","There's something really special about this movie, but I can't put my finger on it. Maybe it's the combination of sci-fi and horror, which create a very distinct atmosphere that you can just feel throughout the entire flick. Maybe it's the idea of a hell-dimension, accessible through a black hole, something so far away yet so close-by that gives me the creeps. Even though you don't see anything of this don't-wanna-be-there-dimension, the effect it has on the crew just says it all. The plot maybe quite simple, but the film doesn't dwell too much on it, it does not imply it is a mind-blowing idea. You won't hear Laurence Fishburne saying: 'Oh, my God! A hell dimension! How is it even possible?!' Nothing in the movie is scarier than stuff I've seen before, still the scariness of Event Horizon isn't in the gore, nor in the shock and awe moments. No, it's in the atmosphere. It's in the ominousness which somehow grabs you and doesn't let go. It's in the gut-feeling. Event Horizon is a gut-movie. Maybe that's the thing I couldn't put my finger on."

","At first glance, Event Horizon would appear to be a science fiction film through and through. It's set in the future, features spacecraft and the men and women who fly them, and is about a rescue mission to another spacecraft. Yet, before long, it's quickly obvious that Event Horizon is, in fact, a horror film set in space, and a surprisingly effective one at that. While not a masterpiece, it is a reasonably disturbing film.<br/><br/>Event Horizon opens in the mid 21st century, where man has attempted faster-than-light travel. The vessel built for this was the space ship the Event Horizon, and it contained at it's heart an artificial singularity, a miniature black hole if you will, that will open a door to another part of the universe. Upon first test of the engine, the ship disappeared, not to be heard from again. Seven years later, it reappears in orbit over Neptune and a rescue ship, the Lewis & Clark, is dispatched to determine if there are survivors, and what happened to the Event Horizon. Along for the ride is the ship's designer, Dr. Weir (Sam Neill), whos going through a strong trauma in his life after his wife has recently committed suicide. The crew of the Lewis & Clark, commanded by Captain Miller (Laurence Fishburne), listen to Weir's explanation of what happened to the Event Horizon and then receive a transmission from the ship that is garbled but seems to suggest a not so pleasant fate for the crew. The Lewis & Clark crew dock with the Event Horizon and begin investigating the ghost ship, but find strange happenings occurring throughout, with different members of the crew seeing strange things: Miller sees a man he left for dead on an exploding vessel, medical officer Peters (Kathleen Quinland) sees her crippled son, and the ships engineer, Justin (Jack Noseworthy) looked into the singularity engine and is put into a state of shock and Weir begins seeing visions of his wife.<br/><br/>It quickly becomes apparent that the Event Horizon has been somewhere other than another part of the galaxy, and it has brought something back with it.<br/><br/>Event Horizon is not a groundbreaking entry in the horror genre, that's for sure. Many aspects on display have been utilized in countless other films. And yet, director Paul Anderson manages to give us the requisite chills and leave us on the edge of our seats. A primary element that helps the film is the Event Horizon itself. Designed with a very Gothic look in mind, the ship just looks and feels scary. It is place I can't imagine anyone ever being comfortable being in. The dark, empty hallways and rooms are menacing themselves, and that helps ratchet up the tension. Anderson also does a good job of crafting suspenseful scenes involving the character's visions. Almost every one of those sequences will leave you unsure of what you will see and that keeps the audience in a state of unease.<br/><br/>As the film progresses, there is an increase in make-up effects grusomeness, so I would agree that it makes it a difficult film to watch as it goes on. However, most everything in the last half-hour is payoff to the setup, so while it's not always pretty to watch, it makes it all the more effective.<br/><br/>Acting wise, Event Horizon is decent, but nobody will be well remembered for their work. Sam Neill is probably the most memorable as the slowly disintegrating Weir, tumbling to madness before our eyes. Laurence Fishbure is effective as the hard-nosed captain, and everyone else gets the job done.<br/><br/>A lot of people gave Event Horizon flack upon it's release, and again, it's not the most original horror film made, but it is one of the more disturbing I saw in the mid to late '90s, and I would give it a recommendation, just be careful watching it by yourself."
"ExpendableMan","8","269","340","24 May 2006"," A criminally under rated horror masterpiece
","Unfairly dismissed as a combination of Alien and Hellraiser, Event Horizon is one of those films that should be ranked among the classics of it's genre yet has somehow fallen by the wayside to be revered by movie geeks and horror aficionados but ultimately ignored by the mainstream. What's especially surprising is that this excellent film came from the directing skills of Paul W Anderson who was also responsible for such tragic misfires as Resident Evil and Alien Versus Predator and shows that there is more to Hollywood's Generic Director For Hire than first imagined.<br/><br/>Set in the year 2047 the story concerns the sudden reappearance of a prototype spaceship (the Event Horizon of the title) which vanished on it's maiden voyage seven years previously. A salvage ship called The Lewis And Clark is sent out to investigate and brings along Dr William Weir (Sam Neil), a physics expert originally responsible for the ship's creation. They dock with the Horizon but find no signs of life and as they set about making repairs, the crew begin to experience hallucinations and sense that they are not alone...<br/><br/>So far so very familiar but this is far, far more than a rip off disguising itself as a 'homage.' For one thing there is no predatory alien hunter on the loose and instead the horror is far more psychological. Not that there isn't a fair amount of violence and gore but the gradual sense of unease that builds up to it is crafted more on the crew's growing sense of anxiety and paranoia. Plus, there is no definitive explanation given for what they are experiencing. Just what are these Ghosts from their pasts doing on this ship? And what exists on the other side of the black hole? Another dimension where mankind was never meant to go or as the movie itself suggests but doesn't confirm, the very depths of hell itself? Couple this with the excellent set design - the ship is modelled on the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris - and the pulse-pounding moments in the latter half when the chaos sets in and you have one tremendously enjoyable horror film. Best watched alone at night with all the lights off where you can properly get swept up in it's claustrophobic atmosphere, you'll never need eyes to see again."

","This is actually one of my favorite horror movies. It is smart, scary, and yes, even a little disturbing at times. While some of the ideas behind the science are absurd, that is why it's called science-""fiction"".<br/><br/>The cast does a good job in their roles, and the setting for the movie is dark, creepy, and perfectly done.<br/><br/>I have read several bad reviews in these comments, and I have seen basically two categories of such. One is that the science involved is ridiculous. This is a movie. A horror movie. A horror movie on a spaceship in the future. I think it's time to suspend your disbelief and enjoy the movie.<br/><br/>The second complaint I have been reading is even worse. That the movie is too scary and disturbing! I don't think I have EVER sat down to watch a scary movie and been upset that it was...scary. Perhaps the movie was accidentally placed in the children's section.<br/><br/>Regardless, the movie is fun and scary. Exactly what most people look for in a scary movie. I highly suggest renting this gem and enjoying it for what it is: One of the better horror movies of the late 90's."
"Agent10","7","225","303","7 May 2002"," A good mix of horror and sci-fi
","This film was a lot better than what most people gave it credit for. The cinematography was excellent, and the lighting gave the film a very eerie feel to it. Certainly better than the average sci-fi film. Not only did the film mix two mediums almost perfectly (sci-fi and horror), it completed the union almost flawlessly. Not a perfect movie, but then again, Sam Neill was amazing in this film. Virtually all of the technical aspects in the film were top-notch. While it didn't advance the film industry overall, it did make an impact in the sci-fi genre."
"Mash-the-stampede","9","105","141","2 June 2010"," ""Save yourself...from hell""
","To this day, ""Event Horizon"" is THE scariest horror science fiction film i have ever witnessed!<br/><br/>I was 14 years old when I first watched this film on video and to put it lightly...it scared the shiz out of me! I loved it!!! Now 12 years later a finally purchase the film on DVD (ordered from the states as I can't find it anywhere in New Zealand) and I watched it with a couple friends who have never seen it before. Suddenly I was 14 again! A scared child, too frightened to look away from the screen. Caught in an icy grip of fear and excitement! A feeling I haven't felt since the first viewing of 'Event Horizon'. Brilliant! I jumped in all the same scenes I jumped in 12 years ago and i was so absolutely absorbed in this film. My friends felt the same way i did and we all sat on the same couch with the lights off while this film quietly terrified us!<br/><br/>Now I'm not exactly a huge horror movie enthusiast as i find most horror films to be stupid, cheesy and just not scary in the slightest. Horror films now are especially ridiculous as that ""Saw"" series (when will it end?) is just silly and repetitive which is a shame as the first film is a pretty descent thriller, which seems to be another problem for horror films is that there are too many sequels with each film becoming further and further detached from the original making the whole premise and idea of the film pointless and boring.<br/><br/>Which is exactly the reason ""Event Horizon"" works. It is a stand-alone film. No sequels. No actual killer as such...it is the presence of an unseen evil which corrupts the characters into becoming warped and ultimately the cause of their own demise. For a horror film the kill count is surprisingly low and no one actually dies during the first hour of the film. It's the suspense of the film and the actual idea behind it which is so un-believable frightening that you find yourself absorbed and un-able to look away from the screen....gripped in fear. That's why this film is so brilliant. The cast is great. It's not overly convoluted. It's scary beyond belief. The story is good enough to keep the viewers attention and adrenaline pumping and the special effects have held up surprisingly well for a film that was filmed back in 1997.<br/><br/>I really wish there was a Director's cut edition of this film.<br/><br/>If you've seen this film and you were not frightened...you are either really warped, lying, or talked all the way through it. i suggest a re-watch by yourself with the lights off and all other distractions (laptop, cellphone) switched off as well and just sit and watch...I guarantee fear will gnaw at you eventually.<br/><br/>And if you enjoyed this film, you should also check out ""Pandorum"" as it is also fairly good, though not quite in the same league as ""Event Horizon"".<br/><br/>""Liberate tutame...ex inferis."""
"Maarten1985","7","76","101","13 August 2006"," Decent sci-fi/horror - Underrated
","EVENT HORIZON is a pretty good sci-fi/horror movie which you'll either love or hate. It's a very dark and depressing movie which completely justifies the 'terror' in the tag-line. Perhaps the continuing terror is why some people probably dislike it.<br/><br/>As far as I know, most horror movies lack a decent story or decent acting or character development. That's why I'm not into horror movies that much. But Event Horizon has an interesting story that is an ideal and most of all original environment for a horror movie. Even though character development is limited, as the film progresses you'll get to know most of the characters better. Especially Sam Neill's (Dr. Weir) and Laurence Fishburn's (Cpt. Miller) characters.<br/><br/>The acting was done very well by most of the cast, most notable Laurence Fishburn and Sam Neill who did a good job. The sets on the other hand are brilliant and creepy at the same time. I would not feel comfortable walking around in any of those rooms, especially the engineering room featuring the Gravity Drive (sphere with 3 magnetic rings within a room filled with deadly spikes on the walls and ceiling). This adds more tension than there already is to the movie which makes the experience only better and worthwhile.<br/><br/>The special effects in this movie are quite a treat. Ranging from an external view of the gigantic Event Horizon around Neptune to Dr. Weir and his 'HANDywork' with his eyes.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this is a good but underrated sci-fi horror movie with lots of freaky moments that will keep your heart racing. If you like the depressing endless terror, you'll like this movie quite a bit. If you rather have happy endings and laughs, you'll probably dislike it.<br/><br/>For the best experience, watch this movie in a dark room at night or even past midnight with the volume turned up a bit over the normal setting.<br/><br/>Rated 7/10 on IMDb, but I personally would give it a 7.5/10."
"Megn1","10","373","534","5 July 2005"," So brilliant its hard to believe Paul Anderson directed AVP.
","This is without a doubt one of the greatest horror films ever made! I wouldn't classify it as sci-fi even though it does pay homage (or some would say rip-off) to many of the greats, such as Alien and The Black Hole. This is a pure horror film and also has a b-movie charm. This is the kind of movie William Castle would be directing if he was still alive today, but much better! It is the best haunted house movie of the lot, but its set in a spaceship.<br/><br/>OK, the movie doesn't have the most complicated plot or character development, it works because of the atmosphere and Paul Anderson has pulled off a one-trick pony here. The atmosphere in this film is so friggin brilliant that you forget you're watching a movie and it physically affects you! James Cameron and Ridley Scott reached this level of brilliance in the Alien films and David Fincher with Seven.<br/><br/>I've seen this movie over 20 times. It is incredibly entertaining, with fine performances, amazing special FX, one of the best and creepy music scores ever, the best space production design ever, the best subwoofer explosions, the best cinematography, energetic and brilliant direction...I could go on....<br/><br/>It's also become a bit of a cult classic nowadays. I've loved the film since it was first released and every friend I show it to agrees and considers it a sleeper. It is also one of the only films I know that induces fear into the audience and provokes them to curse in awe. Every time my mates and I watch it, we are gobsmacked in its craziness! 10/10 - Easily in the top 10 horror films of all time! One of the most entertaining movies ever made. Paul Anderson has never surpassed this film and it will be the one he is remembered for."

","I tried to remember the last time I found myself scared or disturbed by a movie. It was so long ago in fact that I simply couldn't recall. I was 35 when I first saw this movie; after it had finished I felt like I was 10 years old and had just finished watching an old scratchy B&W werewolf flick.<br/><br/>It had been so long since I had truly been disturbed in a scared way I'd almost forgotten what it felt like. Schindlers List troubled me, but not in this way, this was a true feeling of shock and horror. Four or five minutes after the screen had gone blank and the music faded, I'm still staring at the TV screen in a nicely terrorized state. I had to shake myself to snap out of it. Fabulous!!!!!<br/><br/>I love seeing peoples faces after I have told them to watch this film. They give me that, ""Oh my God!!!!!!"" look and breath in deeply at the same time. They too have been truly traumatized for a short while. When they discover the nature of the garbled video message is a great recoil moment within the film and one I can still remember some 5 years after seeing it. If you're easily scared don't watch this movie, you'll have a heart attack. If you haven't been scared in a while then be prepared for how marvelous that feeling is. <br/><br/>YOU HAVE BEEN DULY WARNED!!!!!!!!!!!"

","'Event Horizon' is very much an atmospheric sci-fi horror. It does not rely on gore (although there is enough of that) but rather it is the creepy atmosphere that engages the viewer. Andersen successfully creates a tense, depressing, and claustrophobic atmosphere. The suspense and pace are well maintained. It pays tribute to several movies of the same genre (like 'The Shining', 'Aliens' etc). Character development is slightly weak but the actors do a good job and the viewer cares for them. Sam Neill, Laurence Fishburne, Kathleen Quinlan, Joely Richardson, Richard Jones and Jason Isaacs do a fine job with what they're given. The sets look very unwelcoming and creepy. The special effects and sound effects are good. The cinematography is superb. The plot is a little complex and difficult to follow in the beginning leaving the viewer wondering with what exactly is going on but this becomes easier with repeated viewings. In my view, 'Event Horizon' is an underrated film and perhaps did not get enough recognition because it did not have any stars or enough 'monsters' and 'blood' or perhaps the subject was a little too complex for some to grasp."
"Danny_G13","Null","96","135","11 February 2003"," Decently structured sci-fi horror
","Event Horizon is a decent movie. There's no question it's never going to win awards for originality, or anything else, frankly, but what it does it does well. It's based on the idea of a space ship, which disappeared just under a decade ago, reappearing mysteriously, prompting a search and rescue vessel to go in and investigate. Telling more would spoil the premise, so no more will be said. It is all set in the future, as much sci-fi is, and deep in outer space, of course. The performances are as polished as you'd expect from Sam Neill, as the doctor, and Laurence Fishbourne, as the scout ship captain, so there are generally no complaints there. The gore levels at times are not for the squeamish, but what else would you expect from an 18 (UK) rated movie? There are a fair number of predictable moments, and cliched lines, but the overall production is more than decent and able to keep your attention focused on the plot. A good effort all round, and the overall 5.5 rating it received here is a touch harsh. I'd say 7."
"Scoopy","6","97","148","20 April 1999"," almost sang its song in tune
","Once upon a time there were two movies, both considered masterpieces of their genre.<br/><br/>One was callied ""Alien"", the brilliantly realized SF/Horror film from Ridley Scott, about a deep space mission that brought back an unwanted predatory visitor from the imagination of Giger.<br/><br/>The other film was called ""Solaris"", about a deep space mission that caused the crew to exhibit psychotic behavior and keep living out scenes from their earth life. Solaris, an intellectual film from the Soviet-era genius Andrei Tarkovsky,  is the more complex film. It does not attempt to explain whether the hallucinations are caused by an external force, space fever, passage into a time-space warp, or just the fact that you can't ever run from yourself, not matter how far you go. No monsters.<br/><br/>""Event Horizon"" is a cross breed between these two legendary deep-space films. The monster is there, but it inhabits the minds of the crew, learns everything about them, every fear, every memory, and causes their insanity. Solaris with action, and an identified external cause. The idea was pretty damned good, the special effects and visuals were brilliant, and they hired a good cast. Some of the moments will scare the beejeepers out of you.<br/><br/>But they went over the top in some ways. Too many explosions. A fist-fight with the monster, what's that all about? Too many empty-headed discussions about what man was or wasn't meant to know. Ultimately too little really original. Reviewers were sharply divided on this film. Some said it was a truly brilliant scare-fest, others thought is was a zero-star waste of their precious time. I don't know. It isn't Alien or Solaris, but it has a lot of positives and I enjoyed it, but I don't plan to watch it again."

","This is a damn good horror movie. It's especially surprising as the director's best movie that I saw before this was Mortal Kombat. Don't get me wrong, Mortal Kombat is cheesy fun but this movie shows that he can actually craft a well made sci-fi horror. The first hour of this movie builds up an excellent atmosphere. The eerie tone and imagery combine to create a genuinely unsettling movie. Then in the last half an hour the movie turns into a very grotesque action-horror hybrid. I still enjoyed that part, however I preferred the slow-moving atmospheric sections as that's the kind of horror that resonates more with me. Now, apparently Anderson's original cut was 130 minutes long and it got the NC-17 rating. I personally think that cut, which is apparently even more gruesome would drag on and lose it's atmosphere in favour of Hostel-like exploitation. For me, it's one of those instances where studio interference paid off as the run-time feels just right. All in all, the movie is a definite recommendation and much more than an Alien rip-off."

After repeated home viewings it does lose its shock factor yet it is still a great film, though I have to add it really was meant for the big screen. The sets are great, the gore is shocking & the ship design is truly beautiful. Admittedly the Event Horizon borrowed its look from '2001' yet they took that long majestic shape & gave it a more modern gritty feel. A few bits of ham acting (listen to when Richardson says ""the hulls been breached"") didn't detract from this excellent Hellraiser Vs 2001 style flic.

","**contains spoilers* <br/><br/>It is a well known fact, to most horror fans, that horror and sci-fi hardly ever manage to come together in a coherent way. The tendency is to let the plots slide into cartoonish ""it's the creature from out of space-here-to-gobble-us-all"". One genre ends up imposing its own clichés upon the under, making the ship sink. <br/><br/>Event Horizon is not the case. Not even remotely. First of all, as already been pointed out, what matters most about this movie is the atmosphere. It is dark, the angles are odd, all the gore attests to a level of insanity and mindless violence that really IS hell.<br/><br/>Instead of re-creating a whole new world or a completely different society as a standard sci-fi would do, Event Horizon takes us to the heart of every day human existence when submitted to endure the horrors of space. And these are Hell. <br/><br/>It is psychological horror in that, in a very factual sense, the character's fears end up being their own perdition. The sphere itself may be responsible for some of the most awful sounds ever to star in a horror movie. It reminds me a bit of nails scratching glass only warped out to get under one's nerves. That it truly accomplishes. <br/><br/>Event Horizon closes the characters within themselves and once they are trapped, there is no escape. That is also a key element of this movie's power...it's ability to present a ending that opens to a never-ending cycle of suffering in a way that differs from the obvious (you know, shark movies that end with ominous shark tale looming in the distance; haunt-stories that finish with some object being moved around; whatever hero/villain gathering strength from the ashes, all the way to the famous classic The Bulb). <br/><br/>I once read a book about the Gothic ethos of horror romances in which it was explained that one of the major sources of fear is morbid reiteration. This movie is a clear proof of that.<br/><br/>Disturbing."

","""Event Horizon"" is a lot of fun and shows just how versatile Sci-fi, as a genre, can be. Unfortunately, it also highlights the problems with high concept movies if they don't perfectly execute on their ambitions. I'm not gonna lie and say this is a great or important film but if you are one of those people who has a little Venn Diagram space in your heart for sci-fi/horror films then this is a film for you.<br/><br/>First off, the production design in this film is stellar (lol get it?). From the bridge of the Lewis & Clark, to the core of the Event Horizon's gravity drive, and to the neon green crawl spaces underneath the core. The locations are not just designed to feel believable, which they do, but also to play into the eerie feeling of the film which they also do, especially the sequence with Dr. Weir (Sam Neill, ""Jurassic Park"") under the core, lights strobing on and off inside the Jefferie's Tubes he is crawling through.<br/><br/>The acting is uneven and feels like certain actors were given different ideas than the rest about what the film was about. Sam Neill is great as usual and the cast boasts a stacked cast with Jason Isaacs (""Death of Stalin"") and Laurence Fishburne (""The Matrix"") rounding things out. Most of the time these actors seem to be in a psychological terror movie set in space and discuss the various terrors in their past and what it means that they are seeing hallucinations about them. They have the sorts of conversations that people facing their fears and imminent deaths might have as they parse their own reactions, psychology, and internal movements.<br/><br/>On the other hand we have Richard T. Jones, Kathleen Quinlan, and Joely Richardson, who seem to be in either a disaster film or action movie. Even Larry Fishburne gets in on the action movie vibes as he occasionally channels a hard edged commanding officer who doesn't take no guff and might occasionally have to choose bubble gum or kicking @$$. While these characters may be exposed to similarly terrifying events they seem to handle it more in the cheesy way that 90s action films do. Characters are known to nickname each other things like 'Baby' and 'Mamma Bear' or yell things like, ""I'm gone,"" as they hit a lever that launches them into danger. It feels like half the cast in is the movie ""Alien"" and the other half is in ""Armageddon.""<br/><br/>The break down for me is almost that simple. I love the parts of this movie that are horror heavy and am bored by the parts that are action heavy. It doesn't help that some of the graphics have aged more poorly than a person who completed two terms as President of the United States.<br/><br/>There's a part of me that thinks that this is a property ripe for reboot/sequel/re-imagining but there's another part of me that fears movie that would try to recapture the magic of this film. I know that for me, the psychological terror aspects of the film are my favorite but that might not be the case for everyone and I'd hate to think that some people who like this movie would be left out in the cold by whoever decided to remake this movie as 'the version they would have liked to see' rather than keeping the messy quality of the original.<br/><br/>The messiness actually adds to the film in some ways. It would feel overly contrived to have every single member of the crew wandering around and pontificating to each other the whole movie about the plight of existence and the terror of the unknown just as it would feel untrue to have them all strutting like Space Marines gunning for another trophy. By putting both aspects in the film they both end up feeling more true to life.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, my last criticism is also that while it does attempt to do some psychological terror and philosophical musing, the underlying themes of the movie still end up being very muddled. The plot is very by the book and should leave lots of room for character exploration and connection but ""Event Horizon'' leaves these characters as two dimensional stand ins. There is never any doubt about where our main character's journeys end. Almost before they ever step foot on the ship you can go down the line, one by one. Dead, dead by suicide, dead by sacrifice, turned to the dark side; you know it all from the beginning because these characters don't have multiple personality and psychological traits that make them who they are. They are stereotypes with one or two events that have happened to them in the past.<br/><br/>All in all, I really like this movie. It's one I re-watch all the time and has a lot of great set pieces and imagery but it certainly isn't the deepest film. However, I don't think that is what most people are after with a movie of this type so I won't let that stop me from recommending it to almost any sci-fi or horror fanatic."
"david_rudy_lee","8","3","3","14 June 2019"," Solid, but Flawed Sci-Fi Horror Film
","This was a film that I remember watching back when it came out and hit the movie channels. After that initial viewing, I thought it had a really had a dark concept. My thoughts were actually that this was a lot like Hellraiser in space. The synopsis is a rescue crew investigates a spaceship that disappeared into a black hole and has now returned...with someone or something new on-board.<br/><br/>We actually start this one with getting back-story of how there was first colonies on the Moon, followed by mining colonies on Mars and then finally they created a ship named the Event Horizon, which is also the name of the point of no return for black holes. The ship goes missing and it is reported that it blew up. We learn this is a cover-up and that the ship disappeared. In the film's present, the ship has returned.<br/><br/>The film then introduces us to Dr. William Weir (Sam Neill). He is the designer of the Event Horizon. He is asked to join a team that is going to check on the ship that has reappeared by the planet Neptune. A rescue mission is put together with the ship, the Lewis and Clark. Captain Miller (Laurence Fishburne) is tasked to lead it. He isn't told what the mission is; just that is rescue and salvage. With him is a medical tech Peters (Kathleen Quinlan), Lt. Starck (Joely Richardson), Cooper (Richard T. Jones), Dr. D.J. (Jason Isaacs), Smitty (Sean Pertwee) who is the pilot and finally Justin (Jack Noseworthy).<br/><br/>Something this film does that I like is kind of introducing us to some of the technology. Everyone is put into a stasis to save their bodies as they travel through space. I will admit this film gives off a bit of Alien here with a crew trying to answer a distress call for a ship. As well as try to salvage it.<br/><br/>Once they arrive in the area they are supposed to, they find the missing ship. Dr. Weir gives some background on its special engine and how it uses black holes to jump across the galaxy, making space travel much faster. The Event Horizon is scanned for life-forms, but they are getting weird readings. It is decided that Capt. Miller, Lt. Starck, Peters and Justin will go aboard. Part of this is to getting the ship back working to bring it in.<br/><br/>Justin goes to where the core of the engine is and something happens. It somehow turns on by itself and sucks him in. Cooper gets him back out with the winch he is connected to, but he's in a coma like state. Dr. Weir tells them this isn't possible as it has three electric fields keeping it in place and has to be turned on manually. The crew starts to see some dark things of their past and loved ones as there's something not right going on with the ship. It gets even darker as Peters uncovers the ship's log and sees the final moments of the previous crew.<br/><br/>I do have to admit, that coming into this film I was excited to check this out again, because I hadn't seen it since I wrote a paper about it in an astronomy class about black holes. It wasn't as brutal as I remembered it and of course not as scary either. That is not to say that I didn't enjoy what I saw. The concept of black holes is something that fascinates me. I really want to know if the gravitational pull just destroys everything or if they are really like wormholes that lead to another place or something else.<br/><br/>This concept of what hell is really a place that is dimension just beyond ours is something else I really like too. What if bending time and space like this film is doing could really open a door to a world like this. I almost wish this film would have focused more on this than what we got. I listened to a podcast about this recently and they brought up there was a lot of cut footage, with some of that being more gore. I actually wish we could have gotten more of that and a bit less of what we did get to be honest. The film doesn't seem to fit together as well as it should. There are gaps in the story and time wise. That is not to say that pacing isn't good, but it doesn't build as much as tension as I really wanted it to. The film runs 96 minutes and I do wish we got 15 minutes or even push it to a full 2 hours as there is a great concept here.<br/><br/>Since I kind of brought up how this does have a Hellraiser feel, we do get this entity that takes what scares or depresses us. It then uses it against us. This is a terrifying idea. Not only that, I love the torture aspects where the bodies are mutilated. I'm not big on pain, so this idea makes me cringe. They don't take it far enough though for me to really feel that way. We just get glimpses of this and I will say, it is some of my favorite aspects of the film as it reminds me of the CD cover to a Rammstein that fascinated me.<br/><br/>Next to move to the acting, I would say that Fishburne is solid in this one. He is a fair captain and I think that he genuinely cares about his crew. He turns a tight ship and is fair. Not his best performance, but still good. Neill I think is really good as well. I do think that he kind of disappears through stretches of the film and I'm wondering if part of this is scenes that were cut. I wanted more from him. He is quite creepy though as the film goes on. Quinlan I thought was solid. I do feel bad for her is that her son is disabled and she wants to stay on Earth with him. Richardson is fine in her role. She is pretty easy on the eyes. Jones, Pertwee and Noseworthy are also pretty solid in their roles. I will admit that Jones did get on my nerves a bit. There isn't much of the rest of the cast, but they do round out the film for what is needed.<br/><br/>Something that I dreaded about films from this era was the effects. Back to the podcast I listened on this, they were talking about how they didn't hold up. I will say that I'm torn. The effects that were done practically of course look great. I just wish we would have gotten a bit more. For the CGI, this think they are definitely hit or miss where some look really good and others really bad. I do like the look of both ships, but something that also struck me is that you'd think this would feel more contained. The Event Horizon feels so big that you don't get that cramped feel that makes space movies scarier. The film though is shot very well.<br/><br/>Now with that said, this film didn't hold up as well as I remember it, but I still enjoy it. I think that there is a great concept here there is just a lot missing. I think this actually hurts the pacing of the film as it moves through some things too quickly and doesn't build enough of the horror as it could. The acting is good though and again, some of the ideas that are explored are solid. The effects are definitely hit or miss. The soundtrack of the film didn't really stand out to me, but it did fit for what they needed. I would say that overall this film is above average for me. I would recommend giving it a viewing especially if you are into sci-fi horror."

","This comment contains mild spoilers.<br/><br/>I hardly know where to begin. I went to see this when it first came out, expecting a stylish, smart sci-fi horror movie.  Instead, I saw something that could have been a decent horror flick, if it weren't for the complete disregard given to common sense. Here are my problems with the movie in no particular order:<br/><br/>What sadist designed a ""suspended animation"" pod that, when opened, dumps you on to the deck in a huge splash of water?<br/><br/>It was said that they accelerated to 10Gs - floating in a tub of water wearing a snorkel isn't going to keep your lungs from imploding at that level of acceleration.<br/><br/>The CO2 scrubbers (a big deal in the movie) were located at the end of the ship with the space drive - as far from the living quarters where the CO2 expelling humans spend their time.  And, the ship is conveniently designed to explode in the middle, which would split the ship in two, in case the experimental space drive  misbehaved, but would also doom the crew to a slow, suffocating death.  Not the best design in the world.<br/><br/>Stuff was used for atmosphere that would be impractical at best : A huge cruciform windshield, doors with big spikes that slam shut alarmingly fast, a dim, dank sick bay with operating tables shaped like neon coffins.  All of which makes for a creepy atmosphere, but none of which makes any sort of sense in designing a spaceship.  I'd much rather have a scary movie in which they at least *tried* to have things make sense.<br/><br/>No one on earth could figure out they were speaking Latin in the video?  I know it's a dead language, but come *on*!<br/><br/>There's much more, including one of the crew traveling through space by venting O2 from his suit, but hopefully I've given you enough reasons to avoid renting this thing.  The bad, bad, *bad*  science was ludicrous enough to keep me from getting even a little scared."

The plot revolving around Sam Neill was contrived and had no direction, what did his dead wife have to do the ship? And then when he begins to kill the crew because they want to leave, all of a sudden he has superhuman power and easily overtakes a man with a sharp knife in his hands, not to mention he has no eyes!<br/><br/>I actually started laughing by the last of the death scenes because it was fun to see what new, terrible death they could produce.  The only real scene that held my attention in horror was the footage of the first crew being tortured and the captain holding his eyes and speaking in Latin. The rest of the movie contains mediocre acting ( I was especially disappointed by Laurence Fishburne who usually is outstanding), borrowed plots, and a story that drags on and on.<br/><br/>At the end Sam Neill says ""Hell is only a word. the reality is much, much worse.""

"derwunderbaremandarin","1","45","98","9 May 2010"," Plagiarism and clichés

The same storyline, about 18 years after the original was out, is a farce. Event Horizon simply does not even remotely create the dense atmosphere of horror that was created in Alien. The turning-evil of the scientist is very predictable. None of the characters (they all resemble the cool marines from Aliens by the way, including a couple of the typical ""weak"" women) is described well, and one hardly cares for them. And when you don't care for the characters, you are not afraid that something might happen to them. A great defect for a horror movie, because if you don't care, the movie is not scary. The movie is full of pathetic clichés. When the rescuers hear from the ghost-ship, they get an audio-message with the usual distorted screaming on it. They filter it, and voilà, one of the cool marines finds out that it actually is *Latin* and translates it immediately. Latin sounds spooky to some people, and that's probably why someone in deep space has nothing better to do then sending messages in Latin while he is being massacred. Incredible. The idea to give the ghost-ship an evil consciousness is ridiculous: the ship is a haunted house in space. <br/><br/>If you expect a good horror-movie, avoid this one. YOu will be disappointed."

","Event Horizon is a spooky horror thriller with some flaws from director Paul W.S. Anderson whose admirable in making this movie about a rescue crew investigates a spaceship that disappeared into a black hole and has now returned with someone or something on board lurking in the shadows waiting for it's chance to strike. The movie is suspenseful, with some gruesome deaths, and solid performances by the cast. But there are some flaws that weigh the film down. I'll get back to that. The cast for the most part are good in their roles including Laurence Fishburne as the hero, Sam Neill in a rare hero/villain role, Joely Richarson, and Kathleen Quinlan. Jason Isaacs, Richard T. Jones, Sean Pertwee, and Jack Noseworthy are effective as the supporting characters but some of them lack development because their roles are cut short. The special effects are impressive and the film does offer enough suspense but the ending wasn't the greatest. If they had changed the ending somehow it would've been a little better. There was some suspense but there could have been more and there weren't any real scares except for a couple of them. The movie does leave a lot of questions unanswered except for a few brief explanations from Neill's character about how the drive works and where it could have taken the other crew. I would have given it a higher rating if there was a clearer explanation to what exactly happened. The deaths however were well executed and brutal. The brief glimpses of people being tortured in grotesque ways were graphic and realistic. Neill's character was right when he says, ""hell is just a word the reality is much much worse."" Well his character was definitely right which doesn't mean good news for Laurence Fishburne and his rescue team who have responded to Event Horizon's distress beacon. Despite some flaws Event Horizon is still a decent horror thriller with enough gruesome deaths, suspense, and good performances by the cast that's sure to please most fans of the genre."

Here is one of the most acclaimed and said to be the scariest movies among horror fans, but when I watched it all I could do is chuckle. Event Horizon is cheese horror, and here is why: - The casting is horrible. The characters are not only all clichés, but they're clichés who can't act. They say some of the stupidest lines in the history of cinemalike, ""Look, a corpse-sickle!""and then act as if they've said the most intelligent thing ever. It's ridicules.<br/><br/><ul><li>The entire movie is filled with melodramatic scenes. Something bad will happen, then it's accompanied by a laughing man imitating Dr. Eviland everyone still takes him seriously. One of the absolute cheesiest lines is, ""Once you're evil, you don't need eyes . . ."" as Dr. Evil-wannabe cackles in his chair. Sorry, I didn't know I was watching a comedy.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>There is no atmosphere, tension, suspense, or terror. The movie jumps strait from the opening to the scenes that are supposed to be scary, but never gives you any suspense or atmosphere. The ship is so abstract it looks like one of those play places at McDonalds or something, not a bearer of doom that the movie expects you to think of it as.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Why does EVERY sci-fi movie have to rip-off Medline L'Engle's book A Wrinkle In Time, then think it's the first movie to come up with the idea? I could list at least 10 movies that have done that, and this makes number 11. Great, we get it: if you fold space you can go from one place to the other faster. We get it already. Think of something new, please. We understood it in the 60's, we understand it now. What I don't understand is why EVERY sci-fi movie can't think of something even slightly new instead of using the same old tired cliché and acting as if it's the first time we ever heard it.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>There were at least 5 wake-up-and-it's-just-a-dream sequences in this movie, and every time they just get cheesier and cheesier.</li></ul><br/><br/>I'm not even sure there is more for me to complain about because all that is fresh in my mind is how cheesy Event Horizon was. I cannot remember a single minute of the runtime that I actually found something serious or scary. Sure, I can understand why some people would find this movie scary, because as Stephen King proved hundreds of times, cheese scares people. But for someone like me who is spoiled by truly good sci-fi/horror movies, like Alien, I simply can't take this seriously. The premise is great, but that's all I can give it. I think this movie proves that everything Paul W.S. Anderson turns to cheese. If he directed it, even if it's somehow acclaimed, don't see it.<br/><br/>1/10"

","A rescue team investigates a spaceship called ¨Event Horizon¨ that disappeared into a black hole and has now returned , re-establishing contact after 25 years lost in cosmos , but now , 2047 , with someone or something new on-board . The vessel has been sent to salvage and pick up survivors and discover strange deeds . This frightening Sci-Fi movie concerns about some crack astronauts being trapped into a claustrophobic space aircraft . This is a spectacular and moving story full of twists and turns ; however being pretty claustrophobic , though this is never tiring . It starts with some astronauts wake up from pods , they are captained by Laurence Fishburne and accompanied by scientific Sam Neill . One of them goes to explore the zone and encounters an extraordinary surprise . Meanwhile , they meet new mysteries hidden throughout the aircraft and attempting to survive . They then encounter themselves chased by bloodthirsty , predatory visions which have haunted them . They must confront some of the most horrifying spectres ever seen and some has been decimating the crew . The survivor group is surrounded , as they encounter horrible visions that are waiting for them , facing their destruction and exposed to cruel dangers . They undertake a desperate fighting to survive and confronting each other .<br/><br/>This exciting picture contains thrills , chills , plot twists, action-filled and lots of gore and guts . The terror and action moments are fast moving and compactly realized enhanced by excellent special effects by the expert Richard Yuricich . The film turns out to be a crossover between old-fashioned ghost terror yarn and modern horror/Sci-Fi film taking ideas here and there , resulting in a fine movie . And of course the theme of people being stranded in a hostile, perilous space environment with attackers creatures is justly reminiscent of Alien . The creepy images of wide range from the genuinely fantastic to the bizarre along with an eerie and amazing frames that creates horror piles on horror . It's predictable but also its predictability is redeemed for some extraordinary surprises and in part by the charismatic acting from the main protagonists as Fishburne , Sam Neill and large support cast as Richard T Jones , Jason Isaacs , Sean Pertwee , Kathleen Quinlan , Joely Richardson and Noseworthy . The shapeless evil hovers , phantoms appearance deliver the goods , plenty of screams, shocks and tension . The make-up artist as Rob Bottin and assistants create the truly terrible images . Horrifying and astonishing frames about eerie events with deserted and threatening corridors , walls drips blood , Gothic halls as well as the creepy scenarios in the large spacial craft without barely people and covered of metal and iron . Cool , dark cinematography by Adran Biddle who creates a perfect atmosphere and haunting musical score fitting to action and horror by Michael Kamen .<br/><br/>The motion picture is surprisingly directed with startling visual style by Brit filmmaker Paul W. S. Anderson in his third film , his first was ¨Shopping¨ . He is a notorious producer , writer and director of Sci-Fi , some super-productions as ¨Resident Evil¨ saga, ¨Alien Vs Predator¨ , ¨Soldier¨ , ¨Mortal combat¨ and recently a fantastic ¨Three musketeers¨."

","This movie was a big disappointment. The first 30 minutes contain all of the elements to be an excellent sci-fi thriller. It seems that what Anderson tried to create here is a Kubrick type film somewhere between ""The Shinning"" and ""2001 A Space Odyssey"". What it turns into is at best a ""B"" movie with a lot of blood, gore and splatter which are a bad diversion from the screenplay and the script which are at times absolutely woeful. The acting is OK to very good considering how bad the script is in places. Lawrence Fishburn does an excellent job but then again he is in my opinion very underrated as an actor. I think Anderson really blew an opportunity here to create a great movie with sequel potential. It's really a shame when you consider other well done comparable deep space sci-fi films such as Pitch Black etc."

"lizziebeth-1","1","22","48","8 August 2002"," Should be renamed Ripped Off and Sucked In (1997). Awful. 0.0001/10.
","WARNING: SPOILERS!<br/><br/>Event Horizon (1997) starts out great: the special effects begin as part of the opening credits: there is a fabulous segue from the Paramount studio logo up into space, refocusing on the stars and onto an apparent gaseous event horizon around a black hole. An event horizon is the perceivable limit, or the boundary between describable and indescribable physics at the edge of a ""singularity"". A singularity, a ""black hole"" star fallen into its own gravity well, can be visualized, just as the Simpsons did, as an infinite, bottomless pit, if you consider normal spacetime essentially a two-dimensional plane. It really is supposed to be infinite, with nothingness and no dimensions, no spacetime, at the bottom. Hell, nothing anywhere inside a black hole can make any sense at all. You and I keep our brains in normal spacetime, and we just don't have any frame of reference at all in common with a singularity. None. That's the point.<br/><br/>At the perceivable edge of this thing, back onto normal space, there are some slightly less weird physics, which we have called the ""event horizon"". This is the one-way membrane hiding the black hole. But forget black holes; the event horizon ITSELF is really bad news. If you are unlucky enough to supposedly get stuck in one, you get stretched out infinitely (ouch), because in just the distance between your head and your foot the difference in the gravitational force acting upon you approaches the infinite. For ""you"", time does not pass, and you cannot even be said to have died. Anyway, that's the theory.<br/><br/>Black holes were a hotly debated theoretical entity among astrophysicists for about 25 years, especially after Carl Sagan's friend, Kip Thorne of Cal Tech came up with ""wormholes"" around 1970, the theoretical possibility of a path in spacetime through the singularity instead of hitting it (there is a mathematical solution to an equation, but Stephen Hawking doesn't like it much because it depends on too many other variables). The wormhole joins two points of spacetime together temporarily, but you need two gravity wells to make that happen. That's what the ""gravity drive"" on The Event Horizon is supposed to be doing.<br/><br/>So in 1997 Paul Anderson (annoyingly similarly named to sci-fi novelist Poul Anderson) and Paramount tried to fictionalize what it might be like to survive a wormhole. What a good idea (NOT) it was to imagine that the gravity drive would also drive astronauts mad. How stupid do you have to be to accept such rubbish? -Well, very.<br/><br/>Don't misunderstand, I have no real problem with the folding of spacetime: so it would take a black hole in front and a black hole behind your spaceship (according to the actual scientific theory); so what? Surely the crew of the Event Horizon could have already tamed and placed two such warm and fuzzy singularities on a leash. No problem.<br/><br/>Instead, my problem with the plot of Event Horizon (1997) is that the much vaunted gravity drive would interfere with the neurochemistry  and that's all  of human brains in normal spacetime. Kind of a big flaw, don't you think? It would be rather difficult to develop the technology without somebody overseeing the PLANETARY BUDGET needed, actually noticing. Kip Thorne doesn't even appear to have been consulted for this, and perhaps there's a reason for that. The hallucination premise is the avenue for supplying lots of explosions, blood, guts and gore  excitement, but only for bozos. Miramax/ Palace put out a similar schlocky but cheaper turkey 7 years before, called Hardware (1990), which is the only movie I actually walked out on in my whole life. I was THIS CLOSE to walking out on Event Horizon (1997).<br/><br/>The casting is OK. Laurence (previously usually credited as Larry, and before that, again as Laurence, I kid you not) Fishburne is the acceptable lead, as Captain Miller. Larry went on to be Morpheus in The Matrix (1999). Onya Larry, he's the only winner out of Event Horizon. I just wish he would figure out who he is.<br/><br/>I really appreciate Sam Neill for taking so many ""big science"" roles, probably beginning with Jurassic Park (1993). Here he is Dr Weir, the inventor of the ""gravity drive"", but it's thoroughly awful and depressing to see him so denigrated later on in this movie to a hideous schlock character aboard the bad ship Event Horizon. Please do watch him in The Dish (2000) instead, where he is the sweetest, most mild-mannered radio astronomer you could ever hope to see.<br/><br/>Kathleen Quinlan is lovely as usual, but she is wasted as the doctor aboard this popsicle, and remains forgettable. Jack Noseworthy gets initially red-shirted (in Star Trek parlance) within the first half-hour. Unfortunately his thesping is not missed. He had been mugging for the camera again and throwing away whatever lines he had. Richard T Jones as Cooper is somewhat brighter, but he too is annoying with his lack of discipline. Just because his starship captain is also an African American is no reason for Cooper to revert to a stereotype. He's either a mission specialist who NEVER WAS a stereotype- HELLO- or he's a bozo who shouldn't be there.<br/><br/>I recommend no-one stays around for the tease ending, which is so lame that it is necessary to tell the audience that ""The End"" has arrived. Ripped off and sucked in, man! Paramount's executives at the time approved this bizarre cross between cutting edge scientific theory and stupid schlock. To whom are they trying to appeal? Any audience capable of understanding the science will not be impressed by mindless blood and gore. Probably the single most offensive disappointment of the 20th century. MAJOR turkey. Stay away in droves (if you can)! Sorry, Larry, no reflection on your work. 0.0001/10."

","Having seen Event Horizon it must rank as a major disappointment. With the interesting cast and the spooky storyline my hopes were high only to be let down by a Director out of his depth. Perhaps I'm being too critical of Paul Anderson but all his films have left me feeling empty and cheated e.g. take your pick from Mortal Kombat, Event Horizon and soldier. The main problem with Event Horizon is its melting pot of ideas. It seems the film doesn't know whether it wants to be Alien, Hellraiser or the Exorcist. Eventually it just ends up being an expensive mix of stolen ideas and themes all used to illeffect.<br/><br/>At times the film was creepy and did have the odd jump out of your seat moment, not to forget the feeling of gloom and dread present throughout the whole film. But the film was way too short and the script laughable. Given the sheer scale of the Event Horizon ship why does it take the crew 10 min to check it out and why does the audience only get to see 4 different rooms? The only answer I can come up with was budget limitations. As for the ending well what was the point of watching the film? Perhaps Anderson should try to direct more films without special effects. Maybe then he will be able to actually construct a film, not just a string of special effects moulded together with bland dialogue.......4"
"poolandrews","5","9","17","23 April 2005"," Decent enough Sci-Fi Chiller that's a fairly entertaining watch.
","Some explanatory on screen text informs the viewer that the Event Horizon was a one-of-a-kind spacecraft designed for faster than light travel that disappeared in the year 2040 somewhere near the planet Neptune. We are then told that it's '2047...now'. Seven years after it disappeared without trace a source of transmission from the Event Horizon has been detected & traced to the orbit of Neptune. The Event Horizon's creator Dr. William Weir (Sam Neill) is sent to investigate in a search & rescue ship called the Lewis and Clarke along with it's crew. The Lewis and Clarke is Captained by Joe Miller (Laurence Fishburne), his crew consists of second in command Lieutenant Starck (Joely Richardson), two engineers Smith (Sean Pertwee) & Justin (Jack Noseworthy), two medics D.J. (Jason Isaacs) & Peters (Kathleen Quinlan) plus a rescue technician named Cooper (Richard T. Jones). 56 days after leaving Earth they reach Neptune & locate the Event Horizon. They dock & Captain Miller, Peters & Justin enter the seemingly deserted spaceship. Captain Miller finds a dead mutilated body floating around & lots of blood stains on the bridge. Meanwhile Justin explores the engineering section of the Event Horizon where the core is situated, a piece of machinery which causes a sort of black hole to appear by which the Event Horizon is able to travel from any point to any other point almost instantly. Justin is sucked into the core & thrown back out again shortly after. In the ensuing panic & commotion the Lewis and Clarke is damaged, Captain Miller orders everyone on-board the Event Horizon to discuss the situation. It appears that the Event Horizon only has enough air left for 20 hours, Justin is alive but in a very bad condition & eventually tries to commit suicide by throwing himself out of an airlock. Captain Miller orders everyone to pull together, repair the Lewis and Clarke in time & make it back home safely. As the hours pass the team on-board the Event Horizon start to see visions, disturbing visions that are personally related to them. Searching through the Event Horizon's Captain John Kilpack's (Peter Marinker) video log they discover some terrifying & chilling footage that makes everyone in a big hurry to leave. Except, that is, Dr. Weir who appears to start & become possessed by his creation & isn't so keen on leaving her behind...<br/><br/>Directed by Paul W.S. Anderson I thought Event Horizon was a decent enough Sci-Fi horror that wasn't brilliant but wasn't bad either. The biggest problem with Event Horizon is the script by Philip Eisner which is a bit of a mess. Nothing is explained satisfactorily in my opinion, it's all very vague & underdeveloped. After I finished watching Event Horizon I had more questions than answers like where did the Event Horizon go for seven years exactly? What has it brought back? What is this evils motivation for doing what it does? When these strange things start to happen & they start to realise that the Event Horizon is responsible why don't they just all stay in the Lewis and Clarke until the repairs are complete? I just didn't get Dr. Weir's motivations, he barely does anything or has any meaningful involvement apart from talking about technical mumbo-jumbo for most of the film & then just suddenly loses his marbles or becomes possessed & until this point we know very little about him so for him to suddenly turn into the bad guy felt empty almost. I didn't like the threat the team encounters, it was very unfocused & not scary or real like say the Alien from Alien (1979). There are other points throughout that I wasn't too happy about either but I won't bother going into them here. And why did the script have to include a typical annoying comedy relief character who swears & comes out with various childish one-liners which are at odds with the rest of the dialogue & characters in the film. Event Horizon also reminds me strongly of Aliens (1986) in it's set up, plot devices & all round feel. Unfortunately Event Horizon doesn't have the tension or excitement. One thing that Event Horizon's script does have going for it is the fact that it moves along like a rocket & is never dull or boring, something is always happening. The production design credited to Joseph Bennett is generally very good throughout Event Horizon with it's Gothic looking spaceship sets, I especially loved the design for the core itself & the room it's housed in. Acting is OK from all involved except that annoying idiot who plays Cooper, the comedy relief. The special effects are good, but there are one or two that don't hold up so well these days. There isn't much gore or violence in it, someone with their eyes poked out, someone sliced open and hanging on hooks & someone being exposed to an open airlock where their veins start to bulge & pop. There's a bit of female nudity as well. Event Horizon is well made & has a definite slickness about it, just a shame about that script really. Overall I liked it for sure, but I didn't love it as there were to many vague points that didn't work for me. I just didn't like the evil force, give me a guy in a rubber monster suit anytime over this wishy-washy pseudo hell nonsense. Definitely worth watching but there are better out there, having said that there are a lot worse as well & you couldn't really go wrong if you can find it going cheap or are able to catch it on T.V."

The rest of the cast are OK but can't compare to either of the two lead men  especially Lawrence.<br/><br/>Overall this starts with some good atmosphere but later falls into gore without substance.  However it does have it's good bits and Lawrence Fishburne makes the whole thing worth watching with a performance that holds the whole damn thing together."

","Definitely one of the best sci-fi horror movies ever. Even though much of the impending evil was implied or glimpsed it was enough to imagine how bad it could have been if it was unleashed.

","The sum of its parts are better than the whole, but ""Event Horizon"" features terrific Producrion design, strong visual effects and performances that drive the film. The script by Phillip Eisner, has a great concept but the writing could be better (there was an uncredited rewrite by ""Se7en"" writer Andrew Kevin Walker) and, no doubt, Paul W.S. Anderson took a crack at it as well.<br/><br/>The handsome production design always makes the film fun to look. <br/><br/>Spoiler: There are some dumb sequences in the film such as the character of Peters (played by Kathleen Quinlan) chasing her son and then falling in the core to her death is pretty dumb. It also doesn't make sense as to why Weir (Sam Neill) doesn't mention the delusions he has on the ship (acting as if nothing is happening) doesn't share what is happening to him. Is he in denial? It might have been interesting to find out a bit more about that and what drove his wife to suicide. <br/><br/>End of Spoilers<br/><br/>The deleted scenes (some of which exist in low quality video) would have helped the film providing us with more background info but, as is, it's still entertaining with a brisk pace.<br/><br/>Although far from perfect, this is one of Paul W.S.

"Quinoa1984","6","3","4","29 October 2016"," so good at points that it's a shame when it isn't near the end
","This is another of those movies I saw in pieces on TV, which frankly isn't giving Event Horizon enough of its due. It's probably the only Paul WS Anderson movie I can think of that truly deserves your attention to be WATCHED from start to finish, not looking away, not distracted, because it is aiming to be a serious science fiction movie, with some horror elements. And finally seeing it from start to finish I came to the conclusion that, yes, it is Anderson's best... and at the same time it also has derivative aspects, not inherently negative against the movie per-say, and a clever concept (a space ship that takes the emotional readings of its occupants and proceeds to f***-up and/or kill its inhabitants), but near the end it falls apart not so much in script but in execution.<br/><br/>So, this is good. At times, it's very good. The set-up is a mixture of, to me, Alien AND Aliens, to varying degrees (and maybe, as Roger Ebert reminded me of in his review, Solaris): Doctor Sam Neill is on a mission to go back to a vessel he had a major part in shaping, the Event Horizon, which has gone past the reach of central space command or whatnot in the orbit of Neptune, and he has made the crew of the Lewis & Clark, led by Captain Laurence Fishburne and including crew such as Jason Isaacs and Joely Richardson, to go with him to find it and what happened to the crew of the ship (there's a recording that sounds extremely distressing). I like sci-fi like this, where the characters talk salty to one another, and you get the chemistry between the characters (and actors most especially) in these early scenes. I genuinely cared what would happen to them, which is a credit to Anderson in the casting.<br/><br/>And this has that moment that explains how to bend/travel through space with the paper that you can poke a hole through one end to another, which is so neat! Things like that always spark my attention, and for the first half of this, as derivative as it is in some of its look and the fact that, in its way, this time the alien/aliens ARE the ship itself, it's different and compelling in how it traces the inner fears and phobias of the characters, reaql traumas (i.e. Kathleen Quinlan's disabled son), and manipulates them literally to death. That's all fine, and there's even one genuinely great, masterfully done scene where Sam Neill's doctor has a ""meeting"" with his dead naked wife in a bathroom. That is creepy, if not outright scary, and it ends in a cinematically satisfying shot.<br/><br/>But there's also a feeling that the movie could go into more, like what really *is* in that other dimension or other place the Event Horizon has been to, what it means to go into that ""other"" side that Sam Neill seems to know about but is cagey in revealing. More than that though is how Anderson slips the tone in the final stretch, this is what made me realize it wasn't *as* good as I was hoping for: when it finally comes to bringing some action and gore, where Fishburne has to preserve his (dwindling) crew and ship, he goes into filmmaking pyrotechnics of a sort that's distracting and moments and lines even from Neill, who is so good here, that becomes funny in an unintentional way. I found myself stifling laughter in a packed theater seeing parts of this ending (some parts are more intentionally funny, with the black astronaut who has to use his boosters to get back to the ship and says 'motherf***er' every other word, and... it feels organic to him!) and could predict so much of what was about to happen. After a set up and partial pay-off that was working and for Anderson to not have all the follow through I hoped for was a let-down.<br/><br/>All the same, Event Horizon represents the sort of sci-fi spectacle we don't get in theaters as much as we used to back in the 90's, and in that sense it's easy to take it for granted, how it does dig into ideas of identity and fears and what obsessions draw out of people when traumas are put to full throttle. To put it another way, this is a brainy-dumb thriller, or a dumb-brainy thriller, and it's good. Mostly. When it's trying. 6.5/10"

I love the way Laurence never cracks a smile in the whole movie, and is always the voice of wrath. It makes it that much better that he deals with the voice of chaos, that is Sam Neill. The scene between them, when Weir is explaining to Miller about how Hell is just a word is possibly my favourite scene, and leaves it wide open to the possibility of these two becoming arch enemies in future movies. Because, lets face it, this movie needs a damn sequel.<br/><br/>I'm really annoyed to hear that this movie was cut short in its release. From the sounds of it, the movie could've been even better than what we know it as, had Paul Anderson got his way with the final cut. Either way, I'm happy with this version, and I definitely want to see Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill reprise their roles in a sequel."

I still have trouble watching it alone with the lights off and I've seen it many, many times, as I introduce all my friends to it and they usually make me watch it with them. The effects are great and it's so creepy that I jump when things happen, and I never jump at movies. I love the atmosphere, the creepy lighting and the music. All of it enhances the movie, rather than being distracting or directing ones mood toward a scene. The gore is pretty much perfect, not too much, not too little.

","There are numerous Sci-Fi films jostling at the front of the pack for the ""Worst Ever' accolade, and 'Event Horizon' should certainly be considered one of the top contenders. Although the film has upscale production values, penny-pinching in the screen-writing budget becomes obvious as soon as the characters open their mouths. The story's introduction reveals an experimental faster-than-light spaceship had gone missing on its maiden flight. Seven years later it has mysteriously reappeared orbiting Neptune, and another vessel is dispatched to investigate.<br/><br/>On board this rescue ship, the astronauts are bickering like toddlers long before they arrive at their destination. When an exploratory team ventures into the derelict hulk's industrial-Gothic interior, their intelligence goes into terminal decline as the hack screenplay plunges them into a crude gore-and-horror fest. They start screaming at one another like hysterics, while the soundtrack ramps up the melodrama in a lame attempt to disguise the deficiencies of the material. None of the routine nastiness makes any sense, and the eventual explanation for the vessel's cursed condition is pitifully weak. After '2001' and 'Alien' had shown the possibilities for modern Sci-Fi, 'Event Horizon' is a severe disappointment which gives the entire genre a bad name."

Event Horizon suggests it isn't any good at all. In fairness, I have friends who consider this to be the scariest film they have ever seen, but then they did see it in their early teens.<br/><br/>The film borrows liberally from 2001 and 2010, The Haunting, The Shining, The Amityville Horror, The Lawnmower Man and probably about a hundred other films that begin with ""the"", but most notably it seems to be in debt at all times to the Alien series. The unoriginality wouldn't matter were this an effective or entertaining film, but the script is banal and muddled and the direction is uninspired; Anderson draws on horror clichÃ©s like constant lightning flashes... in space! Anderson's films generally have a glossy yet dull look and feel, and this one is no exception; a considerable amount of work obviously went into the production design of this film, yet in the film the sets rarely look as impressive as they could and should do.<br/><br/>In short the film is a dull, borderline incomprehensible mess. It does showcase a good lead performance from Sam Neill, and an amusing supporting one from Richard T. Jones, but neither really makes the film worth seeing.

The characters and dialogue were hammy as hell and had me constantly cringing. The whole 'where did the Event Horizon go' idea was intriguing but woefuly unexplored, not I don't think because the writer wanted an air of enigma and mystery, but rather because they clearly could not be bothered to come up with anything beyond a vague premise to attach some special effects to.

","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** 1997 was a great year for British films ( And I won`t get into an argument with what constitutes a "" British "" film ) with THE FULL MONTY , BEAN and SPICE WORLD all being massive hits in the US . Strangely the British made film EVENT HORIZON probably had a bigger budget than its three compatriots put together but made little impact on the American box office<br/><br/>
If I was to point out the cause for its failure then I would say it`s with Philip Eisner`s script. It lacks a lot in both characterisation and story development , things happen without much explanation and at times it`s all slightly confusing . Of course if there`s been as much as 20 minutes cut out of the final print then that`s hardly Eisner`s fault , but he should take the blame for the unoriginal script ***** MAY CONTAIN MINOR SPOILERS ***** The whole concept of a haunted space craft is no different to that of a haunted house ,the start of EVENT HORIZON  reminded me of both 2001 and ALIEN .  , people being confronted by their worst fears is straight out of 1984, a space ship that`s alive is a reference to QUATERMASS AND THE PIT , and the villain`s appearance resembles Pinhead being converted to cenobite at the start of HELLRAISER 2: HELLBOUND. Even the context of the dialogue is borrowed from other sources "" Be with me "" is from  LIFEFORCE , and "" I have such sights to show you "" is HELLRAISER  again . But luckily no one comes out with the cliche "" It`s all right , there`s nothing to worry about , everything is under control "" because that would be too self referential ***** END SPOILERS ****<br/><br/>Paul Anderson does a fairly good job as director ( Has anyone noticed that Anderson wouldn`t know a good script if he saw one. Maybe someone plucked his eyes out too ? ) and it`s on the technical areas the film works best , there`s plenty of scenes that will make you jump out of your seat due to the sound mix . If Anderson has a problem with EVENT HORIZON then it`s that he seems unable to get the best out of his cast , only Sean Pertwee gives a good performance as a rough and ready space pilot , everyone else on the ship seems to be half asleep .<br/><br/>So if you like sci-fi or horror films then you may like EVENT HORIZON , but it`s not a film you`re likely to watch over and over again which is a shame. A disappointing film to have come out of Britain during a commercial golden age of British films"

","EVENT HORIZON is one of the few films I've regretted seeing at the movies. It was an awful, cringe-worthy movie-going experience and like TOTAL WRECKALL, one of the many science-fiction films released in the 1990s that slowly but surely killed the possibilities of seeing intelligent sci-fi on the big screen. This film is dumber than a box of moon rocks. It follows the by then familiar formula: in the not so distant future, a bunch of astronauts (as expected, they're all ""types"") on a rescue mission in deep space to find a derelict empty spaceship with something terrifying on board. I've seen this story hundreds of times before in such films as ALIEN, THE BLACK HOLE or even going as far back as 1975 with a TV episode from SPACE 1999 called ""Dragon's Domain"". Remarkably, that episode, which was originally shown on TV for everyone to see, is more thought provoking, intelligent and gruesome than this $60 million big budget opus. You'd think that something made 22 years later, with a bigger resources and a cast of capable actors would have resulted with some signs of the genre evolving, progressing but nope, it's the opposite. EVENT HORIZON is a perfect example of a dying genre regressing into a complete moronic state.<br/><br/>The beginning WAS promising but that first impression quickly dissipated once the characters started dying, characters we hardly knew or cared about (again, they're just ""types""), all of them butchered in some typically spectacular way, in order to hide the fact that the writing was shallow and the film needed something to prompt the audience from falling asleep or walking away in disappointment. The deaths, as gruesome as they are, amount to nothing because we don't care about the unpleasant crew or their plight. After enduring what seemed an eternity, when we finally arrive at the climax, what little credibility the film had was suddenly blown away because of the dumbest plot point in any science fiction story: blame it all on Satan! <br/><br/>Huh, Satan?!?! <br/><br/>What does Satan have to do with science fiction? What does a black hole have to do with hell? I couldn't believe it. I just couldn't believe anyone would be dumb enough to combine these incongruous genre elements in such an unconvincing way. Suddenly, PIGS IN SPACE looks brilliant and groundbreaking next to this turkey. Why would anyone go through the trouble of writing this, producing this, filming this, editing this and releasing this and have it all based on something as hokey as Satan? I mean, I could go to New Jersey to find the devil, nevermind traveling through space and time. Satan, the devil or hell are all earth based concepts and superstitions. They can be effective in horror films which take place on earth but not in a science-fiction film, certainly not this one.<br/><br/>EVENT HORIZON reminded me of two things. First, it reminded me of a film called THE EVIL(1978), which is about a group of people (all types) who go to a haunted house and are killed one by one by some supernatural presence which plays with their fears and such. At the film's climax, not unlike EH, Satan himself (played by greasy actor Victor Buono) is revealed to be the one responsible for the killings. That film is unintentionally funny and having ultra camp Buono play Satan was a bad idea. When I saw Buono with little horns I laughed out loud. In EVENT HORIZON, I expected to see Victor Buono appear out of nowhere and start chewing the scenery. The ending in EH is as bad and as unconvincing as the one in THE EVIL.<br/><br/>The second thing EVENT HORIZON reminded me of was the brilliant novel CHILDHOOD'S END by Arthur C. Clark. The plot twist about aliens who look like the devil was a stroke of genius by Clark, who clearly understands the significance of imagery, symbolism and superstition. The novel, though completely different than this film, is a great example of the level of intelligence science fiction can reach even if it deals with hokey imagery like Satan. It's a pity none of this level of intelligence is in evidence throughout this awful film."

Yawn. One character transforms into something resembling a ""Hellraiser"" Cenobite and the ending smacks of the ""Alien"" series of films. <br/><br/>As a sci-fi film, it could have been so much more complex and involving, but the lazy ""All Black Holes lead to Hell"" premise slams the door on a more imaginative explanation of the original Event Horizon crew's bizarre behaviour and messy deaths. Less emphasis on gore and simple shock tactics might have swayed me more in the film's favour, but ultimately the screenplay cops out of asking questions. Instead the viewer has to strap in for a derivative ""thrill"" ride. I watched the film until the end - hoping that it would get better - but I reckon that most of the budget went on the wonderful production design and the wages for the talented cast.<br/><br/>I'd be interested to see a Director's Cut (if Paul Anderson ever releases one) but it would have to be a lot more like ""Solaris"" or the first of the ""Hellraiser"" films for me to recommend it."

","For some reason this poorly-made film has a rather large cult following. I can't understand why.<br/><br/>Initially a rightful flop at the box office in 1997 it found an audience on VHS and latterly DVD and Blu-ray but only the 97-minute theatrical cut (fade out at 91 minutes) has ever been made available. Quite strange for a epic sci-fi horror.<br/><br/>It turns out that Paul Anderson thought he was directing a movie that would be as revolutionary as Ridley Scott's Alien was back in 1979 and when he turned in his first 130-minute cut of the film it was painfully obvious that his effort and ability to make a solid horror film were sorely lacking. Paramount cut more than half an hour of footage and released it as a crash-and-burn flick with little fanfare.<br/><br/>That's the real story behind Event Horizon. Over the years Paul Anderson has blamed the studio for the film being a tedious bore but it's all down to him and his approach to this lame material which is full of the easiest, EASIEST stinger scares, weak direction, and a superficially ambiguous script that he thought he could go all out with.<br/><br/>Even with very low expectations of Hellraiser/Haunted House/Generic Slasher-in-Space tropes you'll consider doing the dishes or the ironing before the movie is halfway over."

All I can think of saying is that it's crap.  I leave more eloquent comments to those better-qualified critics whose articles you can read on this database  but amazingly enough if you read through them you will even find some neutral, or even positive criticisms.  Some things I just don't understand.<br/><br/>What I'd like to say, then, is that I'm utterly disgusted that such a movie can fall under the genre of ""Science Fiction"".  Why?  If it happens in space and you throw in a few mysterious phrases like ""another dimension"" and ""outside the universe"" does it automatically qualify?   Nowadays such stock phrases seem to me to be just a licence to let anything happen, regardless of plotline or logic.  If you don't understand what ""focussing gravitons"" means, I'll tell you.  It means that a lot of nonsensical stuff is going to happen later on in the movie, which one is meant to accept because when you ""focus gravitons"", anything is possible, really.

I don't know what they were thinking or taking when they came up with the script for this movie. This movie can be vaguely interesting, but it completely throws you off with its, let's be blunt here, boring plot and grotesque violence. The special effects are probably good, but all the visuals are so ugly, disturbing or stomach churning who really care about the special effects or the characters for that matter. Though you end up wanting some of them to survive to make all the things you had to watch them go through worth it. Another disappointment is that this movie has several good actors in it and it goes to show that some big names can't drag a movie out the quagmire the director and scriptwriter created.<br/><br/>If you don't want to be seriously mentally disturbed for at least several months, avoid this movie at all costs.

","Darkness is frightening, because we don't know what it contains.  Blackness isn't frightening - it's just ugly and off putting, like the flourescent greens that also figure so heavily in the colour scheme, like the sudden loud noises and the lascerated flesh.  ""Event Horizon"" doesn't know the difference between scary, startling, and sickening.<br/><br/>But what makes the film really bad is the complete absence of characterisation.  How many people were aboard the rescue ship to begin with?  Five?  Ten?  If only I'd counted.  There's the ship's hubristic scientist - so utterly lifeless a hubristic scientist that I bet if you were to tap him on the shoulder and ask, ""Why did you do what you just did?"" he would look puzzled and reply, ""Because I'm the hubristic scientist."" Similar remarks apply to the jivin' black guy, and to the tough but capable captain (although he, out of everyone, comes closest to being an actual character).  Everyone else on board is utterly unmemorable.  Is this better, or worse?  Hard to tell.  I think Laurence Fishburne's captain is easier to take than the average faceless crew member; Sam Neill's scientist is much harder.<br/><br/>Don't think for a minute that I'm blaming the actors.  It's the script.  No more than half of the lines CAN be delivered with conviction, so no more than half are.  The cast spends most of its time shouting at one another, explaining things (in a sort of a way) to the audience, and wandering off suddenly to investigate this or that without telling anyone only to come back having forgotten whatever it was they had been doing before they left. It becomes tiring after a while, watching conversations you know won't lead anywhere because they'll be forgotten as soon as the camera turns to something else.<br/><br/>P.S.: I can't help noticing that an earlier reviewer tells us that if we don't want something scary and suspenseful we should watch ""Bambi"" instead. He can't have seen ""Bambi"" recently.  Concede for the sake of argument that ""Event Horizon"" is scary; still, ""Bambi"" is far more suspenseful.  One cares whether or not Bambi survives."

Basically, the screenplay (if you can call it that) for this load of hardware laden excreta was so all-over-the-place, while being producer influenced (in a bad way) that by the time we got to the gory conclusion, I'd already been there, done that, and didn't give a flying damn.  Consistency out the window, the rules made up as we went along; what was promised (in the trailer) as some sort of psychological venture was nothing more than an exercise in gross-out of the David Fincher variety -- without Fincher's ability to tell a story visually.<br/><br/>And, one other debit -- Sam Elliot seems to be suffering Michael Caine disease.  He'll appear in any piece of crap, it seems, if they sign the paychecks and give him lots of scenery chewing moments.

"Siamois","7","5","9","1 April 2009"," An underrated gem...
","Director Paul Anderson has let me down on a number of occasions but Event Horizon is not of of them. In fact, this entertaining adventure in space is his best film.<br/><br/>The main reason Event Horizon is such a success is that it visits many genres, jumping nicely from one to the other. At its heart is ""horror in space"". Science-fiction with overtones of HP Lovecraft and Clive Barker. But the key to Event Horizon is that it always aims to entertain and never takes itself seriously. We don't dwell too much on the science, it's just made as evocative as possible for the story to work. The characters are sketched just enough for us to care about them, but Anderson is aware this isn't a character drama, so again doesn't lose too much time with sappy backstories. It helps that the cast absolutely rocks. The brilliant Sam Neill, Larry Fishburne, Joely Richardson, Kathleen Quinlan and the very underrated Jason Isaacs. Despite the high tension and graphic horror, Even Horizon even has well-placed humorous bits, thanks in great part to the character of Cooper (played hilariously by Richard T. Jones).<br/><br/>The architecture and science behind the ship (called the Event Horizon) is simply beautiful and great and contributes to the thrill ride. The ship itself becomes a character. The direction itself is a little sloppy. Some scenes rather uninspired and the editing a bit sloppy. Anderson hints in interviews that the film needed to be rushed due to studio pressure and since a lot of footage has apparently been lost, no true ""director's cut"" will ever do it proper justice.<br/><br/>What we are left with is a movie that is too entertaining to pass, especially for fans of horror and sci-fi. Repeated viewings show that the film has very few dull moments. A solid and unique entry that inspired subsequent films (such as Sunshine).<br/><br/>Highly recommended if you do not take your sci-fi too seriously."

","Never has so much been spent on such a horrid story! This movie is 14 years old as I write this (2011, in case you don't pay attention the date stamp). I fished it out of the $5 movie bin at Walmart this evening, choosing it for viewing because it has some big-name actors in a big-budget sci-fi movie, thus beating out Schwarzenegger's ""Commando"" and ""Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star."" It came with two DVD disks, the second disk for special features.<br/><br/>I'll begin by pointing out the positive. The movie has aged well. The cinematography is top-notch, all the lighting, sound, props and special effects look great (to me, a completely untrained couch potato). This positive is one factor that helped me get through the movie, despite my growing irritation with it. The other was the hint that maybe I would be able to see attractive female nudity.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the plot is asinine. Almost all horror movies have asinine plots, so had I known ahead of time this is supposed to be a horror movie, I might have not expected so much from it. Now I've read a few of the other negative reviews of this movie, and I can see I'm not the only person who recognizes the obvious. Virtually nothing that happens in this movie has any business being in this movie. I get angry every time I think about it. So much of the plot is perfunctory climax, bad things happening on cue, and so obvious, because EVERY SINGLE HORROR MOVIE HAS THE SAME STORY ARC! Some people like cheesiness, but this goes so much deeper than even cheesiness could describe.<br/><br/>It has nice props. I liked the props. I need to think about that for a little bit, until I feel better. Nice props, even though it seems silly that the living quarters look like the heart of a tokamak.<br/><br/>Oh, there is some female nudity in it. In the first half of the movie, we get to see a woman's bare nipple for about 0.25 seconds. I spent the next half-hour wondering why the producers even bothered putting a naked woman in the movie if that was all they were going to show. We spend more time looking into her eyeless eye sockets as she speaks to us in a calm voice. Eventually, Sam Neill's character forces the camera to lock onto those same bare breasts for a minute or so. Visually, nothing else is happening. Then, we go back to the eyeless eye sockets.<br/><br/>The movie attempts to introduce tension by the perfunctory personality clashes between crew members, particularly against the new person aboard. The new crew member designed a ship (the ""Event Horizon"") that has been lost for several years, but now has reappeared. This crew was sent to find out what happened to the ""Horizon."" To build this tension, in one scene, the designer shows complete disregard for another person's personal property as he attempts to explain how the ship he designed operates; so in another scene, a crew member damages the ship he built. Let's compromise the integrity of the ship we are trying to rescue, so we can even our petty score! <br/><br/>Anyway, nice props. Big name stars. Some glimpses of a woman's bare breasts. The Planet Neptune swirling below. Oh, wait... somehow, the ""Event Horizon"" is orbiting Neptune *inside* her upper atmospheric cloud bank, in clouds so dense that she can't even be seen until the rescue ship almost runs into her. So, actually, the Planet Neptune, swirling all around.<br/><br/>If you have any regard for scientific accuracy, you may resent this movie intensely much. If you care about logical motivations, the movie may annoy you. If you value intellectual, thoughtful stories, this movie may drive you mad.<br/><br/>Of course, there is eventually blood everywhere. Blood and gore and horrific things. People getting bumped in the head. Eyes being dug out of sockets. Sharp, spiky things. Dead people. Age-inappropriate children in a Rated R movie, causing havoc. That's just me, reacting to this movie."

","I am terrified of this movie...or I should say that I WAS terrified of it. I have now since conquered my phobia of this movie and am just now able to write a review of it. <br/><br/>I saw this movie in 1997 when it came out and it is the only horror movie, that in my entire life of watching horror, starting with ""JAWS"" at age 7, that, as an adult, scared me so badly that it made me sick and I had nightmares over it. <br/><br/>It is graphic, it is gory and there is just something about the dark and evil scenes that pervade this movie that one can't get over. It's not something that ""goes bump in the night"" but an all out terror that seems to seep into one's subconscious as this movie unfolds. <br/><br/>Being a Goth/Macabre/Erotica author, I am used to gore and graphic death scenes, using them quite often in what I write, but the scenes of evil carnage in this movie are simply something that defy description. Even now I find myself struggling with how to describe something that, once you see this movie, never really seems to leave you.<br/><br/>The cast for this movie was incredible and I can't see any other cast doing as well as this one did. Laurence Fishburne is gruff and business first in his role of Captain Miller. Sam Neill...what can I say about him except that he was one horrifying character as Dr. William Weir, an obsessed and nightmare plagued man, with deranged dreams of his dead wife and wanting to go back to the Event Horizon, no matter what. The ship called to him and his wife called to him...there was no stopping him. I must take a moment to say that Sam Neill was so convincing as the psychotic and murderous Dr. Weir that it took me years before I could watch anything with him in it, no matter what it was, he frightened me so badly. Now THAT is acting!<br/><br/>The supporting cast was just as electrifying. Richard T. Jones, as Cooper, the Rescue Tech gave some of the MUCH needed comedy relief when things became too tense and Jason Isaacs as D.J, Trauma, was ice cold but undoubtedly frightened when he finally deciphers the real message on the cryptic distress signal recording that the crew was allowed to hear, from the doomed last crew of the cursed ship. His fear is realistic, chilling.<br/><br/>
Jack Noseworthy, as Justin, Engineer, put in one of the best, if not much too brief performances of his life as the first victim of the Event Horizon's new crew, being sucked into the ""gateway"" and thus traveling to where the Event Horizon had been...hell. ""The dark inside me"" he proclaims in a fit of violent convulsion and that is simply the beginning of the trouble, and makes this movie an edge of your seat masterpiece.<br/><br/>Kathleen Quinlan as Peters, Med Tech was tragic, haunted by not being able to be with her son, Joely Richardson as Lt. Starck, Executive Officer was strong and believable and Sean Pertwee as Pilot Smith had probably one of the best lines in the movie, ""this ship is f*cked"" and his loathing of the damned, Event Horizon is evident from the minute he steps on board.<br/><br/>I now own this movie and watch it often. If you want non-stop action, horrifying special effects, and graphic gore, then this movie is any suspense and horror lover's dream. I would recommend this movie highly...but only if you have a strong stomach. Oh and it might help to have the lights on as well...<br/><br/>""Liberate tutemae ex inferis."""

","I liked the movie but do not understand why it is alleged to be worthy of a cult following. It's certainly a better than average science fiction flick but I found ""the horror"" in it more hokey than terrifying. <br/><br/>The plot was a great one to work with (starship vanishes for seven years, mysteriously returns with its crew dead or missing) and I read the book too which the movie generally follows except for its weak portrayal to the viewer of the true horrors the former crew of the Event Horizon actually experienced. <br/><br/>The casting was generally weak. Lawrence Fishburne as the rescue starship's Captain Miller wasn't working. I thought he played the role too tightly and reserved. Samuel L. Jackson would have been a better choice. Kathleen Quinlan still knows how to sob like a victim very well but hasn't turned in a decent performance since Lifeguard. Richard Jones as Cooper is a stereotype all the way and Jack Noseworthy as Justin was unnoteworthy. <br/><br/>WARNING SPOILERS GALORE!<br/><br/>If a central theme is that the ship has been to hell and back, then you've got to do a better job of presenting what your vision of hell really is. The book lays this out in detail. But the film covers it in quick, fast, vision sequences that if you blink, you'll miss. Using my DVD, I had to go frame by frame to see what was being flashed. Those were great, horrific shots of people in the apparent agony of existing in hell. Had they been put up there in extended, detailed sequences then you'd get an idea of the horrors of hell in unfolding detail. But to flash them by so quickly just detracted from the terror because it all went by too quickly. If you put all that work into a shot, let people see it and feast upon it! <br/><br/>It seemed more like the crew had just gone insane rather than the what really happened; having been to hell and been forced to do perverted things and have perverted things done to them. Just reading about those things (remember the arm down the throat? Yuch!) in the book was terrifying because you could imagine it in your mind. The film failed to capture the true potential of this horror, again because the sequences flashed by too quickly. <br/><br/>Sam Neil as the satanic figure worked well enough as he slowly succumbed to the evil. But the climactic battle mano-a-mano with Captain Miller was a head scratcher. Settle this by a fist fight with a creature from hell? I don't think so. And why would the creature yell when Captain Miller destroys the ship? Wouldn't that be what he wanted...to send everyone straight back to hell? Ah well.<br/><br/>This could have been one of the best sci-fi horror flicks of all time. The plot had such great material to work with. But the execution was a disappointment. The fact that this film is so popular, though flawed, attests to the viewers primal fears and desires concerning what could have been presented, but wasn't. <br/><br/>We just got a quick, unsatisfying glimpse of hell when we wanted the characters to actually take us there, terrify us, and make us all go back and want to become Christians the way The Exorcist did. <br/><br/>Overall, the screen version just wasn't as compelling as the book. I've seen scarier haunted houses."

","Mild spoilers herein.<br/><br/>I very much enjoyed this movie. I have rented it about 4 different times now with groups of friends because it is a horror film that is actually scary, unlike the teeny `scary' movies. Not only is the movie true to the theoretical physics of faster than light travel, but also does a good job of speculating what COULD happen and explaining how it works. For those who might not understand the physics of it, or those who do, might see this film as an easy pass for making a horror movie by  spoilers  `tearing a hole through Hell.' But I found it very creative and very entertaining. If you want to be creeped out hella, and have nightmares, then this movie is a must.<br/><br/>I give it a 9/10, for some predictability and pacing."

","Let me preface this by saying this movie has, or had, so much potential. The concept is great: A crew investigates a ship that has gone missing for many years only to discover its been in Hell. You would think that this would make for a gripping, terrifying, unique film. Instead we are forced to watch flat characters stroll around an empty ship where the actual ""horror"" aspect of the film takes nearly an hour of the movie's 96 minute run to take into effect. This is one of those movies that feels much longer than its actual run time.<br/><br/>This movie had so much going for it: a great cast, a great plot, great effects that still hold up 17 years later, etc. Unfortunately, nothing actually interesting or ""scary"" happens. This is just another movie that relies on gore to be scary, and guess what, it just doesn't work. I was left thinking that so much suspense and atmosphere was created to reflect the horrors that the Event Horizon experienced in Hell that the writer did not know how to live up to it. So instead, we are left to be scared of visions, fire, guts, and torn out eyeballs.<br/><br/>And that just isn't scary."

And when you did see it, it wasn't all that good. Plus, they explain the problem like eight times, I should think that once would be enough. That just got irritating, I get it, the ship went to hell and came back, get on with it.<br/><br/>I think they just tried to put too much in too little time.

","This is really stupid sci-fi movie with some kind of religious reference. It's not very clear what this film is all about, and I think the creators are very confused by themselves. Maby they meant to create some dark, claustrophobic and apocalyptic movie, maybe they tried to say something about human nature, limits of science and psychological perception, or maybe about the collision of religion and technology. All of those you can find here, but you cannot find that thing, which distinct a real masterpiece from just some bad movie with good intentions.<br/><br/>My guess, whoever made this flop, they just took all the components from other sci-fi movies and combined them into one big mess. The result is scrappy, incoherent, immature, ridiculous, boring and not even frightening piece of crap. <br/><br/>I think teenagers may find that movie tense and interesting, but people who can appreciate really good sci-fi, my suggestion is to skip this one.<br/><br/>Anyway, using this opportunity, I would like to recommend John Carpenter's early movies, like ""Dark Star"" and ""The Thing""."

I believe Laurence Fishburne may be one of the most under-appreciated actors around. He is very versatile, and seems to fit into just about any character he plays.<br/><br/>A great idea for a movie, and some real possibilities here, but some lackadaisical acting from a talented cast, some ridiculous dialog, and questionable directing and editing make this a real disappointment."

","I have absolutely no idea how this movie currently has a 5.8/10 rating! Event Horizon was one of those films that made a huge willing-suspension-of-disbelief jump during its trailer to be able to tell a story of what it truly might be like at the other end of the universe.<br/><br/>The cast performances (led by Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill) were outstanding with no weak acting that I can speak of. The characters themselves were intriguing as each crew member was in essence fallible yet competent.<br/><br/>The dark theme and raw evil created in all aspects throughout the movie (the score, the characters, sharp images, lighting) added a scared 's***tless' viewing experience.<br/><br/>I often wonder if the perception of this movie hurt its ratings.

"rochus_meijer","9","4","8","23 December 2005"," The Shining in outer space
","This movie freaked me out of my chair many times! A friend of mine recommended this movie to me years ago. He saw it at the theater and was stunned. I remembered seeing a trailer of the film and wanting to see it badly. Fact is, the film only stayed in the cinema for about five weeks in my country. I was too late, I had to rent it on video. I can imagine that ""Event Horizon"" has a scary effect in the cinema, but watching it home alone made me probably feel more shocked then ever before. What I thought to be a mediocre ""Alien"" ripoff, turned out to be something completely different. It scared the hell out of me..<br/><br/>For those of you who saw ""Ghost Ship"", this movie has a lot of similarities, only ""Event Horizon"" is way better. I'll start with the opening credits. Nothing really special, but the music score that comes along with it; absolutely terrifying! Great work by both Michael Kamen and Orbital, who use a sublime mixture of techno, orchestra music and all kinds of chilling sound effects. At that moment I knew I was going to be scared, which didn't take long to actually happen.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is quite well. My credits go to Sam Neill in particular, who plays a role in which I never saw him before. Watch and see for yourself. The story is the worst thing in this movie, although I like the concept of a spaceship that creates black holes to travel faster than light. But the whole 'rescue mission that goes awry' is done so many times before, it didn't impress me much. The same goes for the ending which is in my opinion a bit of a letdown. On the other hand, it probably had a more lasting effect on me just because I was still confused with what actually happened.<br/><br/>For those of us who can't stand any gore, don't watch this! Although most of the gore in ""Event Horizon"" comes in flashes, there are particular scenes which do not leave much to the imagination. Shocks will be there plenty for the most of us, as everything hits you right in the face over and over again.<br/><br/>Adding everything in this film up: special effects, music and the atmosphere are the best things here. The storyline is the worst, but is still enjoyable as long as you don't take it too serious. So what's my conclusion? If you want to be scared, do as I did and watch ""Event Horizon"" alone in the dark with loud sound.. If you enjoyed ""Ghost Ship"", go and see this movie as it is the same concept, only way better and more believable.. If you liked ""The Shining"", you might consider looking at ""Event Horizon"" as well because a good description is ""The Overlook Hotel in outer space"". It's chilling, it's shocking and it stays in your head for a very long time. Liberate tutemae ex inferis! (Safe yourself from hell!) 8/10!"
"b-severson","9","4","8","3 November 2005"," Conceptually very scary film...
","I saw this movie in theater when I was 12 and since then it has remained in my top three scariest films. I don't think my parents realized how frightening it was going to be when they took me to see it. The film, which takes place in 2047 (when humans have already established colonies on the moon and have started commercial mining on Mars), moves quickly and gets scary fast. Sam Neill plays a scientific engineer (Dr. Weir) assigned to guide a search-and-rescue vessel to Neptune where a ship (the Event Horizon) has suddenly resurfaced seven years after disappearing. Laurence Fishburne stars as the crew's captain (Cpt. Miller) and mediator after news of the lost vessel found creates panic. The Event Horizon (which was a research vessel destined for our nearest star) was actually part of an exploratory project designed by Weir. In the film, he creates a gateway (black hole) that allows for faster-than-light travel. However, unforeseen accidents occur and the Event Horizon ends up at a place far, far away from its intended destination. A truly terrifying film that expands on Stephen Hawkings' ideas about black holes for the WORSE..."

","An eerie, pounding techno soundtrack.. excellent special effects, and lots of them.. brilliant futuristic/gothic sets.. great 'Mary Celeste' storyline.. good shocks.. great ending.<br/><br/>I can't understand why people criticise this movie for being derivative. Yes, it's got a big gloomy spaceship.  That doesn't make it Alien.  It mentions black holes, but that doesn't have anything to do with the Disney movie.  It blows up at the end - Hey, I think I saw a movie once where the thing blew up at the end! Jesus.  Oh, and that wasn't a spoiler.  Telling you about an action movie where nothing blows up - that would be a spoiler.<br/><br/>Most of all, I enjoyed the zero-G effects, the amazing sets (on a par with Burton's genius on Batman), and the generally fewer-holds-barred-than-usual take on Hell.  It was creepy too, which a lot of horror films fail to be.<br/><br/>On the minus side (and not to take away from the film), TV-edited versions of Event Horizon are especially rubbish.  We're used to seeing swearwords replaced, and violence trimmed - but watching this on the BBC the other day I noticed whole swathes missing - entire scenes!  The plot was cut to shreds (even worse than .. is), and I can understand why someone watching it on TV for the first time would think it was a load of cluttered, unexplained rubbish.  Except for the actual look, and the soundtrack - which anyone should realise is excellent.<br/><br/>I have moderate hopes for Resident Evil (Paul Anderson's latest film), but - having seen Soldier - I fear he may have peaked with Event Horizon which would be a shame, because (judging from an audience chat I saw once), he seems to be a decent guy."
"Oreolove","2","4","8","10 January 2002"," Snooze!
","This movie redefines ""turkey."" The creators have managed to make it as unbelievable and confusing as possible. (How many people have you seen get sucked into space, without a spacesuit, and return to the ship with nothing more than minor cuts?) Not even the All-Star cast could've saved this one. Sadly, the ""All-Star cast"" didn't live up to their title. Laurence Fishburne came off as a jerk even though he was the hero and Sam Niel was sadly miscast far below his talent. The plot moved slowly, most of the characters came off as either stupid or sharp-tongued, and the ""comic relief"" just came off as annoying. I would like to congratulate new-comer Jack Noseworthy for pulling off a decent performance, although he somewhat becomes like a vegetable before the movie is half over. The plot is left with holes you could drive a truck through, and leaves the viewer feeling emotionally drained and utterly confused. Nothing less than a miracle could have saved this bomb."

","I don't think I've ever seen a worse movie than Event Horizon.  While the early graphics were good, the script was bloody awful.  It's essentially the story of Prometheus, retold yet again.  Prometheus, you recall, stole the secret of fire from the gods and was punished by being chained to a rock and having his liver eternally pecked out by eagles.<br/><br/>""Bloody"" is the best one-word description.  There's lots and lots of blood, in fact - gallons of it.  Disembowelments that make Prometheus's torment look like a Sunday picnic.  And why?  Because the scientist broke the laws of physics.<br/><br/>I'm not surprised to find Sam Neill in this turkey, but I'm disappointed that Lawrence Fishburn's considerable skills were wasted on it.<br/><br/>Most everyone dies horribly, of course, but you can save yourself.

","I know a lot of folks don't like Event Horizon, but I found it to be one of the few truly chilling sci-fi horror films that I have seen in the past two decades.<br/><br/>A rescue mission is sent out after a long-lost spaceship (the Event Horizon) reappears in orbit around Neptune.  The ship was actually the first attempt at faster-than-light travel, and used a unique method of bending space developed by Sam Neill's scientist...which inadvertantly sent the ship and its original crew outside the universe, and into a world of complete chaos that approximates Hell.  Unfortunately, the rescue party doesn't know this, and doesn't know that the ship wants to go back.<br/><br/>Both Sam Neill and Lawrence Fishburne given outstanding performances.  Neill is excellent as the scientist who has given all (including his wife's life - by suicide) to create the Event Horizon, and gradually loses his mind to the haunted ship.  Fishburne is the commander of the rescue mission who refuses to leave any of his crew behind, and wants to destroy the ship before it takes them all back to the other dimension. His own dedication to that ideal rivals Neill's insane desire to go back with this ship.<br/><br/>There are many similarities between this movie and other science fiction works (including Alien, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and particular Sphere, which came out years later), but I believe that Event Horizon stands on its own as a masterpiece of horror."

","Just saw this on one of those cable channels that shows uncut movies, and now I remember why I avoided seeing it for so many years.<br/><br/>It starts out OK apart from the cheesy opening credits sequence that probably looked pretty cool in 1997 but looks really dated now (as do most of the computer generated effects in the movie). A space ship called the Event Horizon, which was presumed lost seven years ago has unexpectedly sent out a distress signal from Neptune. A rescue team is dispatched along with a scientist who, early in the film, explains that he invented the special drive that was supposed to let Event Horizon open a hole in the fabric of space-time and jump directly to a neighboring star. So far, so good - seems like it could be an interesting sci-fi movie, although there are many signs that it's actually a horror movie, including the fact that the Event Horizon was apparently designed to look like a haunted castle floating in space. And it's actually ""orbiting"" within the atmosphere of Neptune. But whatever.<br/><br/>HERE'S THE BIG SPOILER - and I reveal it only because if, like me, you were hoping this would be a decent sci-fi flick, this should put you right off it - the hole that Event Horizon opened didn't lead to a neighboring star. It went, literally, to hell. And after causing the original crew to murder each other in gory, ritualistic ways, it has come back to our universe looking for more victims.<br/><br/>OK, say you're willing to buy into that as a horror film plot. Even then this movie is terrible because it basically just lifts plot elements and visual elements from Alien, Stargate, The Shining and a host of other, better films. And then throws in a bunch of jump scares - sudden loud noises, flashing lights, etc - and tons of gore. Nearly everything in this movie is a cliché that you've probably seen elsewhere, and if you're not able to fully predict how the second half is going to play out, then you've never watched a horror movie before.<br/><br/>The movie really wasn't even worth the amount of time it took to write this review, but I was shocked when I looked it up on IMDb and saw people giving it 8, 9 and 10 star reviews. It is DEFINITELY not that good, even if you like horror movies. Maybe a two or three at best."

","I strangely failed to catch up with British Director Paul Anderson's sci-fi movie ""Event Horizon"" until 20 years after it was made. And now I think I understand why, as this piece does not please the viewer as well as it might. This is a more intriguing failing than it might seem, given quite-adequate special effects on the spacecraft in orbit around Neptune (certainly so for 1997), a pretty reasonable cast (Sam Neill, Joely Richardson, Sean Pertwee and Jason Isaacs to name but four) and a creepy-enough core plot idea (with a nicely enigmatic little twist at the end).<br/><br/>Admittedly, quite a bit of the dialogue here is hammy, the theme music is simply a mistake, the plot realisation is at times predictable, and quite often members of the ""Lewis & Clark"" crew seem to act in slightly unlikely ways (the traditional sin of withholding information from Captain and crew being quite well at work here at regular intervals, for example).<br/><br/>But does even this list of misdemeanours account for what happens with this film? <br/><br/>I'm not quite sure.<br/><br/>What is interesting is that the Neill character Dr William Weir sums up the evil of Hell by reference to eternal chaos and - surprisingly - the film offers up a little slice of that chaos, and it's not pleasant. And, while unpleasantness is not necessarily a crime in a film, or indeed in any other piece of art, the turnoffs here somehow just seem to outweigh any possible rewards of watching, even in a whole that comes in at just 96 minutes."

Though they discover something far more sinister & dark when they get there!<br/><br/>I found the film to be pretty good, considering I know little about Sci-Fi. Especially the terms, phrases & things they were saying, but it was good & sort of understandable. <br/><br/>The gore effects were good though I had heard before watching that there is about 30 minutes of lost footage which got ditched because some pussy wimpy screen testers fainted from the strong extreme gore used! Now that to me was how it should have been, though the film didn't disappoint in terms of gore or graphic violence, I felt the uncut version should've been kept if not released, there is however hope of an uncut release as far back as 2012, though it's been for years & we haven't heard anything since...but fingers crossed! I felt the gore effects in this film were quite restricted & not prolonged enough & could've done with a lot more disgusting vile gore & maggots! But like I said, it was acceptable enough despite the disappointment in the toned down violence! <br/><br/>The death scenes were decent enough & some of the visuals didn't disappoint too much. It was an OK kind of film & one worth watching & if not re-watching & this is coming from someone who doesn't much like Sci-Fi films! <br/><br/>The ending was satisfying enough & not clichéd like other horror film endings! But it was good. At only 91 minutes & the fast paced feeling I did quite enjoy how fast it moved, though for the sake of seeing prolonged gore & bloody extreme violence I would've wanted it to be longer & wouldn't have minded despite it being Sci-Fi & slightly confusing. I would've killed for the prolonged deleted scenes!<br/><br/>I overall found this film to be pretty good despite the lack of gore & prolonged visuals of graphic violence which could've been prolonged more. I would've liked to have seen some graphic blood splattering violence, but unfortunately no. I'm so hoping for the 130 minute directors cut that we've been deprived of all these years!<br/><br/>I give this flick a 7/10. If the bloody gory vile scenes were prolonged more & some good bloody kills I would've gave this film a 9 rating, but this cut version gets a generous 7/10!

Unfortunately it soon became evident no-one had any faith in the power of storytelling and characterization to engage the audience. Instead they had to exaggerate every interaction between members of the crew to be as abrasive as possible, and introduce every cheesy and over-the-top horror film trick they could think of to progress the film. I nearly wrote ""to maintain interest"" but in fact it's a big turn off and you soon regard the whole affair with total contempt. Here's an example of the wit and character development in the film: black male crew member to female crew member while offering a cup of coffee ""How'd you like something hot and black inside you?"" (leers). Just when you think it can't get any worse with exaggerated gory special effects, it does. I see some people like this film, honestly I shudder to imagine the sort of person that would. It's quite repulsive, and the only reason I'm giving it a 2 is that I did watch it to the end to see who they could extricate from the general mayhem.

","Event Horizon is a perfect ensemble collaboration of talent, which takes the basic elements of separate genre legends such as Aliens and The Shining. Essentially it's a clash of religion and science and I suppose what might have happened had they merged Aliens with The Shining.<br/><br/>Director Paul W.S. Anderson (Resident Evil) and writer Philip Eisner (The Mutant Chronicles) made their finest ever film with Event Horizon, the story of a rescue and salvage ship crew employed by Dr Weir, the first scientist to create inter-dimensional space travel, whose titular spaceship sent out a distress call before disappearing into oblivion.<br/><br/>The ship has returned and is floating dead in space just outside of Jupiter's atmosphere, its crew has vanished. Captain Miller (Lawrence Fishburne) and his crew, board the ship only to discover the remains of the doomed Event Horizon's crew and to begin salvaging disturbing evidence that the ship - which itself begins to show signs of life - may have traveled to someplace beyond just another dimension.<br/><br/>Firstly, I was surprised over time to learn of the writer and director's separate careers. According to IMDb, Philip Eisner hasn't worked since The Mutant Chronicles and I'm not surprised. It was awful. I only watched it because I generally like Thomas Jane's films and it seemed like a good watch just by the trailer.<br/><br/>The only other film I really liked from Anderson meanwhile was Death Race. I wish he'd just let Resident Evil die and not come back like the retarded zombies it's all about. Bullet to the head and bye-bye, baby!<br/><br/>What makes their first effort work here is the minimalist attitude towards the horror element and the amount of work put into the element of suspense and character building. Otherwise it's down to the clean and safely used CGI and set-pieces and overall, the actors.<br/><br/>Lawrence Fishburne who hadn't made a great film up until then since King of New York was a great choice for Captain Miller. He assumes control with ease and just gets the job done like every plain and ordinary working man's boss does, rather than try to shine.<br/><br/>Sam Neill as Dr Weir takes the reins of the troubled genius like a true theatre legend, showing why he has been one of the industry's consistently best actors since his re-emergence as a mature actor in psycho thriller Dead Calm. Here he really busts out the dramatic and hams it up to good effect when necessary, making him very much the main event, which I suppose he was meant to be.<br/><br/>The backing cast also consisted of some very admirable talent including fellow Brits Joely Richardson as the cold hearted and sensible Ripley-alike second in command, Jason Isaacs as the ship's medic and psychologist and genre legend Sean Pertwee as the typically English grease monkey mechanic. <br/><br/>The Yanks gave us legend Kathleen Quinlan as the resident med tech and Richard T. Jones and Jack Noseworthy as the salvage crew. Far from retiring to their characters' stereotypes, the actors play on it well but still develop a good rapport with each other.<br/><br/>As I remember one of the most impressive and surprising appearances was of the techno-punk band The Prodigy, who supplied the disturbed twisted metal connoting soundtrack. This served well in the film's overall theme and the filler tracks are suspenseful and heavily suggesting of just how crazy the film gets as it progresses.<br/><br/>Since Event Horizon there have been a number of similar themed runaway successes from mainstream and B-Movies alike but rather than giving the opinion that Event Horizon had followed on where genre creator Alien had given it the inspiration, Event has managed to create a genre of its own. If you haven't seen it and you have a budding horror and sci-fi classics DVD collection, this needs to be a part of it!"

","Event Horizon is a ground breaking edition to the horror genre, and a breath of fresh air next to all the teen slasher movies of the 90's.<br/><br/>Set in the year 2047, there is a sudden reappearance of a prototype spaceship (Event Horizon) which vanished seven years ago. A rescue ship is sent out to investigate along with Dr William Weir, who is a physics expert responsible for creating the ship. There is no sign of life and as they set out to make repairs the crew begin to sense that they are not alone.<br/><br/>So Event Horizon may not have the most complicated plot or work on character development but what it does achieve, is creating an intense atmosphere in a confined space. The most accomplished thing in this film are the hallucinations that the crew experience. The editing techniques used to portray these make them the success that they are. You along with the crew begin to question what you actually seeing on screen, because one minute its there, and in the flash of an eye its gone. This helps to give the movie an eerie edge, and it also plays with your psychological emotions.<br/><br/>The main element itself was designed with a Gothic look and feel in mind. The camera angles used add to the intensity; the dark, empty hallways and rooms create a menacing feel, and you definitely feel that there is something lurking beyond, which leaves you in a state of unease. Not to mention the gore is fantastic.<br/><br/>Paul Anderson utilises many aspects which other horror films have, but what he achieves is more chilling and leaves an audience at the edge of there seats. An atmospheric horror film, what more could you possibly want?"

","Right first of i can understand people not liking this movie,each to there own as it were but i feel many people have only seen the versions cut for television or something like that, as i saw this movie back in 97 and something instantly clicked i loved it but I'm not sure why. yes its the directors only truly decent movie. The sets are wonderful for the budget and short production time. The cast are good in there roles the effects are also fairly good the camera work and direction are superb but its none of these things that make the movie so good for me. I caught this again on sky the other week and its different from the cinema version but still it was there this feeling, its the atmosphere the mood, Im in my mid 30s now and never really scared by movies as we know its not real but maybe it mankind's fear of the unknown. This movie i think fills me with a feeling of total dread right down to my gut the hair on my neck sort of queasy sick feeling thats why it is scary, not for the gore or jumps its the mood it creates within you i have trouble watching it alone at night in the dark and I'm a fully grown man there is just something about it that makes me feel so uncomfortable watching. I get people don't like this actor or that or the weekend bedroom scientists that want to pick holes in the theory of worm holes and jump drives, but hey its sci-fi that's the point it doesn't have to be feasible or work its fiction the only restriction is our imaginations in this genre also i think the edit for television cuts a lot of parts that help hold it together so please find a DVD and give this a go it shouldn't be scary but there is just something i cant put my finger on but i find it to be one of the most clever films I've ever seen simply for the way it makes you feel you will be thinking about it for weeks afterwards please just try it.......and enjoy it for what it is"

Sam Neil plays the scientist guiding the hapless crew to the vicinity of a distress signal. Then lot's of stuff happens (no need for a 'spoiler alert').<br/><br/>I can't believe that so many IMDb'ers are so down on this gem of a sci-fi flick.

","This is Paul Andersons best movie here. Anderson has been bringing us some very unsatisfying movies as of late and this one seems to fly under the radar. When your watching the movie you don't realize that this is his film. A couple of reasons will show this, 1, you got a good/strong cast. 2, It's well written and acted. 3, it works and will scare you or make you feel uneasy. I like this movie quite a bit. I'm not one to be scared by movies easily but this one makes it hard for me to sleep at night. Its not so much the movie itself but when your hear that transmission that Dr Wier plays back you know there's trouble ahead and when you see what happens to the crew on that ships log it makes you feel extremely uneasy. The ship plays the perfect villain here and the whole feeling of the movie is uneasy. Nothing looks pretty in this movie. And that look sells it. I would recommend it because all in all it is a good movie. Sam Neill puts on a great performance along with Lawrence Fishburne. The supporting cast is great as well with familiar faces all around. If your in the video store and want something to tickle your mind alittle, go ahead and watch this flick. It won't disappoint, but its not for the easily sickened."
"macduff50","4","2","3","14 April 2006"," mismatched ideas, gore effects, sink flick
","I have to disagree with those who like this film, sort of.<br/><br/>It sets itself up as a science fiction film, but in fact, it's a horror film, and worse, a theological horror film. The spaceship's ""drive"" allows it to travel in space by short-cutting through other dimensions, but when, after an absence of seven years, it returns to the solar system, it turns out (**SPOILER**) that it's actually been to Hell.<br/><br/>The problem is that science fiction is based on science, and the idea of this film depends on a literal understanding of some fairly medieval (aka fundamentalist) Christianity. The two simply don't mix. Those who like science fiction will be deeply annoyed by the intrusion of religious ideas, and those who are religious likely will miss this film entirely because it looks like science fiction.<br/><br/>In the end too, a lot of loose ends remain untied. Is Hell real? Is it just another dimension? What's the theory behind the way all these dimensions fit together into some universe or other? Are our cultural ideas about Hell derived from some sort of intuition about these other dimensions? Who knows? Who cares? Certainly not the film-makers, who seem interested only in milking the concept for the maximum amount of gore and pointless shocks -- you know, the sort that make you jump in your seat for a second, and then you realize that's all it was: no concept, just another ""Gotcha!"" moment. Manipulative and thoughtless film-making at its worst (or best, depending on your tastes).<br/><br/>And the truly sad part is that the acting and the set design are truly fabulous. A lot of energy was expended on making the ship seem workable, real, and genuinely creepy. In the end, however, all the effort is wasted. The story doesn't fit together, and the genre itself is misjudged. Give it a miss."

","I saw this movie on opening day in a packed theater.  I knew it would be bad when I overheard the ushers were refusing to go into the theater to do a headcount.  Expecting something on the level of Aliens, I was amazed.<br/><br/>Sure, the whole genere of derelict spacecraft rescued by motley crew of quirky deviant types had been done to death, but this movie was not intended to surpass those movies, but encompass and expound on them.  I believe that the similarities noted by so many to Aliens and Hellraiser were not plaguerizing but tribute. If you look deep into the movie and its basic thesis, and not distract yourself with coolant containers and laughable artificial gravity generators, you will see that it is an allegory for the hell within. It has some great symbolism and the much criticised gore accomplishes what it is intended to accomplish--you are affected by this movie.  Sometimes deeply. It leaves you with the feeling that somehow your soul has been taken out. Not for the delicate. Yes, the script is script is a collage of all the sci-fi movies in the past 30 years, yes the characters are one dimensional... but think on this: Were it more realistic, would you ever be able to turn out the lights again? Could you do any kind of looking at yourself inside without seeing Sam Neil staring back, eyeless? Perhaps the best review of this movie is this: After the credits started rolling to the soulless sounds of Orbital, something occurred in the packed theater that I had never seen before.  As everyone filed out of the theater, faces blank and pale, not a single word was uttered. Not one. ***1/2 out of ****"
"patdell","Null","2","3","25 July 2001"," Don't overlook Even Horizon. There are better films in the genre, but there are also much, much worse.
","The main criticisms levelled at Event Horizon have been lack of focus and fresh ideas.<br/><br/>I agree that Horizon is derivate in many of its elements, but then it is a rare film in this genre that presents something entirely new. You will find echoes of Alien, 2001, even The Shining plus more in Event Horizon. But I think that it offers enough that is new or at least a new spin to make it worth a look.<br/><br/>As for focus I was struck by how honed Horizon was in what it was getting at. (Watch out, here comes a little spoiler!) Having each character stalked by a darkness from their own minds made real, allowed a wider scope of unexpected jolts to be sprung on the audience than if there was just your run-of-the-mill toothy monster.<br/><br/>Horizon's jerky pacing is its main shortcoming. It tends to throw shocks at you throughout instead of building solidly to a knockout climax. The conclusion when it comes feels as if its trying to get your wandering attention back onto the screen and so to some will feel overblown as a consequence.<br/><br/>Laurence Fishburne leads a strong cast as captain of the rescue ship sent to find survivors aboard the Event Horizon which has mysteriously re-appeared after vanishing years before. Watching him in action is always a pleasure, especially as you can observe traits he was to bring to The Matrix as Morpheus. Sam Neil is able to summon up a charismatic performance too, in a vein far removed from his usual taciturn screen presence.<br/><br/>Because little good sci-fi gets made I believe the sci-fi audience is an overly critical one. Even with the mini renaissance of sci-fi at the moment with Matrix 2/3, X-Men 2/3 and Final Fantasy etc, there is still a shortage of quality non-Trek material. Don't overlook Even Horizon. There are better films in the genre, but there are also much, much worse."

"moviegoerstoney","Null","2","3","22 November 1999"," An extremely good film.
","This a very good movie. It creates a wonderful atmosphere. It's very creepy and scary. Plus it also gives one a feel akin to claustrophobia. You get the feeling that everything, the ship, fate, nature, EVERYTHING, is closing in on you and that everything is against you. It also gives one a wonderful sense of isolation, that you are completely alone and that there is no one that can come along and help. The people who made this film said that they were trying to duplicate those two elements in the manner that Alien did. I think that in some ways (particularly for the claustrophobic feel) they surpassed Alien. All films lose something going from the big screen to the small screen. But if you missed this on the big screen, you missed out. You fully feel the atmosphere it creates when watched in a movie theatre. You only get a small fraction of it watching the movie on TV.<br/><br/>The film is also good from a psychological view point, as we see the characters reaction to the experiences they are going through, and how this affects their relationship with each other.<br/><br/>My only problem is it does display a little too much gore, but if you can bare sitting through the gory parts, you'll experience a great film."

","Event horizon tells the tale of a ship which is capable of faster than light travel, however on the maiden voyage the ship disappears and then seven years later the ship mysteriously reappears. A rescue team along with the ships designer (Sam Neil) is dispatched to investigate. Events take a dark turn However when the ship is boarded and things are eerily not as they seem. We learn the ship has traveled between dimensions and actually took the previous crew to hell and that the ship has become corrupted by the chaos in the afore mentioned dimension.<br/><br/>Event horizon boasts an impressive seasoned cast of actors Sam Neil, Laurence Fishburne, Sean Pertwee, Jack Noseworthy, Kathleen Quinlan and Richard T. Jones star.<br/><br/>Along with the excellent cast the movie boasts incredible set design. The ship is gothic in appearance (which I personally love) and fits the narrative of the plot very well. Gore is used fairly well, there are very short graphic scenes which leave more to the audience's imagine which in my opinion works better than hellraisers use of showing you everything gore.<br/><br/>Event horizon does fall short in some places however, the movie has absolutely fantastic ideas which are sometimes poorly executed. These can be attributed to constraints placed on the direction by paramount cutting a lot of scenes from the movie, which the cast themselves were not happy about.<br/><br/>In conclusion Event Horizon is probably one of my favourite Sci-Fi movies of all time (think the shining but in space with gore). This explains the cult fan base which has developed over the years since the movie was released. The film still holds up really well which is unusual considering the movie came out in 1997.

Boasting such fine acting talents as Sam Neiil and Larry Fishburn. There might just be an exciting directors cut on the way, or hopefully over the horizon."
"cadge01","8","1","1","17 November 2019"," Alien meets Solaris with a touch of Lovecraft
","Every once in a while I watch a film that has been so poorly received by critics that I am genuinely astounded as to how so many professional critics can have came to such a spectacularly different conclusion as I have. Event Horizon is very much one of those films.<br/><br/>The plot concerns the crew of an interstellar recovery vessel led by Captain Miller (Laurence Fishburne) who are en route to salvage the eponymous ship, which has reappeared after a 7 year absence. The ship's designer (Dr. Billy Weir played by Same Neil) gives the crew a very hand-wavy explanation of how the ship uses a gravity drive which generates a black hole to enable it to traverse far greater distances than any existing technology allows - a concept that is implausible if not impossible. Unfortunately it seems as though the Event Horizon's crew died in a very bloody and violent fashion.<br/><br/>In terms of genre, the film very much fits within the sci-fi horror niche. In particular it appears to derive a great deal of influence from Alien (to the extent that both ships resemble the Nostromo). However a number of characters experience hallucinations and this as well as the theme of humans trying to interact with something they cannot fully understand also reminded me of Solaris. And when a film contains a quote along the lines of 'You break all the laws of physics and you seriously think there wouldn't be a price?' it's hard not to think of the cosmic horror of H.P. Lovecraft in which science, technology, and even reason, prove futile in the face of vast and uncaring universe.<br/><br/>Despite the fast pace and frequent use of special effects characterisation is not ignored. Much of the horror is drawn from characters being presented with traumatic images from their pasts. Likewise, there are several scenes where the characters clearly show concern for and emotional attachment towards each other. However given that two of the rescue ship's crew are female, I was relieved the makers of the film didn't try to force a romance subplot. It was also a relief to see characters acting in a fashion that allowed them to show fear whilst still coping with the situation in a rational manner - as opposed to the traditional two extremes of the horror genre; hysterical idiots or fearless ubermensch. In particular, Laurence Fishburne provided a suitable commanding presence as a strong leader who clearly cared about his crew, while Joely Richardson came across as an effective second in command.<br/><br/>While Event Horizon is never quite able to reach the greatness of Alien (which I consider best in class for sci-fi horror) it did manage to sustain my attention through a combination of suspense, horror, and mystery. There were no glaring plot holes, I couldn't name a bad actor, and the special effects all hold up to viewing in 2019. I have no idea why the critics hated this film so much, for sure there may be an element of snobbery towards genre fare, but many of the same critics have given positive reviews to other genre films such as those from the Alien or The Terminator series. While the opinions of others won't stop me enjoying a film, it is a bit of a shape to think that many people will be turned off watching Event Horizon by its poor critical reputation. So for those who are evenly remotely interested in it, I would enthusiastically urge you to seek it and judge it for yourself."

This movie actually makes me sad since it's underdeveloped in almost every aspect.<br/><br/>
It is weak as a sci-fi movie, it sucks as a horror since it uses only the most obvious jump scares. The pacing and the editing is clunky. When I watched it the last time I caught myself thinking on how each individual scene could've been easily improved. This movie was clearly inspired by Alien, Aliens, Hellraiser and DooM game series (there are even some Doom easter eggs in the movie). Also, it's hard to watch this in 2019 since the effects really don't hold up, some of them look so bad I don't think they were good even by 1997 standards.<br/><br/>
This is frustrating since the movie has some really good gore (and it obviously had more, but it was severely cut by the studio), and a very distinct style in set (and ship) design. Some of the sets they have are amazing, and even though it makes absolutely no sense in terms of actual engineering it still looks amazing. Very nice craft. The actors did their best with a script like that. I mean, some of the ending scenes are so comical and unintentionally funny you really can't handle those any better.<br/><br/>
No real point in watching or re-watching this in 2019, but there is a need to re-make this ASAP. I can see this as a kind of slower psychological horror about space isolation with a tint of supernatural. Get a competent director and this would fly for sure."

Perhaps it is the echo of that fear I developed in my youth, but there is something incredibly unsettling about Event Horizon. Yes, the sci-fi side of things doesn't really add up, causing enormous continuity errors and goofs, and resulting in this half lost in space adventure / half inter-dimensional psychological horror really hitting the mark - for about only half of the time. The fact that there was a lost 130 minute cut of this 90 minute movie tells me that there was a lot more going on that we weren't filled in on. <br/><br/>A recent journey through the revived Twin Peaks taught me that a deeper sense of satisfaction can be achieved by embracing and perpetuating mystery; that great things can come of events that raise more questions than they set out to solve, but here it still kinda feels like we are being cheated out of finding what truly lies behind that portal into the ""hell"" dimension. The lost cut is just that; lost, forever, and that bizarre story just adds to the intrigue around this contrasting movie.

","After reading many reviews, I've come to the conclusion that this film has very few if any objective reviews. I'm surprised at the number of reviewers that absolutely hated this movie, I suspect that at least some of them were expecting a sci-fi movie and not a horror movie, or were overly affected by the faux gore and edited the rest of the film out of their minds.<br/><br/>I first watched this film in 1998 on pay-per-view shortly after its theatrical run. It's a mostly solid psychological terror flick with a great cast, but at the end it really falls flat.<br/><br/>The buildup of dread is exquisitely crafted for a while, as the trapped characters begin seeing illusions of their worst fears come to life. One entranced character almost dies during these opening sequences, though it seems as if the Hellish presence of the ship is just toying with them at first.<br/><br/>These sequences all work great. I've not felt such film-induced dread in a while, since most slasher/startle flicks fail in every way to truly scare me. However, when they find out that the old crew slaughtered one another it starts to get really shlockey.<br/><br/>Act 3 of this movie unfortunately is really a let-down. They drop the whole psychological terror/illusions of the mind motif in favor of a Doom 2 style showdown. Sam Neil becomes Satan, and Lawrence Fishburn beats him up with a CO2 scrubber. Satan seems more upset about the ship blowing up then I would have expected, but what do I know.<br/><br/>If the dread buildup would have continued, I could easily give this film 10 stars, but the last 20 minutes are just shlock."

","A rescue crew are sent in to investigate the mysterious circumstances surrounding a ship that disappeared into a black hole some 7 years ago. The crew manage to locate the missing ship known as 'Event Horizon' and quickly discover that all is not quite right with the Event Horizon.<br/><br/>As with most space related films Event Horizon has an intriguing premise and is also a film that opens up promisingly; albeit it is a tad slow and does set itself up as being more worthy than it thinks that it is. It's a pity then that the slow burn approach never really builds into anything great - it essentially cobbles together elements from many other films such as Solaris, Black Hole and Alien to name but a few making the film both generic and predictable. Interestingly, this creates a tonal clash between the first half and the second half whereby the first half is slow and pretentious (which are things I hate) and the second half is whacked out, ridiculous and quite fun to watch (which are things I love). This gives the film an uneven feel to it resulting in a film that I didn't hate, but also one that I couldn't love either.<br/><br/>The cast are actually good here and work well to make the second half of the film fairly intense and enjoyable; this is hampered slightly by a rather lame and predictable twist later in the film. Paul Anderson's directing is good and he mostly makes good use of the locations; the claustrophobic feel that he gives to the film is good and he injects several shots of adrenalin to the picture which does make the second half of the film pass by much quicker than the first half.<br/><br/>Yes if we're being honest this is a poor man's Alien and if you're looking for anything remotely original or intelligent then you're best off looking elsewhere. Even though the film seems to start and end on 2 different tones there is just about enough going on throughout the 90 minutes to make it work, and this results in a film that is neither brilliant nor ground-breaking, but one that is bearable and watchable."

","The Event Horizon is an abandoned ship found by the crew of the Lewis and Clark. Sam Neill plays the designer of the Event Horizon who lost contact with the crew and has gone to find his masterpiece. No spoilers here, but if you hate sci-fi or horror, give it a miss! Event Horizon is a cult film, not well received upon release but a sleeper of it's day. Quite a large budget but never oversold, this sci-fi horror really delivers the goods due in large to the director, Paul W S Anderson. This genre is his forte and he is a director of distinction, using excellent visuals, keeping the tension prevalent making you feel on edge constantly. Great example of Sam Neill's qualities with strong performances elsewhere, but it is the juxtaposition of the imposing girth of the ""techno-mediaeval"" Event Horizon and it's gravity drive and the claustrophobic nature of the the Lewis and Clark which gives the feeling of despondancy, everything is stacked against the characters.<br/><br/>The balance between British and American characters plus an Australian also makes this film better for me because you get a little tired of having an all American cast in big films, no matter how good they are. The acting in the film is good as a consequence in this, all of these good actors being up to their full standards. As for the story-line, well, it doesn't get any better than a ship getting sucked down a black hole and coming back with an evil entity onboard which killed its crew and is bent on killing the rescue crew too. ""The Event Horizon"" is a stunning ship and the Gravity Drive is a stunning looking device to go in its heart - it's no wonder that Dr. Weir became obsessed with it. But this film is a good example of how obsessions can become deadly, so watch out. The dark entity starts to make its presence known and eventually takes over Dr. Weir and kills most of the crew. It involves some fantastic scenes such as Justin depressurising in the air lock and some guy on a ship log recording pulling out his entrails though his mouth. Sounds gory? Yeah, it is, but don't let that put you off even if you really need to have a strong stomach for it.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 9 out of 10."
"NateWatchesCoolMovies","9","1","1","27 October 2015"," A truly scary space horror
","Paul W.S. Anderson has been known for maiming some projects, namely Alien Vs. Predator. His Resident Evil films are a rocky road for fans of the game (I think they're fun, don't judge) and he has a few solid genre efforts in the underrated Soldier with Kurt Russell, and Death Race. Any missteps in his lineup can be forgiven, however, on account of Event Horizon, a terrifying journey into outer space, and perhaps further. It plays like Dead Space, Doom and Hellraiser all rolled into one palm sweating nightmare. When a massive, state of the art deep space extraction ship goes missing in the far regions, a rescue vessel called the 'Lewis & Clark' is dispatched investigate and bring the crew home. Captained by Miller (Laurence Fishburne) and presided over by the original ship's designer, Dr. William Weir (Sam Neill). They locate the ship, and board her. From there, they discover that while it has been floating out there, it has visited another dimension, a dimension consisting of the last possible type of energy you want to run into. It preys on them one by one, allowing for some grotesque, shivery death scenes. There's a sequence where they check the ship's video log to find out what happened to the original crew. What they discover there will give you a cold jolt of sickening terror, and is the most well orchestrated scare moment of the film, and possibly the decade. The rest of the crew are played by reliably solid actors, including Joely Richardson, Jack Noseworthy, Richard T. Jones, Sean Pertwee and Jason Isaacs, a standout as J.D., the paranoid Irishman. Sam Neil is eerily calm as Weir, and Fishburne remains stoic as the Captain. Horror movies set in space don't often show, up, and are even less frequently effective, but this one shatters the mould to bring us raw, seething fear in a place where there is no escape, no rescue, and no hiding from the malevolent dark energies working against them."
"utgard14","7","1","1","17 October 2015"," ""F*** this ship!""
","A spaceship called Event Horizon returns after disappearing years before. A rescue ship investigates and finds evil. Evil, I tell you! A good sci-fi horror flick that has improved with age. I like it more now than I did when it was first released. It's a movie that borrows so liberally from everything from The Black Hole and Alien to Hellraiser that it leaves itself open to charges of theft. It also uses a formula that has been done to death -- the motley crew of a ship (space or sea -- doesn't matter) encountering some dangerous creature or force. That formula was never better than in Alien, although its roots go at least as far back as the 1950s sci-fi boom. So with the film's creative bankruptcy, why do I still rate it as high as I do? Basically because it does its job very well. It's an entertaining movie with few artistic pretenses. The cast is good for this kind of movie where there's usually at least one person hamming it up so badly they bring the whole movie down with them. Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill are the standouts but the entire cast is solid. The special effects and sets are not too shabby. It's one of director Paul W.S. Anderson's better movies, not that that's saying a lot. I don't really have any superlatives to throw at Event Horizon, as it's not the best of anything really. Just an enjoyable genre movie that has some forgivable flaws."
"thepigsoftheroundtable","7","1","1","6 October 2015"," A less scary Alien
","Seeing how I love Sci-Fi horror it was only natural that I would come upon this movie. But after checking out some of the reviews I was almost turned away by the shear amount of hate this movie was getting. But a few people did give it 10/10 and glorious praise, for which I don't know why. Event Horizon just wasn't that scary. The acting and cinematography were great but the movie was lacking in the scares department. The reason for this I believe was because of the lack of an antagonist for the majority of the movie. Unlike Alien which creates a dark atmosphere by letting the audience know that there is something out to get the crew Event Horizon didn't have this. For the first hour of the movie I thought they were all just hallucinating until the doctor went crazy and started killing everyone. At that point he just looked like a cheap knock off of they guy from Hellraiser. The movie also felt very rushed at the end, like the director was just trying to finish it up as fast as he could, like he didn't really care about the movie. Another thing that made me dislike the movie was the fact that there was a lot of comedic relief, especially in really intense scenes and that just didn't work well with this movie at all. Just as I was starting to get a little spooked one of the characters would completely ruin the feeling by saying something funny. It just felt out of place and did not sit well in a dark movie like this. <br/><br/>Overall I give Event Horizon a 6/10. I did give it higher than many people because the special effects, acting, and overall idea were great but it was just lacking. The story was convoluted and jumped around, and the movie just felt like I was watching Alien without the alien itself in it. This is the type of movie that should be remade. A great idea for a movie that just wasn't completed to it's full potential."
"imzadi001","3","1","1","2 November 2011"," Okay movie. Disposable crew members.
","Event horizon is a decent film, but it comes with a price. It asks the viewer to essentially suspend disbelief in the face of the idiotic crew of the lewis and clark space vessel, who all seem to concertedly hate the dr. and behave as though they never graduated high school. One would assume that the crew of any advanced space vessel would be less arrogant, more reserved and more capable to deal with the unknown. And for some reason scientific concepts seem to invoke a knee jerk, adolescent reaction out of some of them which causes them to want to beat people up (what the?). Yea, they do not seem to be too big on science, yet they seem to know, paradoxically, how to operate the ship. It is a difficult thing to get past, but once you do, it is a decent film.<br/><br/>What this film excels in is atmosphere. And it has plenty of darkness in it, reminiscent, in some ways, of alien. Laurence fishburne does an adequate job of portraying the captain of the lewis and clark, the vessel which is on a mission to recover the secrets of the event horizon (the part where they find the event horizon actually reminds me of 2010: the year we make contact a little, when they find the discovery wreckage).<br/><br/>The psychological component is the most interesting aspect of this film, but it is also physically believable, which I guess means they got the props and effects portion of the film right. There are contradictions that are difficult to accept though, and unfortunately they have little to do with the actual story and more to do with stupid inconsistencies, such as when justin (I.E 'baby bear') suffers debilitating injuries from exposure to zero gravity for a mere 15 seconds, where he begins to spit up blood etc, but a scene toward the end where captain miller is somehow able to cope with the same exposure for what seems like several minutes without injury.<br/><br/>Okay so, toward the end it becomes apparent why the crew hated dr. Weir, but it's almost as if the story calls upon us hating him before we even know a damned thing about him, such as how attached he is to the event horizon, and even his attachment to the ship seems more of a neurotic condition rather than something to be hated for. Ultimately the film asks us to vicariously dislike dr. Weir through the crew of the lewis and clark, it asks us to admit that these lunk heads know better than we do, but it is difficult to buy and too simplistic a sell. the Dr. himself seems to be the only intellect on board. Everyone else seems to lurch around saying F**k every other word or sitting back with their feet up, chain smoking and acting like throw backs to the 20th century who are disinterested in anything to do with their chosen profession.<br/><br/>With all these flaws in account, the film does still manage to encapsulate you with its psychological component. But you almost find yourself not caring whether or not this crew lives or dies. The only one holding it together is laurence fishburne's character, and he seems to be the only person aboard the ship whose fate you care anything about. I suppose, in a sense there is that general feeling of humanity that encompasses you when you see these people faced with such incredible odds and frightening scenario, but it is hard to maintain with how childish, arrogant and knee jerk the crew members tend to be.<br/><br/>Overall, a watchable, atmospheric film, but could have been done way better than it was. I have seen it twice over the course of the past 2 years, and I do not think I will be revisiting it too much as there are much better films both intellectually and artistically, that have many more layers that one can invest ones time dissecting, and where the characters are not disposable idiots for the most part."

I'm not a particularly squeamish guy, but the level of gore in this movie didn't seem justified. It gets a 4 / 10 from me because of the decent individual acting performances and the relatively high production values (aside from the video compositing).<br/><br/>Check it out if you're really into gore, Sam Neil, or Laurence Fishburne but don't expect much suspense in the way of Alien from this space slasher flick."

","Other than ""Independence Day,"" which I loved for all the wrong reasons, (It's the ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" of the modern era) ""Event Horizon"" has to rank as my guiltiest filmic pleasure. Its plot is rediculous, its dialogue laughable, and I can't count the number of films it ripped off shamelessly, sometimes scene-for-scene. But I love it. There is a simple reason why; I like to be scared, and this film did it. It contains some of the most graphic and powerful horrific imagery I have ever seen; visions of Hell that are truly Hellish, rather than resembling a Far Side comic or a dominatrix's bedroom. It is based on Lovecraft, possibly the most psychological of horror writers, and, like ""In the Mouth of Madness,"" another underrated Lovecraft ripoff (sorry, homage) stars Sam Neil, perhaps best in the world at conveying slow-burning insanity. <br/><br/>Lawrence Fishburne is wonderfully intense, and the photography is excellent. This film also ranks as one of the few times CGI has been used effectively in a film. <br/><br/>It is absolutely awful. I know that. I don't care.<br/><br/>I will not rate this film, because it doesn't deserve it, but I will reccomend it to anyone who likes to be scared"
"mentalcritic","Null","1","1","12 October 2000"," excessive gore? you people are pathetic!
","""The excessive gore was unnecessary"" blah blah blah... well, here's a surprising revelation. This film was toned down in order to get past the MPAA with an R rating, which goes to show what a crock America's film classification system has become. The original conception of the ending, in fact, had the Event Horizon making its jump with all of the new crew still aboard. The intention was to show us a slice of the other dimension and just how awful it is.<br/><br/>Maybe this film appears shockingly violent to Americans, but to people with more sense or who live in countries where the censors emphasise classification over cutting, it's really just standard horror fare. Oh wait a minute... did someone actually mistake this film for science fiction? I would have thought the mere premise would have cleared that one up: spaceship disappears, spaceship comes back like a modern day Marie Celeste. Pretty easy to work out that we're not taking this trip out into space to be awed by special effects shots. We're doing it because we want to be revolted by the darker side of human nature.<br/><br/>Having said that, gore is what makes a horror film watchable in spite of a bad script and bad acting. However, Event Horizon is not hobbled by either of those things. The mostly British cast realised that they were mostly props for bad things to happen to, and it shows in the way they act out their roles. It makes a nice contrast with American acting, where they seem to expect at least a thousand lines of clever dialogue.<br/><br/>My only serious complaints about this film are that it isn't long enough to have a story which makes you care about anyone besides Fishburne and Neill, and that it isn't out on DVD here. Oh, and don't try to watch this film on VHS. The low-level noise in the dark areas of the picture and the loss of about 33% of the picture severely cuts down the film's impact. Part of the attraction at the cinema was the wide shots out in space. That and all the blood. Blood. Blood. Blood. Blood."
"kosmasp","1","5","12","23 April 2006"," Bad, bad, bad ... or in one word: Bad!
","Now for this ""special"" movie, that I watched theatrically, I will specify in various paragraphs, what I didn't like about the movie. When I went to watch the movie, I didn't thought it would be a classic. But boy if I knew how bad it was/is I wouldn't bothered to go in at all.<br/><br/>Let's start from the actors. And if I didn't knew the actors I'd be wondering where they had found those people (maybe they dragged someone in from the street?). But there is an explanation: Sam Neill & Co are humans too and they need the money. To pay bills and stuff. But even they must be ashamed of this. And they didn't even bother to act at all! Not that it would have elevated this movie to much better ranking place, but it might have been a little more pleasant to watch. Or at least they could have tried to have while shooting the movie, but even that wasn't possible (it seems that way if you watch the movie).<br/><br/>But the actors are not the ones responsible for this mess. First of all you have to ask yourself if the scriptwriter had anything in mind except ""a cool idea""! Because the outline did sound quite good. But when you have so much plot holes in a movie ... you just wish it is over. For the movie and the characters! You just don't care for people who act irrational and only just about compete who'll say the worst line in the movie. Irrational ""acting"" is something that you are used to in horror movies (most of the thrill will happen, just because of that behavior), but what happens here is just about every bad cliché thrown in. And mixed together, they don't taste any good, and they also smell bad too! But a bad script can be helped by a good director. If there was one here at hand ... If if if ... but there was none. Quite the contrary, this one (director was meant) isn't good, but he's bad! So he let all of the above happen and more. When people have a bad thing happening and then just jump out the next moment as if nothing happened, you're not only confused, but more than a bit angry. Mass delusion anyone? It must've been something in the tea or coffee!<br/><br/>Talking about something, like you don't believe it exists, just to be afraid of the same thing that doesn't ""exist"" the next second ... at least that's what the script lines were that came out the actors mouth ... (you didn't get it? Neither did I while watching the movie!) It's just so f**'d up ... I get mad thinking about it ... The movie touched a nerve. And one things for sure, if I ever do something bad again, something real bad, I shall be punished with watching this movie along ""Kinetta"" ... But if you're a masochist, you can do that in your free time too ... I warned you! But if you don't want to waste your time, just don't watch this ""classic""! (and yes I knew that some people will be offended by this, those same people who think this movie is good. Can't believe it, but some people just seem to enjoy the formula bad acting/bad director/bad script ... knock yourself out!)"

","I put very little faith into this film. I heard from a few friends that this was a terrifying movie . With that said, these same friends preferred the TCM remake over the original, gritty redneck docu-style craze-fest that was the original 1974 version, and would coincide visceral shock to 'quality scares'. While I respect everyone's views on film due to the subjectivity of the horror genre, I cannot understand why anyone would have any respect for this movie at all.<br/><br/>Where do I start? Here we have a Director, Paul WS Anderson, which from his interviews seems like a really cool guy, takes influence from first-person video games like Doom and RPG's like Starcraft. THAT was his visual inspiration. Seriously? Formatting the style of a set from a video game? As a kid, I loved the Mortal Kombat movie, but I was 6 years old. I just wanted to see karate chopping and blades shooting out of Scorpio's hand. With Event Horizon, we get the same tongue-in-cheek style of Mortal Kombat, except the source material is a lot more unsettling: a mad-scientist constructed portal that has the power to bring you to other dimensions, one of which is the pits of hell. SUCH A COOL CONCEPT, RIGHT? Well, what we get is a oozing-with-cheese action blockbuster with paper-thin characters with dialogue that is more suitable for interludes on Playstation game. <br/><br/>The gore is copy+pasted from the preceding and much, much better Hellraiser I and II, and the CGI is on par with the dreadful Spawn which came out that same year. <br/><br/>I hate rating movies a 1 because I think it's distasteful and many people that rate 1's are conjectural as means to not get the movie they were hoping for. I hated There Will Be Blood in the theater, but loved it upon my second viewing. I thought The Ring was ""ok"" when I first saw it, but really loved it upon my second viewing when I was alone on a rainy day. This film, however, I feel deserves a 1. I saw this m3 months ago and was p%ssed off at what I had to sit through. I thought maybe there was something that I had missed. Watched it again; hated it even more! *eek*.. The disingenuous actors/dialogues/stereotypes, the settings, lighting, absurd editing, vapidity of tone made me feel like I really wasted my time.<br/><br/>I'm not an Anderson 'hater', because I appreciated the Resident Evil film. <br/><br/>With that said, I'll just re-watch Aliens or Cube when I need my 'fix' for some scifi horror."

They pause during dramatic moments, they are sometimes seemingly unfazed by the chaos around them. The choppy editing, pointless Dutch camera angles and crash zooms, and the constant, cliché score take a lot of the tension out of the film, and each jumpscare is incredibly predictable and ineffective. Unlike its supposed influences, it does not create a sense of tension and dread through silence, but rather only uses silence for a few seconds before each jumpscare.

","I remember being impressed with this film when I first saw it way back in the late 1990's. It's one of those that, once you've seen it, it keeps coming back to you. I have been meaning to watch it again for some time now and so I though now being as good time as any I popped it in the DVD player, turned the sound up and let her rip! I wasn't disappointed; it's every bit as good as I remember, right down to the pumping 'Prodigy' track that runs over the closing credits. I will give you my take on it after this very brief summary.<br/><br/>The experimental spaceship, The Event Horizon, has been missing for seven years after it left the solar system bound for Proxima Centuri. After its beacon is detected in the vicinity of Neptune, a rescue mission is launched. A specialist crew is sent out along with Dr. William Weir, the man who designed the ship. The crew consists of; Captain Miller, Peters, the Med Tech, Lt. Starck, Cooper, Justin, D.J. and Smith. Dr. Weir is haunted with memories of his dead wife, who had recently committed suicide. None of them are prepared for what they find when they reach the, now deserted, Event Horizon. The experimental drive had taken it to places beyond understanding and it hadn't come back alone. I will leave it there or the Spoiler Police will be signing me up for another trip.<br/><br/>A very well made film with some really excellent effects. Great performances all round; everyone did a very professional job and made the story believable. So, special praise goes to; Laurence Fishburne as Captain Miller, Sam Neill as Dr. William Weir, Kathleen Quinlan as Peters and Joely Richardson as Lt. Starck. Honourable mentions go to; Richard T. Jones as Cooper, Jack Noseworthy as Justin, Jason Isaacs (hello to him) as D.J. and Sean Pertwee as Smith.<br/><br/>I must admit I really like this film, how it's got such a low rating on Rotten Tomatoes I will never know! Yes, the plot is a little complicated but I did find it truly scary and there a very few films I can say that about these days. To me I think it's probably the best space horror since the Alien films and it's certainly better than Alien 4! I haven't read what the professional critics have to say on it, but I will stick to my guns and say it's a very underrated Sci-Fi Horror that deserves better recognition Recommended.<br/><br/>My Score: 7.7/10.<br/><br/>IMDb Score: 6.4/10 (based on 54,832 votes at the time of going to press).<br/><br/>Rotten Tomatoes Score: 23/100 (based on 35 reviews (No Consensus) counted at the time of going to press)."

However, none of them were so disturbing, that they made me literally leave the theater. Forget covering your eyes through a scary part, I felt the need to leave. The part that disturbed me so much was the scene where the designer of the ship was in a crucifix (upside down maybe?). As a Christian, this was too real for me and it affected me to my core. Don't worry, I did come back to finish the movie. But to this day, I have yet to see be a movie that moved me (literally) as much as this one.<br/><br/>Many of these reviews hit the nail on the head. It isn't that gory scary, although, eyes being ripped out and exploding blood vessels due to open skin exposure to outer space, were kind of cool. And it wasn't shock scary (the flashbacks and screen flashes of the Dr.'s wife shown with missing eyes and only having dark voids for eyes, were pretty spooky). The thing that made this movie memorable for me, enough to label it the scariest movie I've ever seen, was the fact that it encompassed and masterfully portrayed something that all (for the most part) of us fear, straight down to the core of our souls. Hell. The plot implies that a piece of hell had been brought back with this ship. This is very believable because it, in theory may be science fiction. We don't know what's in the middle of a black hole, therefore, one could assume that it is conceivable that a hell like existence is in the middle of a black hole. And that is the real factor that completely mind bucked me.<br/><br/>Call me what you want, but I won't even watch it again. It is a must see, even if it's only once..."

","Thanks to the new technology, i've been able to ""get"" most of the movies I knew from when I was a kid, i'm talking about the '80 and '90. Event Horizon is one of them. This movie is... beyond. This movie is mentally stimulating, it's intelligent. Yes, I'm sure the science fans will be very upset with this movie (then again, you either like science, or you like science fiction, and this movie is a FICTION, and a MOVIE, so don't take it too seriously) but c'mon, it's also, how can I say, educative. A ship, a spaceship, that went far, so far to reach... to reach the hell, or a crazy dimension in which your fear becomes reality, dead comes back to life, and people go nuts. If you want my personal opinion, the video game Dead Space is basically the port of the movie Event Horizon."

","Event Horizon is one of the best horror films ever made, partly because it is so scary and intelligent. The acting is fantastic, and Event Horizon is full of suspense that will definitely have you on the edge of your seat. The atmospheric setting for Event Horizon is done perfectly, and makes the film one of the most scariest films today. Event Horizon is also incredibly entertaining and never gets boring once throughout the whole film. The movie is made in a very clever way that has everything that a horror film needs to be good. One of the things that makes Event Horizon such a good film is the way in which it is so classic. The suspense scenes in the film are done perfectly and scarily and in a classic way that would make Hitchcock proud. I really do not have anything to criticize about Event Horizon, because everything in the film is done perfectly. And Event Horizon is actually scary, with edge of your seat horror that will haunt you for the rest of your life. Event Horizon is a entertaining, suspenseful and very intelligent and imaginative film that is guaranteed not to disappoint."

","OK so first of all, this movie has the effect of keeping you glued to your chair while your watching. But if we look at it from a critical perspective we can see that it isn't that great.<br/><br/>The films tries too accomplish several things, but in the end it fails. It tries to be both subtle and direct, but it ends up as being too direct and too over-the-top (too much unnecessary gore). It somehow tries to merge religious and scientific ideas, but it does not finish the job. The ideas presented are too blunt, too rough to fully understand and swallow. Too much Clive Barker and too little Lovecraft, if you know what i mean.<br/><br/>So what is the result? A have baked film, with a lot of gore, a couple of scary moments, a wide range of scientific and religious ideas (taken from horror writers) that don't mix very well, which starts out excellent but ends up as being over-the-top, and concluded with a weird ending.<br/><br/>It's not a bad film, it will entertain, but it feels like it could have been so much more."

","Event Horizon, the title of the movie, and the title of the fictitious spaceship in the movie that is capable of bending both space and time. And a crew of military spaceship operators are hired to track down the ship after it mysteriously resurfaces in deep space after being lost for the last seven years. Where has this time bending ship been the last seven years? Such a promising and intriguing premise is brutally ruined with over the top gore and violence. What could have been a thinking person's science-fiction mystery or even 'space detective' style movie is quickly reduced do a brain dead slasher gore fest complete with enough blood and mayhem to nearly erase the solid 45 minutes of brilliant writing, directing, and acting that preceded it.<br/><br/>Eventually it is revealed that the ship most likely jumped forward in time seven years, instantly appearing at the current time of the movie. If the writers had simply left the movie at that I would have rated this a 10. But instead the ship is somehow magically transported to hell and back...and thus begins the gratuitous and ridiculous levels of violence.<br/><br/>Sadly the intent of the movie producers and directors was to not only have the level of gore in the released version of the movie, but an even higher level of gore that had to be toned down to achieve an R rating.<br/><br/>This is sad, because violence and gore, while sometimes are great in films, are not worthy substitutes for quality writing and storytelling. Violence with very little plot attached can basically summarize the last 45 minutes of an otherwise perfect film. A 'less is more' approach would have better sufficed, not the full-on head-first blood orgy that happens instead."

It has been a long time since I've seen a movie that actually made me cover my eyes. The fact that they keep showing the same images didn't help! The movie was hard to follow at times. But it's not especially the type of movie that I wanted to rewind and go back to certain scenes just to make sense of the current scene. I guess I just didn't expect it to end up the way it did. You always find the alien and kill it, and everything's better, or at least until he sequel comes out. :) I think the reason it creeps me out is because what they find is not an alien or something they could kill, like in most horror movies you watch, but evil itself, incarnated in the characters fears - creepy stuff.

","A movie with mixed feeling for the premise, but still great to watch. Many argue that ""Event Horizon"" is one of the scariest sci-fi movies ever made, while others say it's just a rip off of other great space movies. It's always a gamble when the plot has been done before, but ""Even Horizon"" stands out as an original of it's kind, which could be either good or bad. I did find ""Event Horizon"" to be quite a thrill. The idea that no one can hear you in space is haunting, and that the rescue crew is millions of miles away form civilization. The special effects were done well and are even up to today's standards. Both Sam Neill and Laurence Fishburne give good performances, as well as the rest of the cast. The crew is a tough, marine style bunch, but their morale quickly dies as they soon fall apart upon landing on the Event Horizon.<br/><br/>When the rescue crew finally boards the Event Horizon, they learn that the crew that once inhabited the ship is gone, but a strange presence returned with the ship after it's long disappearance. Creepy sound effects and haunting echoes may be enough to scare most viewers, as this movie achieves it's goal as being a good horror film. The plot however, remains flimsy. There are plenty of holes in the script, and several questions are unanswered regarding some the events that occur. And many other things go completely unexplained.<br/><br/>""Event Horizon"" earned a reputation as an extremely gory film. There are several disturbing scenes, such as a spike impaling accompanied by more blood than I have ever seen in a movie before. There are also some cool fire effects to add to the intensity. An interesting point is the way the alien like creatures toy with the human rescue team. They cause them to hallucinate and visit their worst and most frightening memories of their past, that cause them to break down on the brink of insanity. And you get to see it all as the crew imagines it. Often images of dead loved ones appear out of nowhere and it scares the hell out of some of the crew members. Frightening, but also entertaining."

Once they get there, they find said ship, but no crew, and, oh by the way, the gates to Hell.  Huh? Did we miss something here, like CONTINUITY??  The first half of the film is okay, but really falls apart in the second half.  Nothing makes much sense; there's lots of gore but not much reason for it, and one very gratuitous scene wherein a crewmember, sensing danger (no moss on this one!) rockets to the rescue, shouting: ""Here I come, (insert a really naughty word here)!!""  Apparently, if this film is any guide, in the future, spaceships will be commanded by Americans and crewed by the British; most of these people sound as if they were yanked off the streets of Liverpool.  The second half of the film looks very much like it was inspired by ""Hellraiser"", but with a ""we've seen it before"" tedium to it. According to post-release hype, a rotating passageway in the ""Event Horizon"" ship was deliberately designed to look like the interior of a meat grinder, and in this it thoroughly succeeds, but to what end?  Not only doesn't it make the least bit of sense, it's extremely disorienting just to look at, to say nothing of actually having to walk through.  Why?  No astronaut would willingly sign on to a ship that looked like this.  The pity is that both Fishburne and Neil are better-than-average actors who have made some terrible decisions of late.  How many new driveways do you guys really need? In short, folks, if you really want lots of gore and/or weirdness, stay with ""Hellraiser"" or ""I Come in Peace"", and send this loser off to the cornfield."

","""Event Horizon"" is one of the worst films that I have ever seen.  Very rarely has so much talent and money been squandered on such an ugly mess of a movie.  The film deals with an outer space crew who is trying to retrieve a mysterious ship which is trapped deep in the outer limits.  The original crew have all been killed and now this crew must find out why.  Why?  Why? Why?  That seems to be the key question of this film.  The screenplay is all over the universe.  It adds elements from films like ""The Exorcist"", ""Aliens"", ""The Abyss"", ""Apollo 13"", ""Jaws"", and just about every other film ever produced.  If one idea had been used throughout, then the film would have been admirable and watchable if nothing else.  However the references to the aforementioned films make ""Event Horizon"" a movie that wants desperately to be good, but just does not have the goods to make that dream a reality.

I made sure to record it onto VCR because I am a huge fan of horror and science fiction films so this seemed like the perfect blend. I was NOT disappointed.<br/><br/>A lot of people so far have either: a) Made bad reviews about the film usually unjustified. or b) Spent the whole review slagging others off and not actually reviewing the film.<br/><br/>Anyway, onto the film. The acting both from Fishburne and Neill is second to none and is without a doubt one of the best performances I have ever seen either of them deliver. Secondly, the plot, although not much, has originality. The film is more psychadelic than physical horror but it really can get you thinking.<br/><br/>For horror fans this is a MUST. one of THE best films of the 1990's and I would recommend that everybody should check it out at some stage in their lives.

It started as quite interesting Sci-Fi with some aspects of space travel nicely taken into account. Then it just went down the drain. If you are going to have a Sci-Fi movie you are going to have to present believable technology and advancements (the complete explanation how everything works is not required). In my opinion the wormhole to hell as a concept doesn't work at all. At least not if the movie was supposed to be anywhere near Sci-Fi. In Doom 3 the concept worked just because the original games were made with tongue in cheek attitude.

","There are two basic types of horror films--suspense-based and gore-based. Since I can't stand the former, it won't be a surprise that I greatly disliked this movie.

I doubt there was a technical adviser within 10 light-years of either writing or production. With no plot and no character development (and some idiotic characters, to boot!), you are left roughly with an Olympic-pool sized bloodbath to make up for the rest. <br/><br/>There were some reviewers who mentioned Hellraiser as a possible reference type in their comments, and I would concur. Some of the special effects grotesqueries were good, and that is why I gave a rating of 2 rather than 1. If hack-fest movies are your thing, have at it.

S. Anderson was offered to direct X-MEN, but he declined that offer in order to do ""Event Horizon""- lucky for us! For me,the film was a groundbreaking confluence of space science, physics, science fiction, horror, and spirituality/religion- ""good versus evil"".<br/><br/>The film was originally 130 minutes in length, but the studio forced Anderson to cut it down to 96 minutes- something Anderson regrets to this day. The studio and Test audience runs of the 130 minute version proved too unnerving and disturbing as this version was much more graphic than the released version.<br/><br/>The film has developed somewhat of a cult status amongst its fans. Meanwhile, Anderson had promised to release a ""Director's Cut"" to include the 34 minutes worth of footage the studios forced him to cut; however, that footage was lost and only remains in lower quality video tape. Hence, no Director's Cut will ever be likely.<br/><br/>Despite the lost footage and Anderson having his Post-Production time cut from 6 to 4 weeks, the released version is very, very good. The movie is TRULY CREEPY; especially because of the story: It is seemingly quite plausible and,thus all the more frightening. I first experienced this film on DVD up-scaled at 1080i at home on my 46"" home theater system, alone, in the dark, and very late at night. This movie continuously and reliably sent chills up and down my spine- thanks Anderson! If a Director's Cut had ever been released I can only imagine how delightfully unnerving and disturbing it would have been!<br/><br/>Just watched it on Blu-Ray...Awesome... Despite its 1997 release, on Blu-Ray the improved detail, color, and sound improvements make it look so good that it seems it could have been made recently!

","Event horizon is best described as the horror movie that could<br/><br/>have been so much more. With its cast, director of photography<br/><br/>and even art department. <br/><br/>The films story is basically deep space rescue of a lost<br/><br/>experimental ship. The script is excellent with great comments<br/><br/>and psychological impacting rhetoric. But the film looses in its<br/><br/>passing and similarity with many other films of the genre and other<br/><br/>horror movies.<br/><br/>The main similarities I see with this film is the Shinning. A living<br/><br/>ship that just enjoys twisting it inhabitants for the pleasure of it.<br/><br/>The idea of a living entity that resides in an inanimate object is<br/><br/>often seen but when visuals are clearly similar, it is a shame: the<br/><br/>visions of the little child running around, the whispers in the dark<br/><br/>and even the elevator with gallons of blood. Sam Neill's character,<br/><br/>a protagonist, even descends into insanity and becomes the<br/><br/>antagonist like Jack Nicholson by seeing twisted imagery and<br/><br/>flashbacks.<br/><br/>Another problem are its camera shots. Most of them remind you of<br/><br/>AlienÂ…Why you ask. Adrian Biddle a great cinematographer and one of my personal<br/><br/>favorites. But the director seems to ask him to place the camera in<br/><br/>the same positions as James Cameron had asked him for Aliens.<br/><br/>Even the `Gigeresque' ship make the movie look too much like it<br/><br/>belongs to the Alien SAGA.<br/><br/>Paul Anderson, the director of Mortal Kombat I and II, Soldier and<br/><br/>the upcoming Resident Evil, seemed more preoccupied with<br/><br/>shocking rather than shocking and scaring at the same time. He<br/><br/>uses extreme gore to try and scare the audience but instead it just<br/><br/>makes it look silly or disgusting rather than stylish. The script was<br/><br/>strong enough to scare without the gore. David Fincher proves with<br/><br/>Se7en that awful gore can be off screen and psychologically<br/><br/>disturb you more than actually seeing the atrocities.<br/><br/>I believe I read the best critique of the film in Toronto's Now<br/><br/>magazine, during the films run at the theatre. `The actors like<br/><br/>Fishburne, Quinlan and Neill all signed to make a different movie<br/><br/>that what was made.'

","This wasn't a terrible film as far as movies go. I love SciFi and I don't mind SciFi horror but this movie just was not that great. <br/><br/>The plot is that a crew is sent off to check out a ship which magically came back from who knows where. Hilarity ensues. <br/><br/>As it turns out the ship is, for lack of a better word, haunted. The old crew is dead and now the ship wants a new crew which it is finding in the people sent to investigate. The CG might have been decent at the time but come off as cheesy. There is a distinctive claymation scene, or possibly terrible CG scene, which had me cracking up. <br/><br/>There is gore. Lots and lots of gore. The creepiest parts don't show the ultra violence which is more or less a blessing since that sort of thing just creeps me out and is more or less unnecessary. The gore is not too memorable as far as it goes but a few scenes should have you at least surprised that they managed to use that much ketchup. <br/><br/>--So here is where it falls flat and this is the spoilers section.-- Everything scary happens in extremely predictable ways. When someone goes off alone (despite being on a haunted ghost ship with literally the entire old crew dead by murdering themselves) that is when it gets spooky, every single time. It is so formulaic as to be funny. ""Oh, there goes another character running off after something."" and BAM... the ship essentially kills or terrifies the crew member AGAIN. <br/><br/>My favorite line was ""What HAPPENED to your EYES!?"" ""Where we're going, you won't need eyes to see."" and apparently they were going to ""hell"" which you never actually saw. Funny but not all that scary. By the time the 3rd crew member was running off alone after having 2 other dead crew members I started to pretend that they were really going out to Michaels to pick up some crafts to make the ship happy. As it turns out the ship became corrupted on the trip to ""hell"". There wasn't even an AI to corrupt, it was just the physical ship that was corrupted. I didn't know that was even possible, even in SciFi but it is or was and the ship is now trying to murder everyone on board but somehow failing miserably. <br/><br/>Actually this was something I didn't understand. If the ship was actually sentient and wanted to murder the whole crew just open an airlock. If the ship wasn't sentient and just horrible things continued to happen to the crew, how come there bodies are not impaled on all of the wonderfully placed locations... you know... by accident? It seemed like the ship wanted to just punish the crew without killing them by killing them in new and profound ways. <br/><br/>By the time the ultra scary part happens where they start flashing creepy or scary things at you rapidly I lost all interest in the movie. I suppose that the flashing of creepy things SHOULD scare people but by that point, you have already seen a few scenes from ""Silence of the Lambs"" so the rapid maggot scenes really fell flat. <br/><br/>I will give it props for having a woman and a Black man survive at the end. That was honestly most unexpected since I sat back waiting for each person to be knocked off in turn and really just expected the whole new crew to die screaming. <br/><br/>If you find this scary, then you are not use to SciFi in this particular genre or you are shocked by formulaic horror. The dialogue is terrible. The gore is semi-realistic in parts but not really when it counted. I still wonder where all that blood came from which flooded the bit of the ship at the end. Also... see ""The Shining"" for that particular scene. It just felt like it was ripping off other GREAT movies and left me waiting for it to just end."

","This movie was dark and scary as ""heck"" while not being just plain gory (while I will state that there are definitely several scenes which are quite graphic, I think they didn't go over the top) The reason it's among my personal favorites is the way they managed to scare you. The scenes that make you jump aren't cheap scare tactics, (ok SOME are) but most play into the storyline and enhance the overall darkness of the film. They managed to give the film a nice sci-fi or futuristic look without being cheesy, and while highly unlikely, the concept and technology behind the film I personally find to be plausible which also puts it higher up on my list. The plot was explained well and flowed nicely from beginning to end. The movie was able to wrap up the story while also leaving the ""classic"" scary movie close of ""could there be more""? Definitely best with a decent surround sound system and a darkened room! A+ in my book!"
"Michael_Elliott","Null","2","4","11 March 2013"," Dark and Rather Brave Film
","Event Horizon (1997) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Dark and sometimes disturbing mix of sci-fi and horror about the spaceship Event Horizon, which went missing shortly after its mission. Seven years later it reemerges so a rescue crew goes after it trying to figure out where it's been the entire time. I saw EVENT HORIZON when it was first released and really couldn't understand why it gained so many negative reviews. There's no question that the film contains some flaws but it's also a rather ambitious film that relies just as much on its story than just the special effects. I thought director Paul Anderson did a fantastic job early on really making the viewer feel uneasy. There's a brief line where a crew member talks about how far they are from safety and this scene perfectly builds up a rather dark tension because you realize that these people really are on their own with no one to help them. The entire atmosphere of the film is incredibly dark and while I'm not going to give anything away, what the story attempts to do with where the ship has gone was rather unique and I think that for the most part it works. Now, if you've ever heard of this film then you know about the various issues it ran into during the test screenings. There's been talk of a director's cut, which I think might help out many of the flaws. The story takes us to a rather dark direction but it just seems as if something is missing. There are a few questions that need to be answered and there are a few things that don't make much sense but perhaps these were forced to be left on the cutting room floor. If so, hopefully we can see the complete version at some point. Another thing that works here are the extremely strong performances with Laurence Fishburne, Sam Neill, Kathleen Quinlan and Joely Richardson delivering great work. The special effects are also another major plus including an incredibly beautiful opening sequence as well as the effects really making you feel as if you're in space the entire time. Some have been critical of some of the graphic and bloody violence but I thought it actually played well into the story and didn't take away from anything. As it stands, EVENT HORIZON is a rather brave but flawed film but hopefully a complete version will give us a better look at what it was really trying to do."
"RJGodin2","3","2","4","31 July 2009"," confused rehash of Solaris ideas
","Event Horizon is a horror exploitation of the concepts presented in Solaris. It takes horror cues from Alien and Don't Look Now and mashes them with Solaris and 2001 to make an ultimately unsatisfying film.<br/><br/>It takes off from some real physics concepts (e.g. folding space) which were also already used in Dune and then amps up the gore. Many aspects of the story don't get fully developed and are left hanging.<br/><br/>The set is elaborate and the computer effects extensive. It shows that much more time, money and effort were put into the stage craft than the story and character. Never a good ratio for movie making. It makes you wonder what the original script might have looked like.<br/><br/>A rather derivative, disappointment."
"bigfanofthebob42","7","2","4","21 June 2006"," If Satan was making me speak Latin, I'd rip out my eyes, too.
","Event Horizon has the two distinctions of being the only Paul WS Anderson movie that does not feel like it was shat out by a monkey with ADD and smeared onto celluloid, and off being one of the few movies that have genuinely traumatized me. Today, Event Horizon doesn't really freak me out anymore, but it's still an underrated freakout for anyone who hasn't seen it that can accept the weak script and lackluster third act.<br/><br/>So basically it's about this spaceship that gets possessed by evil and terrorizes people by making them go crazy or showing them flashes of their friends screaming and being mutilated in some freaky dimension of chaos or something. The flash parts are really freaky, and along with the scene where the ship's log suddenly starts playing by itself without static over what happened after evil took over--it looks like the kind of porn the dark lord Sauron watches, but with tighter editing. By just flashing crazy gory stuff at you, it makes you think you've seen things that are worse than what you have, since most of it consists of people screaming and bloody or nude corpses impaled through the face hanging around covered in maggots. (on second thought, that is freaky) But it tricks you into thinking you're seeing people being graphically dissected and people eating themselves and gay people getting married.<br/><br/>A lot of people upon release found it to be really derivative of Alien, among other things, but I don't think it's derivative, because it feels like it's taking place somewhere else in the same universe, which is also how it gets away with having everyone smoke 50 years into the future.<br/><br/>The script is lame. ""I'm now walking. I'm now entering the medical bay. I'm now picking my nose."" a lot of the dialogue can be like that. Or there's the other, non-Morpheus black guy, who seems to be attempting to be the best Funny, But Clumsy Negro stereotype in the history of the cinema, and unfortunately he fails because it takes you out of the movie whenever he appears. They might as well have had Paul WS Anderson play the part in blackface. Also, there's a lot of talk about ""hell"" and ""a dimension of pure chaos"", and it all sounds a little silly no matter how freakishly disturbing the visions of it are.<br/><br/>The last half hour houses the biggest shocks, for me, but the movie sort of falls apart into a series of action sequences before the big explosion. You know, the kind that happens in any sci-fi horror movie. It's also unfortunate that they turned the Jurassic Park 1 and 3 guy into the outright villain--it's less scary when you can see the bad guy, particularly if he looks like a more lame, naked version of Pinhead from the Hellraiser movies, but with no pins, so he's really just Head, and that's not a cool name for anybody. The whole last half hour reeks of studio impatience and interference. There was originally another half hour that was cut out, and probably contained a lot of stuff that should have been in the movie, but the studio was a jerk and made them cut a lot of the gore, or the ""character"" and ""story development"", you know, things that aren't necessary to Hollywood studios. It's a shame, because with that footage, Event Horizon might have been an actually good movie, and a jewel amidst the chunks of corn in the turd of Paul WS Anderson's filmography.<br/><br/>If Anderson made it today, it would be scored entirely with Marilyn Manson, the action scenes would be hyper-edited and incomprehensible, the characters wouldn't even have personalities, and it would end with Morpheus making friends with the evil force so that together they can battle the alien zombies that Anderson felt were necessary to add to make the movie cooler. And it ends with Morpheus and the Weir-beast walking off into the sunset, holding hands."

"mjbridges82","5","2","4","22 April 2005"," Sadly eviscerated.
","'Have you ever seen acting in zero gravity?' I have, it's not pretty. Event Horizon was directed Paul Anderson, or Paul W.S. Anderson as he now calls himself in an attempt to avoid being confused with indie auteur Paul Thomas Anderson, though apparently he's now confused with indie auteur Wes Anderson. Dyslexia is apparently more prevalent than I had previously imagined. I doubt the Anderson in question here has ever been accused of being an auteur. Second only to the frankly inexcusably inept Ewe Boll in destroying the reputation of video game to movie adaptations, and maybe those responsible for Super Mario Bros., Anderson here deals with a debut script from Philip Eisner.<br/><br/>Establishing itself firmly in a Sci-Fi mould, Event Horizon kicks off with a brief captioned run down of the past 50 or so years of space travel. It's the year 2047, humans are now floating around far flung regions of deep space and happily robbing Mars of her natural resources. We learn that an experimental ship, called the Event Horizon, disappeared on her maiden voyage some seven years previously. Now that a transmission has been picked up from her, it's the dubious honour of a small team lead by Captain Miller (Laurence Fishburne) along with the mastermind behind the technology of the ship, Dr. Weir (Sam Neill), to launch a salvage and rescue mission. The rescue crew is typically artificially diverse in personality, gender, and race in order to drum up some banter and accentuate conflict and distrust when the inevitable tough gets going. After the customary pseudo-science babble to explain how the ship works, it makes black holes and travels through them, the unwilling would be rescuers find and board the stricken vessel. It quickly becomes apparent that where ever the Gothic-nouveau ship has been all this time, it hasn't exactly had a positive affect. The crew quickly start experiencing horrific personal visions that seem far too tangible to be mere hallucinations, could it be that the ship is alive and trying to kill them? Wearing it's influences on it's sleeve, Event Horizon's opening scenes manage to ape both the Nostromo introduction from Alien and the external space station shots from 2001. Despite drawing from these rich sources, it's apparent in the brevity and showiness of the execution that these scenes are there simply 'because they can'. Though clearly the art direction and production design people have done their stuff admirably, and cinematographer Adrian Biddle, a veteran of both Alien and Aliens productions, is both comfortable and highly competent in his task, their efforts are sorely dampened by frenetic cuts. Just as you're trying to absorb some of the neo-Gothic dread, Anderson pulls you away in favour of a cheap fright or some inane expository dialogue. Though Sci-Fi in it's trappings, Event Horizon is clearly a horror film, and it's in this endeavour that it finds the most success. Overtly owing much to Clive Barker's Hellraiser vision, Anderson manages to conjure some memorably disturbing scenes. The notion that ship actually travelled to some other hellish dimension, or perhaps Hell itself becomes more compelling with each subsequent gory set piece. Indeed it seems Anderson was slightly too successful in this department. As any viewer will notice, the final third of the film suffers badly from confused editing. Characters go unaccounted for extended periods with no explanation, the action flits around in a chaotic fashion, what the hell is going on? The charitable might offer that it's an intentional device to mirror the chaotic, disorientating events the crew are suffering. The sensible know that, like many of the inhabitants of Event Horizon the ship, Event Horizon the movie has been eviscerated. Literally, the guts have been ripped out of this movie. It's rumoured that around 20 minutes of horror excess had to be excised from the film in order to secure the financially desirable 'R' rating for US audiences. Almost ironic considering Anderson's previous project, Mortal Kombat had the curious distinction of being significantly less violent than the video game that spawned it in order to be compatible with it's youthful target audience.<br/><br/>It's a shame the strongest material, both in content and ostensibly quality, have been left out. It would likely have helped propel the film above it's critical and box office also-ran status, and helped distract from some of the films evident short comings. Though the leads Fishburne and Neill grind out characteristically workman like performances, most of the supports visibly flounder with the hackneyed dialogue and paper thin characterisation. It's clear Event Horizon has too many shortcomings to ever have reached the heights of it's influences, but it could have been a whole lot better. I for one would certainly welcome the arrival of the rumoured 'Director's Cut' style DVD. Perhaps this film still has more to offer. As it stands presently, Event Horizon is certainly worth a look for anyone looking for some stylish scares, so long as you don't try and follow it too closely."

Watching this movie required hard work on my part, the only reason I saw it through to the end was just incase there was a possibility it improved at some point.

The movie plunges you deeper and deeper into madness. Some scenes are pretty graphical, but the horror of this film relies mainly of the cruelty of the reality presented to you. There's a disturbing logic to this film and unlike other movies of this type, it doesn't leave any questions unanswered. To me, a movie that manages to affect its audience is a movie that succeeds. In this case I was literally shocked, which is good for a sci-fi/horror gig. The actors deliver great performances and the cinematography is also of great quality.

","A movie that starts out as a run-of-the-mill sci-fi creeper in the vain of Alien, this soon proves itself to be the equal of that film in terms of building and maintaining tension. The cast works excellently together, using, in a similar manner to Alien, a mixture of US movie actors and British TV actors to provide both grit and bravado (apologies for the stereotyping). While it's immediately noticable that all Sean Pertwee ever does is swear (can you find a line where he doesn't?) most of the other characters manage to maintain the tension through their dialogue while avoiding tacky horror cliches or glossing over them with enough dark cinematography and soundtrack that the cheapness of the dialogue is lost in the overwhelming atmosphere of tension. <br/><br/>If you're wondering why I've used the word ""tension"" so much in the above paragraph, it's because that is the whole raison d'etre of this movie. It aims to create tension and successfully does so. It is also quite genuinely disturbing at times, through the contrast of suspense techniques such as empty corridors and clattering noises, with outright gore (the guy suspended above the operating table actually made me go ""eeeurrrgh"" which no film has in quite a while). I'm suspicious that the people claiming ""this didn't scare me"" are attempting to give themselses a cinematic ego-boost.<br/><br/>As for the bad points; the dialogue isn't wonderful throughout (phrases like ""the darkness inside me"" sound a bit comic-book). Sam Neill is exceptionally boring in everything he's ever been in, including this - please, film producers, stop casting this man!

","Potential spoiler included.  Event Horizon at the time it was released was completely marketed for the wrong audience.  All of the previews and trailers portrayed it as Sci-fi/action but in fact it is one of the most disturbing horror films I've ever seen.  I was completely taken by surprise. There are predictable horror elements and a few surprises and lots of blood and gore.  There are truly some horrific images in this film.

Fishburne as the captain is a really cool character.  We can really identify with Smith.  In this film, unlike so many of it's genre siblings and cousins the black characters (there are 2) are not the first to die.<br/><br/>The production design is fantastic and disturbing in reflecting the dichotomy between heaven and hell.  Buried in the film, God and Heaven are represented by all that we can see so thus the absence of all evidence as in a black hole represents Hell.  Simply put the production design is as disturbing as it is impressive.  There is little to no comfort to be had in this story.

"jhclues","3","2","4","15 September 2000"," Not Much On The ""Horizon""
","**Possible Spoilers**		In an era that has given us such films as `The Matrix' and `The Phantom Menace,' audiences have come to expect a lot, especially visually, and special effects are definitely one of the elements that separates the memorable from the forgettable.  In the case of `Event Horizon,' there are four key elements that separate it from total `B' movie status:  Fishburne, Neill, Quinlan and Richardson; the bottom line is, the story, and the movie itself, just doesn't live up to the star power involved with it.  The Event Horizon is a spacecraft launched in 2040 to explore the `boundaries' of the universe.  Somewhere just past Neptune, it disappears without a trace.  Seven years later, it shows up again, and a search and rescue ship is sent to check it out.  Captain Miller (Laurence Fishburne) leads the crew, which includes Peters (Kathleen Quinlan), Lt. Starck (Joely Richardson) and Cooper (Richard T. Jones).  Also aboard is Dr. William Weir (Sam Neill), who originally programmed the Event Horizon.  When they finally make contact with the phantom Horizon, they find that the crew is dead or missing, and the only clues they have are from the ships visual logs.  And the news isn't pleasant.  The ship apparently ventured into some other dimension, and returned with a life all it's own, including the ability to discern the vulnerability of whomever happens to be aboard at the time; and when Miller and his crew show up, the Horizon wastes no time in exploiting the fears or remorse of the individuals who have blundered into it's territory.  Soon they find themselves, along with the Horizon's crew, trapped in a virtual `Hell' with nowhere to go; it's like the sci-fi version of `Hotel California,' where you can check in, but you can never leave. <br/><br/>	The concept of the story is interesting, but the transfer from the written page to the screen falls a bit short.  Neither the story nor the characters are developed anywhere near well enough; we get what amounts to a mere glimpse into what makes Miller and Peters tick, and a little more (but still not nearly enough) into the background of Weir.  Throughout the film there are flashes of the Horizon's crew, trapped in this Hell they've entered, with plenty of blood and gore thrown at you very quickly, just enough to give you the idea of what's going on.  But after awhile, these flashes seem redundant and lose any significance they may have had to begin with.  The same process is used to play out the susceptibilities of Miller (what happened to a former crew member of his), Peters (her son) and Weir (his wife).  There are some shocking moments, but not enough to sustain much interest, and the computer graphics are not up to standard by a long shot. Especially early in the film, much of it has an animated look, like what you would have expected maybe twenty years ago (what was great in a movie like `Tron,' for example, doesn't cut it today). 	The supporting cast includes Jack Noseworthy (Justin), Jason Isaacs (D.J.), Sean Pertwee (Smith), Peter Marinker (Kilpatrick), Holley Chant (Claire) and Barclay Wright (Denny).  The performances are credible enough, especially by Fishburne and Quinlan, but director Paul Anderson has wrung little out of what he had to work with, and it's all delivered fairly unimaginatively. The special effects are mediocre, and in the end, what you have with `Event Horizon,' is essentially a pretty decent `B' movie.  There's a few thrills and some suspense, but don't go into this one expecting too much of a return on your investment of time or money.  I rate this one 3/10."

","Event Horizon was an okay movie.It had an extremely good cast.That was most likely the reason people saw it. The plot was fair...Sci-Fi Horror about a ship and its insane creator.

","Whether you look at it as science fiction or horror, this film is pretty humdrum.  The scientific premise is by now a cliche.  The horror scenes are just plain stupid--I usually found myself laughing at parts I knew were supposed to be scary.  The script is overwritten, corny, and melodramatic, and the characters are two-dimensional.  A waste of time, especially since one practically has to force onself to finish watching it."

","When I went to the theater to watch Event Horizon, I wasn't expecting much - my standards for sci-fi films are pretty low. I wasn't expecting a great plot, just one that could produce some scary scenes.<br/><br/>Instead, I was subjected to 90 minutes of horrific imagery not often seen outside of Bosch paintings. In retrospect, this movie was very effective at disturbing me - if only by producing such unbelievably nasty scenes that I had no choice. I was closer to getting sick than being scared.<br/><br/>Maybe that's why I hated this movie so much. Very little about the plot will surprise you, but the images will stay with you for a while.

","""Event Horizon"" could have been a really impressive movie.  The visuals are nice, and the film does have a couple of genuinely creepy and frightening moments, which is more than can be said for quite a few so-called horror films.  However, the movie is badly compromised by characters that move about as mindless slaves to the plot, as well as by some excruciatingly bad science.  Now, this is a science fiction movie, and as a longtime fan of science fiction, I am willing to concede such unlikelihoods as their faster -than-light drive and artificial gravity; however, the gross and unnecessary violations of well-understood physics (such as the fact that the ships seem to be both indside Neptune's atmosphere and motionless with respect to it and orbiting the planet at the same time; ask yourself why you don't see satellites ""orbiting"" in the atmosphere of Earth) and the ridiculously artificial technical complications completely destroy my willing suspension of disbelief.  For years, I have been waiting to see a space-opera-type science fiction movie come out of Hollywood that shows even close to the level of sceintific and technical knowledge shown by the great majority of successful hard science fiction writers.  I am still waiting.<br/><br/>Overall Rating:  4 (out of 10), or 1 and 1/2 stars (out of 4)"

Not surprisingly, the mission doesn't exactly go according to plan, and the crew is thrust into the unexpected and unknown. An intriguing amalgam of ALIEN, SOLARIS, and HELLRAISER, EVENT HORIZON is less of a science fiction yarn, and more of a haunted house in space epic. A stellar cast and impressive sets -especially the gyroscopic ""gateway""- help to make the incredible occurrences seem somewhat reasonable. After all, creating and using wormholes for travel is one thing, while ""gating in"" pandemonium is quite another!

"tabuno","7","0","0","18 January 2019"," A Solid But Not Completely Successful Fusion of Sci Fi and Horror
","5 September 2010. Sphere (1998) with Samuel L. Jackson came out a year later using the same underlying premise in an underwater environment scenario who has a presence in ways resembling Lawrence Fishburne in Event Horizon though more grounded in this movie as well as a subsequent version in Supernova (2000). But perhaps the closest psychological connection to this movie comes in the form of Galaxy of Terror (1981).<br/><br/>For 2047, the technology (notebooks and computerization) appears to be more 2020, even though it has a futuristic but contemporary feel 13 years later after its release as well as the incorporation oddly enough of weirdly archaic looking mechanical devices with steam and grinding metal from the Iron Age.<br/><br/>Incorporated into this movie are bits of Alien (1979) doors and door sounds and smatterings of Alien (1979) chasing and running down corridors, and even an Alien (1979) mysterious signal or message parallel and is even suggestive of the older First Spaceship on Venus (1960) or Planet of the Vampires (1965). Vague visual color similarities to The Cell (2000) and some design inside the core's mechanism to 2001: A Space Odyssey as well as later scene depicting being trapped outside in the vacuum of space. The visuals in this movie particularly the first third are fascinating as well as beginning to show signs of aging with the not quit lucid and authentic integration of floating objects in a vacuum, however, the effort and the overall impact are impressive and likely strikingly new when the movie came out 13 years ago and really broke new ground since 2010 came out seven years earlier (1984). Some of the scenes have not been replicated even to this day, even with the availability of the technology - like the interior of a deep frozen weightless vessel.<br/><br/>The explosion airlock scene is a particularly crucial scene where the screenplay and director is able to retain a believable, comprehensible consistency, a scene is actually seems to barely steer away from stereotypical overly dramatic standard of sensational horrific gore like like that observed in Outland (1981), though the final climatic scenes do have a compelling sense of suspense and drama.<br/><br/>Additionally, Sam Neill's crucial importance in the movie can't quite bring up either by the script or perhaps his acting to truly provide the depth necessary to truly display the credibility of the horrific transformation from the science fiction genre and their a few editing issues especially when Laurence Fishburne suddenly finds himself alone in a corridor with a haunting voice reverberating around him, and even the sudden discovery of the disposition of Lt. Stark played by Joely Richardson occurs without much explanation. One of the later destruction scenes also seems to be so overly destructive, to the point of portraying itself as a lazy, convenient script device. By the end of the movie, even the bio-detector devices used earlier in the movie seem to have been forgotten as the descent into an exclusively horror movie genre takes over unlike their use in the more intense sci fi emotive scenes from both Alien (1979) and Aliens (1986).<br/><br/>While the descent from science fiction into horror might be considered a twisted corruption of science fiction, it might also be a fascinating fusion of the two in terms of how the interaction between the alien unknown of science fiction is manifested in the human mind and perception and behavior. And where good and evil is observed, it may be the human moral underpinnings of our anthropomorphic attempts to explain what we do not understand or conceive, but what is and it is our darkest fears of what we do not fathom that result in panic and paranoia and what might be delusional creations of our own inner psychic but are just as real in an alternative presentation. Yet even with this explanation in the end, even though its seems to skirt successfully for prolong time, Event Horizon (1997) doesn't quite seem to avoid the overly simplified blood and gore horror fixation during the latter third of the movie which takes some of the action-thrills from Alien (1979) but in a psychological monster as opposed to physical monster way as depicted in The Omen (1976), The Man with the X-Ray Eyes (1963) and particularly The Hellraiser (1987) come to mind. Sphere (1998) even with its much more tame and for some ""boring"" scenario seems to able to more effectively capture the alien-horror-sci-fi fusion or Sam Neill's struggles that were more sedately and cerebrally captured in the remake of Solaris (1972) by George Clooney.<br/><br/>On the whole, this movie experience is interesting, sometimes scary, with a twist or two, and presents the American satisfaction of a sci fi action thriller, incorporating a strong horror element, and retains the American sci fi ending scene. Nevertheless, Event Horizon can't kind manage to present a superb fusion of these genres in a new classic form, but it can be commended for its attempt. 7/10."

","I liked Event Horizon- at least visually but it suffers from the same problems that plague many average films of this sort- a bland screenplay. Event Horizon takes us to the year 2047 and onto the deep space rescue craft Lewis & Clark as it departs from Earth orbit on a two-month journey to Neptune. The primary mission of the Lewis & Clark is to go into a low orbit around Neptune and make contact with the deep space research vessel Event Horizon, which was initially thought destroyed seven years ago. The would-be rescuers are to search for survivors and salvage anything that's reclaimable, but no one is prepared for the horror that lurks deep within the dark corridors of the dead ship. The crew of the Event Horizon may have had their innards splattered over the bulkheads, but something aboard the ship is very much alive. Event Horizon isn't particularly effective as a horror, adventure, or science fiction film but the atmosphere and set design are good. That is all I can say about it."

The film takes the viewer into a perfect tension and has taken its place among the unforgettable works of golden age of 90's.

"Screen_Blitz","6","0","0","16 August 2016"," Gruesome, eerie science-fiction gorefest boast striking visuals, but shallow writing
","From director Paul W. S. Anderson comes an eerie science-fiction horror thrillers that takes audiences on a ride through it's dark, tasty visuals, but sadly without an alluring screenplay to underpin the stunning aspect. Upon watching this film, it certainly wasn't too difficult to appreciate the efforts Anderson displays on screen; but I could not help but notice the high amount of elements borrowed from many superior science-fiction thrillers like James Cameron's 'Aliens' and John Carpenter's 'The Thing'. It's clear that Anderson is showering in inspiration and knows how to have fun with the genre, but the film as a whole doesn't always work, at least not too well in the narrative department. While it showers the screen with enough blood and gore to make the sensitive crowd squirm and occasional nightmare-inducing to the mix, Anderson attempts on generating a thoroughly frightening experience come with only half-hearted results. Set in the futuristic 2047 in the depths of outer space, the film centers on a crew of astronauts: Captain Miller (played by Laurence Fishburne), Lieutenant Stark (played by Joely Richardson), Cooper (played by Richard Jones), D.J (played by Jason Isaacs), Justin (played by Jack Noseworthy), Smith (played by Sean Pertwee), and Medical Technician Peters (played by Kathleen Quinlan) on an investigation for a lost spaceship known as Event Horizon. Assisted by the creator of Event Horizon, the crew embark on an exploration to the missing spaceship, only to encounter a terrifying force that picks off the crew one by one. <br/><br/>Compared to other science-fiction features, this one is nowhere near as memorable or inventive as it sets out to be, nor does it embrace the proper caliber to sustain a truly visceral experience. Luckily, director Paul W. S. Anderson packs just enough thrills and striking visuals to make up a somewhat exciting experience, but the suspense and horror does fall flat at times; especially during the first half. Capturing a claustrophobic atmosphere and nightmarish imagery ranging from grossly deformed human figures with gauged-out eyes, to dismembered mutant bodies, to creepy blood-covered paranormal entities; there is no denying how absurd and horrifying this movie can get as it journeys through plenty of creepy imagery that is bound to make the weak stomach squirm. And the dazzling production design of the spaceship interior and the corridors which borrow heavily from 'Alien' are quite nice to look at, especially with the decent cinematography to expand upon the view. It's too bad however, that the storyline falls short of substance, ending the plot with major questions unanswered (dealing with plot points I rather not spoil) and characters sorely underdeveloped. The crew is trapped in a ship that has been to Hell. As interesting as it is, the film never makes a solid attempt to explain what is going on. Though Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill give an okay, if flawed performances as the lead characters, neither of them manage to stand out too far above the rest of the cast who's characters are left in two-dimensional entities. This is not the stay that none of the characters aren't likable, but sadly none of them are uninteresting in a way that you keep rooting for their survival. And it definitely does not help that the writers pin the characters with inconsistently laughable dialogue. <br/><br/>Event Horizon may not the proper narrative heft to support it's flawed storyline, but offers just enough thrills and excitement to make up for the blemishes in it's script. It is not a film that reaches the level of a visceral horror experience, nor does it even come close to. By the end however, it makes for a pulse-pounding thrill ride brought together by the efforts of Paul W. S. Anderson."

","It was lonely at home & late in the night, I decided to watch some TV & doze off. Unfortunately I flipped on HBO & they were playing Event Horizon. By the end of the movie not only was I awestruck & scared out of my wits, the entire night I was up thinking about the movie. Usually I watch a movie after reading the reviews, hearing comments from friends etc. This was a shocker for me.<br/><br/>Its not every day you see a good mix of science fiction & horror. Of course it was the screen presence of Laurence Fishburne & Sam Neill that first made me stop channel surfing but the rest of the cast too did an excellent job as far as acting was concerned. But it was the subtle development of the plot that did the trick. The movie starts off in the year 2047 with a rescue & salvage mission of a ship the ''Event Horizon'' which mysteriously disappears during its maiden voyage & then reappears after 7 years. The Event Horizon was an attempt to perform space hops (jump from one point in space to another immediately without actually burning fuel & traveling that distance).<br/><br/>Along with the salvage team they have Dr. William Weir (Sam Neill) who obviously knows more than he is ready to disclose. The rest of the team (& the movie for that matter) has Capt. Miller (Laurence Fishburne) who is cool, composed & ready to see the reason beyond the logics. As the crew tries to find out what happened to the crew & where the ship has been for the last seven years the answers, unpleasant as they are, only lead to more darker questions.<br/><br/>The crew soon suspects that they would need a salvage team themselves. And even worse, someone or something does not want them to leave. Alive, anyway. The visuals & sound are beautifully intertwined in this horror classic. Not to the visually gross scale but good enough to send shock waves down your spine. Laurence Fishburne shows us hints of the man we know as Morpheus in the Matrix. Sam Neill was there but actually falls short in making a lasting impact.<br/><br/>The screenplay was good considering that I was seeing it on TV with commercials and all & still felt the movie was scary enough. The facts open up one by one evenly throughout the movie & not in one sudden shocker (as revealed by scary old granny/grandpa giving a scarier story & warning as seen in a normal horror flick). On the whole a very good movie especially if you are a sci-fi & horror fan.<br/><br/>Just be warned don't see it alone, at night esp. if you would like to sleep after seeing it!!"

","Event Horizon put me in mind of two other movies, Alien, of course, and Forbidden Planet. You have a crew made up of people who are clearly British as well as American so things are pretty international by the year 2047. Either that, or the redoubtable Jason Isaacs and the adorable Sean Pertwee are incapable of doing American accents; somehow I think it's the former. They all board a ship that has been missing for seven years and so naturally we're wondering what kind of Alien-like surprise they're going to get.<br/><br/>The movie was wonderful and on the brink of terrifying up to the halfway mark. I was asking myself why I had barely ever heard of it until the second half when we get into the Forbidden Planet version of things. I'm not sure if I can say this is completely Forbidden Planet as what lurks within may come not just from man's own delusions but whence those spring. But somehow this movie does not deliver on that side. I was enjoying some reviews on the platform on which I saw the movie, Netflix, and there as well as in places here people discussed how terrified they were by the movie's dark implications particularly when young; one person said Event Horizon ""destroyed my childhood."" Possibly then its ultimate theme speaks best to the beautifully naive among us where the truth touches a core.<br/><br/>I will say, Forbidden Planet destroyed my childhood, or at least my walks to school. Trying not to give anything away, but somehow the symbol of evil in that one transmogrified to huge dinosaurs dogging my every step; I kept turning around expecting a tyrannosaurus rex rearing up on the horizon. I was also terrified of brontosauri but was told they were only herbivores, although I suppose being stepped on by one would not be fun either. Anyway, I think Forbidden Planet was a far more effective film than Event Horizon -- and to those who love Forbidden Planet, please forgive me if I am way off in comparing the two -- and that is why so few of us know about Event Horizon. As many have said here it could essentially be classified as a horror film, with comparisons, say, to even The Shining and others. I know there is a film I have seen recently which garnered the same reception of, ""It's really scary when you think of the deeper implications."" I think that may have been the David Caruso cult classic Session 9; oh, another one you hadn't heard of before either? It's worth checking out. I would half, er, have to leave my recommendation on Event Horizon at the halfway mark. It's worth a check out if only for its place in sci-fi or quasi history. Grab your partner and your popcorn because you're in for a ride. But you'll probably have no trouble sleeping.<br/><br/>By the way ... Jason Isaacs is adorable, too. But it wasn't until I caught him in Sweetwater on Netflix that I began to look for he-of-the-impossibly-clear-eyes elsewhere and thus came to Event Horizon. Now there's someone about whom I have to ask ... why I had I never heard of him before?"
"AJ4F","5","0","0","3 September 2013"," The ship's name held promise but the film fell short
","I watched this after reading a Stephen Hawking book in which ""event horizon"" was described in terms of general relativity and black hole physics. But the hammering soundtrack in the opening credits warned me that this film probably wouldn't rise to the elegance of that concept. It had too many standard plot devices and was never really scary to me.<br/><br/>Here are some issues, starting with most annoying first:<br/><br/>1) You'd think that an advanced spaceship crew would be educated like today's astronauts, not blue collar types easily bored by the scientist's explanation of a ""singularity"" and other aspects of black hole travel. They'd send the best of the best on such a critical mission, not jive talkers and impatient drones. ""Say it in plain English!"" is ridiculously overused in movies and insults an intelligent audience. A real crew of that caliber would understand black holes well beyond his folded paper demo. I know it was done for the audience's sake, but still.<br/><br/>2) The steam-punk gravity drive and the general interior of the ship seemed deliberately designed to convey malice, not functionality. It's almost as if the ship was built as a haunted house. Why all the spikes in the doors that humans pass through? OSHA wouldn't allow such a ship to be built. The gravity drive seemed more like a medieval torture device than something modern engineering would come up with. I suppose all the spikes could be related to magnetism but it wasn't explained.<br/><br/>3) The blood in the ship's structure had no scientific context. It played like a ripoff of ""The Shining."" This movie was too big on ""fi"" and too small on ""sci."" They should have toned down the gore.<br/><br/>4) Technical aspects, like the guy in the airlock spewing that much blood and living, or the astronaut being propelled back toward the planet with his breathing pack seemed ludicrous. The electronics damage to the rescue ship seemed impossible to fix. It needed a lot more than skin patches. Why do so many movies show sparks flying from sophisticated instruments which are miraculously repaired in hours?<br/><br/>5) The premise that we'd already colonized the Moon by 2015 was ridiculously optimistic, even in 1997.<br/><br/>Still, it kept me entertained enough to see it through, so I gave it a neutral 5.<br/><br/>I'd recommend ""Solaris"" (2002) for a much better depiction of mentally conjured people, etc. The elements of that in ""Event Horizon"" were done in sledgehammer style, though the eyeless wife did give me a jolt."

","Event Horizon is an interesting and unusual movie. It is a straight blend of supernatural horror with hard science fiction (as opposed to, say, Alien, which is a science fiction horror movie ie. the horror derives from the science fiction).<br/><br/>The rescue spaceship Lewis & Clark is sent to rescue the Event Horizon which went missing years before, having pioneered a faster-than-light drive. When they board it, there is lots of blood, but no people. And then they start seeing things. Horrible, horrible things...<br/><br/>This movie has lots of sci-fi hardware - it is reminiscent of Alien in terms of what the spacecraft interiors look like, and set design and effects (makeup, physical, photographic etc.) are fine.<br/><br/>The cast, and performances are also fine - it is an A list cast (Laurence Fishburne, Sam Neill etc.) so one would expect no less.<br/><br/>The text of the film is never specific as to what extent the supernatural crosses over with the scientific into real life - we could be witnessing hallucinations or something real. I think it doesn't matter - what matters is the effect of such manifestations. This is a ""last man standing"" film.<br/><br/>By its own standards, it works well."

","I was excited to view this film, due to the actors involved. Yet, I found the only memorable performance was done by Laurence Fishburne. <br/><br/>I watch a lot of horror movies, and once in a great while one truly haunts me. This movie gave me nightmares. I believe it was due to Sam Neill's cut up face, and the scene where the previous crew start murdering each other. <br/><br/>This movie is incredibly violent, and I didn't dig the gateway to hell idea. <br/><br/>I also have a question...Neill was acting peculiar from start to finish, but was he evil from the beginning? I suppose once his dead ex-wife took his eyeballs, the ""evil"" got to him. I just thought that it was odd that he was the only one who truly became evil. The rest of the crew just got killed off. And what happened to that baby bear kid? The one who actually went through the black hole and came back attempting to commit suicide? The last time he was mentioned in the film, Morpheous was preparing the crew members to leave and telling them to get him ready. He is not seen again. And there are three of them rescued in the end? The blonde, the funny black guy (he was actually my favourite) and was the last one the baby bear?<br/><br/>And I agree with everybody that this movie has stolen many ideas. Alien, hellraiser and the shinning. All MUCH better movies. <br/><br/>Don't see this movie if you're looking for a good sci-fi film. If you want a gut-wrenching horror flick, go right ahead."

You will not be disappointed. I remember renting it with my best friend because I think we liked space movies and we were like, oh sweet, a new a space movie. Looks good. We had no idea it was a horror flick. I remember sitting there in his basement and becoming engrossed in this movie and it was like he wasn't even there I was so drawn into it. The terror steadily grew and grew and never left. The way I remember it, there were no breaks between the scary parts. It was just unrelentingly scary once it got going. I remember it ending and me and my friend just looking at each other freaked out of our minds. We both thought it was the scariest movie we had ever seen.

"analyst12","Null","0","0","4 November 2004"," The Hands-Down Scariest Movie Ever
","Let me be as frank as possible: Event Horizon is the scariest movie that I've ever seen. <br/><br/>Scream? Laughed out loud. Freddy? Kind of a big joke. Jason? Not even in the same ballpark. <br/><br/>I walked in to that theater with ten college friends - a few of whom were football players for a major university - and we all had our baseball hats over our faces like a bunch of ten-year olds trying to protect ourselves from the scary parts. And in case you were wondering, yes, it was a co-ed group. <br/><br/>Here's the deal: *most* sci-fi/horror movies rely on a handful of tactics to build suspense, but the longer a particular series of sequels or franchise builds, the more contrived those techniques seem. After a while, we can't wait to see how Freddy will ""hack up"" the next punk teenager too stupid to leave town. <br/><br/>Event Horizon doesn't work like that. The characters are not only intelligent, but also very real and too human. Their terror is very real on screen, and when they get into trouble - well, let's just say the word ""commiserate"" doesn't really cover it. <br/><br/>Everything in the film works the way it should in a horror movie: the lighting and cinematography are first rate - providing a constant sense of eerie dread throughout every step of the derelict spacecraft; the plot draws out the unknown like a long puff on a cigar - it's bitter, but full of flavor that's best when tasted in the mouth and not quickly inhaled; and finally, there are no guarantees regarding the characters. Usually, all you have to do is peg the most beautiful members of the cast who initially act virtuously or compassionately and you know that the mixture of conscience and luck will help them survive the evil in the film. This time though, there is no common denominator with the characters to ruin the plot ahead of time. You will have to keep guessing.<br/><br/>And let me be clear about this: the enemy is sure to scare because it really is evil. Freddy's one kind of evil, and the killers from Scream are the same way - they're evil in a homicidal way. This evil is in a state of anomie: it's simply evil because it revels in being evil and celebrates it with childish glee.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a movie that will scare the snot out of you - this is it. The movie is crucially aware of the use of gore, terror, and mystery throughout. Personally, I recommend that you watch it with a friend, and holding onto a hat to cover your eyes is practically a must on the first time through."
"dysamoria","Null","0","0","4 April 2003"," Beautiful Cinematic Virtues and Brutally Shocking Failures
","When I first saw this film, it angered me. No, actually, it enraged me. I became obsessed with this film. I was obsessed with hating it. The reason was that it had so much to like about it, so much potential and such a great cast... yet it also chose to be as brutal, clumsy and senseless as it did.<br/><br/>
This film has fantastic production design. The sets are grand, well conceived, appropriately lit (dark, somber) and appear quite solid and functional. The design is heavily influenced by gothic styles. The space craft of the title is like a cathedral. The interior is designed to appear functional and clean and quite at home in science fiction... when all the lights are on. When the lights have gone down a bit, when a character is alone and anxious, the interior feels oppressive and sinister and there is more than a passing resemblance to a torture chamber; this becomes bluntly obvious later on as it literally becomes one, but for now, it is an impressive world of functional and intriguing design. Of special note is, again, the gothic cathedral appearance of the ship's exterior, and the almost cross-like front view port of the ship.<br/><br/>For some reason, the combination of science fiction and horror creates a special mood, one that I love, and Event Horizon sets that mood perfectly through its visual design.<br/><br/>The cinematography is, at times, beautiful. Almost every frame is composed with intent and care to evoke some kind of mood and to show you only enough to worry you. The sets are shown off wonderfully with the cinematography.<br/><br/>
Now, lets talk about fear: Setting aside, for the moment, the obvious flaw of ""boo! I scared you!"" moments (and there are plenty of lame BOO! moments), this film contains some very scary moments that rely totally on mood, anticipation and suggestion.<br/><br/>Minor Spoiler Paragraph:<br/><br/>The ship seems to be haunted. But not by ghosts. It seems to be drawing out the personal issues of the inhabitants and using them to instill fear. This is done quite well, though much could be expanded on for further character development. The mood and action suggests that you're about to see something horrible such as a man headed on a walk out into space without a suit or ""what's that under the sheet??""<br/><br/>End of Minor Spoiler Paragraph.<br/><br/>This leads me to where I must note that this movie has one of the most realistic ""unprotected human in the vacuum of space"" scenes since 2001. Here is where movies of old would have shown you a gross and bloody explosion (or lame puffing-out of face and eyeballs, as found in Total Recall). Not Event Horizon. In fact, up to this point, the movie has done an excellent job of giving you almost a ""hard science"" approach to its fictional technology. You get to see that there is artificial gravity (something that isn't always on), sleep chambers to hibernate travelers on long journeys, a brilliantly scripted lay man's explanation of FTL travel (bending space), and even one I've never seen before: the sleep chambers are water tanks, to cushion the frail humans during the intense G forces of acceleration and deceleration.<br/><br/>So, up to now, we have a beautiful and intelligent film. Then comes the part that ruins all that.<br/><br/>Before the real spoilers, I thought it would be a good idea to stress that this film is NIGHTMARE FUEL. Do NOT let young children watch it. It deserves the R rating. If your children are easily confused by vaguely intentioned violence (you can't explain ""why""), are easily scared into having bad dreams by scary movies, or especially if they are night-terror prone, this film should be kept away from them until they are old enough (which is probably the film's R rating legal age minimum). I have heard that this film was shortened to its current running length from a longer version that still sits on the cutting room floor. I can only imagine what they had to cut to avoid an X rating. The violence it retains can leave lasting negative impressions. It did on me, and I was already a ""brave adult"" at the time.<br/><br/>Here is where I warn you of Serious Plot Spoilers from here to the end of the review!<br/><br/>The movie suddenly takes a 180 degree turn. A supporting character dies in a relatively pointless and stupid manner, eliminating any chance of knowing more about the character's personal dark background. This leads one of the main characters to change from a good, complex and interesting man (with dark agonies of his own personal life) into an evil and hateful brutal murderer that seems to kill for the pleasure of causing suffering in his victims. His actions directly or indirectly cause the death of several other people (some of which, as an audience member, I really felt bad for because they were somewhat likable and they did nothing to invite their unkind fate, unlike other horror movies where they tend to give good reasons to slaughter some of the characters). The goals and motivations of this ""changed man"" are nowhere to be seen. His actions make no sense and have no apparent justification or explanation. The movie itself takes on this personality as it stops suggesting things and starts showing them. Up front. Brutally. Grossly. Most of all, needlessly. It is as though the film's creators suddenly lost all ability to hold back and instead tried to find ways to disgust the audience both physically (visually) and emotionally (justification? motivation? reason? NONE!). This film is one of few to actually upset my insides. Not just through the gore, but the kind of violent gore portrayed and the totally unjustified and random nature of it. I suppose this is the point.<br/><br/>The climax of the film is the survivors trying to escape their impending doom. I was amazed that the film allowed the survivors that it did. One last good point for it, I guess.<br/><br/>The problem in the film lies in the fact that it was doing a great job at being interesting, frightening and beautiful, but then suddenly decided to throw all that away and go for 100% shock and senselessness. Ending up like that, is to me, an insult to the audience. The audience has been set up for a great treat of intellectual scares (minus the BOO! moments) and then they are bashed over the head with shocking insanity.<br/><br/>The part that leaves me the most frustrated about this film is that it appears to have set out to do exactly what it did to me. Set me up with expectations and then bash me over the head with the shattering of them. It worked. I was shocked and bothered. Even somewhat sickened. Yet... oooohh... I still... LIKED a great deal of the content in the movie to a GREAT extent. I was so angry and disgusted with this film, yet I found myself referring to it all the time. Using it as an example of this or that kind of technical accomplishment in films. Using it as a kind of ""tool to measure other films by"" (as good or bad example). After years of reflecting on the one time I saw the film and how I was enraged by it, I have a strange desire to see it again!  I find my own creative works influenced by it (positively). What the hell did they do to me?<br/><br/>Reading commentary from the creators, it seemed that they intended everything to happen as it did. Does that take away the negative aspects of being clumsy and brutal after having demonstrated an ability to do wonderfully without it? I can't honestly say.<br/><br/>If you're reading this as a person who has not seen it, and you're looking for help in deciding whether you should see it, I must admit that this film is an education on both how to make a frightening science fiction horror movie... and how NOT to. Both at the same time. If you love great set designs and art direction and visuals and cinematography, there is a great deal of enjoyment for you to get out of this film. The problem is when all of that is shamed by the brutality and mindlessness of the film's climax.<br/><br/>To bring this rant to a close: I know nothing about how well this film did monetarily either in the box office or in rental. However, Event Horizon is so confusing on so many different levels that it may leave you totally devoid of the ability to make a solid judgment on it (as it has left me). If this was the goal of the filmmakers, then they have been totally successful."

When you actually look into it the scientific idea behind Event Horizon is fairly sound, if we had the technology to create a black hole it might actually work.

","I'm sick to death of all the 'postmodern' so called horror films coming out lately that think they're being 'ironic' so I thought I'd check out this good old fashioned science fiction horror flic.  I chose it over Sphere basically because it didn't have Sharon Stone in it.<br/><br/>After half an hour I was almost ready to turn it off.  It's not that it was dragging out cliche's - I was prepared for that -  it was just the lacklustre nature in which it was doing it.  The explanation of space-time travel was completely unconvincing.  But about the time that Sam Neil begins to show that there is more to his character than at first seemed, my interest started to perk up.  By the time 'baby bear' was in the airlock with his insides trying to escape his skin, I was finally drawn completely into the film.<br/><br/>From that moment on it's basically a thrill ride to the end.  With various members of the crew seeing gruesome images and experiencing gory deaths. It's the gore that makes this film standout from more artistic ventures like 'Alien'.  It may be a base level approach, but it worked effectively on me. There is always the threat of unimaginable horror that awaits the crew throughout the film.  I think it's this threat more than the actual gore that is scary.<br/><br/>It's a quality ensemble gathered to deliver the script, but only two of the actors really stand out.  Sam Neil enjoys the chance to play on the duality of his character in the role that Gary Oldman usually seems to play.  He has the sort of character that can transcend the dialogue, and he does well.<br/><br/>Talented English actress Joely Richardson - who was moving in 'Hollow Reed' and naked in 'Lady Chatterly' - is the other that stands out.  She manages, where the others fail, to almost make her character three-dimensional and believable, despite (or perhaps because of) the lack of a trite back story that the other main characters have.<br/><br/>6/10 - The unconvincing science fiction build up lets down what is actually quite an exciting little horror movie."

","Having seen the trailer, I wanted to see the movie as I kinda like space action movies. However, the fact that Event Horizon only played for two weeks here should have warned me that something was amiss. When it finally was released on video, I sped to the video rental only to find out that there was after all a good reason why it only played for a fortnight.<br/><br/>The plot is simple: a high tech space exploration ship called Event Horizon goes missing. As in any good space drama (ouch!) all rescue attempts fail, but after seven years the ship miraculously turns up again somewhere around Neptune. A bunch of SAR vets are dispatched to find out what finally happened. Once arrived, they discover that Event Horizon was in fact a faster than light experiment involving artificial singularities (black holes), inter-dimensional gates and space folding (these are the layman terms used by Sam Neill when briefing the crew!).<br/><br/>The whole idea behind the whole movie is that tampering with nature's laws could be detrimental to your health, ie inter-dimensional travel might take you to hell instead of Proxima Centauri. After all, who knows what or who is behind space? Now that is an interesting idea, but who cares? Certainly not the director or the script writer who insisted on making this Hellraiser in Space.<br/><br/>So, as it went along the movie turns out to be a health hazard as my stomach begun to protest in view of the increasing amounts of gore. Too bad for the money spent but one only learns doing things themselves.<br/><br/>PS: Not for the faint hearted!"

"ChoiBaby","Null","0","0","27 December 1998"," An engrossing horror and science-fiction amalgram with plenty of scares.
","A somewhat conventional science-fiction horror film that reflects upon earlier efforts such as Alien (1979), et al. is still a fascinating thriller that will keep your heart beating in anticipation. Event Horizon is a well polished thriller that owes a little too much to the science-fiction and horror concepts of the late 1970s and early 1980s.<br/><br/>The Event Horizon is a spaceship with the capabilities to ""travel faster than the speed of light."" In the year 2040 though, the Event Horizon has lost contact. Seven years later, a rescue mission aboard the U.S.S. Lewis and Clark is charged with bringing the crew and the entire ship of the Event Horizon back. Captain Miller (Laurence Fishburne) is in charge of the operation. A British scientist, Dr. Weir (Sam Neill), haunted by the memories of his deceased wife, Claire, which are planted inside his deepest thoughts must join Miller and his crew for he was the one that designed the spaceship, Event Horizon. The rest of the cast consists of Peters (Kathleen Quinlain), and Justin, a rookie technician.  Also, a psychologist, a pilot, and a wisecracking rescue technician round out the remaining cast.<br/><br/>Dr. Weir has a lot of explaining to do about the Event Horizon to the entire modley of the U.S.S. Lewis and Clark. Many have found his scientific possibilites to be implausible, but Weir claims that the spaceship can travel beyond the capabilities of any normal spacecraft transporation. Eventually, the Lewis and Clark rescue squad does manage to bump into the Event Horizon, coincidentally. They travel inside, only to fail finding any lifeforms or survivors. Dr. Weir and Capt. Miller then discover the ""core"" of the Event Horizon, which allow it to travel back and forth through any fabric of time and space. However, this leads to nightmarish consequences...<br/><br/>The new crew of the U.S.S. Lewis and Clark then suddenly see ""hallucinations"" of their deepest, darkerst secrets. Right in front of their eyes, members of the Lewis and Clark see their past coming back to haunt them. Dr. Weir thinks his wife is back to comfort him. Capt. Miller sees a violent, burning image of one of his dead comrades walking.  Peters sees her own son, Denny, running around the Event Horizon loose. The crew loses their cool and breaks down. Dr. Weir goes insane, and one by one, the crew members succumb to the Event Horizon's awesome powers...<br/><br/>Event Horizon is a decent amalgram of both the sci-fi and horror genres. What's great about this film is that it's never predictable; surprises jump you from left to right, above and below. The special effects are very good, and this film has a surreal, imaginative atmospehere that gives a breathtaking albeit claustrophobic fear.<br/><br/>Event Horizon is a very freaky film that's not for the faint of heart. It is very bloody at times though rather messy. Event Horizon is a fine horror film that's a good treat for aficionados of deviant films. It is wickedly scary and the films shows what's it like when people are forced to relive their own nightmares. This film lack logic and sense so if you're looking for comprehension, look elsewhere. Event Horizon may not take sci-fi-horror films to new horizons, but it will take the audience into new realms of fantasy and illusion, where evil dominates.<br/><br/>RATING: **1/2 out of ****."

Since very few movies actually scare me, I must say that Event Horizon was very effective in style. I thought it was an intriguing and scary film. Some might see the ending as a letdown (or a relief). If the concept of Hell frightens you, you may wish to skip Event Horizon. Good effects, good style, very creepy.

","It might be.  This movie is horrifying.  It was on TV recently and even though I knew it would screw me up, I couldn't avert my eyes.<br/><br/>It's on the same level as Psycho and Blair Witch.  Which for me at least means that it's terrifying.  The Event Horizon it gorier than the aforementioned two, but like them, it relies heavily on suggestion and a good dramatic tension -- a sense of unease pervades the entire movie. Conveying this unease is a hallmark of good horror movie (I'm not a fan of the genre, I might add).  Another part of the brilliance of this, and other top tier movies is the strategic use of ambiguity -- the creation of ""gaps"" which are left for the viewer's imagination to fill-in.  The movie establishes a framework, or a direction of thought and the viewers complete the myth in their own minds.  In this case, the results are disturbing."

","I'm a big fan of director Paul Anderson.  From his first feature, 'Shopping', to his latest. 'Resident Evil'.  This is his follow-up film to the kickin 'Mortal Kombat', and it delivers on every level.  Great visuals, FX, music, atmosphere, acting and general feel to the film takes this above most genre outings of late.  However, as much as I like this movie, I can't quite put my complete stamp of approval on it... yet.  There are plenty of plot holes, unanswered questions and odd motives that serve no purpose.  I now know why.  The original cut of this film was over 2 and a half hours long.  All the character development was taken out by the studio, along with explanations and plot.  Apparently Paramount thinks we are all dumb and can't handle a horror film with a purpose.  You can usually tell when this has happened when a movie clocks in at under a hour and a half ('Hellraiser 4' anyone?).  I've heard rumors that an 'Event Horizon: Special Edition' is coming to DVD in the near future.  I can't wait to see what a masterpiece this movie could have been.  As it stands... I give it 6/10."

","Not many people are fans of Sam Neill's work, I, on the hand enjoy his suspicious looks and pauses in dialogue. I enjoy the way he plays with the lines he is given rather than just blurting them out like some actors (Keanu Reeves, for instance). And his work in Event Horizon is right up there with some of his best films. In fact, the acting is pretty well in this movie overall, it is not Academy award material but not everything has to be. Laurence Fishbourne walks around with something stuck up his butt as his character seems to lack any human characteristics, but everyone else did a great job concidering what they were given. <br/><br/>    The only lacking thing in the movie was the dialogue itself. The story was great, but the dialogue seemed forced and incoherent. A lot of useless talk to fill the time between the tense moments, and too much yelling when those moments come. <br/><br/>    As I noted the story is really good, it offers a lot of bone chilling scares and understandable, yet unpredictable plot twists. For being in a far off time and place, and dealing with difficult ideas, every thing was clear, and better yet it seemed to run pretty smoothly, rather than choppy like some scary movies can get as they try to move from one tense moment to the next (Any one of the Jason movies, or Children Under the Stairs (Ack! I hate even saying that name!)).<br/><br/>    The BEST part of the film seeing as it nearly knocked my socks off, was the technical aspects. Even many of the elements on the Event Horizon seemed to reappear in the Matrix ship, and everything seemed really realistic even though it was the future (unlike Impostor). The sound effects were really great, it is hard to find a movie these days where sound effects are used in a way to enhance the story, rather than just explain it. Like a good cinematography, sound effects can totally enhance the story if they are used correctly. In this movie they are spectacular! They bring the tenseness to a whole new level usually missed in horror movies. Definitely worth seeing if you want to try out that new surround sound system you just bought! <br/><br/>     CONCLUSION:  I would see it once, then again after a long while so you can forget the scary parts. Also, without a good surround sound system this film may seem a little lacking, but worth seeing once."

","I wasn't expecting much, and was pleasantly surprised. Lots of great sets and the production design is top-notch, except for that silly captain's chair on the Lewis & Clark. Haunting visuals, both from the Event Horizon's recorded log and Fishburne's view of 'hell'! Freeze-frame and take a look... a lot of great and gory effects went into shots that you miss most of if you didn't freeze-frame.<br/><br/> Paul Anderson may not be the best director, but he's far from the worst and his movies, whether you like them or not, are typically great looking, i.e. Soldier and Mortal Kombat.<br/><br/> My two biggest problems are Sam Neill's explanation of a worm-hole to the crew of experienced space pilots. This is not a new theory and what he explains on what the drive does is something I even knew about ... certainly the crew don't need that explained. Also the engineering room looked a bit too much like a movie set, with all the lights and sharp spikes coming out of the ground for no reason.<br/><br/> One more thing, another reviewer made note that he was tired of movies exposing people to space and all they have to show for it are minor cuts. In fact, if you were exposed to space, not much would happen in terms of noticeable physical damage. But you just pretty much drown in space. A few blood vessels would pop, but otherwise, you die of lack of breathing. Of course, you would also freeze if you lived long enough to hold your breath that long.<br/><br/> A good movie, not great, but with some genuine creeps, that I recommend it."

","I watched this movie yesterday and I really liked it. The performances were all pretty good, I especially liked Sam Neill and Laurence Fishburne.<br/><br/>In the beginning of the movie, it feels a bit like the Alien movies, with the crew members being introduced. But the whole history of the Event Horizon, the docking and then the subtle terror everywhere, made it look more like Shining. Very quiet scenes, with the ""Something is going to happen"" atmosphere, and then, either nothing happens or only for a second. The things that happen might still be illusions and just signs of the crew going crazy.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, that atmosphere is destroyed by the end, when there is actually a ""monster"", a personification of the things that happen, on the ship. After that its mostly a monster-chase. The End isn't too surprising either, but still not bad. After all, I really enjoyed the movie, but think I'd have liked it more if it had stayed subtle, with the question ""Are the things really there or do those people imagine them?"", instead of answering it."

The ship has returned after many years, and the mission is to find out where it has been, what happened to the crew, and what has it brought back.<br/><br/>I know what you're thinking; ""A ship that can fold space??""  That's about the most basic way of putting it.  But it is very cleverly explained by one of the characters in the movie, a physicist who is fascinated the most with the strange Event Horizon.  Also keep in mind, the whole thing is set a few years into the future which would surpass conventional science as we know it presently.  Combined with above average special effects and great scenery, the whole idea of the movie works quite well.<br/><br/>The plot is very interesting.  If you like a little mystery and suspense, you'll get hooked right from the beginning because it forces you to watch to know what is in that ship, and what will be the ultimate fate of the crew.

","Whilst many will disagree with me, I still find Event Horizon to be an adequate sci-fi/thriller.  Those who are new to the genre, and similarly those whose life -is- sci-fi, will no doubt be disappointed with it.  When I first saw it I was in a movie theatre with about a handful of other people (I love late night sessions), and while this may be a contributing factor to my positive opinion of the film, I still believe it has -some- decent attributes and will now stop defending my position!<br/><br/>Event Horizon has everything you want in a sci-fi/thriller: suspense, action, a feasible plot, comic relief (although sometimes unwanted) and that feeling that you actually -are- on board a space vessel and that it's not just digital special fx or a well-made set.  I have watched too many horror films/thriller, and started doing so at too young an age, that not many films scare me - and Event Horizon did!  Probably best viewed at night (with a good sound system!) to appreciate the mood of the film.  The sudden movements/actions, backed up by the rather loud and startling sound effects (contrasting the silence which precedes them) makes for a good scare! (in my humble opinion, of course).<br/><br/>The plot is very vague (which is in no way a bad thing) and this 'hell' which they refer to is never completely revealed or depicted which leaves a lot to the imagination.  How can one begin to properly describe hell? Especially considering that one's ""worst nightmare"" varies considerably between people.  At least Event Horizon -has- some sort of story to it and doesn't just rely on special effects like most sci-fi movies these days. And if you don't like the storyline or think it's too far fetched, get over it .. it's science FICTION.  Sam Neil's character doesn't do too good a job of explaining how the ship works anyway and writes it off as too complex for us to comprehend which is enough for us to accept it and not dwell on it too much.<br/><br/>There didn't seem to be too much character chemistry going on, it was more each to their own, but with a relatively small cast and considering the circumstances they found themselves under, this wasn't such a terrible downfall.  The comic relief that Cooper provided was a little too much and did not blend too well with the overall mood the film was trying to create. Personally I found his character to be annoying.  Sean Pertwee did some good acting on the other hand and I love his character up until the end! (you'll see what I mean).<br/><br/>So for a ""dodgy"" sci-fi movie with ""borrowed"" themes, Event Horizon faired alright and I would give it a 9 out of 10.  When I first saw it at the cinema it was my favourite film for at least a year and I'm still not completely sure why...<br/><br/>Oh and the ending .. I liked.  Although I'm one of those people that gets sucked into movies and doesn't predict or anticipate things, as clicheed or ""typical"" as they may be so my opinion could be highly subjective.  But nonetheless overall I find Event Horizon to be a good film, for entertainment purposes only as it doesn't delve into anything deeper than that."

If you don't like very gory films then don't watch the film but over here in England there are guildline boxes alongside the rating giving you an overview of the language, sex/nudity and violence and this film was rated as a very violent film with strong gore and the film wouldn't be the same without it.

When the crew board the ship they unwittingly find out the horrors of what happened to the original crew first hand.<br/><br/>This film was scary as Hell.

Like the bad boy that I was, me and two friends decided to tackle this piece of pulsating adrenaline inducing project at the latest hour.  At the height of Horizon's most horrific scenes I found myself teleported back into the days of a child, watching films that were half as bloody and being frightened to the point of insanity. The plot seems simple enough but becomes very twisted, straying from the 'alien' cliche and striding into a more 'biblical' revelation (not giving away anything).  It's heart pounding soundtrack, from the opening credits of Orbital to the end credits scrolling to the Prodigy, adds to the overall atmosphere of a suffocating and creepy 100 or so minutes.  The performances are a mixed bag, Skipper Miller (Fishbourne) and the incredible Weir (Sammy boy) are played to perfection, aside from Miller's last cries of ""You-will-not-take-my-crew!"". Anderson's direction is aided by some pretty impressive sets.  Every shot is picturesque, the dark and torturing backdrops simply make your skin crawl, (the Core is simply the scariest most evil set thise side of the Emperor's Chamber in Return Of The Jedi [okay okay, maybe not]). The blood and gore goes a bit overboard but it is justified considering the stories twist. From the first tape recording of ""Liberatai Mai"" to the macabre montage of the ""old crew"" Event Horizon pushes you to the very edge. (after seeing it, my friends and I left with pale faces and beating hearts only to leave my hat in the cinema.  We had to brave the darkness of the cinema after it closed to get it back.  The aisle lights were the only things left on, and it felt like I was walking back into the Event Horizon ship itself!) Underrated and very VERY scary.

A classical ""Gothic novel Haunted House""-tale being transferred to a science fiction background with an empty, haunted spaceship - that sounded quite interesting and new. This movie could have been one of the best Science Fiction movies of all times - if it would have been done right. It started out quite good - the crew finding the ship and going aboard, but then the whole movie turned from a psychological, creepy and atmospheric film into a gorefest. When will Hollywood directors learn that real thrills are not produced by blood and gore, but by the things you DON'T see. A sound, a pounding, camera angles, music - THAT is what makes me shiver, the old ""to thrill is not to show"" recipe that leaves room for imagination, not the straight into the face thing with guts flying around. I really expected this movie to be a classical gothic novel-kind-of-thing in the tradition of movies like ""The Haunting Of Hill House"" (1963 version of course) or ""The Innocents"" (also the black/white version) but it turned out to be a cheap and gory movie in the tradition of  ""Nightmare on Elm Street"".

The ship unfortunatly disappears without a trace on its maiden voyage.  Seven years later the ship appears in Neptune's orbit and USAC (future NASA) sends the ship's creator William Weir (Sam Neil) along with a crew of astronauts lead by Captain Miller (Laurence Fishburne) They soon discover that the crew are not the only one onboard the ship....  Although the first few minutes of this movie are boring the excitment picks up rapidly as we see Weir's devotion to the ship become an obsession.

","For a film that lends heavily from the Alien series and a hint of 'The Haunting', it's the kind of fare we've seen before.  And since (see Sphere).<br/><br/>
After the 'Event Horizon' goes missing in deep space, it's arrival at the outer limits of our solar system sends a mixed bunch of astro-types to investigate.<br/><br/>What ensues is the kind of stuff that is best played loud (and 'big' would help!).  The set is fantastic looking stuff, but I can't help but worry that it was created by some sado/masochist on overdrive.  Not that that's a problem in itself, but when the 'horror' angle starts to kick in, it really gets gut-wrenching.

","I wanted to like it. Part of the problem is that it was misrepresented. People were expecting an Alien-style Sci-Fi epic but got this gothic Barkeresque haunted-house-in-space arty piece instead. The design and visual effects are stunning (although the techno-gothic look of the Event Horizon's interiors gets to be a bit too much - exterior-wise, though, it's one my favourite SF ships ever).<br/><br/>It's got a great cast - Neill, Fishburne and Isaacs in particular stand out. Pertwee is maybe a bit too blunt and hard-edged, Quinlan's character doesn't gel and Richardson doesn't have anything to do. I suspect it's the material they have to work with that presents the problem - Neill is great doing the obsessed scientist bit, but not his deranged Pinhead-from-Hellraiser turn.<br/><br/>The editing/pacing is definitely wrong - the little bits of printout that establish the story at the beginning are initially useful, but get to be annoying and clumsy, especially when the important bits get re-told later in dialogue. They have a 20-hour countdown, which they keep referring to, cutting off chunks of the remaining time with gay abandon - one minute they're down to 17 hours, then 4, all without doing them anything or any time seeming to really have passed.<br/><br/>And lastly, there's the shocks. All signposted with blaring blasts of sound that tell you THIS BIT IS SCARY. Those bits aren't scary, and you soon get bored (and a little deaf).<br/><br/>Final analysis? Blame the director. There's the germ of a good film here, but not in the hands of Paul Anderson, responsible for four incredibly schlock-y films (the others being Shopping, Mortal Kombat and Soldier)."

I was in desperate need of a good sound system -- I had to run a wire from my VCR to my Minidisc, then convert the left channel into two channels, so the sound was horrible when I watched it...oh, don't stop reading now, that was pretty boring.  Anyways, Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill did terrific performances as the head crew members of a ship to save Dr. Weir (Neill)'s beloved ship, the Event Horizon.  I don't want to get into terrific detail, but what was scary was the jump scenes (that's why I wanted a good sound system) and the eerie silence that comes with every sci-fi movie, but sometimes without good execution.  This is not the case for this movie.  I loved the fact that you have to ponder a few things about this movie, even after the credits roll.  To think about a ship that has been deserted for 7 years and you have no idea where it has been, is some scary s**t.

However, as they arrive with the vessel's designer, Dr. William Weir (Sam Neill), they discover corpses, disturbing home-videos and a great big gate in engineering. When Justin (Jack Noseworthy) enters the gate and then exits in a comatose-state, things take a turn for the twisted and the extremely nasty. Joining the cast is Joely Richardson as no-nonsense Lt.

The fact that the spaceship is like hell and that the engineer becomes possessed by it and how it knows what each one of the crew members fears the most proves my point. The physician who created the ship is shown to only care about the success of its mission and totally ignores and denies human reactions and wellbeing. I think this is to say that, wait a minute, we've gone too far. We've crossed our limits. He broke the relativity concept which means that he broke the rules. Just like neuroscience and genetical engineering and all this stuff. It should be stopped because in the end it's going to turn against us as if it has a spirit, just like the ship has a spirit. I can go on and on about this movie. I give an A+ to the writer and I don't really care about the special effects and costumes and stuff like that. But I think that the actors did their job.

Unless you cannot handle dark and very depraved scenes of violence, and cope with extremely depressing and distressing scenes, I wholeheartedly recommend this film.

","EVENT HORIZON would have made a watchable addition to the HELLRAISER series of films with a few changes. As it stands now, it's a barely memorable science-fiction/horror potboiler that, like so many other contemporary films (horror or otherwise), has a nasty streak. You don't need plastic monsters and gore effects to horrify; see THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT as confirmation of this. All EVENT HORIZON is missing are the Cenobites and judging by the film's ""vision of Hell"", they're really not that far away. And Sam Neill once again shows that he still has'nt grasped even the most rudimentery basics of acting."

I think everything about the movie was great. First movie I have ever covered my face b/c something was so gross. And the fact the plot was something impossible is why they call it science-fiction. But the concept that they can travel faster than light to me is just awesome. The effects in it are awesome. I dont complain about the gory-ness b/c THAT is what HORROR is suppose to be. ""Scream"" and ""I Know What You DId Last Summer"" were really stupid in my opinion. Scream, it was okay, but IKWYDLS was just totally and utterly boring to me. Im glad I didnt pay movie theatre prices to see it. I would have payed to see Event Horizon, though, and I wish I would've now. The actors are great, they do a wonderful job. The cast fits perfect. A caring captain (miller), a funny guy who keeps things down to earth (cooper), the paranoid guy (smith), a weird-science freak (weir), the baby (justin), the motherly woman (peters), and the serious woman (stark). I think this movie should get more credit than it has. I own this movie and watch it all the time. And someone said the ship looks like a toture-chamber...Makes it THAT much more better.

","People seem to have extreme opinions of this film -- as usual. It's tiring to read ""THIS MOVIE WAS THE BEST EVER!!!!"" and ""THIS MOVIE WAS THE WORST EVER!!!"" with glib explanations why.<br/><br/>""Event Horizon"" is an unusual movie, but I like it. Unlike other horror films, this one has a soul, and a theme. The theme is regrets.<br/><br/>First off, the characters and actors are first-rate. Laurence Fishbourne and Sam Neill particularly stand out. Fishbourne's character is more subtle than any roles I had seen him in -- save perhaps his ""Boyz N the Hood"" Furious Styles character. Sam Neill has the unenviable job of playing a character who goes whacko -- and not only does he have to go completely over-the-top, but he has to do it in an emotionally believeable manner.<br/><br/>Neill's character, before his transformation, is very sympathetic. In fact, one can't help but root for him to save himself. Hints of his extreme loneliness are echoed from the first shot of the film -- him inside a lonely sphere within a vast maze, constantly pulling back -- reminscient of the opening shot of ""Star Trek: First Contact"". He battles the demons within of his dead wife (having committed suicide due to her depression and obvious abandonment issues.)<br/><br/>There is evil in this movie, and it uses regret and loss to conquer. Neill's character is unable to deal with the pain of the loss of his wife, so evil provides him with an escape.<br/><br/>On another level, the movie is a fun terror ride. There is not as much gore as implied in these other posts. The movie's darkness is capably lightened somewhat by Jason Isaac's character.<br/><br/>One note: The movie's opening score probably marks the first time a hard-driving dark metal-techno beat was used to open a score -- but it works, in a big way. It's jarring enough in its incongruity for a horror sci-fi film it actually WORKS."
"Jeremy-93","Null","0","0","23 August 1999"," Distressingly ordinary, and too smugly self-enwrapped to scare
","Something's wrong with this movie, right at its heart, which is a pity because most of the superficial things are fine.  I hate to allegorize movie plots, but this ship really is powered by an imaginative black hole at its centre.  It turns out not to have an idea in; it just sucks ideas from elsewhere, then squishes them.  Several shots and one scene are lifted directly out of 'Solyaris'; the linking corridor on the Event Horizon is out of '2001', the atmosphere among the crew at the start is a slightly blander reworking of the first part of 'Alien'; there's the odd borrowing from Dante's Inferno.  But this is 'Solyaris' without the philosophy (and also without the unbearable poignancy, which made the philosophy not just palatable but riveting - also without Natalya Bondarchuk, which has to be a disadvantage), '2001' without the ... well, OK, without the boring bits, 'Alien' without the alien (more or less) and without the sense of focus and perfect timing - Ridley Scott's a much better director of relatively ordinary scripts - and Dante without the poetry.<br/><br/>This would be fine if the film was scary, which is what it sets out to be, but it isn't.  It's gory, very gory, and there are plenty of synthetic jolts, but it doesn't have that imaginative coherence that makes something fearful, because however unfamiliar the situation you can imagine being there, and you sure as hell don't want to be.  'Event Horizon' is at once too stupid and too knowing to scare.  It's very self-conscious, but with a completely genre-bound self-consciousness, so that watching it never becomes any more than watching a showcase for very good production design, ticking off genre references and waiting for the next crash on the soundtrack."

I also had problems with the ships orbit around Neptune. It was low enough in the atmosphere to be surrounded with clouds yet could remain at orbital speeds of tens of thousands of MPH and not burn up. I was able to predict the end of the movie (including the cheesy technique of leaving an ending which opens the possibility for a sequel) halfway through it.

","Sure it takes some stuff from other movies and uses it, but there aren't really that many movies anymore that don't borrow from other movies at least a little bit, mostly because just about everything has been done!  We've seen talking animals, tornadoes, dinosaurs, aliens, demons, sinking ships, explosions (although I gotta admit I can't get enough of those), mask wearing psychopaths, guns (those either), aliens, talking babies, car chases, aliens, more aliens, asteroids, etc. over and over again!  Sometimes making a good movie is taking stuff from other movies and rework them a little bit to make them better, thus adding a little bit of originality to stuff that's been seen before.  That's why many old TV shows are being remade.  Sure, many of the remakes suck, but what about ""The Fugitive,"" ""The Brady Bunch,"" and a few others I can't think of right now?  There are tons of movies about Titanic, yet nobody complained when the newest watered down, bad acted teeny-bopper version hit the theaters.  They made that piece of doodie the number one grossing movie!<br/><br/>This movie is like ""The Shining"" in space, but it adds a few plot elements here and there.  People complain about too much gore, and I think that those people are the moviegoers who call themselves horror movie fans but have only seen movies like ""Scream 1 & 2"" and ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" and all the other new horror movies that don't live up to what horror used to be.  I'm not saying ""Scream"" was bad, that was my first real horror movie too, but after that I went and checked out it's roots, ""Halloween,"" the original ""Nightmare on Elm Street,"" ""The Shining"", and many others.  Had I seen these before I'd seen ""Scream"" I would have looked at it as a totally different movie.  But I'm not talking about ""Scream,"" I'm talking about ""Event Horizon.""<br/><br/>It is more like the older horror movies, it doesn't water down the plot with a bunch of unnecessary and out-of-place humor.  It goes right where it should, the scary stuff.  Sure there might be a few plot holes, but who cares?<br/><br/>I feel sorry for people who analyze things that are scientifically or historically wrong with a movie when they watch it, because they aren't watching the movie for the reasons they should.  There were tons of historical mistakes in Titanic.  Star Wars has a lot of scientific mistakes with it.  Jurassic Park probably couldn't really happen.  In almost all movies set in the future, people have the power to travel at the speed of light and create wormholes, but our weapons are never quite good enough to kill a few acid-bleeding aliens or giant tank bugs.  My point is, suspend your disbelief when you are watching a movie to be entertained, you just might actually like what you're watching.  After you've seen it a few times then look for what's wrong with it, but don't hate it for what is wrong about it, like it for what is right about it.  If you must hate a movie, at least make sure that it's because of terrible acting or a bad script or something like that.  Don't hate a movie because it's not scientific fact or because it's too gory for you.  I gave this 7 out of 10, because I LIKED IT DAMMIT!"

This movie, as I said before, is not art. It doesn't want to be, I think.  At least it doesn't go for pretension to fool people into thinking the movie has far reaching poetic ideas.  But it is entertaining, to me.  That is, mainly because the film exhibits a certain Gothic atmosphere I like. Not that it's terribly original in that (or anything else for that matter), but its gothic sense is pushed into overdrive later in the film, expresses some simple, not too challenging but interesting ideas, gives you an action climax which is loathable for it being an action climax, but entertaining in its setup and execution, interesting designs (I like how the ship is shaped like a cross) and some extreme imagery and style.  Where the film excels, in my opinion, is its excessiveness.  It pushes the gore and horror over the edge beyond what you would have first imagined, and gives you genuine terror with this concept and showing you in a somewhat restrained manner, how it is.

His vision was of a film that, not unlike ""The Shining"", that didn't fair well on it's release, he hoped that ""Event Horizon"" would steadily gain followers over the years.<br/><br/>I really don't see why that shouldn't be the case. Although Anderson's more recent films haven't been much to shout about I think he still has a great imagination and better films will surely follow from him. I think ""Event Horizon"" should eventually become a real classic.<br/><br/>It's a great spin on 'monster horror', the irony and ingeniousity being there are no actual monsters. Not unlike other great horror's, you don't actually see the evil character in question, only the product of that evil which in this case is Sam Neill's character.<br/><br/>There great performances all around in particular Sam Neill and Kathleen Quinlan, it's not overly reliant on special effects, although the effects that are used are timeless, excellent makeup and pyrotechnics (apart from the dodgy early CGI engine coolant), it's excellently held together with timing and pacing which always keeps you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>The work on lighting especially creates the mood for a great horror. I think it's awesome"

","In the future, rapid space travel is possible through the use of black holes and ""folding"" the universe. One ship was built with that ability, but it was unfortunately lost and must be found.<br/><br/>Sounds pretty good, right? Yeah, that's what I thought. But it seems as if the writers couldn't figure out how to actually make that into a film. Or maybe the studio ran out of money partly through production because once the half-way point is reached, the movie becomes an awful gore-fest. While that might be appealing to some, I thought the second half of the movie was a huge disappointment. This movie is simply hard to watch because of it's blood and guts, AND the plot that seems to go nowhere after the introductions are done. Good Luck."
"pgdicko","8","2","5","19 January 2007"," The Best Sci-fi Horror film since 'Alien'.
","Since it's release in 1997, this film has not been given the credit it deserves. It has a great mix of science fiction, horror, and suspense. The director Paul W.S Anderson has since gone on to direct 'Soldier' and Alien VS Predator. But I Believe this is his finest work to date. The film creates an eerie, and terrifying feel with the help of incredible set designs, precision lighting and unique cinematography. The film also boasts a stellar cast which includes, Laurence Fishburne, Sam Neill, Joely Richardson, and Richard T. Jones who is brilliant as the extremely witty 'Cooper', he has some hilarious one liners and brings a little comedy to a genre where you would not usually see it, and probably would not want to, but somehow this film makes it work. It works because the mood of the film is still at the front of your mind and there is always an horrific and terrifying scene waiting around the corner. On the downside, I believe that the story could have been developed a little more. Perhaps with a more detailed explanation of what happened to the spaceship of the title. However, the fact that the story is very original was good enough for me."

","If there is one thing a horror film should be that's disturbing. That's why Hellraiser was so successful 1) because it portrayed hell as something very close to humans and 2) because it used pain as something that many people could get pleasure from. Hence ""Angels to some, demons to others"". Event horizon does have it's share of disturbance but could have been a lot more.<br/><br/>Firstly it would not have hurt if the studio had spent some more money on the film, so that the introduction sequence where the crew saves some miners from a fire could have been shot. Paul Anderson said that he incorporated some material from that sequence into the film, and it is true e.g. Miller saving his friend when he opens the pressure door and gets released into space without a suit, but an additional introduction sequence would have been better.<br/><br/>Indeed many scenes were cut from the film in order to tighten the pace but don't you think they went too far? I read about the plot before having watched the actual film, and I logically expected to see a sequence where the event horizon disappears and then get something like ""Seven years later"". However we are just told what happened, and you immediately get the idea that this picture was made for a moderate budget. Also a scene was filmed where Dr Weirr (Sam Neil), gets briefed about the Event Horizon's reappearance and convinces the man in charge to let him go with the rescue team. Now why was that cut out? It's probably part of the big studios wisdom, or stupidity if you ask me, which is ""Do not make the film too long"". This particular sequence, I believe, is of primary importance and gives us a longer introduction. The release version, I am sorry to say, kinda drops us into a story it wants to get on with and finish ASAP. I was surprised when I first saw it, no way I expected it to be that fast.<br/><br/>Unfortunately there's more like the above. Extended visions of hell and an orgy between the Event Horizon's original crew were also eliminated. Why? Because they seemed to be too freaky. Maybe the studio was not actually aware that this is a)a horror film and b)about hell. What did they expect to see in it? Kids with dolls?. Hellraiser is very bloody, why didn't it get chopped up?<br/><br/>It's not that I don't like the film, god I've given it 9/10, but it's so painful seeing something that could have been a lot more, get turned into a just good horror movie when it could have gotten a Hellraiser like status.<br/><br/>9/10 for it's good story, the black hole idea,the good performances and it's perception of hell.<br/><br/>Finally, Mr Anderson I hope that it won't take you much longer to release the director's cut you promised us."

","The first time I watched this movie me and my roommate made sure that we did not leave each other alone in the room unless it was time to sleep. Needless to say someone got locked outside the room and had to sleep in the cold all alone. There are not many good movies out there that can make a cut for a good thriller. This particular movie made it to a fairly good horror range. A very good collection of cast members (Lawrence Fishburn and Sam Niels being my favorites in the team) and a well thought out plot and special effects. Perhaps I am being partial on the special effects since this movie was made during a time where special effects did matter and it was not just computers that did the image trick. The movie did have its share of gruesomeness that did send some shivers down my back. It is one of the classic movies that I definitely want to own and also recommended to watch in groups or with your significant other. Even today I still consider this one of the classics that should be watched. Even though I admit that I cannot see Fishburn in the same serious manner after seeing him as cowboy Curtis in PeeWee's play house (what the hell was that? A gay cowboy?) but he is still one of the most top notch actors that stands side by side with Sam Niels."

Throughout the years whenever I would run into a discussion of horror movies with people I always brought up event horizon and people fall into two categories, either they agreed with me as being the scariest movie of all time, or they hated it ... no in between.<br/><br/>The premise of the movie is simple. In the distant future a space ship goes missing in the far reaches of our solar system mysteriously returning a few years later without its crew. A team of marines are send to Neptune to find out what happened to the ship and crew.<br/><br/>The special effects are pretty good, the ambiance/mood is dark and eerie, and the cast ... wow, I think they did an amazing job, with Laurence Fishburne how can you lose.<br/><br/>If your a sci-fi fan and/or a horror movie fan, this movie is definitely for you.

","This movie is just so difficult to forget. It lingers in your memory for a long time after you have seen it. Although none of the actors or their acting (except maybe Sam Neill), is memorable or worth mentioning, the movie is just so unnerving and disturbingly retained within. It starts out as a normal sci-fi looking movie and then progresses on to become an extraordinarily sci-fi cum horror flick. The movie can never be called boring because it leaves you at the edge of your seats on account of it's suspense and shock-value. The movie is certainly not for the faint-hearted and fickle-minded as it contains certain horrific scenes and gory visuals. The horror works quiet well at the psychological level too. The creators of the movie are certainly imaginative in using superb visuals and brilliant sets. The alleys and the corridors of the spaceship are so spooky and creates a claustrophobic environment."

If chicks don't like it, then they can walk it, if guys don't like it - then the poofters should hire out City of Angels and stop whinging. Afterall, it is their choice, stop moaning.<br/><br/>If you love suspense, gore and basically quite a warped sense of horror, then you should enjoy this. I not, then get something else.<br/><br/>Scenes involved people smothered against walls, crew killing each other in a sick and twisted ways (thrusting their fist down each others throat to rip their insides out, that kind of stuff) and quite a good looking part where one of the crew decompresses out in space.<br/><br/>Don't expect another type of hollywood movie where their are heroes, this is what films should be like. Simple story - Ship disappears, search and rescue rendevouz, board ship...oh dear, everything goes pear shaped and now everyone is trying to survive, but who are the lucky ones??!!<br/><br/>You will have to find out!<br/><br/>Oh, and another thing!!! Some critics claim parts of this film is snatched from other movies!!<br/><br/>WRONG!!!<br/><br/>They used clips from this!!

"Navaros","1","3","10","10 March 2008"," Terrible movie that MIGHT have been entertaining, scary, and good, as a 10 minute short film.
","Event Horizon is a bad B-movie with a SciFi/horror mix, and it fails in every area it tries to explore.<br/><br/>All the characters in Event Horizon have zero personality whatsoever. There is no reason to care about any of them.<br/><br/>All the dialogue is terrible. It made all the characters be generic talking heads that only ever say the most necessary, obvious things, in the most mundane way possible, in addition to them having no personality.<br/><br/>At least Laurence Fishburne had a strong screen intensity and performs great acting (as usual), which makes him interesting to watch for that reason alone. But none of the other characters even had that, so they were completely worthless. Sometimes bad movies can be elevated by great actors that make you care about their characters even when the movie has nothing else going for it. That ability is something an actor either has or doesn't have. Laurence Fishburne has that. Other than Laurence Fishburne, none of the actors in Event Horizon have that. Like Laurence Fishburne says in the classic gangster movie, ""Hoodlum"": ""Either you get it, or you don't"". Fishburne is the only actor in Event Horizon who *gets it*. He made his screen-presence in Event Horizon compelling despite having very little to work with in terms of what his (badly) scripted lines are and the bad script in general.<br/><br/>Event Horizon was extremely boring and barely scary at all. Most of the ""scares"" come from cheesy gimmicks rather than from legitimate ways, like having a very loud crashing sound effect suddenly play when a severed hand floats into someone's space helmet.<br/><br/>Event Horizon didn't really need to spend 5 minutes rehashing the tired old fold space/wormhole SciFi cliché that has been done ad nauseam over and over again for approximately the past 100 years. It is also very pompous the way this movie pretends it *invented* this concept, when it certainly did not.<br/><br/>There are very, very few entertaining/interesting/scary minutes of screen-time are in Event Horizon. Maybe 5, at the very most. That leaves 87 minutes of boring, monotonous screen-time that is filled with nothing but pointless filler. Nothing really happens in this movie until the last 5 minutes, It does not take 92 minutes to say: ""This ship broke the laws of physics, went to Hell as a result, and brought back some scary delusions/supernatural phenomenon"". But Event Horizon tries to pad-out that 5 minutes worth of content into 92 minutes worth of content, and the result is the total disaster of a movie that is Event Horizon.<br/><br/>I understand there is a concept called ""suspense"", but for suspense to work there must *first* be characters worth caring about. Event Horizon doesn't have any, so claiming that all the boring filler (approximately 87 minutes of this movie's 92 minute screen-time) exists for the sake of suspense isn't going to cut it. The *only* way that Event Horizon works on any level whatsoever is as a sleep-inducing miracle cure for those who suffer from insomnia.<br/><br/>Even *another* universally-panned (Event Horizon was also universally-panned) SciFi/horror movie with the same theme as Event Horizon, did the same theme much, much better. That movie is called ""Supernova"" starring James Spader, from the year 2000. James Spader and everyone in the movie Supernova make you care about them via outstanding charisma and great acting. Event Horizon is a major step *down* from Supernova. Event Horizon is an *even poorer* rehash of what was a very poor movie in the first place. It is no surprise that Paul W.S. Anderson career would continue to consist of creating bad B-movie SciFi productions and video game movies. That is exactly what Event Horizon was. No better of a bad B-movie than any of the rest of his movies that came before and after, all of which have the same very low quality as Event Horizon.<br/><br/>If Event Horizon was a 10 minute short film, it could have cut all the crap and had nothing but good, solid, scary, worthwhile entertainment in it. Instead of being that, Event Horizon is a terrible movie in every respect (other than Fishburne's excellent acting), with barely 5 minutes worth of of worthwhile entertainment in it."

","***Spoilers***<br/><br/>Hellaciously abstract. Horror offers many opportunities for such explorations.<br/><br/>A film about what a film does to the audience's eye. A film about Alice, about eye-holes, especially wormy ones. Unfortunately the director doesn't have a camera to match (what if Baz or Brian had been possessed by Tark? ahh, sweet worm hole).<br/><br/>A film about folding, the most important of which is folding space. And the space the film is trying to fold is the space between the film, (and hence also its creator's mind) and us.<br/><br/>And with a couple of better actors and a better director this would have been an absolute masterpiece. As it is, I think it is still one of the most successful attempts at bending the space between audience and film.<br/><br/>Alice is perhaps the richest, most multi-layered archetype to base a story on.<br/><br/>But how many Alice stories are all about the hole like this one is? What an intelligent focus for a story! So we see the story conflated to outer space, and self-referentially is most concerned about space, folding space.<br/><br/>And like most Alice stories, this is about a ""dream"" that contains 3 Alices.<br/><br/>The red-headed dead wife who haunts from real life, the auburn-haired Mama bear who mirrors her death, and Goldilocks who survives with newly rouged tresses.<br/><br/>The film begins with us/the camera entering a wormhole; then we follow the rabbit's dream until we come out the other side by exiting through Alice's dream (as she is released from the other side of the Looking Glass). Pefect framing by the writer.<br/><br/>Being an Alice story, and focused on holes, one would think there would be some sex in the story. It's hard to find, but there is. In the background of the story's ""reality"", and rightfully at the greatest abstract distance from the main story, sex is placed within the dreams about the mad doctor's real wife (a dream within the dream, or a play within the play). Dreams about a wife who committed suicide over the death of the creation of that hole-entering sex---the hole-exiting child. The wife falls through the hole of death, mirrored by the death of Mama Bear in the ship.<br/><br/>What a wonderful ship, what wonderful set design. The cross-section of the ship is designed in the shape of an eye, the gateway as its pupil, and the umbilical passage as the optic nerve that travels back to the bridge/brain.<br/><br/>The eye is referenced everywhere, reflecting the eye of the writer, the eye of the director, the eye of the camera and the eye of the audience. The writer is able to conflate all these levels by using a worm(hole) that is eating its own tale. I.e., the film is about a story that happens in the mind's eye. On one side of the gateway this is happening in the creator's mind's eye and on the other side the audience's, folding us right into the film, and/or it's creator into us. These two worlds are separated by a couple of dams, the director & our own eyes, which the writer needs us to remove to merge our worlds.<br/><br/>The only survivors are us, the creator---neither unscathed---and the black sheep child of this enterprise, the film, its folded self represented by an actor who has a lot to learn about folded acting, but at least achieves some folding by doing himself doing Denzel doing the character Cooper.<br/><br/>Notes: The ghosts of many other horror films haunt this movie and the ship as it would also haunt the minds of its writer and its audience. Quotes by annotating not plagiarizing. For eg., Weir references Hell-raiser at the end as that is what he is in the literal mode of the story.<br/><br/>The sets mirror the film's notions, especially the gateway room and the stasis room. The production designer was well aware of the script's layers.<br/><br/>The score was well-suited and relatively minimalist.<br/><br/>Muted symbols like the planet Neptune (echoes of Odysseus), the hints of dualism in the opening typed narrative (and those graphics inherent reference to the writer as the faithful narrator), the floating tools, etc... all used well.<br/><br/>Some nice layering in the shots, and the framing is decent, but overall the direction was unimaginative and could have used a more mobile camera, one that finds its inner worm.<br/><br/>But with such frightfully marvelous writing...<br/><br/>Three out of three"

","The titel ""Event Horizon"" references either the end of the known universe or the sphere around a blackhole. In other words, we don't know anything about what's behind. The concept of opening a portal to hell isn't unique, but the combination with such sci-fi-aspects (explore the unknown) makes it work pretty well. Many people criticize the acting and the visual effects in this, but I compare it to other horror movies or other animated films from that era and that actually makes it look good. I probably overrate Event Horizon by a large margin, because I watched it when I was young and it almost scared me to death. But even when I watch it today, I see a solid Sci-Fi-Horror movie with a good story, many disturbing scenes and a great deal of space adventure. In my opinion, it follows in the footseps of the best in the genre like Alien 1979 or The Thing 1982. It's a shame, that this kind of movies are pretty rare these days, since the genre has so many possibilities for a great horror story."

If you are looking for a horror movie with a little more wits than average, this movie could be for you.
On a technical note:
<ul><li>Nobody would design a bridge that you would have to explode to separate a ship into 2 sections, that makes no sense. If one wanted the possibility of separating a ship in two, you would design a locking mechanism that you can lock and unlock at will.</li><li>If a crew starts having hallucinations and acting on it, the first order to make, as a commander, is that nobody can be by themselves.

It has a working crew ship that are out to secure and bring back Event Horizon; a ship that has been lost for years. What they don't know is Event Horizon brought something malevolent that is out to them doom all to hell. It is a simple movie, but it is the outcome and horror elements that make this movie a fun ride.

","I first saw this movie in 1998 and it has always stuck with me. While certainly not perfect, there are some excellent (albeit gory) visuals, much of the acting is solid, and the first half of the film does a great job building up suspense.<br/><br/>The story does play around with mind games, hallucinations, and drawing on the characters' past traumas. At times, if you're unable to suspend disbelief, this can make characters appear foolish as they chase after a character that couldn't possibly be there or otherwise see things they should logically know are not real. But if you can wrap your mind around this being much more than horror-character stupidity, you begin to realize just how insidious the evil in this movie is.<br/><br/>Sam Neill has done other horror and I think he's underrated when it comes to his appearances in the genre. He does a great job throughout here, adjusting his performance well as his character goes through major changes.<br/><br/>There aren't many decent sci-fi/horror films out there. While this one certainly doesn't surpass classics like Alien, it is a suspenseful, creepy film that continues the genre's tradition of asking big, frightening questions. I definitely recommend it to any fans of dark science fiction."
"dworldeater","7","1","2","18 February 2018"," Pretty cool and bleak sci fi shocker
","Event Horizon is a very dark and well acted science fiction/horror hybrid from director Paul WS Anderson. The plot is complex and principally involves our cast going into space to investigate and find the vessel Event Horizon. I would say this is more for sci fi fans than horror fans, but there is more than enough tension, suspense and grisly images to please horror fans. A lot of this stuff is psychological and the special f/x are outstanding. Early on in the film, much is lost due to an overemphasis on technical jargon(which sci fi fans I am sure love), but later on the film picks up and goes full throttle into dark and horrific territory. There are nods to Hellraiser and The Shining as well as the Alien series. Lawrence Fishburne and Sam Neil are both excellent in this. Event Horizon is in many ways a flawed film but it is an interesting watch and much recommended for fans of dark science fiction."

","I wonder if this movie was intended as a horror or just a dark sci-fi because there wasn't anything really creepy except for the look of the ship Event Horizon - its face resembles that alien from the Ridley Scott movies! The effects are quite good and there's also tense moments when the rescue crew docks with the ship and goes in to check for survivors. The performances are OK but I felt the choice of actors could have been better - Laurence Fishburne and Same Neill are the only ones who really held my attention. Some scenes confuse especially how a certain dead character comes back and attack the rest of the survivors. With the effects and the atmosphere they attempted to create, this movie had lots of box-office potential but failed to deliver as expected. Verdict - with lots of misses than hits, there was nothing much even Laurence Fishburne could do to save Event Horizon(ship or the movie)...a forgettable, one-time watch."
"t-viktor212","5","1","2","11 March 2017"," Could have been developed much better
","It's been a while since I've reviewed a film on IMDb, but on this one I felt the urge to do so. Event Horizon has a well-thought premise, which simply fails to become anything good. The ""starship in distress"" trope has been used in many films, and much better. One such film was Solaris.<br/><br/>The fact is, I enjoyed Event Horizon's first half or so. It had some stupid jump scares, all right, but until then, the mystery was well executed. I believe the story started to get stupid and ridiculous when a certain video showed up.<br/><br/>Who's seen Solaris (mind, the 1972 Tarkovskij film) might remember a similar plot: a Space station near a planet reports of certain anomalies that occur on board, as well as the breakdown of the scientists working on the station, and a Psichologist, Kris, is sent. When the Kris gets aboard, a long series of really unsettling and scary events and circumstances ignite to the viewer, and what's relevant, with almost no gore. Some might say Solaris is boring, but, damn it isn't. It's very scary, and also much deeper than many movies. Now, Solaris is also a masterpiece of cinema. Is it fair to confront this film and Solaris?<br/><br/>The fact is, that the story of the two films is similar. Sam Neill's character is in this movie's first half in almost the same situation as Kevin, there's the theme of the unknown and the alien dealt with in a similar manner, the setting is almost entirely one space ship / station's corridors.<br/><br/>So whats's the difference? The way the material was dealt with. Solaris is clever, unsettling, lets the viewer have deep thoughts but also freaks him out. Event Horizon is, on the other hand, full of Jumpscares (a quite cheap way of scaring the viewer), mentions superficially some aspects that might have been dealt more deeply (e.g. what happened to the ship), and destroys all the premises it built up in the last 30 minutes, letting go to a flow of endless gore (another cheap way of scaring the viewer). Even the ending wasn't satisfying. <br/><br/>All the actors did the best they could, Sam Neil for example executed well his role, even in the final arc, even if I personally hated that part of the film. VFX and photography, for a 97 movie, were fine-ish, as well, also I remember that I appreciated some shots and even the set designs. The technical side of the film was well executed. What went wrong, terribly wrong, was the story, and the ultimate meaning of the film.<br/><br/>The movie's first 20 minutes made me want to give it an 8/10, the next 30 minutes a 6/10. The final arc was worth a 3/10. Therefore, I feel right to give it a 4.75/10, approximated via IMDb rating system to 5/10."
"MaximumMadness","8","1","2","3 January 2017"," ""Event Horizon""- Just a solid, fun sci-fi horror experience.
","""Event Horizon"" is one of those films that came out at just the right time, even if it didn't seem like it at first. The brainchild of director Paul WS Anderson and writer Philip Eisner, the movie is a certified cult phenomena. Despite being a moderate financial flop at initial release and garnering decided mixed critical reception, the film quickly found a new life in the home video and rental market, and even now, 20 years later, it remains a favorite for fans of horror and suspense. It became one of the most popular films of the 90's in a weird way thanks to its second life, and I do think it is for good reason- while by no means is ""Event Horizon"" a ""great"" film, it is most certainly great fun. Mildly creepy, well constructed and oftentimes disturbing, it's a very solid sci-fi scare fest.<br/><br/>About thirty years in the future, the space-vessel ""Event Horizon"" mysteriously reappears off the orbit of Neptune, after having been thought to be long-since lost. A rescue vessel- the Lewis and Clark- is sent on a mission to track down the fabled ship and see if there are any survivors. On board is a colorful cast of characters, including the Event Horizon's lead designer Dr. William Weir. But it turns out that not all is well- the ship seems to desolate... its crew dead and its mysterious gravity-drive core acting strangely. It soon becomes clear that when its experimental warp drive was activated, the ship crossed into a dark and hellish dimension that drove its crew insane and brought back a mysterious force that now threatens to destroy the Lewis and Clark and its crew. And so the crew of Weir, Captain Miller, Lieutenant Starck and several others are forced into a fight for survival against this mysterious presence...<br/><br/>One of the more remarkable things about the film is the sheer Gothic and claustrophobic style that director Anderson injects into each and every frame, and how well it helps to tell the tale with a devilish glee. While he's perhaps best known now as the director of the long-running and wildly divisive ""Resident Evil"" film franchise, Anderson has always been a relatively competent visual storyteller and he has a great eye for style and composition. Building off of the tension and tonality of Eisner's script (which was reportedly re-written by an uncredited Andrew Kevin Walker), Anderson builds an adequate and often frightening sense of mood and tension, and his keen use of both practical and digital effects comes much appreciated.<br/><br/>The performances of the cast are quite good, especially for being a relatively serious attempt at a genre film at a time when horror was taking a turn towards the humorous thanks to properties like ""Scream"" injecting a subversive sense of self-awareness. Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neil in particular excel as our two leads in Captain Miller and Dr. Weir. Fishburne plays a really good authoritative figure in Miller, though he plays it smart and gives small hints of pathos and self- doubt that become apparent more and more as the film moves along, and it gives what could otherwise have been a boring Mary-Sue character a great deal more depth as a result. Neil is just a blast as Dr. Weir, who is haunted by his own demons of the past and goes through some radical changes as the film goes on. Supporting roles by the likes of Jason Isaacs, Joely Richardson and Richard T. Jones are for the most part well-played, though I did find Jones a bit on-the-nose with his more stereotypical role as the ""comedic relief.""<br/><br/>Really, the only thing the film suffers for are a few contrived sequences that feel artificial and over-written and for some admittedly dated sequences that just don't hold up quite well. While I do applaud Anderson for mostly mixing his effects between practical and digital, the early half of the film is way too over- reliant on really bad-looking CGI, and it kind of takes you out of the scene for a moment whenever a digital bottle or digital book floats by in zero-gravity. There's also a bit too much effort put into just grossing out the audience or making them jump, and it cheapens the more legitimate sequences of terror. Yes, we know it's fun to toss gore at the screen and insert random jump-scares... but save it for the slasher films and not pictures like this that are genuinely and consistently well-made and frightening without goo and gore and jumps. There's also one really bad dream sequence early on that I won't spoil... but it almost ruins the mood right off the bat. Thankfully, the film quickly recovers and it gets better very quickly, but I definitely think the film could have done without it.<br/><br/>But those are really just minor issues in an otherwise fun, engaging and often freakish and frightening tale of terror. There's a reason ""Event Horizon"" eventually found its audience and is still a relatively popular and entertaining bit of sci-fi horror... and that's because it's just so much fun. It's got an intriguing enough plot, wonderful direction and freakish visuals that will stick with your mind, and a really great cast that give it their all. Is it one of the best films of the 90's? No. But I'd venture to say it's one of the most easily rewatchable and fun releases of its decade and I know for sure that even twenty years from now, people will still get a kick out of it.<br/><br/>I give ""Event Horizon"" a very good 8 out of 10."
"thelastblogontheleft","8","1","2","27 November 2016"," Sci-Fi Awesomeness
","This was my second viewing of Event Horizon and I loved it even more than the first. I've heard it described as some kind of bizarre lovechild of Alien and Hellraiser and while I agree that it pays homage to both (I mean, Clive Barker DID consult on the movie in pre-production), it's definitely its own strange beast. It's also worth noting that this film did not do well upon its release, grossing only $47 million or so, not even recouping its $60 million production budget.<br/><br/>It's likely that I'm going to love any horror, sci-fi, or thriller based in space. Not only is space completely bad ass and fascinating on its own, but it's a TERRIFYING setting for literally anything to go wrong. YOU'RE IN SPACE. There's nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, no way to escape hell, there's often not even a reliable way to communicate with anyone outside of your own ship/base. It's isolating in the best (and worst) kind of way.<br/><br/>In Event Horizon, it's the crew of the Lewis and Clark — including the fearless Captain Miller (played by Laurence Fishburne) — who are heading out to explore the mysteriously re-appeared Event Horizon after receiving a distress signal. It had disappeared during its maiden voyage 7 years prior, so they are on a mission to see what went wrong, and they've brought along the ship's designer, Dr. William Weir (played by Sam Neill).<br/><br/>It's pretty obvious from the get-go that something went horribly wrong. They find the crew all massacred. They check out the core of the ship which is one of the coolest damn things I've seen anywhere (and was originally supposed to have a much more sleek, futuristic look until Paul W.S. Anderson, the director, decided to give it a more mechanical, interlocking design as a homage to Hellraiser's puzzle box), and when the ship's gravity drive is knocked into action, it activates and then one of the crew puts his freaking arm through it (I am continually amazed by how many movie characters will just put their body into another dimension) and goes full blown catatonic from what he saw on the other side, and shortly after attempts suicide and is put into stasis.<br/><br/>The entire crew experiences intense hallucinations that seem to be catered to their own fears and emotions. They are, of course, stranded at this point, since the Lewis and Clark was damaged and repairs are taking longer than they hoped. They find the last video log of the Event Horizon's crew and it is messed up, including the captain holding up his just gouged out eyes and warning ""liberate tuteme ex inferis"" (""save yourself from hell""). CHILLS. Things are not going well and they soon come to realize that the ship has, thanks to its gravity drive, managed to get to some kind of otherworldly (and obviously hellish) dimension, and now has a life of its own, its only goal to lure its passengers back to hell. Crap.<br/><br/>""You can't leave. She won't let you.""<br/><br/>The tension is, understandably, high throughout the entire movie. Even before things start to go wrong, it's made clear that the crew is not excited about their voyage, having been called off of a scheduled leave to make it. The atmosphere, though, is what really makes it. You are just creeped out the entire time. It's not even in the same realm as a movie that centers around a serial killer or any kind of single being wreaking havoc. It's THE SHIP YOU'RE TRAVELING IN. The ship you're stuck in is literally trying to destroy you and drag you to hell. Creepy doesn't begin to cover it. It has a decent amount of gore and disturbing images, so it's interesting to know that Anderson had to cut a good 30 minutes from his original version of the movie to appease the test audiences and studio (which he apparently regretted later).<br/><br/>""I created the Event Horizon to reach the stars, but she's gone much, much farther than that. She tore a hole in our universe, a gateway to another dimension. A dimension of pure chaos. Pure evil. When she crossed over, she was just a ship. But when she came back she was alive! Look at her, Miller. Isn't she beautiful?""<br/><br/>There's also some fantastic scenes that stick out in my mind. The frozen body that had been previously floating around smashing to the ground (and to pieces) when the gravity is switched back on. The sound of Peters' son scraping against the plastic on the exam table during one of her hallucinations. Dr. Weir traveling through the green duct with the lights strobing on and off. Justin snapping back into reality while he's in the airlock and starting to panic, begging ""Mama Bear, open the door"". When they realize they made a mistake in the transmission translation, originally thinking it said ""save me from hell"" but now knowing it said ""save yourself from hell"". Just so good. And the sole survivors are a black man and a woman, so, BONUS."

If you like horror movies, you'll really like this one and if you like sci-fi too then you'll love it. I had my daughter watch it but it scared the crap out of her.<br/><br/>All the negative reviews out there seem to be from people who thought it was just a sci-fi and not realizing it's really a horror movie set in space.

Event Horizon's designer Dr. William Weir (Sam Neill) joins them and tells the crew about its innovative gravity drive.<br/><br/>The design is interesting and this has the potential to be a pretty good sci-fi horror. This is essentially a haunted house but the chaos overwhelms the movie. Sam Neill doesn't really fit as the mad scientist type. That role needs somebody creepier. Captain Miller is too clueless.

There are also a few scenes that are oddly and unintentionally comedic, such as with Cooper in space. Regardless, some of the establishing shots are very impressive as well as some of the special effects.

","This movie was a big buzz back then, but I never managed to watch it in time, so only now I have done that. Well, sometimes, even the great casting does not help - as neither Sam Neill nor Lawrence Fishburne do save this mediocre plot from miserable plodding and very pathetic ending. The plot is very trite and does not leave any thrill or mystery very soon. Yes, very soon you can easily predict the next step and say what will happen and to whom. This is not good, as the trite plot is never an asset but rather a pending tail, that leaves no place for excitement. The very idea of the lost spaceship and lost crew is very old and very quickly the gore comes in, leaving no time to think or ponder. Well, this is a very good work, and this movie leaves you with a very bated feeling of disillusionment and slight boredom - what, is that all that this is? There are better films in this genre, so do not waste time on this one"
"Hey_Sweden","7","1","2","14 September 2013"," Creepy at times.
","Right from the beginning, it may be clear that ""Event Horizon"" owes a pretty big debt to ""Alien"" (but then, so do many other post-1979 films) but it does have a fairly interesting story and it does live up to the word ""horror"". It gets substantially unnerving and creates some wonderfully horrific imagery. In fact, as films of this type go, it's a pleasure in terms of the visuals - special effects, sets, cinematography. Devotees of these genres should find it to be solid if not exceptional entertainment. They may find the ""science"" ludicrous, but still be amused.<br/><br/>In the year 2047, an exploratory spaceship, the ""Event Horizon"" of the title, has reappeared after having been lost for seven years. A U.S.A.C. team is launched to find out what happened, and rescue any possible survivors. They do this in the company of the ships' designer, William Weir (Sam Neill), who has a tragedy in his past, and members of the team bring their own baggage to the situation, with no-nonsense Captain Miller (Laurence Fishburne) in charge of the mission. What they learn is that the ship now seems to be ""alive"", and aware of what has happened in the teams' pasts.<br/><br/>The script by Philip Eisner is not without humour, but it mostly plays things straight, and the cast performs it with real gravity. Fishburne is good as a rock-solid type of man, while Neill gets a chance to tear into the scenery as Weir becomes more and more deranged. Kathleen Quinlan is affecting as Peters, who is having to deal with child custody issues in her personal life. Joely Richardson is good as efficient team member Starck, and Richard T. Jones, Jack Noseworthy, Jason Isaacs, and Sean Pertwee round out the cast.<br/><br/>Things get off to a nice start with Paramount putting a fun spin on their standard logo sequence, and director Paul Anderson guides everything with style.<br/><br/>""Event Horizon"" may be derivative in some ways, but it moves along well and is never dull.<br/><br/>Seven out of 10."

"jklimentowski","5","1","2","17 December 2012"," I wasn't amazed by this movie
","A horror science-fiction movie. When I think of this genre I always have ""Alien"" on my mind. I think this is a perfect example. Unfortunately ""Event Horizon"" lacks both in the horror and science-fiction parts.<br/><br/>As for the science fiction - well it is just not realistic enough. Of course not all movies should be as realistic as ""2010: Space Odyssey"", but still when you compare it to ""Alien"" it turns out quite poor. Actually there is not much realism or physics in it at all. OK - the idea of time-space folding is nice, but the idea itself is at least as old as The Dune movie, or perhaps even older. I liked the scene of transition from zero gravity to artificial-earth gravity with fluids and bodies instantly dropping. The decompression sequence tries to be more horror like than scientific... and that is all I think. The rest is just pure fantasy.<br/><br/>So forget about science-fiction - is it a good horror? This might be a difficult question for me as most horrors make me laugh rather than scare mostly due to their stupidity and lack of realism. There are of course exceptions like Alien or The Thing. What makes the difference? I think it is the realism of the situation. I really can't be scared by ghosts which can do anything. It is just too unreal - I can not place myself in such a world and my imagination fails. Unfortunately Event Horizon is a movie it this ghost type. Anything can happen therefore I do not feel like one of the terrified crew members, rather I wonder what could the director think of next. Of course there are some more or less scary moments, but these are just typical horror tricks - sudden action with a proper sound effect. There is no feel of terror while watching the movie.<br/><br/>Another thing at which the movie fails is the plot. While the beginning sequences are quite interesting with every minute the plot becomes more and more chaotic. At some stage one really gets bored as it seems that there is no real goal or solution of the plot. One by one some things happen which try to scare you, but there is no logic in them. I can imagine that such a movie could last for a long time with random scary adventures happening to the characters until all of them are dead. But what is the point of watching that? Unfortunately the ending is also quite predictable and gives you no satisfaction of discovering something interesting or an unexpected solution. It is just as plain as that.<br/><br/>OK - so is the movie really so bad? Well it is not a perfect movie, but not a terrible one either. One can watch it and have some fun but it is not a movie that you would like to come back to after years. Just see once, have fun and forget.<br/><br/>It is worth to mention that the move has it's own style. While placed in future all the ships and equipment sometimes look like designed in the past. I can't describe it exactly but sometimes I had a feel of watching a sci-fiction movie from the fifties. Why did the director decide to chose such a scenography instead of pure futuristic one? No idea but I think it works fine."

","I hadn't seen ""Event Horizon"" in over a decade when I picked up the Special Collector's Edition DVD a while ago on a whim. I remembered it as being a pretty good sci-fi/horror flick but I wasn't sure if it'd still hold up. Also, knowing the background of studio interference, I was curious to see what sort of material was left on the cutting room floor.<br/><br/>Now, with the benefit of several more years of movie-watching experience, I can see that the movie is highly derivative. But at least Anderson & company chose good films to borrow from. The general concept of a 'haunted house movie in space' echoes ""Alien"" but Anderson has said himself that his main influences were Kubrick's ""The Shining"" & Wise's ""The Haunting"". Though the film blatantly copies scenes from both of these films and at least a couple of others, this general concept invests the film with some degree of originality.<br/><br/>That's not to say that the story completely works, though. Some of the details are intentionally vague, which could equally be the result of sloppy writing. The fact that the third act devolves into a fairly standard action movie climax also undermines the careful building of suspense that provides the bulk of the film's memorable moments.<br/><br/>As for the cast, it's not bad but most of the actors are shackled by their clichéd characters. Laurence Fishburne & Sam Neill are solid as always but this isn't exactly the best material they've had to work with. The rest of the cast also perform their functions well, even if their characters don't offer anything we haven't seen countless times before.<br/><br/>In terms of production values, ""Event Horizon"" holds it's own for the most part. Despite being only the second best Paul Anderson working in Hollywood today, Paul W.S. Anderson's direction isn't bad. There are some nice shots from time to time and he does a good job of establishing (and maintaining) the film's atmosphere. The visual effects are generally pretty good, though I was less than impressed with some of the 'burning man' visuals.<br/><br/>Ultimately, ""Event Horizon"" has some memorable scares but its shortcomings limit its appeal to a cult following. A director's cut would probably improve matters a little but I highly doubt that the movie would rise anywhere near the level of the films that it imitates. Nevertheless, it is worth watching as one of the better science fiction/horror hybrids out there."

","Recently, I've been having a huge Sci-fi movie marathon and last night I watched this one. I decided to watch it as the game, Dead Space is known for taking some of the characteristics from this movie and implementing them into the game. However, there is a long list of things I hated about this movie, but at the top must be the poor acting. For example, (for people who've seen the movie) the scene where Dr. William Weir (Sam Neill) has a nightmare in Stasis is laughable. Literally laughable. To add to that Sam Neill really doesn't suit being a ""baddy"". I really can't see him having a bad bone in his body. Like a cool uncle... who saves you from Dinosaurs. What I did like about the movie, is basically everything that Dead Space took from it. The effects the ship has on its inhabitants and the way the some characters go insane makes the movie bearable. Another aspect of the movie I liked was the sense of being alone, millions of miles from Earth, and I feel this movie did do this well. 3 out of 10, pretty poor, some good scenes I guess... and loved how a black guy survived :D"
"oneguyrambling","8","1","2","17 December 2010"," Deserved cult classic. Excellent and effective space horror flick.
","Event Horizon is at once frustrating and effective, the frustration comes in revisiting the film and realizing that while there is much to admire, there could actually be so much more. The effectiveness comes from the lengthy build up and gradual escalation to the climax that largely lets you ignore the film's failings.<br/><br/>Realistically there have been many films set in space over the years, more than a few have aspired to including horror elements, not many have been as well made as this.<br/><br/>Event Horizon is a promising film - I keep waiting for the rumoured ""more violent and full on"" Director's cut - unfortunately Paul Anderson didn't build on this promise as everything he has done since has far more commercial leanings, Resident Evil and Death race included.<br/><br/>Perhaps he has simply plateaued and it is his destiny to make films with a few good bits, but generally no depth or lasting qualities - or perhaps he likes counting the money made from crappy Resident Evil sequels? ()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*() The Event Horizon was a deep space exploration vessel, but it disappeared on its maiden voyage in 2040. It is now 2047 and the thing has simply reappeared. This has resulted in what they term a rescue mission, but is really a ""what the f*ck happened?"" mission.<br/><br/>The team boss-man is Laurence Fishburne (who is still amazingly underrated) and his crew include 7 other members, 6 guys and 2 gals.<br/><br/>After a 56 day hypersleep the crew awake very near their destination ()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*()*() Before commencing the mission proper Dr Weir (Sam Neill) explains wassup. It comes to light that he was the designer of the Event Horizon, and that it is actually a vessel capable of traveling at greater than thought possible speed due to its ability to ""bend space"" to suit its needs.<br/><br/>My argument is if they thought faster than the speed of light travel wasn't plausible then how the hell are we expected to swallow ""bending space""? Because this isn't Star Trek, that's why, sh*t just happens to justify the sh*t that follows.<br/><br/>Once aboard the crew search for clues that may explain what happened, both to the ship and previous crew. There are signs that something is a little ""off"" but nothing conclusive until one of the younger crew members reaches the core of the ship and things go awry. To add insult to injury the rescue vessel the ""Lewis & Clark"" is damaged and if unrepaired would run out of air within a short time. Always the way.<br/><br/>So with the young crew member Justin catatonic the survivors come up with theories, the overriding theme being that the ship won't let them leave and is in fact evil itself. Another neat wrinkle is that the ship is perhaps opening doorways to other dimensions, and not all of them are nice. The good Doc pooh-poohs such theories immediately, even as the crew openly wonder exactly where the Event Horizon might have been for the last 7 years.<br/><br/>Shortly afterwards they manage to access the ships' videolog, which gives some pretty gory clues as to what may have happened to the previous crew. Think a picnic on the beach, only with cannibalism, self mutilation and orgies of violence and you'll be pretty close to the mark.<br/><br/>Sooooooo understandably everyone wants out. Now. As they prep for their escape each of them sees things and people from their past, often that only they themselves know about and whose stories they have kept hidden for many years. The ship, or something aboard, is preying on their personal fears and affecting their psyche.<br/><br/>So we get many scenes that are actually quite tense and disturbing, even though we often don't know exactly what is the problem aside from ""why is that strange new guy/kid/woman on board all of a sudden?"" There are some good gore scenes and notable death scenes that pull no punches and make me curious as to what the full-on unreleased version contained, if exploding eyes and having sex while simultaneously appearing to eat your partner isn't enough then I am confused.<br/><br/>You also haven't seen Sam Neill like this, his Dr Weir and the ship seem to have a bizarre and disturbing synergy, and he grows very protective of his bubba as it becomes obvious what the others have in store for it.<br/><br/>I haven't mentioned the other crew simply because there is no need, they are there to further the story and either die horribly or cheat death. But I will say that they are effective and no-one lets the team down too much. I wanna bag Joely Richardson a little but her sister (Liam Neeson's missus) died last year so I'll cut her some slack.<br/><br/>Event Horizon is filled with freaky imagery, effects and in the latter stages makeup. The production design is first rate with everything looking suitably space-ey even though I think this was a pretty low budget film. The finale didn't quite meet the promise of the first hour or so, but before the bang-bang ending Event Horizon enjoyed a first rate build up and deserves its place in all the underrated lists that it finds itself on, even if it is a step down from the greats.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 8 / 10. The guys on Family Guy were right. There are scenes and images that are worthy of discussion. Even if ultimately the film never rises to greatness in any way there are some small touches that elevate this above many also-rans."

","Many films have explored the paradox of being trapped in the infinite vastness of space, and ""Event Horizon"" joins the club.<br/><br/>This blend of sci-fi and visceral horror is never much better than a cut-rate version of ""Alien,"" but at its best it does manage an effectively claustrophobic atmosphere and a sense of creeping dread. But the film's best moments are a distant memory by the time the last 20 minutes or so have played out, and we watch a scary premise collapse under the weight of its attempt to make sense. Many of the final scenes are just silly, and the very end is a clunker.<br/><br/>Movies like this don't need terrific actors, but it could have used one better than Laurence Fishburne, who has the largest role and never acts like anything more is at stake in this life and death scenario than whether or not he's going to get the salad dressing he asked for.<br/><br/>Grade: C+"

","""Event Horizon"" is a scattershot horror movie which plays like a cross between ""Alien"" and ""Hellraiser"". The idea here is that a spaceship breeches the event horizon of a black hole, ""travels to hell"", and is then spat back out into real space. A rescue party is then sent to ascertain what happened to the ship. They board the ship, realise that the ship's been to hell, and are assaulted and possessed by various demonic forces.<br/><br/>The film's quality is all over the place, but it has at least four very unique visuals, and a couple hellish (and very imaginative) designs. The film was notoriously chopped down after being shown to test audiences. 40 minutes were lost, most of which were packed with various devilish creatures, designs and surreal/nightmarish special effects shots. These shots, which were infamous for being very disturbing, were available on bootleg VHS and various places on the internet for a while, but have now been destroyed (some appear on youtube).<br/><br/>7/10 - Like ""Fire In The Sky"" this is one of those films in which the art department and production consultants hijack the film and do their own great work independent of the director."

","Event Horizon follows the crew of the rescue ship, ""Lewis and Clark"", as they embark on a mission to respond to a distress signal emitted by a ship that disappeared seven years ago, the Event Horizon. At the time it disappeared, the Event Horizon was testing out a new drive allowing it to create a wormhole for instantaneous travel. However, something went terrible wrong.<br/><br/>This is a rather good written film. All the elements to make a successful horror film is there and so are the characters. No, the story is not all too great, in fact if you think about it it is rather stupid and the characters could've been better, but all in all it could have been a lot worse. The only good thing about this story is that it's set on a space ship, in a locked environment. It is really not the story that is scary about this movie. Towards the end when the solution comes and there are a lot of story going on it actually starts to look more like an action movie. What makes this movie scary is the mood and the atmosphere.<br/><br/>The acting is OK. The characters are not great so you don't get this connection too them and the actors does a decent job in bringing them to life. Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill are too good leads and the others does a decent job as well.<br/><br/>When it comes to cinematography there are nothing special that stands out. It's all over good with some occasional cool shots, but you've seen them all before. There are nothing too great and original about them, but they are good and along with very good lightning they are an essential part of what creates the atmosphere witch makes this movie scary.<br/><br/>Something that needs to be given a lot of credit for this movie being as scary as it is, is the production design. The interior of the Event Horizon and also the ""Clark"" for that matter is excellent. It is creepy and good looking.<br/><br/>The third element besides cinematography and production design that creates the atmosphere and mood and makes this movie creepy is the music/sound design. The music is good and moody, but they also make the absence of music a powerful tool.<br/><br/>As for special effects they are good. The CGI is nothing groundbreaking. It's simply good looking, not too obvious and it does it's job.<br/><br/>What we have here is not a movie with a scary movie. It has a good amount of gore, but like The Thing it's the excellent atmosphere and mood that makes it scary. Don't pay too much attention to the story, it's not worth it. I'd recommend this one if you like a good horror film. I think you'll be in for a decent scare."

I don't think it was his physical body that the ship brought back. He had his eyes and every thing, but he had these demonic powers. I think it may have been his spirit or essences . I think that his love for the ship, and what ever the ship had become, allowed his essence to combine with the entity on the ship and become a focal point for the ships power, or what ever it had.

","I have only just watched Event Horizon directed by a former Film Studies graduate student of warwick uni, Paul W.S Anderson, and can't help but think I shan't rush to watch it again. Now to be fair this film does fulfill the average sci-fi/horror quota of reasonably tense build up, mildly engaging premise and the almost unavoidable slip into loud, frenetic editing and repetitive casualties (think of all the inferior post-Alien (1979) movies, Sphere, Pitch Black, Supernova, Deep Rising to name but four. However, let's just be honest the film smacks of surface noise and gruesome imagery without ever coming close to Ridley Scott's masterpiece of the genre or even to the bar of the mediocre. Put aside the poor characterization and quite terrible opening narrative (whereby a despairingly unimaginative title credit sequence played out to the least atmospheric score you ever gonna hear is followed by a totally ineffectual series of cues putting us into the present of the film, surely even the most lapse of film students would be familiar with the idea of pure cinema - that the medium is what it is because it is story in images not glip sentences) the fact remains the whole story reads as a ungodly hybrid between Solaris (where the crew were plagued by hallucinations from their psyche due to the proximity of the title planet) and Hellraiser (the horror franchise which pivots upon the concept of a gateway to another dimension, namely the hell of choatic sado-masochistic torture.) If your gonna rip someone of at least have the decency to do it well and even if considerations of script are totally jettisoned from the film's priority list the overriding importance is that the film be directed well. Quite frankly, there isn't a single thing new here and that isn't necessarily saying the film is terrible it just makes you feel the film was put together without much pride in whether the behind it could actually make something decent and to me that always makes me feel dissatisfied with wasting my time watching their lacklustre efforts.

","Event Horizon is a movie that despite you being terrified of, you just can't drag yourself away from the screen. It's unfairly knocked in many quarters, claiming it's overtly violent. I disagree - the violence is all central to the plot, which is enjoyable (in a ""give you nightmares"" kind of way) and engulfing.<br/><br/> The thing that I found so effective about it (other than the plot) is  how extremely easy it is to empathise with the crew of the ship - the characters are such that most people watching will identify with at least one of them (""mama bear"", ""papa bear"" and ""baby bear"" nicknames for some of the crew make you feel like these people really have worked together from before). When you start empathising with characters in a horror movie, it starts getting under your skin... and because of this, Event Horizon is highly effective.<br/><br/> There are definitely overtones from aliens, but you'll get much more of a scare from this... unlike in Aliens, the enemy of this movie cannot be shot, and whilst terrorising the crew, they can't live without it. This nightmarish symbiosis dogs the crew as they slowly begin to understand what's going on with the strange occurrences within ship and what happened to the previous crew. The more the movie progresses, the faster the frights come... and some of them are very, very effective, whether overtly (where it gets disgusting) or only in your head (where you're truly terrified).<br/><br/> If you're into sci-fi/horror, move over Aliens, this is the definitive movie."

","I really, really, liked this film.  It was basically a horror movie in space in a big ship and this made it all the more creepier.  The idea that they are investigating a ship that has come back from another demension and all of a sudden it haunted is a wonderful idea.  What makes the film so scary is that the ship is big and a little dark so you are wondering what is around every corner.  The ship has broughted something back with it and you are wondering what brought it back.  It's pretty graphic, which makes the movie pretty eerie.  I really liked this film and there should be more just like it!"

","After reading a few of the other comments, I decided to write my own. When you go to see a Horror movie, you have to accept the fact that you're going to see blood and guts.  It's not just a few bloody noses here and there. So for those of you who were ""disgusted"" by the gore in this movie...maybe next time you decide to see something in the genre of Horror...make sure you know what you're getting into.  As for myself, and many others who saw this movie, there was plenty of gore (which is a good thing).  The psychological horror was intense, depending on how and where you watch it.  For example, I first saw this at 2 in the morning, with the Surround Sound way up, all the lights off...that added to the intensity.  Some of the plot is pretty corny. But for the most part, it's an original, good old fashioned horror movie. I mean, come on...a dimension that is the equivalent of Hell...what can be more horrifying, besides a sequel to Pearl Harbor? If you're a fan of horror and senseless violence, this one is for you.  If you can't handle blood and guts...go watch Bambi."

","Event Horizon is one heck of a ride. Although not overly original (it bears much resemblance to Andrei Tarkovsky's ""Solaris""), it is still a fun and often frightening venture into the genre of sci-fi/horror.<br/><br/>Dr. Weir (Sam Neill) invented the Event Horizon, a space vessel capable of ""faster than light flight."" The Horizon has the capability to bend space, thus making it possible to travel millions of light years in a matter of seconds through an artificial black hole.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, just days after the Event Horizon's maiden voyage begins, it disappears without a trace. Fast forward seven years to the present, and the Horizon has reappeared near Neptune. Where has it been for the past seven years?<br/><br/>That's what Captain Miller (Laurence Fishburne) and his crew (consisting of Weir) set out to do. They board the ship and experience an evil far greater than anything they could have ever imagined.<br/><br/>Event Horizon is easily one of the most eerie and scary films I have seen in the past few years. The film relies on the creepy ambience of the set designs, and this is one of the many reasons it succeeds.<br/><br/>There is also an aura of mystery to the whole story. Where has the ship been? In many ways it is left up to the viewer to decide.<br/><br/>The performances are good. Neill, one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood, delivers the best performance as the shady Dr. Weir. Fishburne makes a good hero, along with a good supporting cast consisting of Kathleen Quinlan, Joely Richardson, and Jason Isaacs, among others.<br/><br/>One last word to the wise. This is by no means a ""tame"" film. There are dozens of disturbing images and gory deaths. It is probably the most gore that I have seen in a mainstream film in the last five years.<br/><br/>For those who dig sci/fi horror, give this one a look.<br/><br/>A-"

","I saw this in the theatre when it came out a few years ago, and it remains as the ONLY movie I have EVER seen which has scared me (not counting ones I saw when I was under 10 years old).  Anyway, Event Horizon is not the greatest sci-fi movie ever made, but it's pretty decent.  In all honesty, it's closer to a horror movie with a sci-fi setting rather than a pure sci-fi flick.  Nevertheless, its horror is very powerful, but not the cheap thrills you'll find in a slasher movie like Scream.  The sound and ominous music contribute greatly to its effect, so I strongly urge you watch this on a larger screen with a good sound system if possible.  That said, Event Horizon is worth watching late at night if you don't want to be able to sleep for the rest of the night."
"Go_rated_R","Null","1","2","4 July 2001"," My All-Time Favorite Sci-Fi Movie.
","I've seen other reviews on this movie and I was really disapointed on how many people hated it.  They're all saying that the gore ruins the film. That is just no true.  I've seen movies about 300-times more gory than this. The gore is not really bad.....at all. Event Horizon, in short, is a one-of-a-kind science fiction movie that you cannot find anywhere else.  There are no aliens, so that's a releif for some people.  Event Horizon is actually about a spaceship called Event Horizon that has been sent 7 years ago to explore the reaches of our solar system. By travelling, the Event Horizon ""bends"" the universe to get to one point of the universe to another.  After trying to ""bend"" the universe the first time, that's when it disapears. Seven years later, A rescue ship is sent to find it after it apeared on Neptune.  The only message they had received was filled with demonic screaming and a message ""Liberaté Mé"", which means ""save me"".  When the rescue ship arrives, they find much more than an empty ship.<br/><br/>
Sam Neil and Laurence Fisburne star in this gem.  The thought that it puts in your mind is scary, and the movie itself lives up to be a terrifying Sci-fi/Horror.  To prove this, I will say that there are enough scary, eerie, stinging, permanent and horrifying images in this movie to satisfy even people who haven't even heard of it yet.  It's brilliant script is perfect.  You just cannot find another Sci-fi movie with a theme like this. Unlike other popular ships, Event Horizon is haunted.  Sam Neil is brilliant. Laurence Fisburne is ok, but not as great as in The Matrix.  I'd recommend this movie to everyone who either wants a good scare or to everyone who likes sci-fi movie diamonds.<br/><br/>10/10"

","I originally saw this film on opening night in 1997 and it scared the hell out of me. I went with several friends and we all had the same reaction, some variation of ""that movie was really messed up"" Since then, I've had an opportunity to study the film and I get a little mad at people who totally dismiss this film as a ""rip-off."" These are the same people who think that Tarantino is an original auteur and Akiva Goldsman is a talented writer. The only difference here between Anderson and Tarantino's rip-offs is Tarantino chooses lesser-known films to steal (Ever seen City on Fire?)<br/><br/>The acting is well done and effectively directed, except for Sam Neill's character whose motivations were not explored enough. Lawrence Fishburne's line, after finding out what happened to the ships previous crew, is perhaps the most intelligent line ever said in a horror film... ""We're Leaving!"" The effects are excellent and the art direction is terrific. The last person to comment on the film said that it was depressing and bleak, but they fail to see that it was supposed to be like that to reflect the dark nature of what happened there and the tortured nature of Sam Neill's character. The opening shot of the Event Horizon near Neptune, looking like a cross is a fantastic shot and wonderful example of this.<br/><br/>Asides from the blatant ripoffs which I commented on before, this film is a very effective and well-done horror film, one that you need to see without any prior grudges against it from what you've heard. Turn the lights down, turn the sound up, and enjoy. It wants to be a good horror movie and nothing more, and it succeeds wonderfully."
"Unicorn-9","4","1","2","13 June 2000"," What were they thinking?
","What an awful movie. Given the budget and the cast, I'd expected that it would at least be an enjoyable SF romp, but was sadly disappointed. In the hands of a more talented director the poor script might have worked, but the very blatant attempt to recreate an 'Aliens' style intro immediately put me off, and the rapid degeneration into 'Star Trek' style metaphysical nonsense pretty much finished the job even before the sub-'Hellraiser' horror began.<br/><br/>The biggest problem is very simple: there is absolutely no reason for this script to be set in space. It would have worked at least as well with a bunch of kids getting killed in a remote house and a few thousand dollar budget. Instead, someone blew millions on this clunker which will probably put others off making big-budget SF for quite a while.<br/><br/>
Yes it has some tension, yes, there are a few nice bits and pieces, but overall it's one of the few movies which has ever left me feeling nostalgic for '2010'..."

","I looked forward to seeing this movie mainly because I'm a Sam Neill fan -- he's an excellent, underrated actor who doesn't get enough good roles.  The basic premise (a haunted ship that has literally been to hell and back) also sounded interesting.  Well, it all adds up to maybe not THE worst movie of all time, but unquestionably one of them.<br/><br/>The beginning, maybe the first 40 minutes or so, was actually not bad, and Sam Neill created an interesting character as Dr. Weir, a lonely man tormented by guilt over his wife's suicide.  There was also some genuine suspense, with ominous little hints that horrible things were about to happen.  Unfortunately, once the anticipation ended and the actual horrors began, ""Event Horizon"" became ridiculous and revolting.<br/><br/>Anderson is one of those directors who seem to think that to create terror, you have to show rivers of blood and graphic images of human flesh being torn apart with the guts hanging out.  At a certain point, though, it all becomes really gross, rather than scary.  For truly frightening films, see ""Rosemary's Baby"" or ""Repulsion"" (another Roman Polanski film), which relied strictly on psychological horror.<br/><br/>In the second half of ""Event Horizon,"" Neill's character became so grotesque that even the best actor couldn't have done anything decent with it. Laurence Fishburne is a good actor but he was much better in ""Just Cause"" (even though it was a pretty mediocre movie).<br/><br/>""Event Horizon"" is a total waste of time and talent."

","I didn't get to see this on the big screen, it was either on video or on TV that I first saw it, either way it was a TV edit for old squarer TVs, but the film was made in panoramic, so you lost more than half the film with a TV edit having to pan around the original footage to try to pick out the action. TV edits like that have too much poetic licence and too much of the fuller scenes are lost. You have to watch it in full panoramic to enjoy films like this. Now, with the much bigger HD widescreen TVs that people have, I'd encourage the doubters to watch this film again as it should be watched, in all its glory. Some films don't transfer well to the old square TVs as edits, but the TVs we have now do them justice. A lot of older films are worth watching again in Blu-ray on these new TVs. 2001: A Space Odyssey and Close Encounters of the Third Kind are some other good examples, but Event Horizon also fares well with modern tech. Watch it as it should be watched, all of it, with none of the wider footage edited out because of screen size. The cinematography is excellent and the film itself stands up well, even today, after 20 years. Not many films can do that without seeming dated. It is much better than a lot of films that are released today. It was ahead of its time when it was released, it still is, and for me, it is a classic sci-fi film."

","This movie, which I just saw for $4 at the Academy theater and hadn't checked out since I saw it on video a few years after it played in theaters, is a terrific 3-out-of-4 stars sci-fi as I remembered, all right. What's great about this picture -- even though, at times, it may cause dialogue to be a bit clunky and the pacing to not be the best -- is there isn't a wasted shot in the movie; everything's bringing you new information, and you need to know what is going on, and orient yourself. I've always liked the Alien/Outland-esque ""we're working class dudes-and-gals in a tin bucket who could die no less in space than if we were in the middle of the *ocean*"" trip, and Laurence Fishburne is one of the most quietly compelling actors of the nineties (let's not *just* count The Matrix, okay?). Sam Neill's range slips a little, here; he seems to be ""I'm Sam Neill GOING CRAZY!"" a bit too quickly and willingly here, but that's alright. The premise of Solaris is all over the place, the movie reeks of it; what with the ship that thinks, the suicidal wife, and different rules when you're ""way out there,"" if you know the Tarkovsky original, the Soderberg re-make (which I haven't seen) or the Stanislaw Lem novel it's going to be on your mind. Still, this movie's not predictable; it earns its dangers and recoveries -- you're finding out with the crew, including Dr. Sam Neill (who does a not-bad job about explaining how the Event Horizon could skirt spacetime, years before Interstellar came out).If you don't live in Portland, you might not remember ..."

","It's silly and attempts to be horrifying. Even by the late 90s we've seen these types of movies before. I think it was trying to add a bit more a psychological thriller feel which was fine but more silly at times. It's no smarter or worse than Alien Covenant. If anything, it's mercifully short. It has no desire to try and get you to like these characters. It just wants to put them through hell and see if they'll kill each other off.<br/><br/>For me, it's not really worth seeing. Additionally it has some very poor CGI (even for the time, it's pretty bad). Maybe if they make a 'Dead Space' movie it can take the good parts of this and actually be horrifying."

The first 15-20 minutes are great and really did build up my enthusiasm - but it was all going south after a certain point. <br/><br/>What is even more concerning is that I mostly see good reviews about this movie - if it is as a horror movie, fine, as I'm not really a good judge of that genre. But I watched this movie with expectations of deep space, sci-ency stuff and except the first 20 or so minutes it is really annoying in that aspect. It could be because I watched it really late, in 2016(yeah, my first movie of '16), after having watched interstellar, 2001, martian, contact, this was really disappointing as far as that genre is concerned. Hell, I liked Alien when I saw it('97), but I really don't think I'll enjoy it now, so yeah, it's probably that. If you're looking for some horror, gore, watch it but if your want is to get amazed by some story about outer space with science involved, skip this - contact was way better.

","I only discovered this movie last year while searching for Sam Neil. However once I began watching it I was hooked. It starts off with catching you up to when the ship disappeared, which draws you in. And then mentions the reappearance, which captures you attention. I am fans of both Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neil when the movie began but you can bet after watching it I searched out more of their work. And it was the first time I had seen Joely Richardson but I was certainly impressed. The rest of the cast supported them all very well. I certainly believe that this movie was sorely under appreciated. The discovery of the recording, the flight log, and the first frozen body were all big moments I couldn't look away from. Laurence's character Captain Miller was brilliantly portrayed as strong and loyal, more so now after what had happened prior to the movie. Yet perhaps the best performance in my opinion was Neil's Dr. Weir's slow decent into madness. This movie was unnerving chilling and scary, but not in the usual horror movie way. So I leave you with the best quote of the movie (in my opinion) ""Where we're going, we won't need eyes to see."""

","Purely out of interest I checked this on IMDb and was astounded by the 6.6 score, I've seen utter tripe get 7+! It's nothing short of a crime. This film for me is one of the scariest movies ever made, and I'm a 31 yr old man that's seen a lot of them. It sends a shiver down my spine just thinking about some of the scenes. The acting is superb, the atmosphere is really uncomfortable, it's well paced and some of the cuts are genuinely disturbing. And it manages all of this without an actual monster or alien as such. A complaint about this film is its lack of originality, but I feel it should be viewed as an excellent blend of different ideas that should be put together and with no doubt works. There's often a comparison with Alien but I prefer this as it leaves a lot more to the imagination, which can be a dark place. 10/10 for me, any bad reviews must be pretentious fools who decided they didn't want to like it before they even switched it on and let their nit picking ruin their enjoyment of a good little watch."

","There are two main problems I have with Event Horizon. First, the unbelievable storyline and characters. Second, the lack of originality and taking ideas from other famous sci-fi movies.<br/><br/>The movie is based on a story that a trans dimensional spaceship returns after having gone missing for 7 years. The ""Event Horizon"" which has a black hole engine, folds ""space"" so that it can travel faster than light. A rag-tag group of swearing, smoking and brawling space ""soldiers"", accompanied by the delicate mad scientist who invented the ungodly missing ship go on a reconnaissance mission. Basically, the doctor goes berserk on the ship, and people start going mad, tearing out their eyes and so on. The ship, it is suggested, has most likely travelled to trans-dimensional hell. The ships crew is seen in the video log consuming itself while the captain offers a monologue in Latin while holding his extracted eyeballs.<br/><br/>Event Horizon liberally steals ideas from superior sci-fi films. The grungy space cowboy themes from alien, and the cerebral psychological aspects of Solaris. The film degenerates to lots of running through cryptically Gothic space ship corridors, and self-immolation. Finally there is some large explosion after most of the actors have died."

","This is without a doubt one of the best science fiction/horror films i have ever seen. There is a lot of good character development, good acting, the pacing is very well done and there are a lot of good thrills and chills throughout. This is a very underrated movie and deserves more praise than it already has. This movie pays homage to some of the older science fiction and horror films from the past, including the Shining, 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Haunting and Hellraiser. This movie has a very dark atmosphere and feel to it. I saw it for the first time when it came out, and it scared the hell out of me. Paul Anderson did a really good job setting the tone for this film and he did really well with the direction. Laurence Fishburne did a good job playing the captain of the search and rescue team. And hands off to Sam Neill for his portrayal as the guy who built the ship. If you have not seen this movie yet, go rent it or buy it from your local video store. You will not be disappointed. It is definitely worth a watch."
"flyboy015","3","1","3","12 August 2010"," Event Horizon: the Gateway to a Dimension in which Movies SUCK
","I had been waiting for quite a while to see this film after having watched Pandorum, a 2009 sci-fi flick with a similar plot. Compared to Pandorum, Event Horizon was a huge let-down. Perhaps the worst aspect of the film was that it had so much potential- with a great hook and lead-in, a talented cast with strong supporting roles and an exceptional expanding plot, I was dumbfounded when the credits rolled. About half-way through the movie, the ship becomes ""alive"" and Sam Neil undergoes a swell transformation, after which he can throw his co-stars into tables and walls with ease (and perform various other feats of impossible strength), can somehow see well enough to make coordinated movements despite having gouged his own eyes out, and makes clear to the average sci-fi buff that the bridging of science-fiction and horror genres is not suitable to amateurs.<br/><br/>In its favor, the film's first half is exceptionally interesting and immersive, and has a perfect balance of horrifying scenes and on-the-edge-of-your-seat suspense, as well as a strong plot, believable background stories and and a steadily climaxing series of events. But as soon as Sam Neil begins his man-killing rampage, this sorry excuse of ""Classic horror and sci-fi"" takes an obvious turn for the worse. And what's more, it becomes even cheesier and tacked on the further the storyline progresses, with Sam Neil's eventual reincarnation after having been blown off the ship's bridge and into deep space.<br/><br/>Most sci-fi/horror movies have a definitive moment when the actor(s) realize that things won't be turning out so swell. But for 'Event Horizon', this translates more into a realization of the viewer that he or she has just wasted more than an hour of their time. The gory death of DJ, who is crucified and gutted, seems senseless when the storyline and premise of the film are considered.<br/><br/>I did like some of the shots in the movie, however. For instance, in my own opinion, the first glimpse of the Event Horizon's bow with the name written boldly across the ship and garnished by carnival-style lights is exceptionally characteristic. The scene in which Justin realizes he is about to be blown out of the airlock and sent to his death was very well-filmed. His begging for Peters to open the door drove more horror into me than did any other sequence of the film, in fact. I also liked the bit when Sam Neil backs into the darkness, declaring in a chilling (and at this point still tasteful) ""I already AM home."" I wasn't too impressed with the initial panning scene of the space station, which apparently cost the film a third of its budget. I also thought the sequence in which Weir's wife, Claire, cuts her wrists was well-done. His pleading with her to not slit her wrists is as equally terrifying as Justin's apologetic face- especially Weir's line, ""Not again!"". So I would say that there were definitely some great horror sequences darted throughout the movie, in which acting and filming were excellent; nearly perfect. And for the culminating suspense scenes, my hair really rose when Peters creeps across the med bay, with the disturbing scratching sound and heavy breathing in the background, and the perfect amount of ever-so-slight camera shake. Very well done.<br/><br/>Despite a few instances of amazing cinematography, generally-good acting, good visual effects and a seemingly-promising opening plot and storyline, ""Event Horizon"" was a masterpiece of a fluke. I was very disappointed, having expected much more than what was delivered in the second half of the movie- so disappointed, that I was shocked to find that more than a handful of people enjoyed it. I believe I'll stick to sci-fi/horror movies like Pandorum and 2001: A Space Odyssey."
"pictomancer","10","1","3","5 July 2009"," Scariest Sci-Fi I've Ever Seen!!
","This film is the only sci-fi horror film that has truly scared me out of my wits and that makes this film unique in every sense.<br/><br/>The film itself is about a spaceship which disappeared a long time ago. The ship was fitted with a gravity device capable of creating a black hole to act as a gateway to a place in space normally unable to reach. It reappears and a crew is sent to investigate (Laurence Fishburne, Sam Niell etc). But they find the crew as either frozen disfigured corpses or splattered blood entrails on the walls. The best description I can give to encapsulate the situation is 'a haunted house in space': the spaceship is kind of possessed and everyone on board suffers terrifying hallucinations.<br/><br/>The acting is brilliant and extremely believable. The film sort of builds up tension for most of the film, with the deaths occurring towards the end of the film. Horrible deaths to be exact: someone being vivisected and someone ripping their own eyes out to name a few. The thing that makes the film scary is that you expect something tangible as the cause of the horror (an alien or monster) but its the ship itself. Also the unfamiliarity of space adds a kind of xenophobic feel to the events.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a movie you should not miss. I cannot find any flaws in it whatsoever and as I said before, this is the ONLY sci-fi horror that has scared me. Ever."

","Event Horizon is an awkward sci-fi flick. The only thing it really succeeds in doing in being grizzly and ominous (not to mention gory). Over the course of an hour and a half, we are not given much more than a handful of shocks. However, the filmmakers somehow manage to execute this messy story well enough that if you like this sort of thing, you may not be temped to walk away.<br/><br/>After being lost in space for seven years, the Event Horizon spacecraft has suddenly reappeared in the solar system in the year 2047. A small crew led by Captain Miller is sent out to explore the ship and get some answers. What they slowly begin to realize is that the ship has not merely gone off the edge of the map, but it has been to hell and back, and now there are supernatural forces aboard. The reasons how and why this has happened are not explained to us, which is kind of disappointing. What follows is a story of survival on the haunted ship with lots of gore, cheap dialog, and typical cardboard acting.<br/><br/>Event Horizon is not the worst sci-fi film out. I would definitely recommend it over films like 'Sphere' and/or 'The Fifth Element', but regardless, the movie still needs work. It is just barely entertaining."
"gunstar_hero","3","1","3","25 December 2008"," Confused and Horribly Clichéd
","Event Horizon is a movie that can be neatly divided into two halves. In the first, the screenplay is to all intents and purposes a scene-by-scene facsimile of Alien, 20 years later, with no discernible improvement. The sets and special effects, if anything, look worse.<br/><br/>In the second half, the script dispenses entirely with the mildly absorbing haunted-house-in-space conceit and delves into the murkily opportunistic realms of psychological horror, a get-out-clause by which director and writer alike are able to incorporate any arbitrary plot twist and remain unaccountable to the audience's incredulity.<br/><br/>This movie's claim to any kind of critical respectability within the field of science fiction is frankly laughable. It is an amateurish rehash of a dozen better films, two-dimensional and neutered for the mainstream multiplex crowd - whom it failed to impress back in 1997."
"camelman-1","3","1","3","6 October 2008"," A good idea drowned in red dye and bad writing
","I just saw Event Horizon on DVD, long after it was finished bombing in theaters, so if I were jumping on a bandwagon by calling it a banal sci-fi/horror misfire, that bandwagon has already left without me. I genuinely didn't like this film, although there was still enough substance to earn three stars, and I feel like that's pretty generous.<br/><br/>The movie opens with an in-your-face techno song played over a worm hole effect that looks like what you'd see on Windows Media Player, and until that point, I had high hopes for the film. Since it's become a cult hit, I'd heard nothing but good things, and I went in with an open mind. However, it hardly picks up from there, with the cliché 'typewriter' text exposition that not only hands us the first third of the plot, but continues to needlessly label every scene change for the next few minutes.<br/><br/>We're introduced to the generally bland crew of the rescue ship Lewis and Clarke, some of whom have the nerve to rhyme when working at their stations (""Everything's green on my screen, skipper""?). I tried to tell myself that the dialogue wasn't *that* bad, that Fishburne and Neill were still good, even if the rest of the cast was at best mediocre and at worst cringe-worthy. But let me use an example before I stop nit-picking the first thirty minutes of the movie.<br/><br/>This rescue ship is being sent to investigate the disappearance and sudden reappearance of a top-secret vessel, the Event Horizon. They bring along the ship's creator, played by Sam Neill, and he explains the mission to them, telling them the Event Horizon is a ship designed for faster than light travel. One of the crew members asks him to explain how it's possible, and he says it would be too complicated. They insist, so he explains. Then they get mad at him for giving a complicated explanation.<br/><br/>This is *not* good writing, and it's a standard that the rest of the film follows. Without giving too much away, the rest of the movie follows the trials of the crew as they arrive at the Event Horizon. Here's where it earns three stars: the set design. The Gothic interior of the ship is beautifully crafted, although you'll have to forgive how un-practical it is (and for a state of the art space ship, you'd want things as simple and practical as possible). I did, just because the art direction was so good. The absurdity of the ship's design never affects the plot or characters, so it really has nothing against it.<br/><br/>Then there's the story, which loses coherence in proportion to the crew's sanity. By the end of the movie, there's not much sanity, and there's not much coherence. The obvious comic relief character plays a ridiculously major role, tension is sacrificed in favor of cheap, blood-soaked imagery, and religious references are as unwelcome as they are cheesy. You might laugh, like I did, at the villain and his motivation/appearance. At one point, the makeup on his head makes him look like a puppet. And maybe this is just because I'm not a horror regular, but the use of the word 'evil' killed any credibility or meaning that the later revelations about the Event Horizon might have had. It becomes a gore-fest, with some serious over-use of blood to try and convince you that it's 'scary'.<br/><br/>More blood does not make a better movie. It didn't make a better movie out of Event Horizon, and maybe if Paul Anderson had realized that while he was busy planning the fist fight (yes, there's actually a fist fight.) then it could have tapped its potential. This could have been a great psychological thriller, if they had taken more pages from H.P. Lovecraft and hired a more competent screenwriter. Believe the negative reviews, unless you're willing to forgive the problems above, or if you're one of the many people who *does* think more blood makes a better movie."

However, the ship wasn't left untouched: something else is on board. . . but who, or what, is it? And what does it want? <br/><br/>For some reason, Paul W.S.

Sure, his writing for AVP and Resident Evil wasn't the best, but he's not a bad action director. Or, at least, he's an acceptable one that knows how to get what he wants on the screen. Event Horizon, while another sci-fi/horror like the aforementioned, is in a league of its own in comparison to the rest of Anderson's work. It is truly terrifying. Imagine a savage blend of Alien, The Haunting, Hellraiser, and even some Don't Look Now and The Shining to boot. The performances (especially Sam Neill's chilling portrayal of Dr. Weir) were great. The supporting cast of Jason Isaacs (Lucius Malfoy in the Harry Potter series), Sean Pertwee (Dog Soldiers), Joely Richardson (Nip/Tuck), and Kathleen Quinlan (The Hills Have Eyes remake) also all put out solid performances. Luckily for them, they had quality dialogue written for them while Cooper's character (Richard T. Jones) was a horribly written ""token black guy"" character. Frankly, it was pretty annoying to have his humorous character popping up with dumb lines during extremely intense situations (especially one in particular at the end). Regardless, the film was still damn great. The gore/violence were fantastic. The suspense and tension can rival that of many films.

","Like the other genres, horror is not limited to being done one particular way, or any single type. Too bad W.S. has yet to look beyond... this. Here, it truly starts out well. I watch more or less everything he's been involved in, but I haven't spent a lot of money on it, several of them were lent or given to me by acquaintances. He leaves something of a finger-print on anything he's done(harshly put, some might say that once you've seen one of his... yeah), and with both the actual quality and the audience response(they don't always go together), it's odd that he keeps getting to direct. But before its drowned out entirely in something of an ocean of blood(oh how I wish that was hyperbole... something else that's evidently alien to him is the concept that less is more), this has merit. The whole thing is pretty much bathed in CGI, mostly well-done. Some of it is there to distract and show off. The humor isn't bad, and it's seldom forced. The plot is reasonable, and the concept certainly is interesting. The pacing is OK. Acting varies, some of it is relatively good. The effects tend to be great. The film is just uneven... where it starts with hinting, and at least some measure of build-up(which Anderson seems to have since just about completely abandoned), it ends with a comparatively inordinate amount(if they were going for contrast, they missed the mark) of gore, at times grotesque. I'm not saying there's something wrong with that style, the main thing here is how it doesn't fit with the rest, and the overall issue is that this appears to be the only kind he'll make. Throwing violence mercilessly at the viewers, underlined with loud heavy rock. This is, or can be, scary, and unsettling. It just doesn't deliver what it sets up as what is to come... maybe Paul got bored half-way through, and subsequently made whatever was left of the flick the way those of us who've seen at least two are used to him doing this. The references herein would be better received in a more expertly done piece. I recommend this to fans of Paul W.S. Anderson and his work.

For the rest it's completely different, but the atmosphere is there, and of course the scares.<br/><br/>For people who have no idea what 'Doom' is or don't care about it, 'Event Horizon' is just a good sci-fi horror movie. It borrows from many other movies to end up with an original and quite successful result. In fact, the parts where classics like Alien(s), The Shining and even '2001' can be recognized, are so obvious that they should rather be considered homages than rip-offs. As usual, some people complain about the ""science"" in this movie, but if you've read the plot outline it should be pretty obvious that the goal of the makers was not to show us a documentary on physics. <br/><br/>To enjoy this movie optimally, watch it in a dark room with either a good surround system or headphones. The soundtrack does a perfect job of setting the mood without being distracting. Visual effects are quite good for their time, and still look good today.

To recap the plot, a rescue ship arrives at the stranded Event Horizon, a deep space probe, only to find lots of blood and dead bodies and something far worse awaiting them. Anderson borrows heavily from other movies, and EH crosses ALIEN, 2001 and SOLARIS with THE SHINING and HELLRAISER, among others. EH's massive, Gothic-like sets and the sweeping cinematography are magnificent, and the first half of the movie is a humdinger as the rescue crew explores the creepy, sinister EH and begins running into ghosts, or demons, or worse. The second half is a letdown, as we discover that the EH has been where no ship has gone before, into an alternate dimension of pure evil. It doesn't take much to figure where things will be going from that point. Enjoy the first half but skip the second, especially after Sam Neil undergoes his transformation into a poor man's Pinhead. Lots of spooky stuff worth seeing in the first half, though, especially Kathleen Quinlan approaching a sick bay bed where a phantom version of her ill son awaits her under the sheet.

","I always think about H.P. Lovecraft whenever viewing movies mixing the genres of horror and sci-fi. I'm not saying that this movie is based on or directly influenced by a Loveraftian tale. However, I'm sure that H.P.L. would have been entertained. Event Horizon begins by offering a chilling and creative premise: A space ship capable of warping space returns after missing for several years and is adrift within the orbit of Neptune. A science team is sent to search for any survivors and investigate the situation of the ship's disappearance. The team discovers that the shipped warped into a dimension of pure evil and went insane; eventually killing themselves in the process. However, what the team is late in discovering is that the ship itself has become haunted (possessed) and is attempting to murder the rescue team members. Viewer questions arise: Has the ship become an sentient evil entity, or are the possessions and poltergeists caused by residual spiritual energies?<br/><br/>This creative premise had me intrigued. The movie essentially becomes an orbiting haunted house. What a concept! Unfortunately, the promise of a great ghost story is lost on unoriginal elements. The spooky events used to convey the plot become tired and clichéd. Visual hallucinations, sudden sounds of slamming doors, and laughing ghost children (overused in most horror movies of the late 90's) are meant to convey the atmosphere of a haunting, but fall flat.<br/><br/>A better directorial approach should have included each member of the team offering different arguments on the causes of the haunting, bringing in a science-verses-the-world-of-the-spiritual theme. A Lovecraftian blend of the spiritual and hard science would have made this movie more thought provoking and encourage intense conversations among the viewers. <br/><br/>This movie is an example of how many of today's directors are incompetent in utilizing sound and visual imagery to convey a creepy atmosphere. A study of ""Legend of Hell House"", Kubrick's ""Shinning"", or Val Lewton's ""I Walked with a Zombie"" would have assisted the director in forming an appropriate atmosphere for this movie. <br/><br/>In summary..Event Horizon offers a great horror premise, but the cinematic events fail to carry it through."

","Terrible terrible (that's right - so bad I had to write the word twice) dialogue. I can't believe I actually watched this for the second time in my life last night. I had vague memories of not liking it the first time but I said I'd give it another try as I've been starved of good sci-fi since Dark City and of course I've watched the Alien Quadrilogy way too much (AvP doesn't count as an Alien movie).<br/><br/>It's about as scary as a pillow. There was some tension at the beginning but once things get going it just gets boring. Nothing original whatsoever, painful forced dialogue, and once the ""action"" kicks in any attempt at creating a story goes out the window and we're treated like morons wanting nothing more than loud bangs.<br/><br/>In saying that, the beginning is relatively enjoyable although I found the rip-offs of Alien much too obvious to the point of actual plagiarism.<br/><br/>It's just a VERY average movie. In fact I found myself thinking at many points in the film, that this should be standard viewing at all film schools, it is a master lesson in what NOT to do.<br/><br/>At the end of the day Anderson is just a hack, there is absolutely no evidence to the contrary. I cannot believe FOX (although it is FOX after all) are considering letting him do something with AvP2.<br/><br/>NOW THAT IS A SCARY THOUGHT!!"
"nomadr666","8","1","3","22 March 2006"," post-modern ""Space Odyssey""
","Yes, I think the Odyssey is the movie which stays closer than any other to this one, and definitely not ""Alien"", as every second reviewer here mentions. And I'm even not really sure, which one is better. Well, it's not correct to compare them like this, I'd better say, the ""Event Horizon"" is a cover version, a catchy, horror and post-modern one. The latter is a keyword here, although it is not like modern post-modern we get bombed with lately, it concerns more sci-fi content of the film, while it's literally packed with common ideas from sci-fi literature and almost every frame is reminiscent to other sci-fi classics. And this is not a rip-off, it's really intelligent script writing, so that a fan of classical American sci-fi literature of 50's-70's feels himself in this movie like in the very comfortable and familiar world. A very underestimated movie."
"goldfinch","3","1","3","22 December 2005"," Average movie but an interesting observation.
","I thought this movie was very average but one thing I found interesting was how the astronauts had their respective country's national flag on their shoulders. Sam Neill's character was supposed to be Australian and I noticed that the flag he wore actually had the Aboriginal flag on it where the Union Jack should have been. This was an interesting bit of forward thinking by the film's creators as there has been talk for many years that the flag should be changed so it doesn't have the Union Jack, so as to show our removal from colonial Britain. This film was set around the year 2050 I think and the creators must have thought our flag would be changed by then with Australia deciding to honour our nations original inhabitants. I thought this was very well done and was especially surprised to see something like this in an (I assume) American film."
"joseph-kennedy5","9","1","3","8 February 2005"," Great movie
","I think it is a fantastic movie, well crafted and scary. A great premise that needs a sequel! Sam Neil does a great job being the bad guy and Fishburne is fantastic as well. What made the movie scary for me was the lighting and lay out of the Event Horizon. The ship's deck where the doomed crew worked was very dark and cold. Also the size of the Event Horizon made it all the more chilling. The scene where the guy repairing the ship and gets blown of into space was a little silly. The jokes that he cracks whilst being blown into space could have been better or better yet completely omitted. The Event Horizon's recovered log was terrifying and believable. Again I would highly recommend this movie. I hope someone will make a second installment."
"johnnyboyz","7","1","3","23 May 2004"," Spooky, Violent and Atmospheric. All in all, a good film.
","Event Horizon has taken some basic conventions from the horror genre and mixed them up with a very basic Sci-fi setting. There are characters you just KNOW are going to end up dying some sort of a horrible death, an obvious protagonist and some very clever little plot pointers here and there such as how the ship 'Event Horizon' can travel quickly through space and little things like that that make the film seem a lot more different than others in this cross genre.<br/><br/>Several characters put aboard a space ship with a 'no way out' element very much present and the fact it's in space and in the middle of nowhere makes this feel a little more claustrophobic than normal which is a good thing.<br/><br/>The twist in the film, I must admit, did take me by surprise and all though afterwards you think that maybe it was a little obvious, it still does set you back a bit. The acting isn't all that good but at the same time, they weren't dire performances. It was the kind of acting that goes unnoticed without any real performance standing out no matter how much screen time one may have. The dark, sinister setting is used very well and it isn't all CGI which has been the downfall of quite a few horror/sci-fi films in the past.<br/><br/>I liked the early sense of mystery and atmospheric feeling of confusion almost like some of the characters were private eyes, trying to discover what happened and untangling a mystery that has been made up.<br/><br/>All in all, I think you should see the movie and I think, odds on, that you will like it. Maybe not absolutely love it but you will feel a lot better after this film than maybe after certain others."
"soulcharmer","7","1","3","17 December 2003"," Quite chilling
","It's not another scifi horror movie. I'm already over evaluating every scientific nonsense as something that a priori drags the movie down. The overall feel is more important to me. Almost all cast presented decent performances. Photography was really good for me, plot and script suited me well. There are no stupid predator aliens to devour all the crew but still you'll be in constant tension because it's untouchable and unseen evil what's in the air. But I advice you, unless you are a fan of this genre, you might be blatantly disappointed just because you are not. It's an american movie you know, so there are still some stupid dialogues as well as some even more stupid clichés present.<br/><br/>But in overall, I give it 7/10"

","I really, really liked this film. It went straight into my all time top twenty as soon as I saw it. If you are a horror or sci-fi fan, this is a must see. To put it very simply, Event Horizon is a haunted-house movie, set on a spaceship. This description hardly does it justice though. Picture Hellraiser meets Alien, or Seven meets Pitch Black, and you've got a better idea. Some hardcore sci-fi fans might have a little trouble swallowing the supernatural/horror aspect of the film, though. Not a traditional sci-fi by most standards, leaning more towards horror with a futuristic space setting. On the flipside, horror fans  who aren't into sci-fi should have no trouble getting into this movie despite it's setting. Astoundingly beautiful set design, very nice effects, a genuinely scary atmosphere, powerhouse performance by Sam Neill and Laurence Fishburne and a solid story make this a film not to be missed. I am amazed at some of the poor reviews this movie got, particularly the number that included comments like `Where were the aliens?'. It really makes me think they missed the whole point  but you can hardly expect a balanced review of a sci-fi or horror movie from some latte swilling pseudo-intellectual who does nothing but rave about foreign art films. No self-respecting horror or sci-fi fan should miss this movie."

","One of the most genuinely frightening movies that I have ever seen. Maybe THE most frightening movie that I have ever seen. I was jumping at shadows and having nightmares for weeks after seeing this one -- and movies don't, as a rule. frighten me. If you're looking for a jarring, uncompromising ride to Hell and back, (and make no mistake; the film's tagline promises ""infinite terror,"" and it's not kidding) then look no further.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the film's eventual descent into gore will leave many viewers with a bad taste in their mouth, myself included. As the plot (such as it is) plays out, the action becomes more and more gruesome, sacrificing genuine psychological horror for something far more visceral and, in the end, less effective.<br/><br/>Despite misgivings, I find that I can't completely trash this film. It delivers what it promises -- terror, on a number of levels -- and in that respects it succeeds admirably. If you don't dwell to deeply on the plot, and the fact that it's blatantly derivative of some of the best (and worst) sci-fi and horror films ever made, you might just have a good time.<br/><br/>But if you're looking for a cinematic masterpiece, or if you have a weak stomach, then your time and money is probably better spent elsewhere. Oh, and one closing thought:<br/><br/>Explosive decompression, aside from not being explosive, does not work that way; the absolute WORST thing you could do, were you to find yourself trapped in a vacuum, would be to ""expel all of the air from your lungs"".

Normally dependable actors are left with terrible writing as instead of acting with each other, they interact with the ghosts of their past.  Their worst fears come to life and consume them.

The film has an excellent progression of plot, and the acting of the main characters, particularly Sam Neil as Dr. Weir, and Laurence Fishburne as Captain Miller, is excellent.<br/><br/>My own pet peeve of Horror movies is that the terrifying moments are often artificially created by the incredible stupidity of the characters.  This is mostly not the case in Event Horizon.  The set and special effects lend a very creepy air to the whole movie that makes your hair stand on end, and when action happens you're suitably primed to jump out of your seat.<br/><br/>I have two problems with the film: 1) The music at the opening and closing credits doesn't set up the mood of the film at all, and leaves you expecting something else. and, 2)  The ending is a bit unsatisfying, and somewhat cheesy.<br/><br/>Overall, however, this movie is well made and conceived, and has only a few weaknesses.

","Developing a cult following for its terrific set design, gruesome sadomasochist iconography and otherworldly Lovecraftian themes, this $60 million cosmic horror shoots for the stars as 'The Shining in space', but slips into a worse dimension with a frustrating sci-fi spin on Clive Barker's Hellraiser. Plagued by many demons during a troubled production, such as its rushed editing schedule, unfinished CGI and poor sound mix, the film falls apart with gory sequences that feel torn to shreds and stitched back together, not too dissimilar from Sam Neill's hokey turn after a strong set-up in the first act. Aspects like the techno-gothic aesthetic and spooky atmosphere contribute to a sense of foreboding and dread, but sadly never pay off, thanks in no part to a mediocre Philip Eisner script and ill-advised studio meddling. Despite horrifying visuals and a host of game character actors, in particular the tonally jarring but hilarious Richard T. Jones, Paul W.S. Anderson misses the mark for a dull 96 minutes that doesn't point to a longer, better cut lost to time and space. Shame he passed on helming X-Men for this.<br/><br/>3/10 pens through folded paper."

"mikeyboy26","1","1","4","13 July 2018"," Terribly disappointing Sci/Fi horror film
","This may be the worst sci-fi horror movie i've ever seen. Which is terribly unfortunate as the subject matter about what lies beyond the Event Horizon of a Black Hole lends itself well to so many interesting (and fantastical ) possibilities that in the right hands has the potential to be a great film. The film moves very slowly but does not deliver any kind of reward for those who are patient enough to wait for it to unravel. One of my biggest criticisms of the film is that is doesn't explore what happened to the crew of The Event Horizon sufficiently to make it engaging and interesting enough. All those ""flash back"" scenes of the crew only serve to frustrate the viewer as it is not sufficiently fleshed out tat the end. We can only surmise some terrible ""thing"" happened to them. It both frustrating and yes becomes boring. Also almost as a homage to Alien(s) it borrows scenes directly from the movie. For instance the scene where Sam Neil is sucked out of the airlock. The scene where the rescue vessel discovers and boards the pod from the Event Horizon ( so similar to start Aliens go check it out) and the scene where one of the survivors ""dreams"" the evil Sam Neil is one of the rescuers........well it seemed pretty obvious to me. Over all terrible film.
 I wonder when Sam Neil walks into one of those lovely old Pubs in Dunedin New Zealand after a day working on the farm, whether the locals ask him ""hey Sam weren't you in that movie , Event Horizon?"" Just as he's about to throw a dart just to put him off..........i would! Ha!"

","Event Horizon (1997) is for sure one of my favorite science fiction films, I can also count it as one of my favorite horror films because it fits into both genres. It contains strong elements of both horror and sci fi, I love the ways in which it incorporated two kinds of films and combined them into one, never really seen one do it in the way this one did. I like a supernatural element in my horror films, and this film had a very strong supernatural/evil element to it... especially towards the end. I applaud that aspect of the film of the horror side because it just makes everything more interesting. Just hearing the plot really interested me in this film and I'm so glad it didn't disappoint! Basically this film can be summed up as an interesting horror flick with a supernatural element set in space. If that sounds interesting or appealing to you... Then I highly suggest this one! The acting is very well done by each cast member... I was especially impressed by Sam Neil and Laurence Fishburne! They really give captivating performances here. 9/10 overall for Event horizon, I would caution though that if you're easily offended by gore then you may wanna be careful lol."

","""OK, it's been, what, 18 years since the original 'Alien,' so let's just blatantly rip it off -- premise, story, look and feel, everything. But instead of the crew coming across a mysterious ship with a vicious space creature aboard that proceeds to kill off the crew one by one, in our flick the mysterious ship has just returned from a black hole with a weird alien life force that *possesses* some of the crew members, who then proceed to kill off the rest of the crew one by one. Oh and here's the cool part: that alien life force is literally from hell. That's right, the Judeo-Christian hell!"" <br/><br/>Those are the forensically reconstructed thought processes behind ""Event Horizon.""<br/><br/>Don't consider the above to be spoilers. Consider them *savers*, as in saving you from sitting through this bloody mess. <br/><br/>If ""Event Horizon"" had production values that matched the quality of its script, then it would look a lot cheaper. The film does indeed look good, copying that gritty, creepy ""Alien"" look and feel admirably. That's what sucks you in to the story -- that, along with the hope that the story will deliver. Instead what the viewer gets are increasingly preposterous and inconsistent plot points, until the final reveal makes you want to throw a shoe at your TV. ""Hell?! THAT'S what this was all about?""<br/><br/>""Event Horizon"" even copies very specific parts of the ""Alien"" story, such as the whittled-down survivors agreeing to go into deep freeze and await a rescue ship and fighting to turn off the self-destruct mechanism that one of the evil-life-force-controlled humans has set.<br/><br/>To summarize, do not watch this film unless the preceding has still not turned you off from the idea of committing two hours of your life to this kind of story. Rip-offs are sometimes fun, and so are bad films that have something to offer -- in this case, top-tier (for the times) production values. But if a coherent story is what you're after -- something other than ""beer and bad movie"" night with the guys -- then stay the hell away."

","I am utterly astounded that Anderson can go from either extreme of film-making! take this Event Horizon against AVP, very good to utterly crap..<br/><br/>He (Anderson) does a good job of creating suspense, well directed, good special effects - OK a little dodgy CGI once, but at the time (1997) it was acceptable. The actors play their parts convincingly and there is not an abundance of gore, it is subtle and only in flashes of a few seconds - long enough so you know its there, but not long enough to make out exactly what it is - which works well and adds to the quality of the film.. the sets are genuinely unnerving and even if the Event Horizon was 'normal' you wouldn't want to be walking the corridors alone.<br/><br/>I was a little disappointed with the end, it would have been much better if the very last scene had been cut - It would have left it more open (in a better way that the current cut does)..<br/><br/>All-in-all an outstanding effort by Anderson and hopefully a directors cut will be released!"

","We live in a complex world where any self-respecting horror film has to poke fun at itself, contain at least 2 former models as victims, appeal to anyone between 13 and 17, and on no account actually try to be scary for fear of public ridicule. This film broke a taboo of current day films by taking itself seriously, and it paid in the critical and public circles. This really is a sad state of affairs and says a lot about the film industry today. This film is not great but is highly suspenseful and there is some good acting.

"Dr.Tuba","7","1","4","6 April 2001"," Excellent despite a couple shortfalls
","Straight off, let me say that this movie is well done overall, though it could have been more.  Whether I personally could have handled more of this is another matter.<br/><br/>The movie has a deliciously dark and claustrophobic feel to it... I found myself looking for an escape while watching it.  Afterwards, my house felt too small and dark to be comfortable.  That tells me the set design if nothing else was effective.<br/><br/>The acting was fair, being pretty standard and having its stellar moments (especially from Mr. Neill).  There were some lines I thought the movie could do without and some bits that could have been written better. Overall, however, I didn't feel it was a sufficient enough detraction to remove from the overall effect of the movie.<br/><br/>The plot was straightforward and at times, predictable.  I guess unlike other reviewers I don't sit at a movie seeing if I can guess what's next... I expect to be taken on a ride, not to drive.  Only when a movie is so boring that I have nothing else to focus on do I worry about what's next. This one moved along briskly, and lulled at suitable moments to allow viewers to catch their breath.  It interjected enough backstory to keep the suspension of disbelief up while maintaining the proper pacing for a movie in this vein.<br/><br/>Special effects were moderate.  They were good enough not to date the movie but nothing spectacular.  The set designs outpaced them handily.  Combined with good cinematography, the physical feel of the movie actually had more weight and impact than the rest of its elements.<br/><br/>Overall, I was frightened by this movie.  Watching it alone at 1 AM I almost had to leave the house after I saw it.  There were moments that in all honesty kinda stank, but the overall effect was unhindered by them.  The level of gore was high, but it was properly used, I think.  The subject matter this movie dealt with combined the elements of gore and violence and other taboo subjects in the proper way to shock, but didn't load them up to the point of rediculousness.  However, I do warn that you do prepare to be shocked.  This movie, when it opens up, pulls no punches.  It is a scary, creepy movie that if it had been done to some high ideal of ""perfection"" in what it tried to do might be nigh unwatchable.  I highly recommend it for a good scare.  Watch with friends. :-)"

Doesn't matter.  Horror films usually startle me, but don't actually scare me.  This one does, so that means it did it's job admirably.<br/><br/>The whole thing is beautifully designed and decorated.  The characterizations are good, and don't really provide any comfort.  Nothing about any of these people says ""Hero who will succeed and save the rest of the world,"" which just adds to the tension.<br/><br/>It's not the smartest film I ever saw, but since I respect it's emotional impact, this film gets a ten from me."

I missed the chance to see it when it was in theatres, so I rented it when it came out on tape.  The plot surrounds the Event Horizon, an enormous spaceship that has the ability to jump from one point in galaxy to another in seconds using the Gravity Drive, the device that makes this even possible.  Anyway, it disappears on its maiden voyage and mysteriously reappears 7 years later.  A rescue team led by (Laurence Fishburne) is sent to investigate.  When they arrive, they discover that no one is on the ship, but of course it doesn't mean they're alone.  Soon after they arrive, the crew members begin witnessing horrific visions as the ship begins ""toying"" with there minds, searching deep down into their minds projecting their secrets and fears and turns them into horrifying reality. When I watched it, I had no idea that it was actually a horror movie and not a sci-fi film.  Viewers be warned, Event Horizon contains some really gory and sometimes grotesque images that are not pleasant to look at.  Event Horizon is a great horror movie and should be a classic."

","Many people seem to really dislike this movie.  I have now watched it several times and think it's really a pretty good film, for several reasons.  First, the special effects were excellent (no one argues here). Secondly, the actors (gender neutral term here, folks) were excellent (Fishburne, Neil, and Quinlan are all big names).  Next, this film went beyond many sci-fi flicks in that there was not the simplicity of a nice ugly creature to shoot at.  Next, it was rich in symbolism (e.g. the ship being in the shape of a giant crucifix).  In addition, the sound-track combined the modern sounds of 'Orbital' with symphonic sounds which is a nice mix.  Also, parts of the film, though very graphic at parts, made very great impressions by what they did NOT show you (letting you use your brain and imagination, which many newer films don't).  Finally, the ending was not a standard horror ending, but one that took a little intestinal fortitude (aka. Guts) to use (I won't say more about why I liked the end as it would spoil it).  In conclusion, give this film a fair chance when you go to see it."

","Although I don´t like any other of Paul W. S. Anderson´s movies, ""Event Horizon"" is one of my favourite sci-fi flicks of the 90s. The threatening atmosphere is built up in an intelligent way and the sequences when the rescue crew is exploring the corridors of the deserted space ship make your nerves break. Even the ship itself is scary at first glance. The menacing atmosphere is mainly created on the fact that the rescuers can´t see an ""enemy"" or any reason for the disappearance of the ship (at least for a long time). -The unknown itself is the enemy and here ""Event Horizon"" shows some parallels to ""Alien"" (although Alien is far better). The score is wonderful and majestic and it underlines the horror of being trapped in space. Also the idea of the story is not bad. Acting was o.k. to me.

","Strange. I was hesitant about this film basically because it had Laurence Fishburne playing a spaceship captain. I like Laurence Fishburne. He's a decent enough actor - probably a little under-rated. But I couldn't really see him in that kind of role. He surprised me. I thought he worked quite well as Captain Miller of the Rescue Ship Lewis & Clark, sent to investigate the sudden appearance of a ship (the Event Horizon) that suddenly appears in orbit around Neptune after disappearing seven years before. The truly unfortunate thing was that Fishburne seemed to be the only thing that worked in this. The rest of the cast didn't really capture me, and the story just didn't grab me.<br/><br/>The Event Horizon had been testing out a new kind of engine that would allow it to travel faster than the speed of light by essentially bending time. It was lost without a trace. When it reappeared (in the year 2047) Miller's team, which had the scientist who invented the new engine (played by Sam Neill) included, heads off. There seem to be no survivors, but plenty of strange things happen - which are clearly related to this new kind of engine. The crew has strange hallucinations (or are they?) and it turns out that what the new engine has actually done is somehow opened a hole into a new dimension; into some parallel universe that can only be described as hell.<br/><br/>It disappointed me.

However, that hardly does this underrated film the justice that it deserves.<br/><br/>From the opening shot to the closing one there are a whole bunch of things that make this an effective horror film. There's the setting, a huge derelict spaceship. There's the question of where is has been and why the crew disappeared. There's also the question as to what made them disappear and is this thing still on board. Naturally, for there to be a movie, the answer to the latter is yes.<br/><br/>An interesting thing about this film is that it plays almost like a typical slasher movie, but the catch is that there is no masked psycho with a knife.

This film dares say, ""Not so fast. It is scary out there."" The concept of ""inferno ex Astra"" is a literary and cinematic road not taken as often as it should be. <br/><br/>I took from this film the idea that humanity is still young and inexperienced, and playing dice with the greatest force of nature (singularities) could lead to horrors unimagined before. Far from a perfect film, Event Horizon should still be lauded for its daring as well as the brilliant performances of the heroic Fishbourne and the deliciously evil Neil. It may be far from unanimous, but I loved this film. Event Horizon, a classic of Futuristic Horror."
"mattwaterhouse","9","1","5","11 March 2008"," Works brilliantly as both a sci fi and a horror
","A signal is picked up in orbit of Neptune from the Event Horizon, a starship with experimental engines that went missing several years previously. A salvage crew, as well as the ship's designer, are sent to investigate and retrieve the ship and crew, but on board the Event Horizon all is not as it seems... <br/><br/>This movie is very good at creating suspense and it does this in many ways, from the performances of the characters and the magnificent score right down to the lighting. And it does this as well as any horror film (aside from the obvious genre leading films like Psycho etc.) The film undoubtedly works as a sci-fi too, but this is psychological horror at it's most disturbing without lapsing into torture porn. Performance-wise, overall this film is a showcase. Britain is represented brilliantly in Sam Neill (who is actually Australian, my bad), Jason Isaccs and Sean Pertwee. Neill in particular shines in what I believe is by far his deepest and most well acted role as Dr Weir. The other stand out performances are from Kathleen Quinlan and the criminally underused Jack Noseworthy: the latter's performance in the airlock scene is simply breathtaking. The only annoying thing about this film in terms of performance was that Laurence Fishburne and Joely Richardson, both established actors, could have and should have been a hell of a lot better in this movie. Richardson is not in it enough, but neither was Noseworthy so thats no excuse. And the Cooper character was just there to play a black stereotype, saying ""OOOO YEAH BABY!"" at every opportunity. Without him this movie would be a definite ten. <br/><br/>I have seen this film a couple of times, and it still has the capacity to make me soil myself every time. For fans of sci fi and horror this is a must see."
"aurelius-13","8","1","5","27 October 2007"," A decent horror film
","Event Horizon is one of my favorite horror films to watch. When I was a child I have seen one scene where this man's skin is scorched, but this demonic being is also immortal. The conclusion really grabbed my attention to watch the whole movie. <br/><br/>Spoiler: So we begin a missing spacecraft, which was zapped faster than light-speed and it cut through another dimension that was unfortunately ""Hell."" When the ship was discovered seven years after, this crew flies to this missing-mysterious spaceship and venture around. Throughout their quest in the vessel, each individual of the crew kept having these hallucinations about their despondent past. Later on, a scientist named Dr. Weir who has constructed this hellish spacecraft have finally told the crew the secret that this ship was brought back from Hell. This is where the good part starts. After when most of the crew died, the captain and two other survivors tries to destroy one part of the ship so the other part can freely return to Earth. The cool thing is after the captain solely places the last detonator on the ship, a strong heat was closely beside him and this fiery being who is actually Dr. Weir appears; this is what I have explained above. <br/><br/>Spoilers:<br/><br/>Positives: The grasping-terrifying ship, great frightening decorations like the spikes at every door, the music, the flashbacks, the gore wasn't overdone, and the actors played very well.<br/><br/>Negatives: When the crew discovered a camera that recorded what happened during the mysterious disappearance, the video showed the earlier crew being tortured but it seemed too short: although the deleted scenes show 30 minutes of this, which I haven't seen. They could have shown more on the captain's past, and they could show what the youngest member saw when he was forced inside this dark dimension. <br/><br/>Please, give it a chance. The movie is very great despite that this didn't have great results. In my opinion, you will enjoy every moment of it."

","This movie is Beyond Great!! It's one of the best, if not The Best, dark sci-fi movies of all time!!!!!!! What's in the core?? The acting style still holds up to today's standards (2006), the directing and production is very creative. I feel like movies like this used a different creativity that was more abundant at the time. In this case 1997. It's only been 10 years, but the technology of now certainly has not enhanced the creativity of movies in my humble/angry opinion. What's wrong with Hollywood?? Example MI 3. This style has been done 10 billion times already!! And it's been done way better, with less technology!! WTF! I really think that the creativity is so low today, it's like at a light simmer, and i think it has to do with a mass over indulgence in S E X. How's that for darkness?!? It's like the current consciousness is saying ""Who cares, I get laid anyway!"" And women don't really care (stereo typically speaking) They just want ""chick flicks"" e.g. no effects, pure emotion e.g. just be natural and vomit all over the film! How did that make you feel?

","Excellent movie. Sure, it has its glitches, but it does a great job at scaring the beejezus out of you. The music is outstanding, with frantic beats and trumpets filled with angst. The effects are excellent, and the make-up is quite convincing. The only thing that you could say doesn't click quite right is the plot, but it does hold more in is more believable than your standard horror movie. The tension is held throughout the whole movie, and it provides decent plot twists. In the aspect of acting, the cast does a decent job at characterizing the different personalities of the crew. The only one that fails is Laurence Fishburne, who looks ""bored"" where a normal person would be screaming histerically in horror. But it doesn't distract that much. Special note for Sam Neill's performance, which is a very convincing portrait of his role. Also noteworthy, the music by Michael Kamen and electronic-gurus Orbital. Is an excellent mixxture of two very good genres, capable of scaring the crap out of you by itself. I'm listening at it on headphones now and I've jumped in my chair 4 times, in 2 songs. Is a must see for fiction and terror fans alike"

"sebbezw","10","1","5","4 February 2006"," I don't understand why it gets so mediocre ratings
","This is sci fi horror at its best. Maybe I'm just plain stupid, but movies never scare me. But this one did it. Its efficiently scaring, disturbing and creepy, and at the same time brutal and shocking. Is it hard to understand that mix? Well, mix up Hellraiser: Hell on Earth and Hellraiser: Inferno and put in a sci fi plot and voilá! We've got Event Horizon! Now, the (near) perfect script isn't the only superb thing which makes this movie incredible. Great acting from Sam Neill, Laurence Fishburne and Jason Isaacs is also very important. I never liked Fishburne, but this movie changed my mind about this wonderful guy. Sam Neill has always ruled and he does that in this movie too. Jason Isaacs is one of my personal favorite actors so I cant give him bad criticism. Sorry, I just cant. In this case I cant give him that just 'cos his my favorite, he is truly great in this movie. And so is all the other actors. They put their soul and mind in their performance and they add their part to make a true masterpiece.<br/><br/>The special effects rule too. So does the direction. And the production. And, I never thought I would say this about a movie which only lasted for 'bout 90 minutes, the running time is perfect. Every second is valuable, perfectly used and not a single moment or scene seems to be wasted. Gee, just listen to what I'm saying! Here I'm sitting and raising this movie to the heavens! Is there really nothing to complain about? Well, just let me say one word; ""No."" I love this movie. If you liked Alien 'cos of the sci fi horror, then you'll love this! I promise!

","This movie disturbs me and torments me.. the more I watch it.. the more it bothers me. There are very few movies that affect me like this. The horribly gory and violent parts are all in the quick flash scenes.. when you freeze frame and examine those scenes on the DVD, I was scared beyond belief. The horrible things that happen... the flash-forwards and flashbacks... This movie is all about the atmosphere, where the story takes place.. the spaceship Event Horizon (a very scary looking spaceship if you ask me), that disappears 7 years earlier and shows up out of nowhere.. where has it been? What happened to it? If I had a choice... i would rather not know (but that is because I found out what happened and it scared the crap out of me)... I can't quite explain it in words... but this movie is quite a masterpiece. It succeeds where most of the Sci-Fi Horror movies don't.. it actually scared and bothered me.. frightened me even... I must give kudos to Anderson for that. And I cant wait for the Special Edition DVD that I hear is coming soon... I hear there are lots of Deleted Scenes... disturbing scenes.. maybe I can get even more frightened by this great movie..."

","The best film ever! Sam Neill and Mr Fishburn rules this movie. The plot is great and the story is smart. I have seen this movie more then 100 times, (on VHS i watched it until the color of the movie went away!!!)<br/><br/>The film is a never slowing orgy of scary events and it escalates through out the whole piece.<br/><br/>I thought this movie was made by John Carpenter, but it was not. Paul Anderson is quit new on the market and has just had time to a few movies. I like Aline vs predator as well. But that movie is not nearly as good as this; though the connection to Alien is clear. This is like a Hellraiser meets Alien. Highly recommended. Of course."
"Electrohermit","10","1","5","15 June 2005"," One of the scariest
","Don't let the critiques slamming this movie, convince you not to watch Event Horizon. That would be a mistake. Read on, and I'll explain this complicated and disturbing film. There is a hint of a spoiler within my comments, but not enough to effect the film viewing for you. I am a professional artist and writer, with a knack for sci-fi, I try to give some room for imagination. Films that are not perfectly produced can still be extremely entertaining, if you get over the rough edges. Now, in Event Horizon there is cliché dialog and visual elements that could have been more finished. Get over that, and you'll watch one of the most disturbing films ever. Could the film have been made better? Yes. Is the film gripping, believable and frightening? Very much so. Another review on this site suggested the story theme was not that original. I'm sorry, that's dead wrong. It's absolutely unique and frankly I found the concept of Hell, that the movie suggests rather realistically disturbing. In this day and age, when tens of thousands of people are reporting near death experiences and scientists are slowly confirming the existence of other quantum dimensions; there could actually be something very horrible that we are not aware of. I'm not a religious person, but obviously consciousness is forever, atoms just bounce around and fade out eventually. Emotions and experience are massless and carry on in the universe forever. Thoughtful entities in the universe, over an infinite amount of time, will eventually congregate together. Natural physics. Now, if the soul is massless and indestructible, where do all the dark beings go? huh. think about that. Wherever they are ""left"" to congregate would be a very disturbing place indeed. Interestingly, the internet is full of accounts of individuals in medical trauma, having NDEs reporting unimaginable realms outside of space-time, with various levels of benevolence and malevolence. And this is exactly what scared the wits out of me watching the movie. Not so much for the fantastic special effects, the gore and the effects are just enough to enter your psyche and wreak havoc. A good example is ""The Exorcist"". Quite a simple concept really. If someone told you a little girl is tied to a bed the whole movie and talking, occasionally feeling nauseas; you would laugh if someone said you'd be tempted to leave the theater in fear. Think, it's not the prop or actors, it's the concept of demons that wiggles under your membranes. Event Horizon is the same concept, and I applaud the writer and Director. If you watch the special features on the DVD, you will hear the Actors describe how the movie set was disturbing and physically draining to work in. The movie has a vibe. Another bone I have to pick with people is their entertainment systems. You simply can not have a sensory experience watching a sci-fi film on a small wimpy TV screen with tin can speakers. There is a threshold for effectiveness. You don't wake up in the morning and drink a teaspoon of coffee and say ""ahh, I feel better now"". It takes a full cup. Period. So you can not drink a good sci-fi film via a tiny TV. It takes a minimum of 40 inches in wide format. You also need stereo with speakers that are at least 6 inches in diameter and can produce good deep bass. With a nice screen you will melt into the scenery, it will surround you. The sounds will crawl up your back and get under your skin. Not everyone can afford a 58inch HDTV projection TV with surround sound, I realize. Just be aware the gear goes hand in hand with the experience. Be fair to your senses and taste. I'm convinced that 70 percent of the time, negative movie experiences are due to a lack of proper gear."

","**May have slight spoiler(s)**<br/><br/>Another movie on IMDb that for some reason everybody bashes. Can't figure you people out. This movie is excellent; well, at least those who prefer the genre(s)(horror and/or sci-fi). For all those who keep saying it is ""un-original"", how do you come to this assertion? I can think of no other ""ghost"" movie based in deep space on an ""abandoned"" ship. I basically think of it as a ""haunted house in outer space"". The ship itself was original enough - it creates a black hole within itself and travels through it. Not sure if astro-physics works that way, but who cares, it's a frickin' movie people!!!! The gore and scares are not too over the top and do enough to scare some. My only wish is that we got to see Paul Anderson's true cut of the film before the studio got involved. This movie and Alien 3 (another masterpiece!!) deserve to be re-released as full blown director's cuts. My suggestion: get some popcorn, plop yourself on the couch, and enjoy one of the best horror flicks to come around in the last 10 years. Rates 10/10 easily."

One should note that, unlike ""classics"", such as the Alien series, the story is actually challenging. And unlike lieutnant Ripley and her companions, these people actually do sensible things.

","Natural forces govern the universe.<br/><br/>Theoretical forces may govern a fictive universe.<br/><br/>Good science fiction attempts to bridge the gap between the two realms. By taking unanswerable questions of physics and applying theoretical possibilities, one may craft a compelling story.<br/><br/>An event horizon, in general relativity, is a boundary in space-time beyond which events cannot affect an outside observer. It is the point of no return.<br/><br/>Event Horizon falls prey to a common error in semi-recent science fiction: A drastic overestimation of our species' developments in space travel. This film is set in 2040, and it's doubtful our explorations will spread to Neptune by then.<br/><br/>But E.H. is best discussed as a horror flick. Judging it as such, I give it eight stars and call it great.<br/><br/>It tells a complex story that, due to production issues, builds on a cracked foundation.<br/><br/>So there are loose threads in the quilt. Most of the fibers are strongly woven with thought provoking ideas.<br/><br/>Profoundly dark musings, mind you; never forget it's smart, but still a horror movie.<br/><br/>A vivisection takes place. Vivisecting, no matter how tasteful the visual conveyance, is never fun.<br/><br/>If you'll allow the limitations set by the technology available in 1997 (in terms of CGI and production design) and can stomach a handful of unsettling scenes, then check it out for some thrills and chills. (It's available to stream instantly through Netflix.)<br/><br/>But if you haven't seen it and are sensitive to spoilers, stop reading.<br/><br/>To continue my introductory discussion, the viewer will buy into a theoretical force if it compels the story forward.<br/><br/>When it comes to Event Horizon, everything's sound until they board the actual ship. The stuff with the magazine centerfold is intelligent and easily acceptable.<br/><br/>Things get shaky once you start to consider the implications of the ship's consciousness.<br/><br/>What's with the ice crystals? Seems like someone fell in love with the term 'corpsicle.'<br/><br/>The filmmakers had two options for explaining the darkness inhabiting (or possessing) the ship. The reappearance of Weir towards the end, when he battles with Miller in the hellish core, is a physical incarnation of the entity.<br/><br/>The nature of that demonic being is what the film's final cut never nailed down. They could either call it Hell (a concrete location defined by religious beliefs, but at least a colloquial construct of reality), or generate their own mythological realm (the parallel dimension governed by chaos.)<br/><br/>Ultimately they don't answer the question.<br/><br/>I don't appreciate incomplete narratives, but I understand production difficulties. I just wish they'd picked a side and stuck with it.<br/><br/>It's simple enough to believe that the Event Horizon passes through this chaotic dimension but the affect it has on the ship requests a distant reach for our brains to continue the suspension of disbelief.<br/><br/>There's a bevy of examples, so I'll list a quick few. One of the main problems is what I call, 'an incongruence of metaphysical properties,' or the misalignment of surreal forces. The quick and easy i.e.? Telepathic abilities don't include clairvoyance.<br/><br/>Actions are governed by motivations, and for the plot to unfold the way it does, it would be according to the ship's mandate. We can assume the ship's all knowing and all-powerful, because it telepathically dissects the crew's memories and locates their fears. Furthermore, it projects hallucinations onto their consciousness.<br/><br/>Even further, it can cause objects to vanish, like Miller's gun. Meaning it can literally manipulate the fabric of existence.<br/><br/>If the ship has the ability to alter reality, its initial antagonism seems unmotivated and inexplicable. Why string along the entire crew through this revelatory process? What does the ship (or the evil entity possessing it) hope to gain through tormenting the individuals?<br/><br/>There's an inconsequential argument to be made here. Perhaps the entity's wish is to let the three crewmembers escape, thereby spreadingwhat, exactly? Hell on Earth? Why does Starck seem to be the only one 'infected' so to speak? The final scene suggests her mind's plagued with the same malady inhibiting Weir's character at the film's open.<br/><br/>Are we to assume events will play out in a similar manner for Starck as they did for Weir? That's impossible; the Event Horizon is half destroyed and returned to Earth. Will she rein terror across the planet?<br/><br/>To pile on top, soon after the film begins, Weir dreams of the corpse floating on the Event Horizon's flight deck. Thereby suggesting clairvoyance.<br/><br/>So you can see how the power imbalances, the inconsistencies between referential frames, and an ending of minimal consequence add up to a deceptively contrived narrative.<br/><br/>What's life going to be like for Justin, after the macabre experience he's been through? It's almost cruel to let him live; disfigured, traumatized, psychotic and likely suicidal. It's thoroughly twisted, but an attempt to defy convention seems the only impetus for retaining that character's life.<br/><br/>The intercepted audio recording is the perfect microcosm for the whole film.<br/><br/>It's creepy and ominous, and a believable mistranslation. I'll even allow the idea that their manner of speech transforms to Latin.<br/><br/>And hey, for fun, let's forego all discussion of computerized auditory scanners.<br/><br/>Who was the message, ""Save yourself from Hell,"" intended for?<br/><br/>And who had the wherewithal, after passing through the chaotic dimension, to broadcast the warning signal?<br/><br/>Oh. I get it.<br/><br/>Once infected, the spread of Hellish dementia's a gradual multi-stepped debilitation.<br/><br/>First comes the transformation of basic speech faculties. After that, the craving for sadomasochistic orgy manifests.<br/><br/>Silly me. It's all coming together now.<br/><br/>Better start rewriting this review.<br/><br/>Although.<br/><br/>Perhaps I've passed the event horizon<br/><br/>(See what I did there?)"

","I have always liked ""Event Horizon"" mostly I think because of my general loving of sci-fi horror, but despite a wonderfull cast (Fishburne & Neill glitter!) this film annoyingly suffers from so many plot holes, a lump of Swiss cheese would be jealous! Unfortunatly it is the plot holes that seriously let down what could have been a masterpiece of this genre & I am talking about serious ""who, what, why, where"" abyssess!<br/><br/>The first part of the movie is actually very good, & ticks along nicely (although I don't get it that water can save you from 10g Gravity?) But then my eyebrow gets raised when the first flashbacks begin. What has the wife of the designer of the EH ship got to do with the story? Next we get into the recovery of the ships video log, which is full on Wes Cravenesque porn/gore, which inlisted the talents of real life amputees & porn actors! Errr.....WHY!? & what was with the Latin language used for? a connection to Hell perhaps. Then the film begins to loose momentum when the rest of the crew begins to hallucinate/or see ghosts of loved ones. Some of these scenes are so long & drawn out it could almost be a snoozefest! But yet again, why are the crew seeing these hallucinations? because this is yet another big Swiss cheese plot hole which is never explained. This is ultimatly very sad because the original cut of this movie was 130 minutes making me wonder if this lost footage could have explain what is unexplained in the final cut.<br/><br/>Overall EH is a stylish attempt at an Alienesque film & it does have its fair share of jump shocks, gore & horror, but its the story that is sadly lacking. But saying all this the overall message of EH is that experimental deep space travel will take you to Hell, which is a weird message to take onboard. Is EH actually an ""ANTI-space"" movie? Well in this respect yes it is! Because here we are 20 years into the 21st century & we have not even been back to the moon.

","Event Horizon is directed by Paul W.S. Anderson and written by Philip Eisner. It stars Sam Neil, Laurence Fishburne, Joely Richardson, Kathleen Quinlan, Richard T.

Music is by Michael Kamen and orbital and cinematography is by Adrian Biddle.<br/><br/>2047 and a group of astronauts are sent to investigate the 'Event Horizon' which disappeared mysteriously 7 years ago. It has returned minus its crew and now the crew of the 'Lewis and Clark' become exposed to horrifying secrets of the ghost ship...<br/><br/>It is what it is, a haunted house chiller set on a space ship. It's derivative within the genre but it does the genre staples with no little amount of quality. The tone is set from the opening credits being accompanied by a ferociously foreboding musical score, and from there the pic delivers a ""who is going to get killed and in what order"" process - and why? Just what is the mystery at the core of it all?.<br/><br/>A great cast has been assembled, which lifts it above its ""B"" movie roots, so with some thoughtful ideas within the narrative, it's easy to buy into the characterisations. Naturally the blood will flow, devilishly so, but the makers here put a different slant on the sci-fi/horror assailant thread. Of course it gets a bit by the numbers come the final quarter, arguably a bit hokey in fact, but it's very effective and perfect for a lights off viewing experience.<br/><br/>Smart production design helps keeps up the chilly feel to proceedings, whilst the bleak tonal flows that director Anderson goes for really draws the engaged observer in. It's neither ground breaking or a top line film of its type, but holding up on repeat viewings it proves to be a sturdy and unsettling space based chiller. 7/10"

","Event horizon is one of the most cult classic movies of all time. As much as it is a mediocrity, I can see why. There is about 30 minutes of film cut from the final, and while it is a noticeable removal, any mysterious backstory is enough to turn what would have been a slightly above average sci-fi into what is now an urban legend. This cut also made the film basically uncriticizable, as any perceived flaws can be blamed on the cut rather than innate problems with the film. So as to win the favor of the fans before pissing them off, lets start with the positives of the film.<br/><br/>For one thing the costume design is great, as well as the concept. The concept's strength is what makes the execution such a disappointment to me, for reasons I will get to later. The acting is usually strong, especially from Laurence Fishburne. The movie is very good at building suspense as well.<br/><br/>The biggest and most noticeable flaw is the development of the characters. The characters are as generic as can be, the only thing making them interesting are the personal traumas that are taken advantage of in their own hell. If the movie had gone more in depth on these personal traumas, and really made an effort in showing how personal and scary these traumas were to these characters- the movie could have been something great. Instead we get a bunch of tropes with some dark backstory mislabeled as character.<br/><br/>Horror isn't know for it's strong characters (although there are definite exceptions to this) but in a movie that gains its horror from building personal hell for these characters, the least that could do is make them people."

","Directed by Paul W.S. Anderson (Mortal Kombat, Resident Evil, AVP: Alien vs. Predator, Pompeii), I had heard about this film many times, I knew it was sc-fi horror, and I knew one or two names in the cast, so I was hoping it would be something I'd like. Basically in the year 2047, humanity has successfully colonised on the Moon and other planets, and starships have managed to travel and venture deeper into space than ever before, one such ship was the ""Event Horizon"", an experimental government starship, but it mysteriously disappeared seven years ago going beyond the planet Neptune, this loss was considered the worst space disaster on record. However a distress signal was picked up that appeared to come from the Event Horizon, so an astronaut crew on the rescue vessel ""Lewis and Clark"" has been dispatched to investigate, salvage and rescue any living survivors on the ship, they are led by Captain Miller (Laurence Fishburne), and guided by the Event Horizon's designer Dr. William Weir (Sam Neill). The Lewis and Clark crew consists of Executive Officer Lieutenant Starck (Joely Richardson), pilot Smith (Sean Pertwee), Medical Technician Peters (Kathleen Quinlan), Engineer Ensign Justin (Jack Noseworthy), Rescue Technician Cooper (Richard T. Jones) and Trauma Doctor D.J. (Jason Isaacs). The ship is found in deep space, the crew manage to dock with it, but with limited supply of oxygen and increasing carbon dioxide they do not have long to find out what happened to the ship and its crew, it is not long though until the rescuing crew members realise the unimaginable and terrifying secrets lie within the ship. One by one each crew member experiences what is either a hallucination or an apparition that messes with their minds and causes them to panic or go mad, and it is all caused by a gateway, created on the ship to reach other places in space and time, but something was opened that has caused chaos for anyone that dares to venture in. Also starring Peter Marinker as Captain John Kilpack, Holley Chant as Claire and Barclay Wright as Denny Peters. This is obviously a B-movie, full of big names in the cast, but produced with a moderate budget, there are some good special effects and gory moments to satisfy the fans of things nasty, but the dialogue and storyline is rather hammy, and it is often predictable, but if you like to see things going wrong in space and many people going mad thinking they are seeing things, then I suppose it's not a bad science-fiction horror.

"betafett-176-53500","6","0","1","18 April 2015"," Okay movie, but owes huge debt to better film makers
","Paul WS Anderson has never been shy of inviting people to compare his work (unworthily) to Ridley Scott and James Cameron's time and time again, but Event Horizon, whilst starting off with an unashamedly barefaced 'homage' to Alien's blue collar vibe, owes more to John Carpenter than anyone else. Admittedly Anderson telegraphs this from the opening expositional text, which, like Carpenter's seminal Escape from New York, ends with the year it's set in before declaring that its future setting is actually (a very meta) NOW (something Neil Marshall would repeat in his EfNY/Carpenter homage, Doomsday). The whole flick could be summed up as '2010: Odyssey 2 meets Prince of Darkness' with a little Stanley Kubrick touch added here or there. So, no points for originality then, as Anderson begins his lifelong career choice of associating himself with better and more successful directors. But, despite all this, the movie isn't the train wreck it perhaps deserved to be. Most of the actors throw themselves into their (underdeveloped) roles and, aside from some wooden dialogue and ham-fisted exposition, do a mostly decent job. The special FX are passable, again apart from some ropey effects of liquid suspended in zero gravity. There's a few decent jump scares and a foreboding atmosphere actually more subtle than you would really expect from Anderson. Make up and gore effects were decent too. I'm not a fan of Anderson, and have resisted watching Event Horizon for years, despite repeated recommendations,. But having watched it now, I can happily say I found it his most watchable flick, even though as I write this it's now 18 years old. Is it great? No. Terrible? No. Slightly above average? Yeah, that's fair. But I suppose your work will be elevated too when you stand on the shoulders of giants."

","'Event Horizon' is basically a 'haunted house' but not a house – a spaceship instead. Many people have called it 'Alien meets Hellraiser' and, seeing as I can't think of a better description, I would say that's pretty apt.<br/><br/>A rescue ship locates the wreckage of the lost long experimental starship the 'Event Horizon' and goes in to investigate. Not a good idea. Soon all manner of spookiness and nastiness befall the rescuers and they end up the ones in need of saving.<br/><br/>You'll probably recognise a fair few of the cast (mainly Lawrence Fishburne in his 'pre-Morpheous days) and they all do a good job at portraying their characters. However, the real star of the film is the ship itself. The Event Horizon is brilliantly realised and the sets are amazing. This all goes to help build the film's ultimate plus point: the atmosphere. It's dark, it's brooding and you do feel that you're in a – albeit futuristic – haunted house.<br/><br/>There's not an awful lot of 'sci-fi/horror' films about these days, so perhaps this one fits into a bit of a niche market. So, if you like the sound of something which has the atmosphere of Alien crossed with the gore and themes of Hellraiser, then this is for you.<br/><br/>http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/"
"Field78","8","0","1","9 June 2014"," This movie went to Hell and back, and left a piece of it inside me!
","Event Horizon is one of those underrated science fiction movies with a legendary troubled production, but the finished product, despite some obvious flaws, still had a solid core that deserved to be seen. Nevertheless, it took an undeserved beating from critics, and the praises from admirers were drown out by cries of derision from detractors. But then it became a cult-phenomenon. Fans congregated on websites and learned that they were not alone in their admiration. Behind-the-scenes footage showed the intention of the filmmakers, deleted material, and sometimes a glimpse of what could have been.<br/><br/>'Hollow', 'boring', 'overly depending on special effects' and 'not scary' were some of the complaints heard on the initial release. Well, 'not scary' is something I didn't believe from the start. I have never been able to finish this movie without a light on (especially not after hearing that last transmission played by Weir). The idea that a ship returns with a presence that can turn even the most rational person into a ragingly aggressive, mutilating animal scares me beyond anything that I can imagine. Although I am not an overly religious person, the notion that something resembling 'Hell' could physically exist is more than I want to contemplate. The potential beast inside us and others as the ultimate scare, it is a pretty original gimmick that few horror movies actually employ. With such a solid-gold premise, EH is one of the scariest movies of all time to me. It sadly is not among the very BEST scary movies ever, but it occupies a special place for me.<br/><br/>Paul W. Anderson made a lot of not-too-memorable movies, but this 'Shining in space' guarantees him some cult-status (perhaps because he didn't write it?). The wise casting of not-too-familiar character actors makes it not completely obvious which characters are going to die. It also provides sturdy performances from Lawrence Fishburn as the plagued but determined captain, and from Sam Neill, whose surprising but believable turn towards evil in the second half is actually one of the movie's strongest assets. The ships' interior designs and props seemed a bit clunky and unrealistic to me at first, but the future isn't necessarily Star Trek perfect; EH shows us a state-of-the-art ship still very much limited by human imperfections. It is easy to see how ahead of its time this design was in the 90s, and another reason why the movie deserves a re-assessment. By giving the ship the look and feel of a church, the connection with Hell as a place where the sinners are to be judged is aptly made, showing that the makers tried to put in a subtext beyond the ordinary slasher movie. Cinematographer Adrian Biddle uses sweeping camera shots to capture the dark beauty, but knows to keep it steady during the action scenes. Usually, horror works best off-screen, but some of the shock effects, ranging from empty eye sockets to a horribly twisted sado-masochistic home video, are the stuff nightmares are made of, and deserve to be shown in full g(l)ory. The nerve-wrecking sound design makes these scenes perfectly timed, heart-pounding moments. But the biggest impact comes from the 'Visions from Hell', which show glimpses of some of the most gruesome images of mangling and torture ever committed to film outside of a snuff movie. Of course, I couldn't resist going through those scenes frame by frame. I really shouldn't have. I have a pretty good idea now of what Hell could look like.<br/><br/>EH has plenty of sick and twisted greatness, but it also has its flaws. Some of the (computer-generated) special effects look unfinished, thanks to a looming release date and an unfortunately rushed production. I feel less bothered by this over time; most great films reveal their technical flaws over time. I am more concerned with what seems missing from the film. Negative test screenings necessitated additional revisions and editing, leaving no time for fine-tuning the drama. Sadly, this has become the way movie blockbusters are made these days, and sometimes it shows: the first act of the movie adequately builds up tension and anticipation, the second act delivers quite well with all the unraveling and increasing terror, but the film regrettably rushes through its final act. The straightforward finale is mostly to blame, as many of the genre's conventions take over: the guilt- stricken hero making his final sacrifice, the bad guy returning for the final showdown, and a big explosion to wrap things up. Some opportunities for important character moments were missed. While some of the crew's torments take center stage, it would have helped greatly if the other characters were more involved in the story than is the case now. Still, with the exception of two people, all cast members get their moments in the spotlights. There are no redundant characters here that I wished to have killed off. Sean Pertwee has a few of the best moments as the character who instinctively knows they're in the wrong place; Joely Richardson and Jason Isaacs are the cool-headed voices of reason. Jack Noseworthy, however, feels like 'the early victim' who lacks development, and Richard T. Jones' comic relief feels a bit forced at times. <br/><br/>EH is nowadays praised as quite daring, and influential in both movies (torture-porn?) and games. Although it may not be a masterpiece, this movie has had its long-lasting effects on me. Art isn't necessary beautiful or in good taste, and if quality can be measured in how something moves us, then EH certainly has some. Every time I watch it, I cannot help being drawn to those scenes that truly disturb me, like a ship out of Hell that is beckoning me to surrender to Evil. Every time I have seen it, I lose at least an hour of sleep over it. God knows why we mortals keep putting ourselves through this kind of mental auto-mutilation. Damn this movie!! Can't wait to see it again"
"TheSeaLion","6","0","2","24 April 2014"," An underrated sci-fi horror flick
","There were two films that ""Event Horizon"" reminded me of. The first movie it reminded me of was Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" from 1979 where a crew aboard a freighter goes down to a planet, brings back the alien creature, and then has it pick off the crew one by one. The other film I was reminded of was the film ""Sphere"" based off a novel by Michael Crichton where a team underwater finds a futuristic spaceship and discovers a sphere on it which allows the people who enter it to create real threats with their thoughts. ""Event Horizon"" has the scary, dramatic thrill that ""Alien"" had, but also some of the stupidity that ""Sphere"" had.<br/><br/>In the year 2040, the starship 'Event Horizon' disappeared on its maiden voyage. Seven years later, a distress signal from the ship has been received and the crew of the rescue vessel 'Lewis and Clark', along with Dr. Weir (Sam Neil) who helped build the ship, are sent to investigate it. Upon arriving at the ship, they find the crew all dead, but that there are still life-sign readings. Upon further investigation, it turns out that the ship entered a black hole and emerged, now with something controlling it.<br/><br/>Starting off, the crew of the ship is not all that interesting. There is a stereotypical comedic relief character named Cooper (Richard T. Jones), a member of the crew who was whisked away from her son's birthday named Peters (Kathleen Quinlan), and several others. The only two characters in the film who stand out as even remotely interesting are Dr. Weir and Captain Miller (Laurence Fishburne). However, with the exception of Cooper, the characters are not annoying blank slates that are just there for cannon fodder and, for the most part, you can at least be mildly worried about what the outcome for the character might be.<br/><br/>I really appreciate that in a film like this that was made in the late '90s that they did not resort to CGI to create the ships and used models instead, and that the use of CGI was very restricted. The use of models for the ships reminded me and helped me picture the setting of ""Alien"", which I think the film was basing its horror movie in space premise off of. The film was not more interested in showing special effects than it was on telling the story it wanted to tell, which I am glad about. Another notable thing to mention is the design of the 'Event Horizon' is an original spaceship design that I have never seen in any other movie or television show.<br/><br/>After the crew of the 'Lewis and Clark' look around and investigate the ship, the movie starts to go into the stupidity territory with its plot. The ship used its gravity-drive to enter another universe via a black hole and when it came out, the ship began to screw with its crew, and now the 'Lewis and Clark' crew's minds. I liked the fact that there was not a monster that was on the ship that picked the crew off and it was more of a psychological horror story for the cast, but the idea that the ship is now alive and doing that is ludicrous, even in science-fiction terms. There is not an A.I in the ship's computer that went haywire from the black hole, or the ship is not just stuck in between the two universes, the ship is simply alive and is scaring them.<br/><br/>At the end, I became a little fed up with the movie because it did the only thing dumber than having the ship be alive. It brought back Dr. Weir, who beforehand had been sucked into space via an opening in the ship after he was, I have no idea so let's just say infected, by the ship. The ship brings him back, now as a monster to confront Captain Miller. <br/><br/>The film does have some stupid moments in it; sometimes really stupid moments, but it also has a genuinely creepy atmosphere and tone to it, and the idea that the crew is being attacked by their thoughts and not some scary space creature is something I enjoyed. While I will not say this is an underrated masterpiece, I will say it is an underrated film that more people should watch."

","Originally conceived as THE SHINING in space, by the end I think EVENT HORIZON has become more like HELLRAISER in space, although of course one of the later HELLRAISER movies was just that. This is an intriguing and interesting sci-fi/horror movie that initially feels like an ALIEN clone before becoming something else quite different.<br/><br/>The problem is that the story is sadly flawed, spending too much time on all-too-familiar situations and not enough time on the true horror envisaged by the screenwriter. It seems to take the crew an age to get to their destination, and even when stuff is finally happening, the ending is quite choppy. Apparently, 20 minutes of violent footage were excised after a poor reaction from the test audience, which I think is a real shame.<br/><br/>Another problem lies in the choice of director Paul W. S. Anderson, who is and has been one of the worst directors working in Hollywood in recent years. This and DEATH RACE are the only films I truly like of his, and even in these two movies his direction is poor and over the top. The laboured comic relief is particularly noticeable here.<br/><br/>It's a pity, because the story has real potential, with undertones of Clive Barker and H. P. Lovecraft on occasion. The cast is decent too, with nice performances from the reliable Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill, as well as turns from the underrated Sean Pertwee and Jason Isaacs. I hope that an extended director's cut may surface one day and add more to the experience."

","Whoever would have thought that science fiction can be mixed in with religion? Well Event Horizon certainly does fit that bill and no doubt the 3D shooter game Doom certainly followed through.<br/><br/>Imagine a ship goes through Hell, must be one pretty bad trip especially when the thought of having demons in a science fiction world seems impossible. The movie color does give that evil view and Doom certainly took that creative license to another level.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, some of the acting was about on average especially with Sam Neil which could have been expanded like why was he so obsessed with the ship and the history on his wife too when she has no eyeballs.<br/><br/>Otherwise, a good film that goes good with Doom 3 since game was a success and no doubt owes some to this movie."

","A critical and commercial failure upon release, this black sheep of sci-fi horror films gained a cult-following and success with DVD/Video Cassette release afterwards. It is quite a solid film, incorporating a rather B-Movie idea with A-Grade production, great cinematography, and above average acting (particularly for a horror film). Character depth is not a big thing, although the characters are quite likable and full of personality whether serious or humorous. The plot involves a ship called Event Horizon that lost all communication after orbiting past Neptune to have the ship reappear several years later. The crew, unknowing of the ship's past or the mission they are about to participate in, mus investigate the ship for survivors only to find a dark secret about the ship which takes the crew's lives one by one. The horror pieces are effective and entertaining, complimented by a cool story and great visual effects/set pieces. Supposedly, the once-lost footage containing 25-30 minutes of extra background insight and horror sequences has been found and will hopefully encourage a director's cut release. The film does spoil some could-be-amazing parts but carries through to the ending that makes the stop and think for a second to realize how the terror isn't over. <br/><br/>8.5/10."

Why he became a creator of such crap movies ? <br/><br/>Good performances by Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill. All the crew members are recognizable and likable . There is a traditional black guy-who-is –comic-relief and you know what ? He's actually funny. The art-direction is beautiful in some places (the chamber). I really liked one camera angle when the camera spins around – it looked really cool. The special effects hold up good after all those years.<br/><br/>The movie scares quite nicely the audience with some disturbing images that won't leave or head for some time. It's a fun sci-fi horror movie that doesn't add anything new to the genre , yet provides a solid entertainment.<br/><br/>I give it 6/10."

","I've seen this movie over 20 times. I love it. And I'm not a big Anderson fan. Now, his wife on the other hand.........<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm a big 90's kid and this is a true 90's horror film. The idea of a haunted house movie in a spaceship is a good one. <br/><br/>Anderson may suck as a writer, but he actually not that bad of a director. As long as he is not writing the script, it's okay.<br/><br/>He knew how to scare people with this movie. The jump scares are great and there is a lot of moments that make you cringe. Like the video footage scene and D.J.'s demise. (shudder!) <br/><br/>For me, the most intense scene is when Justin is in the airlock without a suit. This scene really had me on the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>The Effects are still great. The model for the Event Horizon looks amazing. There are a few moments of poor CGI, like the scene where Justin goes into the core and there's bad CGI blobs everywhere and when the Lewis and Clark explodes. But everything else holds up today.<br/><br/>And you gotta love that corridor. It's so HUGE! The filmmakers used a very big mirror to make it look bigger. Same trick used in Aliens.<br/><br/>The performances are great. Sam Neil is very creepy as Dr Weir, and Richard T. Jones was very funny as Cooper. Normally the comic relief is the most annoying character in the film. But Cooper works because he's not played by a comedian, he's not annoying and he's not stereotypical. Also, they avoid the ""Killing the black guy"" cliché. Well, Miller dies though.<br/><br/>However, some of the editing in the climax between Miller and Weir is a bit choppy and what's with the massive close ups on Weir's mouth in that scene? <br/><br/>A failure on release, but has found it's audience on TV and DVD. There are teenagers discovering Event Horizon today. <br/><br/>Overall, the best movie Anderson has made. I think he said that this is his favourite movie he's done."

","Just watched this movie as per the suggestion of this post. What I expected? Shocking, gory imagery. Mind bending, unsettling theories of what could be possible in this world over the next 100 years. What The movie delivered? A middling sci-fi thriller with a pretty great cast; not particularly scary. The premise is great - the human race, ""flying too close to the sun,"" rips a hole in the fabric of space time, opening a portal to a chaotic, evil dimension. The spacecraft itself is transformed into an evil being, devouring any well-intentioned rescue crew that happens to cross its path. This is one of those movies that on paper and in my head seem incredible - limitless potential - but unfortunately the execution just did not match up. The hype I had built up based on comments people had made and a review or two that I had read prior to viewing made me expect a mind f*** to compete with other creepy sci fi flicks like The Cube or The Cell crossed with the horror and gore of Candyman. At the end of the day, I recommend checking out Event Horizon as a fun sci-fi movie that requires a bit of imagination and the suspension of disbelief thanks to the mid 90's special effects. Expect a 5/10, discover an 8/10. And that's my 2 cents."

","The Spaceship 'Event Horizon' disappeared near Neptune while on a classified mission to test a new drive system that could make interstellar travel a possibility; seven years later a broadcast was received and the rescue ship 'Lewis and Clark'. This ship's regular crew has been joined by Dr. Weir; the designer of the 'Event Horizon' and the only person to know the nature of the ship's revolutionary drive system; it uses a singularity to fold space enabling it to pass between two points almost instantly. Strange things start to happen once they arrive; scanners show lifeforms everywhere on the 'Event Horizon' and once aboard the crew start having strange visions of people they once knew; dead people! It would appear that that when the gateway opened for its test flight to Proxima Centauri it went somewhere on the way; a place of pure chaos and evil; for want of a better word Hell itself! By the time the crew realises something is wrong; it isn't a question of whether they whether get away alive it is a question of whether any of them will survive.<br/><br/>This sci-fi horror deserves to be better known; there may not be an alien aboard the ship but the strange presence is just as frightening; especially when the crew have visions that involve eyeless loved ones. For a film that isn't that well known it has a surprisingly strong cast of well known actors including Lawrence Fishburne, Joely Richardson, Jason Isaacs and Sean Pertwee amongst the crew; they all put in solid performances although it is Sam Neill who puts in the most memorable performance as Dr. Weir; a character that becomes more dangerous as time passes; whether he is going insane or becoming possessed by the evil controlling the ship is hard to say. They is a lot of disturbing imagery here; both when we see what happened to the old crew of the 'Event Horizon' and when things start going bad for the rescue team; if you don't like the sight of blood you'd best give this a miss but if you want a genuinely creepy sci-fi horror you could do a lot worse."
"TheExpatriate700","6","0","3","13 June 2012"," Great Climax, But Otherwise Unmemorable
","I was drawn to Event Horizon largely on the basis of deleted scenes I had seen on YouTube, particularly the famous orgy of destruction sequence. Although the climax lived up to the expectations this scene created, the rest of the film was middling at best. The plot involves a rescue mission sent out after the long lost space ship Event Horizon reappears.<br/><br/>The film's main selling point, other than its genuinely unsettling climax, is the presence of talented actors like Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill, which takes the film up a notch. Indeed, the film's early scenes give it a gritty realism, as the characters genuinely act like members of the military on an unexpected mission. However, there is not enough character development for the actors to work with, except for the Captain and Weir.<br/><br/>Furthermore, much of the imagery is clearly lifted from earlier films like Hellraiser and The Shining. Although Paul W. S. Anderson deserves credit for not turning the film into an Alien rip off, most of the film does not come across as particularly original.<br/><br/>The climax, with its visions of hell, earns the film a lot of slack, nonetheless. Heavily influenced by Hellraiser, it still manages to pack quite a wallop and will unnerve even veteran horror fans. Had the rest of the film included the deleted footage in the same vein, it would have been a classic."

"BA_Harrison","7","0","1","16 February 2012"," A haunted house in space.
","Event Horizon is set in the near future aboard a massive spacecraft in low-level orbit above Neptune, but at its heart, the film is nothing more than a haunted house movie given a sci-fi twist: the creepy spaceship is the film's Gothic mansion, the echoey walkways and ducts are its dusty rooms and wood-panelled corridors, the search and rescue team are its travellers seeking shelter for the night, Neptune's turbulent atmosphere is its raging thunderstorm, and rather than being built over a gateway to hell, the craft itself is the gateway, its high-tech drive capable of punching a hole into another dimension where chaos and evil reigns.<br/><br/>So, obvious sci-fi trappings such as zero gravity and suspended animation aside, it's tried and tested scares all the way, with hellish visions and supernatural shocks aplenty as director Paul W.S. Anderson skillfully lays on the atmosphere and gory horror. Anderson spoils matters somewhat in the film's closing minutes with an ill-considered finalé that sees one character blown into space by a huge explosion, but somehow surviving the blast to navigate his way back to the spaceship and intervene at a crucial moment, thus saving the day for token spunky female Lt. Starck (Joely Richardson). This rather daft ending almost saw me reducing my rating for Event Horizon from a 7 down to a 6, but the build up was so good that I am prepared to be forgiving."

","I went into Event Horizon with my expectations fairly low and my expectations were met. The film has some potential and seems promising for the first 30-40 minutes. The suspense is good, the plot is unraveling, and we're learning about Dr. William Weir and Captain Miller. <br/><br/>The plot is ridiculous. Once the team reaches the ""Event Horizon"" this movie really goes to hell (HA HA, GET IT?). It's explained that the ship has been to a terrifying realm outside of our universe and returned, and now it makes everyone hallucinate their worst fears. It goes through some back stories about how Captain Miller left one of his men on a ship to burn to death, and some other stuff that no one really cares about. Not to mention the lady that keeps seeing her son. Who cares? She doesn't contribute to the main story at all. It's all mindless filler that no one really cares for.<br/><br/>I must admit that I am a fan of science fiction but this one takes the cake in some aspects. At one point the crew is next to Neptune with 10 hours of breathable oxygen and no one is panicking at all. Oh you know, no big deal, just going to suffocate in 10 hours. Not to mention one of the crew members navigates space without a vessel. Just in his space suit. It's all a big mess.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is largely comparable to ""Sunshine"", but with much darker tone. It's enjoyable if you can overlook some of the highly unrealistic and poorly written ""drama"". I enjoyed it for the most part and would say it has a decent ""rewatchablity"". Decent film."
"The-Sarkologist","6","0","1","26 January 2012"," How technology can send you to hell
","To summarise this movie in a few words, it is a mix between Aliens and Hellraiser with an episode of Space 1999 thrown in. This movie is a Science-fiction horror – that means there is gore and there is lots of mention of hell and there are corpses running about. To me that is not horror, rather horror is something that makes me scared or makes me jump – this movie did neither, though I will say that it is quite suspenseful.<br/><br/>Simply the story is that Earth is only beginning to move into space. They have just colonised the Moon and Mars and have sent one ship out to explore the outer reaches of the solar system – it never returned. Seven years later, another ship – the Lewis and Clark, set off to find this ship.<br/><br/>The action of the movie is set aboard the ship The Event Horizon and is trapped in the upper atmosphere of Neptune. The visual effects are quite outstanding. When the camera zooms away from Daylight station at the beginning, a real sense of vertigo comes over the viewer. The depiction of a very stormy and wind swept upper atmosphere is quite good as well – though if it is windy then there would be atmosphere which the movie clearly states there is not. This movie also looks at going into a vacuum without a protecting suit. Some have said that the body will explode immediately – and this is possible if you still have air in your lungs. The whole spacing scene is quite gruesome.<br/><br/>Some of the more shocking scenes of the movie deals with the gore. As a viewer we are led to watch some very gruesome scenes – and some lead up to some even more gruesome ones, though we are spared seeing them at the last minute. This is not something that I enjoy though; gore, I find, really puts me off a movie and even though it is used to incite emotions, the emotions that tend to be incited I tend not to appreciate.<br/><br/>Event Horizon exploits the unknown. Like other horror movies, there is a lot of supernatural suggestions and this tends to scare people – that is if you do not truly understand the truth about this universe. It really looks at the extent of human endeavour and how our desire to become master of the universe is also bringing about our destruction. It looks at the horror of how our exploration into the unknown could release powers that we cannot control. This almost happened with Nuclear weapons, and the possibility of it going out of our hands still exist. We are destined for destruction and our greed will take us there.<br/><br/>Characters are interesting but really nothing to explore deeply. Captain Miller (Laurence Fishburne) is okay and so is Doctor Weir (Sam Neill). The movie does create a mystery as to their past and slowly reveals it to us. We watch as these to main characters are confronted by their fears and watch how these fears try to destroy them. Even though these characters are faced with fears, these two are really the only two that are developed. One character is tormented by her dead son but the others tend to remain shallow and unobtrusive. The rescue technician does provide for a bit of relief, but even so, the development that exists with Miller and Doctor Weir is not at all evident. One thing that I noticed is the large number of Australian accents in the movie.<br/><br/>Event Horizon is good if you like horror and suspense. If you are in for a simple science-fiction flick then wait for Lost in Space (not that I have seen it at the time of writing this)."

","The writers at least understood how horror films work. They avoided jump ""scares"", relying instead on actual atmosphere (at first). The gore isn't really for gore's sake and seems intended to shock people with the depravity of the acts, since many violent acts are shown after the fact.<br/><br/>Additionally if the writers didn't have the sense to leave it ambiguous, it missed any real explanation, as the only reference about ""Hell"" seems to be a translation from one recorded message, hence more along the lines of a character's perception.<br/><br/>They didn't entirely avoid tripping themselves up.

","""Hell is only a word. The reality is much, much worse."" -- Dr. Weir (Sam Neill)<br/><br/>Evidently, there's not a lot left that you can do in science fiction and horror, so if you're going to steal, why not steal from the best?<br/><br/>Event Horizon, from director Paul Anderson (the Resident Evil franchise), opens with a blue collar crew (like the guys in Alien) on their way to rendezvous with a missing spaceship lost under mysterious circumstances (like in 2010). Along for the ride with Captain Laurence Fishburne (The Matrix) and officers Joely Richardson (Nell) and Kathleen Quinlan (Apollo XIII) is Sam Neil (Jurassic Park) as the mysterious Professor Weir, designer of the titular Event Horizon, the first vessel to attempt faster-than-light travel, and who evidently forgot the ""D"" at the end of his name. Weir's revolutionary gravity drive is the same type of spinning, concentric hoola hoops that propelled Jody Foster in Contact, reinterpreted in massive black steel, in keeping with director Anderson's techno-medieval design scheme.<br/><br/>The plot line is timely, as NASA just announced a research directive to determine if there actually is any reasonable possibility of interstellar travel, which involves exotic technologies to shear the fabric of the space-time continuum. Unlike the folks in Star Trek who blithely engage their warp drive at the drop of a helmet, the unfortunate crew of the Event Horizon has discovered that removing one's self from the comfortable environment of matter, energy, time and space leads to a chaotic dimension which may or may not be Hell. Consequently, the rescue team enters a ghost ship connected to that Otherwhere by its warp engine, which now pulses and throbs like a living thing. But, when Professor Weir is possessed (like Jack Nicholson in The Shining), he becomes obsessed with dragging Captain Fishburne and the others back down the maw of the infernal singularity, while I wondered, ""Didn't I see this same plot in Disney's space bomb, The Black Hole?""<br/><br/>Even though its production design borrows liberally and probably unavoidably from Alien and its sequels, Event Horizon is more like The Shining because there aren't any monsters jumping through the airlock. Its terror is more psychological as the malevolent ship, a place imbued with evil, much like the Overlook Hotel, tries to trick its hapless victims into joining it for a return cruise to Hell by playing on their innermost fears and guilts.<br/><br/>The cast gives it their all, but never achieves quite the audience identification factor that Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerritt, Yaphet Kotto and their co-stars did in Alien. The film attempts to be scientifically plausible, although it pretends, like all science fiction except 2001, that spaceships have gravity. Like that concession to physical logic, the film is also obliged to send its characters off by themselves so they can be picked off one by one. And just when you think you've pegged it as Alien meets The Shining meets The Black Hole, suddenly a character turns up in make-up inspired by Pinhead in the Hellraiser series, spouting the same sadomasochistic bull about how, when you're separated from matter and energy, pain and terror become the most intense sensations, creepy sentiments also expressed in director Stuart Gordon's From Beyond.<br/><br/>But even though it's derivative of just about everything, Event Horizon is still entertainingly scary, although the most frightening aspect may be the sound track's ability to spike from near silence to overdrive, like Captain Fishburne just gave the order for ""Maximum decibels!"" Hey, you have to love a horror movie that can use as its title track a high-energy dance song called ""Funky S--t!"""
"trnjamesbond","8","0","1","8 October 2010"," The Dark Within Us
","I have just watched this movie again and I wanted to write a review on it. It is not a perfect film by any means. But it has a lot of fantasy thinking. The opening score of the film is very energetic with a mix between electronica style music and symphony with dark subtle undertones, it makes you feel that your on the last downward spiral of a really great roller coaster ride. And to ask a question, is the technology in this film based on fact or fiction? When I sit down to watch this movie it makes me believe every time that this kind of space travel might be plausible in the future. It is by any means a simple detective styled film, mixed in with horror and science fiction. An excellent combination by any standards of the film making process.<br/><br/>I think this is why the story works for me. The way I look at horror films in general, or any film actually, is do the main characters appearing on screen seem likable? Bad or Good. And in this film they are. Sam Neil is excellent as usual and also Lawrence Fishburn, which I admit to be a very strong believable character of the film. The supporting cast does exactly what they are suppose to do within their character range. As we are all introduced at the beginning of the film, as the captain introduces the crew to Dr. Weir's character, this is why this works. We get to know the characters and learn to like them. The only character in the film that I feel uncomfortable with is Sam Neil's character. With the beginning intro of his wife committing suicide. So you know right away that this person is unstable. You could call it foreshadowing. So right away you know this character might be trouble. Because eventually you find out that he is the weakest person of the crew, unknowingly to the rest of the characters.<br/><br/>The fact that the crew has no idea that what they are about to encounter makes this movie even more watchable. You feel how they feel confused and scared. Not knowing what is lurking in the bowels of the Event Horizon. It's like a being in a fugue state of mind, the flight or fright scenario. What would you do if you were seeing all these things that creep up to you from your bad past memories, contorting the them in front of you, and you know in your mind that maybe what you are seeing lifelike in front of your eyes, may or may not be true? Or is this unseen monster mocking your weaknesses? I would be frightened to these horrible visions. That's why I recommend this highly underrated film to everyone.<br/><br/>The reason being, you don't really ever get to see where the ship Event Horizon went, or what the old crew encountered. You never really get to see the monster, the only thing that is portrayed in this wonderfully written and directed film is our own inner demons. And I think even today in the year 2010 that this is the true formula of making a great film, it's the idea of the unknown, the mystery and suspense. In all great horror films you always like the characters, you sometimes find something even in the monster that you see in yourself. I think that it is very hard to write something like this and make you feel that through the filming process. This movie has the quality of being a classic. And I truly appreciate all the hard work that was put into this film through the great acting and excellent film direction. It's always a lot of fun to watch from time to time. And is part of my movie collection."

","I saw ""Event Horizon"" when it first came out in '97 and found it immensely disturbing! Repeat viewings have lessened the impact, but it's still Paul Anderson's finest film to date. The set design - all Gothic chambers and torturous spikes - is a work of art and the visual effects are excellent. Liquid suspended in zero gravity, a walking man on fire and the ship itself are all extremely well done.<br/><br/>This is indeed an underrated horror movie and bears much more of a likeness to ""The Shining"" than it does to ""Alien"". However, it most closely mirrors Michael Crichton's novel ""Sphere"" (1987), which was made into a woefully inadequate film with Dustin Hoffman, Sharon Stone and Samuel L Jackson. The idea of a spaceship discovered which affects the salvage team's psyche is the central premise - ""Sphere"" even has a reference to the term ""event horizon"".<br/><br/>This movie slightly falls over in two main areas. Firstly, the characters are not well enough explored (not even Weir, with memories of his deceased wife), although the crew banter riffs naturally on the crew dynamics in ""Alien"".<br/><br/>Secondly - and most importantly - the film loses its knife edge tension in the last third, due to an accelerated narrative and a descent into hell. Weir (Sam Neill) in particular becomes a clichéd figure and it's down to Laurence Fishburne (excellent) to maintain the credibility.<br/><br/>That said, the scares are well staged and Anderson uses split-second (almost subliminal) shots of body horror and torture, along with clever use of sound and music, to ratchet up the fear factor. The production design and cinematography is excellent - if you've not seen it, give it a go."

Why wasn't this movie better promoted? Over the years it's slowly been developing a well deserved cult following, as more and more people discover this underrated gem.

The film I immediately think of is 1979's ""The Black Hole,"" which also revolved around a group of space explorers discovering the derelict hulk of a long-lost space ship, but once our intrepid crew is on board the title craft the film turns into something akin to ""Hellraiser"" more than anything else.<br/><br/>Our story: it's 2047 and the mammoth space ship ""Event Horizon,"" which disappeared without a trace seven years earlier on a mission to the outer reaches of the Universe, has suddenly reappeared in an orbit around Neptune. A rescue crew is dispatched headed by Laurence Fishburne (whose Shakespearean voice can make even the most empty headed science-fiction techno-jargon dialogue sound deep and meaningful) and Sam Neill, the scientist who designed and built the Event Horizon. He's especially proud of its more-or-less-theoretical ""gravity drive,"" which supposedly can travel through dimensions via a ""gateway"" that had never been attempted before. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that traveling through this supposed ""gateway"" is going to be the core of the movie. Once on board the Event Horizon, they find no survivors, just a lot of blood splattered on the walls and an occasional frozen, mutilated corpse drifting past in zero-gravity. It quickly becomes obvious that something horrible happened to the Event Horizon when it left our universe, and as the crew explores the ship it also seems that the craft brought something back WITH them from that trip, which wants all of their souls. One by one the crewmen are plagued with visions of hellish torture, or of traumatic events from their own pasts, and several of them meet gory deaths until the survivors realize that they must get off this ship as quickly as possible, before the evil possessing it claims them all as victims.<br/><br/>The real star of the movie is the set designer (whoever he or she was; fantastic job!), the ""Event Horizon"" resembles a hellish cathedral of some sort (even before the evil sets in) that will make the viewer uncomfortable from the get-go. Of the human cast, Sam Neill gets to have the most fun, as he is eventually taken over by the horror of his creation and goes all Interstellar Jack Torrance on the innocent salvage crew.<br/><br/>Judging from the reviews on this site, ""Event Horizon"" is either a ""love it"" or ""hate it"" kind of film. You can count me as one who loved it, and I will definitely be watching it again in the future. Too bad director Paul Anderson has yet to live up to the promise he showed in this movie."

I am a harsh judge of science fiction and horror movies. I have a million criteria that make a movie great and this one meets them all. I am not into cheesy movie, artsy movies or movies that are overly intellectual. Give me a good story and believable plot, good acting, good sub-plots and climax, keep the story rolling and action moving, give me some mind melting concepts and I will generally give a movie two thumbs up. This movie satisfied my hunger for science fiction. I recommend it to you."

","The only reason I was interested in this movie is because my friend had mention that it was similar to one of my favorite games Dead Space. When I heard that, I had to immediately watch this movie. Oh boy ....<br/><br/>Let me start off by saying, this movie was not as scary as Dead Space. NOT EVEN CLOSE. The movie itself wasn't even scary period. I was disappointed to find out that there really wasn't some sort of life form on the ship like the necromorphs in Dead Space. It was all psychological type stuff the members that boarded Event Horizon experienced. And hey, lets not forget to add the funny black guy .... *sigh* <br/><br/>I am so mad at the lack of good sci-fi horror movies, especially deep space. Pandorum was trash and Splice ... I guess the sex scene made it laughable. Obviously Alien is the king, and how long can I live watching those? James Cameron needs to get back in there. I'm just going to pray and hope the Dead Space live action movie will make me poop my pants. I really want sci-fi horror to reign supreme. Save us!"
"Muldwych","6","0","1","13 June 2010"," Atmospheric Film Filled With Squandered Potential
","Part 'The Black Hole', part 'Sunlight', 'Event Horizon' meshes the epic sci-fi 'base under siege' by mad scientists and the forces of nature plot of both while failing to achieve the greatness of either, eschewing intelligence and depth for shallow, B-grade disposable fluff that entertains just enough for the audience not to feel too cheated and earns the studio a fast buck. Top-drawer actors and well-crafted flashy effects are used to gloss over a meaningless plot and a wasted opportunity, for 'Event Horizon' explores some intriguing concepts and has several elements of a decent film.<br/><br/>Since I first saw it on the big screen, one thing that had always stuck in my mind about 'Event Horizon' was that eerie atmosphere. Director Paul Anderson should certainly explore the horror genre, being adept at building a climate of tension and foreboding. This accentuates the story's central premise: that the ship 'Event Horizon' itself has somehow become affected by the forces it encountered in another dimension. Anderson does a good job of actualising these indelible phenomena on the big screen, keeping the characters and the viewer on edge: we know all hell is going to break loose, but not why or how. He is helped in this goal by the tried and tested talents of an experienced visual effects team that includes department supervisor Richard Yuricich, who earlier proved himself in such greats as '2001' and 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture'. The result earned 'Event Horizon' the description 'weird' when it first came out and the viewers' inability to qualify what they were seeing was one of the film's greatest strengths - no one was entirely sure how real the unexplained anomalies were, which the ending capitalizes upon.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, these efforts are severely undermined by a script that has no interest in exploring the incredible scientific concepts behind the conflict, rendering all the unanswered questions and 'Shining'-style sequences meaningless. It's rather like launching into an intelligent conversation with someone who suddenly decides things are getting too 'heavy' before retreating to the safer topic of whether or not Simon Cowell deserves a knighthood. This has the knock-on effect of ensuring that much of the characters' dialogue is as two-dimensional as their characterisation: if there's a scientist aboard, the chances of him still being sane by the closing credits are about as likely as any military characters present exploring the Kip Thorne ruminations on wormhole theory. The point is not to suggest that anyone should have lapsed into a Carl Sagan lecture on the nature of the universe - those who have sat through the works of Dan Brown will, if still awake, be all too familiar with storytellers more interested in being didactic than genuinely entertaining. Rather, it's the usual desire by the studios not to alienate the meat-heads in the audience with too much of this thing we call 'thinking'. This doubtless also explains the choice of music for the beginning and end credits, which hurriedly promises ""don't worry - there's gonna be shootin' 'n killin'"" - although Michael Kamen's incidental score is thankfully more in tune with his usual standard.<br/><br/>Still, Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill are no strangers to film work held together by more money than brains, the Matrix sequels and pointless 'Under The Mountain' remake being more recent examples. Both are capable of giving so much more, with Neill as usual the best-served out of a modest banquet. Once remembered for playing the son of Satan, this is a man who can convey a great deal without ever saying a word. His Dr Weir alter ego, however, needed far more development if we were to be sympathetic with his plight. Fishburne is never allowed to explore any facial expression other than serious concern, although this might have something to do with his polar opposite in the form of Cooper, as played by Richard T. Nelson, whom I really want to believe is not simply there to be the token 'Funny Black Man', but Cooper is really convincing in the role. Other luminaries worthy of mention include Katherine Quinlan and Jason Isaacs, but only because we've seen them act elsewhere, and Sean Pertwee follows his father into sci-fi for the first time to lesser acclaim, though he is hardly provided with much of a challenge.<br/><br/>Much of my annoyance at the lack of effort put into 'Event Horizon' stems from the fact that I am the right demographic for sci-fi/horror. It's frustrating to see a film that in some ways explores themes and story lines I enjoy, but stops short, terrified that it might actually become something truly decent. On the one hand, I could argue that later successes like Danny Boyle's 'Sunshine' raised the bar for the genre, leaving half-baked efforts such as this dancing the limbo beneath it with miles of clear headway up top. Yet precursors like 'The Black Hole' and 'Alien', which, while not necessarily exploring more intelligent story lines, were constructed with greater maturity by genuine film-makers like Ridley Scott, not interested in assembling a film with the help of a marketing team and interested in proper scripting over cheap thrills. Funnily enough, those are the films people still remember today.<br/><br/>As such, 'Event Horizon' bears up well in appearance, but falls short once you take a closer peek. It feels like a very emblematic Hollywood blockbuster, half-filled with genuinely-talented artistes, but driven by a studio anxiously matching their box-office winning formula with audience demographics. Closer inspection reveals that its high aims are in fact the shadow of a much shorter arm outstretched in front of the wall where the puppetry is being performed for short-term gain only. Do yourself a favour and dig up the classics or watch considered efforts like 'Sunlight' instead. If like me, you haven't seen 'Event Horizon' since its original release and its spooky atmosphere left you with fond memories, keep it that way."
"jzappa","7","0","1","30 May 2010"," Made of Whatever Materials at Hand
","Event Horizon is a bustling makeshift handiwork made secure by impressive production design and performances from actors who aren't easily embarrassed, but it begins with panache. It has the nuanced space vessels moving grandly against the domain of stars, it has the abysmal roar of the massive generators, it has sets boasting convincing technology, and it even has those high-pitched, jabbering, hardly discernible voice-like noises that remind us of Alien and 2001: A Space Odyssey, which give you the eerie sense that tiny creatures are plotting against you. The year is 2047. A rescue mission has been sent to Neptune's proximity, where seven years earlier the titular deep space research vessel vanished. As the rescue ship Lewis and Clark nears, its transmitters read that the temperature on board the other ship is freezing. No indication of human life is recognized. But there are signs of some other sort of life all through the ship. I love movies like this. I enjoy the dated fine points. Case in point: Everybody on board the rescue ship smokes, which is improbable in 2047 on a deep space mission where, later, the carbon dioxide air scrubbers will perform a vital function. And the captain, Laurence Fishburne, wears a leather bomber jacket, bespeaking that Neiman Marcus remains booming decades from now. I liked all of that stuff, though there wasn't much import to it.<br/><br/>What happened to the ship named Event Horizon? Scientist Sam Neill might know. He created the ship's gravity drive, which candidly resembles a minor variation on the Machine in Contact, with three metal rings gyrating around an axis. The drive supposedly conceives a black hole and then sucks the ship through it, so that it can travel astronomical reaches in a second. Neill gives the binding junior high lecture on this process, taking a piece of paper and showing you how far it is from one side to the other, and then folding it in half so that the two edges meet, describing how that occurs when space bends. The crew members nod, observing sternly. They're an exceptionally qualified space crew, on a mission where space and time are livelihood, although they seem to know less about quantum theory than most of us home entertainment couch potatoes do. It's back to Physics 101 for them. They're more like a mix of marine caricatures, as is the case with the zealous and scripted deliveries by Kathleen Quinlan and Joely Richardson, and even buddy cop foils, as is the unfortunate case for Richard T. Jones, playing a character cursed with so many horribly retarded lines that I hold the entire cast and crew responsible for not voicing the need for another rewrite: He's even carrying on like an Eddie Murphy bit when catapulted into space at one point.<br/><br/>So, anyway, where did the ship go for seven years, and what occurred while it was there? Why is the first team all dead? Alas, Event Horizon is not the movie to field these issues. It's all flair, pay-off and special effects. Each scene revises the fundamentals: Early in the film the Lewis and Clark nears the Event Horizon through what I think is the tempestuous gravitational field of Neptune, with endless thunder, lightning and commotion. However as soon as those effects are taken advantage of, the remainder of the movie takes place in the tranquility of space. And although we are regaled with quite pleasant shots of Neptune, the crew members never regard the planet in astonishment, or acknowledge the remarkable spectacle that would shift any Earthling's paradigm forever. They're always so preoccupied with their obligatory, often cheesy dialogue they're heedless of their environment.<br/><br/>The open-faced muse for this entertaining enough sleepwalking exercise in genre expediency, by the director of Mortal Kombat, is an incomparably superior but far less accessible film, Andrei Tarkovsky's Solaris, where a space station courses a colossal planet. The planet in that film is seemingly alive, and generates delusions in the minds of the space station inhabitants, making them believe they're back on Earth with their families. Same thing goes down in Event Horizon, where the crew members sublimate family members and colleagues they long for/cherish/blame themselves for the loss of, although where Tarkovsky was integrating the submerged psyche with the view of a planet as a single organism, Event Horizon exploits the figments and illusions of memory predominantly for jolts and cries of wolf, as well as distilling the antagonistic forces into a single supernatural villain stalking the ship like another Alien film.<br/><br/>It is declared bleakly at one point that the gravity drive is an example of humanity going too far, into reaches we should not dare. There is a charge that someone has ""broken the laws of physics,"" and from the way it's accused you'd think perpetrators will be put in jail or charged with damages. Naturally there are no ""laws"" of physics, simply conclusions about the way things appear to be. What you ""break,"" if you break anything, is no longer a law but just an outmoded view, now replaced by one that makes better sense. Soundly implanted in this movie is a mistrust of actual science. That's probably why its characters know so little about it."
"innocuous","5","0","1","12 May 2010"," Don't you hate to see good money wasted?
","Well, actually, I hate to see bad money wasted, too, but you get my point. A lot of effort went into this film and it should have turned out better than it did. The SFX aren't too bad, and the sets look nice, but the primitive CGI is kind of obvious. The ""weightless"" scenes are also pretty glaring. (Take the lead from the Alien quadrilogy...don't show weightlessness if you don't have to.) <br/><br/>Unfortunately, there were a lot ""clang"" moments in this movie. If a ship and its crew travel to a place of utter ""chaos,"" how could they come back in the condition that they did? I mean, chaos is, by definition, disorganization. It takes an awful lot of organization, the opposite of chaos, to accomplish what the ship (or the evil entity, or whatever) did. And what trained crew member, no matter how he feels, is going to think, ""Oh, that must be my kid, who I know is actually 47 million miles away, running down the corridor of my sealed spaceship""? It's just hard to identify with the characters.<br/><br/>Other than that, it's kind of OK. Anderson does a pretty poor job of editing and you end up confused about where you are at anytime, but I attribute this to his wanting to keep the viewer disoriented.<br/><br/>Worth viewing, but it falls short of its potential."

","Paul Anderson certainly wont be mistaken for a virtuoso filmmaker any time soon, particularly if his work on 'AVP', 'Mortal Kombat' and 'Resident Evil' is anything to go by, but for one brief moment in the late 90's, he was on the verge of creating a genuine psycho-horror masterpiece. And then Evil Paul took over again and ruined everything about twenty minutes from the finish line.<br/><br/>The plot is thus: In the year 2047(which suddenly doesn't seem quite as far away as it probably did in 1997), Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill lead a salvage operation into Neptune space to investigate the sudden re-appearance of the starship 'Event Horizon'. The ship had disappeared without a trace seven years prior during a complicated light-speed travel experiment, and it's the crew's job to rescue any survivors, salvage the ship and figure out what the hell went wrong.<br/><br/>Needless to say, the ship has been somewhere horrifying and has brought back something, well, let's just say it's not very nice. But it's also not what you'd expect - There's no acid dribbling alien killer here, in its place a tense, claustrophobic nightmare that truly defies description. In fact, it's that good that it reminds you of something Clive Barker or John Carpenter could have conceived.<br/><br/>So for the majority of its running time, 'Event Horizon' manages to be a genuinely frightening and surprisingly innovative sci-fi/horror show that is not only well written, but extremely well acted as well. The characters, the set-design, the extremely creepy central concept of an otherworldly hell dimension accessed through a black hole, are all excellent. And then suddenly Anderson loses the plot, and gurgles out possibly the silliest and most cringe-worthy finale since Denzel Washington impaled John Lithgow on the electric tower in 'Ricochet'.<br/><br/>If you don't want to know what happens, stop reading now. If you'd rather save yourself the torture of watching it, then Sam Neill suddenly tears his own eyes out and morphs into Pinhead from Hellraiser, the token comedic-relief-black-dude propels himself through space by dumping his oxygen tanks (yeah right) whilst delivering his best Eddie Murphy impression, and Morpheus (sorry, L. Fish) blows up the ship (much to the behest of Pinhead), looking as though even he realises how stupid this film has become and is glad to put an end to the madness.<br/><br/>Anderson could have had a classic on his hands here, but unfortunately his 'Resident Evil' side got the better of him in the latter stages of the film. That said, the rest of it has proved to be good enough to earn him a respected cult favourite, but one can only help but wonder what might have been if he had have exercised a little restraint in penning the finale. 7/10."

This film doesn't exactly use common sense in places and there are plot holes here and there.<br/><br/>But if you can ignore that, and just sit back and keep on track of the plot which is easy to do, it's a good film. Sh** scary in places, a good soundtrack, it's squeamish, some interesting angles, and plenty of suspense.

","In a nutshell, Event Horizon is an enjoyable rental in the suspense/horror genre.<br/><br/>There is a lot of gore in some scenes, but it is not, overall, a ""gorefest"".<br/><br/>Somehow, despite having great production values, some great actors, and a pace which is just right, the movie also tends not to be remembered. Perhaps it is because the characters are not as deep and developed as you might want. Perhaps it is because this is really three stories in one.<br/><br/>The first story, is what happened to the Event Horizon (a spaceship), several years ago.<br/><br/>The second story, is what will happen to the Event Horizon in the future. (I'm being vague so as to avoid any spoilers).<br/><br/>The third story, is what will happen to the crew sent on a rescue mission to find and recover the Event Horizon. This third story is the focus, told from the perspective of the rescue crew.<br/><br/>This movie might have been better if it told just one story, giving itself more time to develop the characters. That way, a prequel (or two) could fill in some more of the back story.<br/><br/>However, it seems like film makers are content to only make one movie nowadays. What's up with that? Don't they want money? <br/><br/>Anyhow, all three stories take a back seat to the suspense aspects. This is more of a suspense movie than a horror movie, but I think that the horror is what makes the suspense worthwhile, so that is why I call it a ""suspense/horror"". <br/><br/>The first time you watch it, you will be surprised, even if you think you see things coming.<br/><br/>I own a copy of this movie and will enjoy re-watching it later, already have watched it a few times, but, I have to say that with all the good movies out now (including older movies which are being re-released, etc.), this may be more of a rental than a must-buy movie.<br/><br/>As a rental movie, I rate it 9/10, grade A.<br/><br/>As a rental, the only thing that could have made it better, was more ""impact"": better dialog, faster pace with more ""action"", more focused character development, less time spent building up the story.<br/><br/>If you're looking to buy, I'd rate it only 6/10, grade B.<br/><br/>The quality of its parts are high but it just isn't remarkable enough. With a bit more effort, and perhaps making it a series of two or three movies instead of just one, it would have been much more impressive.<br/><br/>Overall, then, 7/10, or a B+ grade. Enjoyable as a rental, but make sure to screen it before you buy it."
"nicrok","8","0","2","25 November 2009"," Underrated sci-fi-horror that lacks consistency
","Event Horizon is an often disregarded, underrated sci-fi-horror flick that has its sweet and effective moments, yet lacks the depth to be a true masterpiece of the genre.<br/><br/>A rescue mission is sent out into deep space towards Neptune to investigate a distress signal that seems to come from a supposedly lost derelict space craft - the Event Horizon. The experimental ship, which was able to create black holes in order to circumvent time and space, had not returned from its first journey through time and space. Upon entering the ship, however, the crew of the rescue mission quickly learn that the Event Horizon had better not returned...<br/><br/>The first half of the movie is brilliant: we are enjoying very good effects (especially in space, and Neptune), nice acting (by Sam Neill and Laurence Fishburne especially), an engaging setting, and an interesting plot. Added with the few effective scares, all signs are pointing to an instant classic. What I personally found quite compelling was the design of the Event Horizon - the gravity core and all the other obscure dwellings that score with their enigmatic nature.<br/><br/>Yet as soon as things slip out of control on the Event Horizon, the movie turns into a B-movie style horror slasher with a lot of action and few scares. Many critics were especially concerned with this ambivalent second half of Event Horizon; personally, I found it hard to dislike it, because it was entertaining, given that the movie didn't itself too serious. However, I reckon they could've gone deeper into the whole hell-dimension issue, since I found that idea quite engaging.<br/><br/>All things considered, I had a great time watching Event Horizon, and am happy to own the DVD of this rare sci-fi classic. It is, I reckon, the overall mood and tone of the film that will get you."

","You know what I find most admirable about this film? It proves that Paul W.S. Anderson can create films that aren't mediocre (ALIEN VS. PREDATOR) or crap (MORTAL KOMBAT). I was never a fan of Anderson's films (though I admit DEATH RACE was some mindless fun) but this is the exception to the rule. In the film, a long-lost starship created for faster-than-light travel reappears mysteriously in orbit above Neptune. A rescue crew is dispatched with the ship's creator to recover any survivors and bring the ship home. Once they've arrived, they discover the crew is dead and the ship has returned from a dimension of unknown origins with a dark secret. The film is reminiscent of previous science fiction/horror such as ALIEN, with it's ominous feeling of danger in the isolation of deep space.<br/><br/>A good sci-fi/horror is one of my weaknesses. This film has a decent blend of intriguing back-story combined with gore effects that continue to look impressive more than ten years later. Even now, the effects in the film are enough to churn my stomach at points. As a nice change of pace, the film even boasts a decent story, as the crew members of the rescue shuttle fight to escape a ship that's determined to keep them. There are a couple of cheap scares but there is also plenty of intrigue as the Event Horizon's original destination becomes clear.<br/><br/>Sam Neill is wonderful as Dr. Weir, the original creator of the Event Horizon who feels himself drawn back to his brainchild inexplicably; Neill is a great actor in my opinion and it was interesting to see him in such a dark role. Laurence Fishburne is a powerful presence as Captain Miller, head of the rescue operation, and there are some strong supporting characters in the form of Joely Richardson and Jason Isaacs. In the end, though, my favorite character would have to be the Event Horizon herself and the evil presence it's taken on with it's return. I've got to give Anderson and his producers credit, as this is one of the best movies he's been attached to. If you're searching for an atmospheric, violent science fiction film, I'm happy to say Anderson's film may, for once, be something worth recommending."

","As the years roll by, EVENT HORIZON keeps looking better and better, much like the initially maligned BLADE RUNNER and JOHN CARPENTER'S THE THING. A rescue ship arrives near Jupiter to find a long-missing research vessel empty, the crew nowhere to be found. But is Event Horizon really empty? Turns out it's haunted, after going into another dimension and returning not quite right. The rescue crew gets picked off one by one by unseen forces. A great cast and terrific set design keep this baby moving along to its shocking conclusion. A variation on SOLARIS and every haunted ocean vessel movie, EVENT HORIZON is a Halloween-oriented masterpiece of scares and thrills. The second half flags a bit, but the first half is about as scary a cinematic ride as you're likely to take in this lifetime. Paul Anderson definitely came up with a winner here, and the movie was clearly ahead of its time when first released -- just like BLADE RUNNER and THE THING. The ending is open to interpretation, which actually works in its favor. This movie will grow on you with repeated viewings. In 1994, Sam Neil had starred in JOHN CARPENTER'S IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS, which makes an excellent companion piece to EVENT HORIZON. Both feature Lovecraftian ""lurking at the door"" themes."
"lukaszsw","7","0","1","23 July 2009"," It has something for everybody but nothing that would make it a great movie
","I enjoyed Event Horizon the first time I watched it. Now after some years I went back to it and it still holds although it aged badly. That doesn't make it a bad movie, in my opinion the age made it unintentionally funny and that what kept me watching.<br/><br/>The story follows pretty much the same story as the movie ""Ghostship"" (which is even more unintentionally silly) - there is a ship wreck in space, a team is sent to search & rescue and they all get slaughter. Much alike ""Ghostship"" there is a plot twist which is unexpected and makes no sense but sure is great to watch.<br/><br/>But what makes this movie bearable is pure comedy on screen. We start with Sam Neil as Dr Weir (thats a villain name alright) in a bathroom on a rescue ship. He has a large mirror and a bathtub (his room sure is spacious for a starship. Of course there is normal gravitation all around. You wouldn't guess how astronauts in 2047 shave - with a RAZOR. His attention is drawn by a dripping tap, the tap itself has no levers so I guess Neil thought to himself ""I should have went for a premium space-tub"". Also all this space plumbers must be lazy not to fix the tap before a mission. We then visit the bridge where everybody have roller chairs (what if the gravity generator malfunctioned?) and spit stupid one-liners like ""its all blinking on my screen"". The captain is Morpheus (played by Morpheus=) and he makes little more sense unless you count an odd leather jacket - is it the part of official uniform? The crew goes into some deep sleep chambers (like in alien but with water) and Doctor Weir wakes up first, everybody is sleeping and computer is silent. Don't you know that this is a nightmare already? This ends with a comedic ""AAAAAaaaaAAA"" by Sam Neil, wasn't he embarrassed by doing a scene like that? After they wake up they found out that they are near Neptun and complain (didn't they know where the ship was headed?). Also its up to Weir to explain to the crew how the government made a ship faster than light. Impossibly the crew is smart enough to tell this is impossible. This scene is priceless because again it hard not to pity Sam Neil to explain the unexplainable. He starts with saying how they managed to fold ""space time"", is it similar to time on Earth? Than 5 minutes before they reach the wreck Dr Weir(d) plays them the one transmission that they've got from it - the recording consist of loud screams and a mad voice saying ""save me"" in Latin. NOW, thats a good hint 5 MINUTES before boarding the vessel! wow =) The team goes to the ships, find it awfully quiet and than find stupid excuses to to wander off and get slaughtered. The big (no) secret is that the ship basically been to HELL and back. That very original. Whats unoriginal is why the ship finds some sneaky way to kill the characters instead of turning the life support off. The design of the capable-of-speed-of-light spaceship is questionable to say the lest. To get to engineering part you have to go trough a section that looks like a meat grinder and the engine itself looks like torture chamber fantasy. Seriously why a a engine would even need so many spikes? and sharp parts. I think the engine is powered on dangerous environment alone. The core is a liquid stable substance and the character exhibits whats seems to be a ""matrix syndrome"" to put the whole hand into unknown substance. What kind of engineer does that? I like the set-up but the rest of the film that follow is sub-par: we see a lot of gore (people with gouged eyes, parts of people falling from the ceiling, people crushed) and all the characters do nothing but invent stupid ways to get out of the ship. The plot twist is indeed unexpected (although not shocking) but at the same time gives no hints as why it happened.<br/><br/>Its a funny little flick that is more disgusting than scary but I don't think there is an abundance of this kind of horrors. Its recommendable but don't expect anything remotely serious and coherent. With a good spirit you can have a great time with it."

"Otoboke","Null","0","1","2 June 2009"," Akin to a 1950's exploitation genre movie with superb visual effects.
","Science-fiction and horror are genres that go way back to the very origins of film itself as a means of entertainment with very little in the way of ""art"". It is no surprise then that both have had their fair share of encounters in the past in an attempt by studios to bring the bucks of monsters and alien fans all in the one take. The sad reality of this however is that much of the time this usually results in a story that is tepid and ultimately see-through in its exploitative nature. In fact, up until Alien which came out in the late 1970's, the horror sci-fi flick was one plagued with dead-pan or over the top acting, formulaic plots and dialogue fit to be spoken only by pieces of furniture. The reasoning behind this is simple; to get the balance between such polarising genres fit enough to overcome the hard-sell nature of each, such a movie's script needs to be intricately developed and picked apart in order to nail that fine line between crass genre movie and entertaining crossover romp.<br/><br/>Event Horizon which seeks to tread down the path Ridley Scott paved two decades earlier is an example of new ideas meshing with old ones; Anderson's film is a whole lot less cerebral and frightening that either of the first two alien pictures, but it is nevertheless interesting in its own light. Most of the feature takes place on board a mysterious ship that has the capability of creating black holes in order to travel vast distances of space and time in a fraction of the standard rate. The problem however is that instead of taking the ship across the galaxy or even to the other side of the universe, the Event Horizon instead creates a link to another dimension—loosely described and referred to through as ""hell"". Of course, the term is entirely ambiguous (and thankfully so), but the connotations are not left hanging in the imagination. Event Horizon takes blood, guts, torture and pain to high levels here, fully getting across what awaits the crew at the other side of that portal, and such moments are usually what give the film its real source of vibrancy and zest.<br/><br/>What doesn't work quite as well however is the clashing of science-fiction (read: spaceships, technological babble and futuristic settings) and horror which too often seem far too overt and biased towards the horror side of things. To be fair, much of the feature's greatest moments come when we as viewers are subjected to moments of rapidly quick flashes of gore and horror, but there are certain scenes laced throughout that never quite work as well. Particularly irksome are the many cliché, ""what's that behind you"" moments quickly followed by a cheap explosion of sound punctuated by Michael Kamen's bombastic score (which, you know, would have been fine for another Die Hard movie, but just consistently feels out of place and detractive here). This, in tow with an ending as anti-climactic, predictable and utterly un-engaging as you could possibly imagine, ends up turning an otherwise decent and claustrophobic Alien wannabe into something akin to a 1950's exploitation genre movie with superb visual effects.<br/><br/>To screenwriter Philip Eisner's credit, there are numerous highlights inherent to Event Horizon's story (most notably being the characters who—although a tad derivative at times—nevertheless help flesh the movie out past its 2D plotting), but a distinct lack of conviction or subtlety to the overarching plot of the proceedings inevitably hurts the production as a whole. The result is a sporadically interesting and compelling feature with stretches of ten or so minutes at a time that are practically flawless—and yet the material that binds such moments together is weak and overly bland. If there is one thing that will taken from the experience however it is the memory of its horror and fantastic visuals (captured by Adrian Biddle, who unsurprisingly enough, did the same thing for Aliens in 1986) which consistently use the elaborate sets and visual effects to convey the ideas and themes of Eisner's script aptly. So it's not terrible by any means, but for anyone but the aficionados of the horror science-fiction movie, should still be taken with a grain of scepticism.<br/><br/><ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>"
"moviesleuth2","7","0","1","17 May 2009"," Mediocre first half, creepy second half
","""Event Horizon"" is still working itself out when it starts. It doesn't iron out all the kinks until the movie is half-over. The first half tries, but fails, to be creepy. However, once it finds its rhythm, ""Event Horizon"" is VERY creepy.<br/><br/>About 50 years into the future, a research vessel called the Event Horizon just disappears. No contact, no trace of what happened or where it went. Seven years later, it reappears, and a rescue crew is sent to investigate. Tagging along is the ship's creator, Dr. Weir (Sam Neill). Once they get there, strange things start happening...<br/><br/>The biggest problem with ""Event Horizon"" is that the first half just isn't creepy. Paul W. S. Anderson (not to be confused with Paul Thomas Anderson or the guy-who-shouldn't-be-making-films Wes Anderson) tries to create tension, but at first, the ""creepy"" goings on aren't, well, creepy. There's no sense of danger, and it's surprising that the actors (specifically Kathleen Quinlan in one scene) seem as spooked as they are. Therefore, the film has to rely on atmosphere to generate tension. While I'm not saying that the ""Event Horizon"" isn't a creepy place from the get-go (it is), it's just not creepy enough.<br/><br/>This shouldn't be construed to mean that the first hour of the film is boring. While it may not get the hairs on the back of your neck to stand up, it's always interesting. The ship is just begging to be explored, and the question of what happened to the ship (and its crew) is always one everyone's mind.<br/><br/>Acting is stronger here than it usually is for this kind of a movie. Laurence Fishburne has a commanding presence as the rescue ship's captain. This was a thinly written character, but Fishburne makes a character out of him. Sam Neill is wasted for the first half, but he becomes a lot better when he has something to do. Joely Richardson doesn't get to do much in terms of character, but she doesn't blow it. Jason Issacs, one of my favorite actors waiting for their big break, creates a dark, but amiable person as DJ. Richard T. Jones (who provides some comic relief), Jack Noseworthy and Sean Pertwee round out the cast with solid, if unmemorable, performances.<br/><br/>Director Paul W.S. Anderson has a lot of control over his material, but he makes some blunders as well. His sense of atmosphere needs fine tuning, but even in a movie like this, he has great control of his actors. He can't always create tension, but he always has the audience's interest. This is a solid offering from the man who would later bring us the Resident Evil movies.<br/><br/>The special effects vary as well. Granted, this movie was made over a decade ago, but even then some of them could have been better worked out. The explosions look nice, the gore doesn't look fake, and the big effects shots (like of the whole ship) are very real and meticulously detailed. However, the little things don't fare as well. For example, the objects that fly across the room in zero gravity are obviously computer generated, and the computers look as if they were made before ""Alien"" (in production time, not the setting).<br/><br/>I know I've been rather vague, and for that I apologize. But I'd still recommend ""Event Horizon."" It's not perfect, but it's not a very bad way to waste a good hour and a half."
"magnus-287","5","0","1","9 January 2009"," Doom meets alien
","I found the combination of space and all the references to hell/satanism a pretty weird combo. The setting is nice, and to be a sci-fi from 1997 the animations are totally acceptable. Once the ships start to malfunction, the lights being flicker and the blood starts flowing, you get that fuzzy 'doom' feeling :) This film has a lot in common with the movie Sunshine, which also is about a rescue mission in space where the crew is affected by some 'mysterious' psychological power. If you like movies like Sunshine or The Sphere, you will probably enjoy this too.<br/><br/>Oh, and as an old Prodigy fan, I liked that they used Smack my bitch up for the ending credits ;-)"
"simon647","6","0","2","25 November 2008"," It's scientifically inappropriate, which is why it's fiction and also horror.
","The reason why it's horror is because it has gore. The reason why it has science-fiction is because using a black hole as dimensional travel is about as delusional as say... Catapulting yourself down the Canyon and expecting the rocks to soften as you fall on them.<br/><br/>Event Horizon refers to the moment where you cross a black hole's edges. Where there is no chance of return whatsoever. So this movie seems to pretend that beyond the Event Horizon, there is another dimension. This is unproven but unlikely. Fiction comes in play at this point, whereas a scientist would have been able to build a mechanism which allows a ship to travel from one point in the other. In this place, the ""Event Horizon"" spaceship.<br/><br/>The spaceship is then used for extra-system travel, where it will discover regions beyond the milky way. Bold enterprise, as the ship and its crew discover only to be found years later. The scientist is sent aboard a rescue ship, whose crew consists of growling men and wise women. Well, the choice of crew is rather justified, because they are all astronauts that were looking to enjoy their little vacation back on earth. So they don't take kindly to the good ""Doctor""'s presence.<br/><br/>You'll imagine the Doctor's feeling rather ambitious about seeing his spaceship again. Of course, getting there, the doctor starts to get hallucinations of his dead wife, provided by the ship itself. What doesn't make much sense is that he gets these hallucinations BEFORE getting on the ship, while the other members of the crew don't get any until they arrive on-board.<br/><br/>Don't worry though, the movie offers a lot more plot holes like these. Does that make it a bad movie? No, the story's believable as long as you hold it to yourself to escape reality for a while. So what makes the movie not so enjoyable here? The acting. I'm not sure if all the actors forgot their faces at work, especially Mr.Fishburne, but they all seemed rather dead-eyed for the most part. Laurence Fishburne often yells without bearing any conviction to his words on his face or overall body. Same with some other characters, while a select few do show appropriate emotions. Unfortunately, we're treated to the stereo-typical black man-in-astronaut gangsta.<br/><br/>I mean is it really necessary for black people to always be imaged as the dumb types? Whatever, seeing as Sam Neil and Fishburne are often on-screen, you'd expect better prestations from them. None of it.<br/><br/>I personally disagree that this is a bad movie but it's certainly nothing to be awed at. The executions for the characters are all very poetic in a way, but they're so theatrical that it makes them less terrifying, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Kind of like watching a play and seeing the main protagonist be given a speech before being executed.<br/><br/>Do watch this movie, even for the sake of just having watched it once."

","Over the years, I've heard people talk about Event Horizon with some reverence. It seems to have a special cult following in the sci-fi/horror genre. However, I never rushed out to rent the flick, even after receiving some props from a couple of characters on Family Guy. Finally, I spotted it listed on an HD movie channel recently.<br/><br/>Firing up the DVR, I settled in for some average sci-fi gore. Setting the expectations low didn't help raise its rating for me. The film starts very promising. I'm a sucker for something with a premise like this one (ship lost for years returns; WTF happened). <br/><br/>Spoilers and stuff:<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the sense of dread just didn't build up for me. It started pretty well with the transmission from the ship and then just goes downhill. The visions didn't do anything for me and the big reveal was a let down.<br/><br/>In the end, the final confrontation became comic. I laughed at the dialogue (""What happened...to your eyes?"") and the sound effects sounded cartoonish. When the two guys were flying around the bridge, I was busting up. The last act ruined the movie for me.<br/><br/>By the way, this is hilarious. It highlights another unintentionally funny moment: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmzYR4IQ_kM"
"screenman","7","0","1","15 November 2008"," Vacuous But Scary
","It's a space rescue mission, with a mixed crew of cynical but competent astronauts led by the excellent Larry Fishburne. Sam Neill plays the covertly knowledgeable 'outsider' with a disproportionate say it what goes on. A signal has been received...<br/><br/>So far the plot is a very close parallel to 'Aliens'.<br/><br/>The signal has come from a space-probe that was officially 'lost' some years before. It's a frightening, garbled noise, once again like that of 'Alien'. Now the vessel has been relocated out amongst the gas giants planets on the edge of the solar system. Authorities need to find out what went wrong. It had several crew members.<br/><br/>The effects and set-pieces are extremely well realised. It is very atmospheric. The 'Aliens' like paranoia is etched with a Gothic horror texture that has a hint of 'Hammer' and 'Quatermass' about it.<br/><br/>This ship, it transpires, was more than just a probe. It was the first vessel to jump through hyperspace. Somehow, it's come back. And there's nobody home - or so it seems...<br/><br/>What follows are a series of set-piece dream-shocks that ratchet-up the tension fairly well. Slowly, the cynical crew become less cynical as they realise that the vessel is possessed. And not only the vessel; so is Sam Neill's character. It's a fairly predictable slaughter-by-turn with nasty fates for those earmarked.<br/><br/>The whole internal structure of the vessel has a menacing, Gothic completeness that is so unlike anything typical of human design as - once again - to resemble the spaceship in 'Alien'.<br/><br/>It would seem that this vessel passed through some kind of hell out there in hyperspace and is somehow tainted by association. During this time the crew went insane. On board Video-monitors have recorded their behaviour and it ain't pretty. The surviving rescuers need to escape.<br/><br/>There is a want of clear explanation between the evident 'evil' we are led to believe exists and its relationship with the 'scientific' universe. The two ideas merge well in effects but unravel at the rational level. I was left extremely disappointed by the denouement.<br/><br/>Also, the interior of the vessel is smeared with large splashes of gore that we must assume are the organic remains of the dead crew, and yet nobody even mentions them, does blood or DNA tests or anything. It's as if the mess is either perfectly normal or that only we can see it. Further, in the time that they inhabit the ship, with air replenished and heating on, this stuff would begin to putrefy and quickly stink-out the confined living space. But again; no-one apparently can smell it either.<br/><br/>Acting is fair to good, the script rather flaccid, but the effects and tension are first-rate. It just leaves the impression that they didn't quite know what to do with the idea. Perhaps Nigel Kneale should have been consulted.<br/><br/>The movie also reminded me of a short story by Cordwainer Smith called 'The Game Of Rat And Dragon', which might well have been its inspiration.<br/><br/>Good scares, inadequate resolution."
"ctomvelu-1","7","0","1","9 November 2008"," It will grow on you
","Like BLADE RUNNER and THE THING, EVENT HORIZON will grow on you with repeated viewings. It is impossible to absorb every little detail that occurs in this sci-fi horror classic based on a single viewing. Sam Neil and Larry Fishburne head out to take a look at a manned spacecraft that disappeared years before and has suddenly reappeared in space. Everyone on board is dead and the ship appears to be possessed (whichit is). The body count among the rescue crew quickly begins to mount. The movie is basically a haunted house in space, and it can be scary as hell. It also can get pretty silly, as it does in the second half when it borrows a little too liberally from HELLRAISER. Director Paul (RESIDENT EVIL) Anderson does a terrific job with the massive sets and eerie lighting and quirky characters, but the script ultimately fails him. Best bet: watch it once all the way through, then watch only the first half on second viewing. If you insist on watching the whole thing a second time, from the point at which medical technician Kathleen Qunilan meets her grisly fate, keep one eye closed for the rest of the film. But man oh man, that first half is a real humdinger."
"El_Rey_De_Movies","7","0","2","7 April 2008"," Don't go on this ship...
","This is not a sci-fi movie; it's a haunted house story wrapped in the outward trappings of science fiction. It's a direct movie descendant of ""Alien"" and ""The Haunting"". Sam Neill is, once again, excellent as the designer/builder of the Event Horizon, the greatest achievement of his career that he cannot enjoy because he's wracked by the guilty knowledge that all the time he spent on it cost him the love and life of his wife, Claire. The ship, equipped with some fancy dimension-warping black hole drive, has returned after having disappeared seven years before, God knows where. It's never quite clear, but it seems to be either a dimension of pure destructive chaos or even Hell itself. Each crew-member's hidden fears and guilt are preyed upon by whatever it is that now inhabits the ship. Yes, there is blood and gore (plenty of it!), but this movie gives us chills thru the astounding ship sets (it looks like something wrenched from a Gothic cathedral), clever use of light and darkness, and the feeling that there's something either behind you or right next to you, watching you all the time. It's creepy and disturbing, all the way to the end. One of my all-time favorites."

The only fluke with the film is with Justin, he would have ""decompressed/incenerated"" instantly, but I guess that wasn't in the script.

It works on the psychological level without too much gore in the final theater version.

I really don't understand why it is scary, there isn't too much gore but you really get the feeling that there is something with the characters, a sort of unearthly presence. That combined with the horrific visions, the gut-wrenching ships log and brilliant acting from Sam Niel create a world where every frame of film is infused with pure evil. This is a movie about exploring the unknown, going beyond the limits of what we understand; this is another possible reason for the movies impact which it has on you because there is so much mystery, you do not know where the event horizon has been and came back from and you do not know what befell the last crew members.

In todays world of crap-fest horror polluted with lame effects and cheap scares its good to see a truly disturbing movie come along to break the trend... The movie works because space itself is so eerie, no one can hear you scream. This means that like in most horror movies the characters are cut off from the rest of the world, but in this case we don't need a crappy excuse like ""the phones stopped working"" or whatever to do it, plain and simple, we're far out in space, natural isolation... The graphic parts of this movie, particularly the recording recovered of the previous crew left a lasting mark on me for weeks, its very twisted... Another thing that made this movie was Sam Neill, he was so creepy, a man so obsessed with his ship that he essentially becomes one with it, and the darkness it brings back.

"Scarecrow-88","8","0","3","11 March 2007"," Event Horizon
","The crew of the Lewis and Clark, a search and rescue vessel, are told to seek out the science space ship, Event Horizon, which has been missing for seven years. Event Horizon was spotted near Neptune and this is where they find the ship. Led by Captain Miller(Laurence Fishburne)the crew are to find out what happened to the crew on board and bring any information which might explain why such a ship could remain missing for so long. Once on board, however, the crew realizes that this ship has been to an uncharted dimension..a kind of evil that has taken over the ship and, in time, the crew. The former scientists on the previous mission, thanks to the creative genius of Dr. William Weir(Sam Neill), were on a mission to guide the Event Horizon on a special experiment in the ""folding of space""..in other words, the ship would travel from one destination to another through a created black hole/gateway. What the crew did travel to, and died from, is for the Lewis and Clark to find out. But, what occurred to that crew(a horror that is recorded on a disc)seven years ago is starting to effect the crew of Lois and Clark. It seems that the heart of Event Horizon, the core that operates the ship, opens on it's own releasing ""the dark"" some evil force that opens up the inner iniquity of those on board who harbor guilt regarding past mistakes. The evil attacks it's prey by tapping into their fear and exposing it through manipulation. Med Tech, Peters(Kathleen Quinlan)sees the diseased son for whom the job keeps her away from. Miller is plagued by the burning victim he had to leave behind on a mission to save his crew. Weir sees the wife who committed suicide. The ship seems to want Weir as it's tool for disrupting the crew's escape. The Lewis and Clark was badly damaged when the core opens pulling crewman Justin(Jack Noseworthy)inside and then spitting him out. A ripple effect/surge from within the core causes major damage. With limited air supply on the Event Horizon, they must repair hull damage or die. But, the evil on board Event Horizon doesn't want them to leave anyway.<br/><br/>In theory, most believe the Event Horizon ""visited"" Hell during the folding of space. Fooling with such things as creating a black hole is risky even if you wish to travel faster from destination to another. We do know that Justin mentions after being thrown out of where ever it was he was taken, that ""the dark"" is coming. The dark could mean anything. What appears on the disc shows the former crew having a violent sex orgy, killing each other. You know from this that the evil that permeates on Event Horizon can change individuals into something quite deviant. The film can be really scary and graphic which is right up my alley. One of the great examples of what you can do with the blending of science fiction and horror. This film has incredible set-design and visual effects..the best money can buy. But, without that fascinating and disturbing plot, this would be just another rehash. The cast is fun to watch and the terror is genuine. A winner for Paul WS Anderson, if you ask me."

","A doctor who designed the ship and a crew of rescuers are sent to pick up the crew from the space vessel Event Horizon, off the orbit of Neptune. What the rescuers don't know, however, is that the ship is powered by a black hole and is capable of opening portals to other planets or maybe even dimensions. What might have come through?<br/><br/>It seems appropriate I chose to watch this after ""Snow White"", the OTHER 1997 Sam Neill horror film (but he's more like the Neill from ""In the Mouth of Madness"" here than the Neill from ""Snow White""). Never a bad time to catch two connected movies back to back.<br/><br/>I can't help but compare this film to other Paul Anderson films such as ""Resident Evil"" or ""Mortal Kombat"". There is a distinct look he is good at with technology and particularly the costumes. While I doubt Anderson designed the costumes, you get a sense he likes characters with jumpsuits. If I had to guess who directed this film without knowing, Anderson would be my first guess based on his scenery alone.<br/><br/>Paul Anderson also loves the techno-industrial music in his films (Orbital, The Prodigy, KMFDM) -- he's like a more lighthearted David Fincher in this way. I grew up on industrial music, so this really works for me. But also, I see metal or more specifically industrial crucial to good horror -- to really make the point, see Charlie Clouser's contributions to ""Saw II"". The whole violence and alienation vibe that is given off by industrial is very appropriate to horror.<br/><br/>The film in general is very likable. Sam Neill is an amazing actor, Laurence Fishbourne (after being Cowboy Curtis but before being Morpheus) is wonderful. And there's a sense of gore that is more hinted at than shown (most of the gore scenes are very quick, leaving an impression on your mind for you to create your own imagery). Many horror space movies are just really stupid (do I need to mention ""Leprechaun in Space""?) or follow the same paths, but this one really stands out as unique. It needed both the horror and space aspects to work.<br/><br/>I could compare this to ""Doom"" (the game or the movie) with the portal to Hell in space... but I won't. Or how about comparing it to ""Solaris"" (George Clooney's only bad film) with the images of dead friends coming back to life? This is vastly superior, by far. Really, I can't stress enough how awful ""Solaris"" is. <br/><br/>The inclusion of the tesseract is really great. I don't think they used the word ""tesseract"", but they used the idea. I grew up with ""A Wrinkle in Time"" and another book about tesseracts (or, more precisely, wormholes since ""tesseract"" just illustrates extra dimensions and not so much how to travel through them) and this always gets me pumped. If such things are really possible, the future will be awesome.<br/><br/>Well, anyway, if you're looking for a horror film that's unlike all others you've seen -- but good -- this is a wise choice. Sam Neill cannot steer you wrong, and the elements needed for a good movie are in place here. It's not like the ""Citizen Kane"" of horror, but maybe the ""Jurassic Park"" of horror. Check it out."

","Not being the biggest fan of horror-films I must admit that Event Horizon is an extremely competent production in spite of its unsightly gore. The characters and the concept of space travel, which is interestingly rather accurate, give the film a much needed grounding before the real horror elements start to kick in.<br/><br/>This movie can be considered a lot of things... 'Hellraiser in Space', 'The Shining in Space' but ultimately it borrows from so many sources that it's impossible to name any single source. In this pieced-together fashion the film works the same way casting actors of various types works well. Fisburne and Sam Neill are the dramatic heart of the film and Anderson's regular, Jason Isaacs, gives a typically strong performance.<br/><br/>However, the film does use plenty of conventional horror-film elements and some of these are rather distracting. The ending for instance may not necessarily lack closure, but it may not be the type of closure I was looking for.<br/><br/>All in all, however, a film worth seeing."

The movie is blatant, make-scary and in it's content just another B-C-grade sci-fi mumbo-jumbo flick.<br/><br/>See it if you... uh, want to waste a perfectly good hour and a half of your life? They could have made such a frightening movie in line with the subject, what with the hell-dimension and all that. Someone screwed up big time. I'm not even a mentionable consumer of horror and/or sci-fi movies and i don't have titanium for guts, i do get scared. But this? Oh man. What a letdown :( Nevertheless, we're all different and someone could find this movie very scary indeed, and has too. Acting was what acting is, acting.

I know I am stepping on peoples toes now, but if you see that connection, perhaps there is a reason why you are hanging around here writing reviews with your own point system DESPITE THE TEN GRADE SCALE AVAILABLE, instead of doing it as a profession. Basically you mean, that just because Alien happened to take place in space, all post-space science-fiction movies is a ripoff on that. Like saying that just because Apocalypse Now took place in Vietnam, all subsequent Vietnamn movies are meager plagiarism.<br/><br/>Well, Event Horizon is in its core, a movie in its way is very primitive; it focus on the lowest of our instincts, survival, and does it very well.

","As a general rule I hate horror films. I scare easily and have a run away imagination. However, I have forced myself to watch a few classics over the years Silence of the Lambs, Nightmare on Elm Street and Hell Raiser (regreted them all at the time, but glad I watched them in hindsight). The plot for Event Horizon appealed so I gave it a go. I wasn't disappointed. It's a great film and deserving of a much higher rating than it gets here. Sam Neil turns in an excellent performance as he descends into madness, taking you with him. In the version I saw, possibly cut, there is some gore, but like all great horror films it is your imagination that does a lot of the work."

It also poses interesting questions regarding theoretical physics, in as much as the theory behind the Event Horizon's revolutionary gravity drive is to defy the law of relativity and create an artificial black hole to bend space time and jump through the resultant hole to stars light years away.<br/><br/>The Event Horizon unlocks the gateway to another dimension, one in which all constraints on human behaviour are removed. The result , chaos and cruelty are the norm, hell is reality. the reality is as bad as you can imagine. After all, nothing that is in this movie did not originate from anywhere but the human mind.

","The irony being that Paul Anderson having done so many video game to movie translations (Resident Evil, Alien vs Predator) has probably delivered the best movie of Doom that will ever be made. And it isn't even Doom.<br/><br/>Doom is a classic video game about man using super technology to meddle with things best left alone. Portals are opened which spew satanic hordes creating an interesting mix of the technological and the arcane. The Doom movie out this summer looks to have dropped that bit entirely, instead relying on a run of the mill ""people infected by virus"" excuse for all the killing. The essence of that clash though is still here in the criminally underrated Event Horizon.<br/><br/>In Event Horizon a spaceship (of the same name) is finally found after having disappeared for several years. It seems it was conducting experiments in faster then light travel - using wormholes to travel huge distances instantly. However it may have traveled to a place no one us would dare to go. And brought back something with it...<br/><br/>Event Horizon is a creepy horror film that doesn't rely on a CGI monster revelation at the end to get it scares. The ship itself is shaped like a cross and is itself a Gothic labyrinth. I have to confess I didn't know much about this film until I watched it thinking it was a run of the mill sci fi movie. The tension builds slowly and effectively and it has a terrific ending. The mix of hellish imagery and futuristic sci fi is a fascinating clash for me personally which is why I found myself loving this film.<br/><br/>Paul Anderson gets a lot of stick, but don't let that put you off watching this. I've even liked Resident Evil (because I loved the videogames) and Alien vs Predator. So you can see I have a penchant for liking films which have been critically raped. Event Horizon hasn't been put through the grinder as much as the previous films but I feel it still gets unnecessary criticism, a lot of it needless ""I don't need to watch it! Its Paul Anderson!"" type stuff.<br/><br/>I still hate Soldier mind you."

","I haven't liked any of Andersen's other films but I like this. It's atmospheric and does well in balancing the claustrophobia and presence of the evil on the ship, on the one hand, with the infinity of space and the theme of absence on the other. I think any film that explores the theme of evil not of human agency has the possibility to be unsettling and terrifying. In most respects, this film works. The performances are mostly good although Sam Neill is a bit hammy and the Cooper character is something of a stereotype. As an aside, though, I was a little amused by the scene in which the crew listen to the recorded broadcast from the ship 'Event Horizon'. Sam Neill tells us that Nasa(?)'s finest scientists have been studying it for some time and ""have isolated what appears to be a human voice."" On the first listen, the crew's medic identifies that the voice is speaking Latin and on his second listen translates the majority of the message. Perhaps Weir's colleagues, when presented with the recording, decided 'let's not listen to it and say we did'."

The second time I saw it, I liked it even better. I finally bought the DVD and have watched it several more times and I love it. Maybe watching a movie more than once isn't for everyone. <br/><br/>I think that a lot of the negativity for this movie comes from the director Paul Anderson. A lot of people really hate this guy. After seeing Alien vs Predator some of this hatred is understandable, but I feel that EH was by far the best of his movies.<br/><br/>The cast of EH was very good. I thought that all of the actors did a good job with their characters. Maybe they could have done a little more development of the main characters, (ie Weir, and Miller) to tell us more about where they came from and their backgrounds. Jolie Richardson is hot too!! <br/><br/>I thought that the whole concept for the movie was great, a ship that travels to another dimension and comes back alive. I love it. Some of the ways the crew members are killed are pretty cool too. The visualizations of Hell and the original crews fates are awesome too. Lets face it, Hell is probably a very bad place!!!!<br/><br/>In summary, this is a great movie, although not to the caliber of Aliens.

","What can I say about this film? It is one of the most scary, beautiful and creative films in genre of sci-fi. The word ""scary"" cannot express its satanic atmosphere, actually. The idea of unexplainable evil from the beyond is not so original, but Anderson (director) managed to express this feeling of 4D chaos in audiovisual flesh of the film. The rare feeling. I think, that the only one film as thrilling as this is Kubrick's ""Shining"". Kubrick has very powerful acting in his film, but Anderson made the same feeling more based on cold atmosphere of outta space. This film always leaves me in very very dark mood. I also think ""Event Horizon"" is somewhat underrated film today, because people look at it like at ""another one predictable space thriller"". ""The Shining"" was also underestimated at the time it went out. But in some time it might become more watchable, because it has stuff that won't let it become unwatchable, like, say, first ""Alien"". In some time it will look like Hitchcock or Carpenter.

The term ""from hell"" or anything like that has gotten so increasingly cliché that it becomes stupid. Granted, all the quick flashes of the people being tortured are pretty freaky, but they're just flashes, and thus limit their level of freakiness.

The ship went missing seven years earlier as it was testing faster than light travel. It picked up a sphere of unknown origin and then at faster than light speed was lost in a black hole. The rescue ship LEWIS AND CLARK arrives seven years later. Some reviewers have callously described the ship LEWIS AND CLARK as a salvage ship. Calling a ship LEWIS AND CLARK seems to imply a schism of the mind because it is multiple named and foreshadows the madness among the spacefarers that is to come caused by the sphere. The interaction between Laurence Fishburne as Captain Miller and Sam Neill as Dr William Weir is OK but two great actors seem to be limited by the words in the script. It is revealed that both men must have gone into the sphere and a real fear of faster than light travel begins to manifest itself.

","I first saw Event Horizon on video cassette in the late 90s and I recently watched it again on DVD. You might find this movie in the sci-fi section of your video store, but it's really a horror story set in space.<br/><br/>Captain Miller and his crew are sent to investigate the mysterious reappearance of the Event Horizon, a spaceship that, a few years ago, disappeared near Neptune. That vessel was equipped with a special hyperspace drive that enabled it to travel faster than the speed of light by warping space and time. All of this is explained to the crew by Dr Weir, the inventor of this technology, who is now a member of Capt Miller's search party. Something went wrong with the Event Horizon, he says, causing the ship to vanish for seven years.<br/><br/>I really loved the early parts of this movie when the search party was exploring the haunted ship. The visuals of the interior of the Event Horizon are impressive. There are lots of shadowy rooms and decks connected by dim, echoing corridors. At the core of the ship there is a huge rotating ring-encircled sphere that is the source of the ship's power and it's effectively cyclopean and sinister-looking; all this made me wish I had watched this one on the big screen. Later on, one of the characters offers the conjecture that the ship may have become a living thing. This is the kind of stuff that has always excited my imagination. Sure enough, as the story moves along, genuinely creepy horrors of all kinds begin to manifest themselves.<br/><br/>The script contains a pot-pouri of ideas from other movies and it has plenty of flaws. Members of the crew are forced to confront ghosts and mind-manufactured frights that are reminiscent of Solaris or Galaxy of Terror. One of the characters morphs into something like one of the cenobytes from Hellraiser and starts making Pinhead-like proclamations. The captain orders his crew not to go near the suspicious core of the ship, and yet everyone seems to wander in its vicinity again and again. The last reel has some continuity errors of time and place: a couple times I was wondering how that guy could possibly end up at that place at that time. And after an interesting build-up, the story seemed to crumble; the frantic sequence of events at the end felt like a poorly contrived attempt to wrap the whole thing up. <br/><br/>Still, when the closing credits rolled, I found that overall I liked my experience of this film. I thought this movie did successfully create a kind of evil-from-the-void Lovecraftian feel, where the cold and vast depths of outer and inner space are full of incomprehensible horrors. There were a lot of unanswered questions and I wasn't able to figure out what the ship's motivation was, but I was okay with that. My theory about these stories is that they should operate on a more visceral level and too much explaining can get in the way and ruin the mood.<br/><br/>In recent years, there has been a trend in movies of this kind to self-consciously make fun of themselves - they maintain a kind of smirking ironic tone and include many one-liners in the script. I was glad that this one, for the most part, avoids this trend and instead tries to be relentlessly tense. In fact, sometimes characters in this movie speak some real silly lines in a grave and sober manner. The fact that Event Horizon takes itself seriously somehow makes it much more fun."

","The idea raised in this film is very disturbing, it definitely scared me, but some of the special effects towards the end, particularly the make up job on the doctor, and points of the plot let it down. It is a shame, because the central plot about how they find out about what happened to the original crew was genuinely chilling and well carried off. The captains story about the crew member he lost in a fire was a bit cheesy, and the doctors hallucination turned out to be quite dull really, she was really scary, I'd hoped she'd turn out to be something more disturbing than a wife who committed suicide. Those 2 things really let the plot down in my opinion, but I give it such a high rating because despite its flaws it's one of the scariest films I have seen in a long time, definitely not for the faint hearted."

","This movie was well written with a unique plot.  Though it's a sci-fi movie it can also be classified as a horror film.  Everything comes together really well at the end and as matter of fact it also leaves you in suspense. This is one of my favorite horror films of all time.  One of the elements that makes this movie so scary is the fact that the scientific concepts are possible although not likely.  I think Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill played their roles very well.  The horrific imagery was actually scary compared to those that are unrealistic and very cheesy.  If your in the mood for a good horror film that is stimulating I would strongly recommend this movie."
"litpics","10","0","2","18 April 2004"," Astounding
","To this day, I would and always will rate this film as the best horror flick of all time. Make that, scariest film of all time. Either way. When I'd first heard of Event Horizon, I was in sixth grade going on seventh. I liked Sam Neill's stuff ever since Jurassic Park, so I went for a ride in this movie, expecting he would be the brave hero.<br/><br/>Spoiler Alert<br/><br/>   I was mistaken. What I received was actually one of the best performances a villain can give. Sure, he was the scientist in the beginning, but ultimately went mad due to so many things around him. I could imagine no other person, to this day, that could fill Neill's shoes as Dr. Weir.<br/><br/>    I'll start with the movie itself. Terrifying, if you really try thinking about it. Not just sitting down to fall asleep to something, although I can't imagine why you'd choose this one. I love the way the story starts out, where you're in an already scary environment, space. Like no other horror, space is finally being used to great extents. Thus being the setting for what would become truly horrific. You start with a basic rescue operation, move to the site, and get trapped with these poor people. The thing that intrigued me the most was that these killings were based on a fear. <br/><br/>   Peters' fear of her sick child, Justin being afraid of being alone, Weir with his deceased wife, and Miller with his dead burning friend that he left behind. All of these heroes were pre-scarred, much like in real life, we carry around all this emotional, and sometimes physically draining, baggage. Event Horizon reflects that.<br/><br/>   It just so happens they are also on a ship that tore a hole in our universe', and led itself to Hell. I loved that concept, one of the unknown. We fathom the unknown as humans. A black hole especially. One must come to ask themselves what is out there, and what if we were to tamper with it.<br/><br/>   Next, I must say the acting is brilliant. Sam Neill stepping up to a different type of role, and slamming it out of the park. I was truly creeped out to see him tear his own eyes from his skull, then blow up the only chance of escape with pilot still inside, and finally to play surgeon on the ship's medic. Ironies, you'll note. It was Smith's, the pilot's, fear of getting out of there that caused him to blow up with the vessel. It was a medic's job that got himself killed. This was also the first time I had ever heard of Lawrence Fishburne. Great stuff, though. He accurately portrayed a broken man trying to help his entire crew out, even if it meant giving his own life just to save one of them. <br/><br/>   A final note on the direction. It took Paul Anderson a lot of courage to take on a project like this. Did you know that it was a book? A great book as well. His adaptations to almost impossible imagery were astounding. Let alone his instincts on casting. All in all, you can't get any better than Event Horizon. So, before you start criticizing its gore ethic, think about the story itself, Hell is involved. Make sure you've researched a film of this genre enough before complaining about certain inequities. Science fiction must be studied, not viewed upon a single time, then cast away.<br/><br/>10 out of 10"

","I think up to the point where Sam Neil's character (Dr. Weir) comes back that this was a pretty good film, that is untill i realized something. The gateway to a so-called ""Hell"", a corpse hanging by hooks and Dr. Weir's brand new demonic look, its Hellraiser in space! And plus this has already been done. I think that this story could have gone in so many different directions but in the end the writer basically got bored and used a better films plot. I suggest if you are thinking about watching this film get ""Hellraiser:Bloodlines"" instead, the plots better and its set in space too.

","Event Horizon stars Sam Niell, who starred in Jurassic Park and as the anti-christ in Omen 3. Here he plays a similar character, who plans to bring hell into the world via a spaceship which returns from the boundaries of Neptune with hell captive. <br/><br/>Initially a science fiction movie, this eventually turns into a futuristic horror which is uncannily similar to Hellraiser 4, in which Pinhead and his demons devour space crew. Event Horizon follows the same path with some horrific results but with a much better cast. You will notice some faces from Alien 3. Laurence Fishburne is wonderful as Captain Miller and keeps a level head through this nightmare in convincing fashion.<br/><br/>
Event Horizon has some great ideas, most of which taken from the film Alien. I was disappointed how the film looked to become an envigorating science fiction movie, then turned into a gory horror. It feels like they took the easy way out. The CGI effects are some of the best I've ever seen and the sequences where the crew first enter Event Horizon are exciting. Too bad the effects were used on claret and massacre in the last thirty minutes. It could have been so much more.<br/><br/>3/5"

","The opening-credits are crap, the heavy music is imho just a commercial choice from greedy producers. The minimalistic opening-style from Alien and Aliens are far more appropriate imho.<br/><br/>The first part of the movie is actually quite good. From a science point of view, I like the concept of worm-holes and time/large-distance travelling. I also like the title 'Event Horizon' anyway, tho it's just a black-hole-related term, I couldn't think of a better name for the ship. Even if you don't know what 'Event Horizon' means, it still looks and sound impressive in a way.<br/><br/>The explanation of Sam Neill about bending 3d space is good, it makes sense for people without knowledge about this stuff.<br/><br/>The Event Horizon itself is a great ship from a design point of view, it surely looks impressive. Sofar no complaints.<br/><br/>However, shortly after the crew enters the ship, the movie drops to a point where it looses it's realism and becomes over-the-top, bloody, gore and almost as if the writer was out of inspiration. The first part, where the watcher is introduced to the facts of worm-holes, and where the question what happened with the EH crew is the issue, is great. But the conclusion is a bit messy if you ask me, I was expecting a completely different conclusion.<br/><br/>I suggest that a writer takes this script, keeps the first part (well, except for that dream of Dr. Weir in the first minutes, in that space-station), and makes a completely new ending to it. The exterior of the EH should be kept as it is, but the intererrior should be different. Less SM'ish :)<br/><br/>I like Alien because -no matter if aliens excist- it feels all very realistic. There're no goofballs in the crew, and the Alien/Alien planet looks realistic to me, mainly thanks to H.R.Giger with his fairly realistic style of drawing.<br/><br/>The first part of EH had this same realism, tho I didn't like all characters, -some are just unrealistic if you ask me-, it wasn't entirely bad either. After the first part, the realism was gone for me.<br/><br/>Sam Neill as the good scientist is realistic, but Sam Neill as a scary freak somehow didn't do it for me.<br/><br/>I recommend watching Alien, Aliens and Alien 3."

","One of those films which deserves its placing through its initial effect on me.  Seldom have I been more shat up by a film.  Most of the big scares are false ones  hands on someone's shoulder etc  but it still had me on the edge of my seat, as the cliche has it.  It looks wonderful  check out not just the Event Horizon itself but also the zoom out from Sam Neill at the beginning, which just keeps going and going...  Maybe it does rip off Hellraiser, and maybe there are bits that don't make sense, but it does have a bloke on fire, Sean Pertwee (always a plus), a member of one of Britain's noblest acting dynasties being almost drowned in blood, and a truly horrible scene where one character goes out of an airlock.

","This is one of the very few movies that ever got to me for some reason or another, and I still can't place why... Maybe it's the creepy video they uncover that tells the fate of the last crew of the event horizon, or the atmosphere that this movie gives off. I usually don't scare easy, and have seen too many horror flicks for my own good, but to this day this one can still give me chills. I suppose it would take the right viewer, the one that doesn't like to be a dork and laugh their way through the whole movie regardless of what it is. <br/><br/>Anyway, the story and plot are quite minor, but what is served up here is great atmosphere and some good scares. Definitely good fare for any horror buff, and I've yet to have any of my friends turn it away after a viewing. I'd provide a description, but it's been done already.<br/><br/>Another plus to this movie is Sam Neill's excellent performance as Dr Wier. He's a totally creepy and whacked out guy, and once things get rolling, he really appears as if he's having a good time with his role as the whacked out doc. Jason Isaacs nails his role as TJ, and even good ol' Larry Fishbourne isn't half bad ( Compared to what he usually doe )<br/><br/>

The acting was very good, however, this film does somewhat convey a undertone of being thrown together as it progresses.  The most likely culprit is the director. Its almost like they did not want to make it predictable, to which they didn't, but in the process of doing so they let a good starting storyline fall flat.   I can't understand why some movie makers do not spend more time developing their storyline into a more palatable movie.  I guess they just cant see past the dollar signs!

However, two-thirds into the movie Event Horizon suddenly dives head-on into the bloodied waters of cut-n-slash horror - the only reason for that being the writers' inability to come up with a worthwile explanation of all the weird goings-on, I presume. It is still beyond me why it was necessary to turn a first-class sci-fi shocker into a rather bland and second-hand horror, a sort of (very inferior) Hellraiser In Space.

I don't really like Anderson's style.  Won't deny that.  He takes too many liberties from Craven and Carpenter in this film and tries to re-hash some of the feelings evoked from Scott's Alien, and Kubrick's The Shining.  Now I do realize that he didn't write this screenplay, so I can't lay total blame on him but when it actually comes to direction, the man does not have an original bone in his body.<br/><br/>Even Resident Evil ripped off other films like Cube, Omega Man, and Night of the Living Dead (though it was intended to borrow from Living Dead, I guess).  Either way, this guy can't come up with anything of his own.  At least the hack-jobber Kurt Wimmer can come up with some 'gun-fu' thing. It still sucks but I guess he can claim that as his own.

","I've been upset lately and this is what I've been telling my friends when they asked me if I had seen any good horror movies: ""No way...they kind of stopped doing those"". It's an affirmation filled with both irony and a small amount of despair. Today, though, is a day which should be marked in a calendar, for I have seen it! I have seen a movie that actually scared me big time...a film that did all that I had hoped Thirteen Ghosts would have done.<br/><br/>SPOILERS<br/><br/>No need to go in on the story...there's not really much of a story. I, myself, prefer to think of it as of a ""pretext"" for horror. A bunch of people are sent to Neptune to ""investigate"" a strange event which occurred, the reappearance of a space ship which had vanished seven years before. The strange reappearance of the ship isn't the only strange thing around. The crew receive a message which I initially thought to contain only the most terrible and to the bone shaking shouts I have ever heard. There was a short text there, among that shouting, which is quite stupidly still undeciphered at those moments(though they had received that message some time before)...oh well, that's not the only stupid thing, but they can most certainly be ignored. These few words get more on the way(hmmm) and from their initial meaning ""Save me"" they transform to ""Save yourself from hell""(that's what Latin can do to you)...but everybody goes on the ship which is the only one capable of traveling at speeds higher than the speed of light(""going around the theory of relativity"") Once on the ship one of the crew members will suffer an accident and the crew's ship will be damaged, these being elements which will prolong the stay on ""Event Horizon""...where our ""friends"" will start hearing strange things, will start seeing strange things and ,worse of all, will start living through them.<br/><br/>Some have said that the characters are practically inexistent...I can not agree. They are very shallow, some of them are ""inexistent"", but the main focus point is on the ship and the ""horror"" not on the characters. Still we learn some things about them...the ones least described are exactly the two survivors...strangely enough.<br/><br/>As I said, this film scared me...it shows disturbing images, of which some are really gruesome and which could have been omitted, but which make ""a hell"" out of ""Event Horizon"". Anderson actually achieved to scare you through more than just the ferocious images, but he also did it with the sound...a hard thing to achieve, which I haven't seen  accomplished recently. <br/><br/>There's not much else to say. For me, in general, horror movies do not have to present any deep message(though, if there's a smart ""head"" behind them, he can get more horror out of such things than out of images) but it has to scare. I am not pleased if I see a movie which tries to ""use"" the ""deep-message tactic"" and then presents a boring and rarely entertaining flick. When I want horror, I just want horror...most certainly, too much of ""image"" horror would make me feel fed up at one point, but considering that this is the first horror movie I've seen this decade(the first REAL one) I can't be unhappy. If you want to get scared...take this piece: 8/10"

","Before going on to much worse things (ie. RESIDENT EVIL), Paul W.S. Anderson (formerly just Paul Anderson, but he changed due to confusion with P.T. Anderson, director of MAGNOLIA, the British director made this, he second venture into Hollywood. After the dreadful MORTAL KOMBAT, Mr. Anderson took on a multi-million dollar sci-fi horror movie: this.<br/><br/>Scripted by reative unknown Philip Eisner, it's that same-old-story of a space-crew coming across an abandoned vessel, only to find that something is still there. . . Laurence Fishburne is an effective Captain Miller, backed up by a whole sack of cliches; Sean Pertwee's cocky pilot, Joely Richardson's sturn professional, Jack Noseworthy's wide-eyed rookie, and Sam Neill's mad scientist. The plot consists of Fishburne's crew teaming up with Neill to find his space-ship of the title, which went missing 4 years ago. When they enter it, all they find are hideously mutilated corpses and a lot of blood.. .plus a particulary disturbing ship's log, which would make Captain Picard turn positively green with disgust. We soon find out that the Event Horizon can open some gateway and travel through the universe, defying the laws of physics because. . .oh just see it and find out, but it's brought something from it's last travels. . .to Hell.<br/><br/>Turning from a rather rum episode of BLAKE'S 7, into a twisted space-slasher was an innotive move from Anderson, and although it doesn't live up to his expectations ('The Shining in Space' was his promise, but it's more like SCREAM among the stars). More like THE HAUNTING (the original not the crap Jan de Bont remake) than ALIEN, this replaces the creepy old house with a creepy old space-ship and it certainly works a treat. The acting is not bad (for a scu-fi movie, anyway), whilst the special-effects and the ever-increasing gore and prosthetics are very impressive. So it's rather sad that isn't actually that scary. There are a couple jumps and frights, but nothing very substantial.<br/><br/>This is a case of an idea being brilliant of paper, but not quite working in practice. Eisner's script is good, but there are too many plot-holes and not enough charactrisation. Despite it being buffed up by Andrew Kevin Walker (responsible for SE7EN and, er, 8MM), the horror scenes are gruesome, but none of them stay with you in the same way that the murders in SE7EN do. Although the Spanish Inquisition-style torture chambers are a nice touch.<br/><br/>Anderson handles the action reasonbly well, much better than in RESIDENT EVIL, but it is the actual Event Horizon, a labyrinth of steel corridors and large spikey-rooms, which steals the show.<br/><br/>EVENT HORIZON is the perfect movie for a Friday night in: pulp sci-fi with buckets (and quite literally, waves) of blood. In the first sitting it was creepy, but in repeated watching, it lacks the rewatchability of other horror movies which continue being frightening as many times as you see them (THE THING, HALLOWEEN).<br/><br/>Paul W.S. Anderson does a far better job on this, than on RESIDENT EVIL (which he scripted himself, so perhaps there lies the problem), and is his best film to date. Mind you, that's not much of an achievement as his other movies include SHOPPING and SOLDIER (shudder).<br/><br/>EVENT HORIZON has become something of a modern cult-clag movie, and it's fun to watch people being hacked and sliced to pieces, but like all of Anderson's films, they are fatally superficial. 3 out of 5"

Plot: In the year of 2040 the spacecraft ""Event Horizon"" dissappeared without a trace. Now in 2047 The U.S Aerospace Command is recieving a distress signal from the ship. It is decided that a search and rescue team leaded by Captain Miller (Laurence Fishburne)and the creator of ""Event Horizon"" Weir (Sam Neill) is sended up to investigate what happened...But when they are arriving they find something evil, so evil it can't be dscribed what i´n words....The only sure way to say it, are: Hell.....<br/><br/>
When I saw that the director of ""Mortal Combat"" should direct a science-fiction\horror film I was thinking: ""This can only go bad"". Then one day my big brother had rented it. I did not want to see it. But 1½ hour later when it was finished, he yelled at me: ""You've Got To See This One"" and so i did, as I already have said with lights off.<br/><br/>Good cast, good directing and a very intersting story. But I spotted some rip-offs from Hellraiser (1987) The Shining (1980) and Contact (1997), but who cares, this is scary anyway.

"FightingIrish","8","0","2","4 November 2002"," Event Horizon *** ½ (out of four)
","Event Horizon *** ½ 1997, 97 min., R (for strong violence and gore, language and some nudity)<br/><br/><br/><br/>By Andrew Kramer<br/><br/>Paul Anderson's Event Horizon is one of the best-made horror films I have seen in a long time. It ranks up there with films such as The Shining, Aliens and Halloween, and yet it feels somewhat lacking. That one aspect prevents it from becoming a true horror classic, but fortunately the mildly mediocre sections of the film are made up for by the film's rollercoaster ride of terror. Event Horizon is probably the most unpleasant, violent and depraved film I have ever viewed, only because it is unflinchingly truthful to the genre. Unlike many other horror films, which lower the fear factor by placing moral characters and happy endings within their screenplays, Event Horizon knows how to terrify an audience. It knows what will scare us and constantly place the characters within situations that will make the heart palpitate with dread. And the characters are not scoring below 75 on the I.Q. test, unlike other characters in recent horror films. They approach each situation like a normal person would approach it.<br/><br/>The story: In the year 2047, a massive space ship, known as the `Event Horizon', has just reappeared in the vicinity of Neptune after being lost for seven years. A salvage team is quickly sent out to investigate the return of the lost vessel on a research craft known as the Lewis and Clark. The team is constructed of (for the most part) engaging, but not widely known actors. They include the captain of the research team, Miller (Laurence Fishburne), Dr. Weir (Sam Neill), who built the Event Horizon, and many others including Joely Richardson, Kathleen Quinlan and Jason Isaacs. One of my favorites out of all the characters was Richard T. Jones, who played the smartass Cooper and did a fine job as a comic-relief (`So, would like something hot and black inside you?' which is only one of his best lines.) Most of the other characters all seem as if they have something to share, whether it is from their past or their way of thinking, but nothing than is truly incredible. Hands down, the best performance in the film is by Sam Neill, who goes effectively fanatical after the thrills start to increase in numbers. What they find on the ship, I will leave to you to discover, but let me tell you that you will be proved wrong at many points, and then chuckle at how efficiently a scene was composed.<br/><br/>
Consider, for example, (and I won't reveal anything to spoiling), the tunnel scene, where you are just about positive that there will be a sudden shock, but your not quite aware when it will pop up, then. BOOM! Almost ever other scary sequence in the film literally leaps off the screen at you, and you never expected it because you were too preoccupied with figuring out when and how the scare was going to manifest. The way terror is conveyed is absolutely riveting, but there is one characteristic in this film that stands alone, in sheer brilliance. And that is the Event Horizon. The actual ship design is incredible: it looks as if it's been constructed entirely out of pieces of monasteries and cathedrals. Not only are the models dazzling, but the structure of the Event Horizon itself actually depicts a true sense of foreboding and evil (If you don't believe me, take notice to the number inscribed on the airlock door where the Lewis and Clark docks with the Event Horizon). <br/><br/>There are, however, some gripes that I had with the film and the first and foremost was that I didn't feel I enjoyed it as much as I could have, due to the overall graphicness and somewhat loose plot. Now I have no real trouble with gore and splatter at all (however, if you do then this film is definitely not for you), but I admit that even though I enjoy horror, I am not a true diehard like others. This film is extremely disturbing: it is the kind of film that stays with one for a very long time, regardless of who you are. The insights that it has make it incredibly (and sometimes uncomfortably) aghast, such as themes dealing with hell and death. The violence is very bloody, but usually if you are not squeamish, than you should be able to handle it. The other major gripe is the plot, which seems not meandering, but a bit unoriginal at times. It occasionally feels like the director ran out of ideas of his own, and therefore had to steal some from other movies. But remember that these are only minor complaints.<br/><br/>
Event Horizon is an odd, shocking, thought-provoking film that ponders the deepest and darkest realms of the human soul, and proves that the world is not made up of heroes and villains. It is mostly a film to be celebrated for its intense terror, powerful direction and high production values. See it and enjoy it: you will not be let down."

Moreover, the overabundant use of the ""f"" word loses it's desired affect.

","What a mistake; this movie is one of those under-rated ones, which a huge part of movie-junkies don't like much because there's -as they say- too much violence, no strict logical plot and too much blood, strange thoughts and dark effects. All those: Please, give it second chance. I think, if you like Lynch's latest work, you will also find a way through this movie, far away from a simple shock feeling, or a ""Woaaah"" for the special effects. The fact, that the ""event horizon"" (not the vessel, the idea of its existence) is a border, no one got a clue or a shining, clear definition for yet, and maybe no one ever will got one, makes me discuss with my friends after watching the movie for a few hours. Sure, the actors aren't that great, and you will miss a deeper psychology as well as a great dialog. But: such kind of movie got all what it needs, and all of these things are much more present than in other sci-fi-movies 'round the '90s. A pleasure to watch, especially if you like science-fiction, beautiful vessels and a never-ending space. And: Science fiction never makes me feel fear before like in this movie. Not because of the blood, because of the non-definite, but existent border of our mind."

","This is definitely a scary movie. A perfect mix of horror and sci-fi. Good acting performances, superb special effects, even if the plot could have been developed a little bit more. There are a lot of influences too, starting from Solaris: the idea of an alien entity which is capable to materialize inner fears of men and their past is surely not new. But there's no poetry inside the spaceship 'Event Horizon', just violence, madness and death. If you're into horror and sci-fi this title is fully recommended."

","This is for those in the world not entirely analytical and without imagination! Those broadsheet readers who slag off films without any real understanding of how to enjoy a movie.<br/><br/>It is about a space ship that has a traveling technique that allows it to travel light years in a matter of nano-seconds. Along the way the ship ""Event Horizon"" whch has this new technology, goes missing only to be found nearly 20 years later on the other side of a distant planet, but where ahd it been in all that time. Needless to say, a crew is sent to find out where the ship had gone for all that time and save the ship if they can.<br/><br/>The crew (led by Laurence Fishburne) travel that distance with Sam Neill who was the creator of the engine. They of course board the vessel, find themselves unable to escape and start dying, one-by-one.<br/><br/>Even though the story and plot are formulaic at best there are very frightening moments with a cast outshining themselves, Sam Neill brilliant (especially if you watch this after seeing another brilliant film with him in The Dish)and unknowns abound outperforming other actors tipped for brilliance by reviewers (Ben Affleck for instance, poor in all the films I have seen him in).<br/><br/>The atmosphere, in a dark and small room oozes out of the wood work, the directing brilliant, the camera does not stay too long on any given object allowing boredom to ensue.<br/><br/>Overall, Marvellous film, probably fun to make, undeserved of all the slagging off by unimaginative reviewers.

This movie isn't a technological wonder, but you will p*** your pants watching it.<br/><br/>The movie sets itself in a spaceship that has been through hell and back.

","I made a mistake: I rented it before watching 'Alien' so I couldn't compare EH with Ridley Scott's masterpiece of Sci Fi horror. But anyway this is pretty good movie for Paul Anderson who's been giving us some crappy work for most of his life (except EH and RE). It's completely bloody and explicitly violent and it's not a bad thing: think of it as Tarantino in a spaceship. And it delivers an invisible type of horror without an alien monster, where the only real monster is what's inside the human head. I got really scared with unpredictable scenes and a terrific cast starting with Sam Neil. Somebody said (in his comments, complaining) that the EH ship looked like a torture chamber, well I believe that this was made on purpose, my friend, that's exactly one of the many ways the movie is supossed to treat the fear, with those creepy and spooky elements, equal to a new kind of terror.

"Gideon40","10","0","2","30 July 2002"," a great, chilling horror movie.
","Although this movie wasn't liked by many people, I found it to be fantastic and I wished it was longer. For anyone who is going to see this film, I suggest to keep an open mind and hopefully not be eating anything while watching it.<br/><br/>(Warning:Review is one big spoiler and is meant only for those who already seen the film)<br/><br/>Event Horizon is about a ship that is supposedly meant to be a research vessel that gets involved in an accident and explodes. Years later, it reappears and a rescue team is sent in, though the crew isn't briefed at all. Dr. Weir(Sam Neil) reveals that the event horizon is a ship made to test faster than light travel by bending space and therefore defying human laws. He also reveals it didn't explode, it just dissappeared into thin air and now its back. The rescue team is then given orders to salvage the ship and rescue survivors, but all they find are bits and pieces of the crew everywhere. Before the crew can pull out, though, their own ship is damaged in an accident and they are stranded with the ship, and the horror its brought back with it.<br/><br/>While this may sound like your typical sci fi thriller, I found it to be different as there were no aliens, there was no form of physical being that was the antagonist. What I found about the movie that interested me was that by bending space fabric, it therefore passed through a dimension not known to humanity. This would be called Hell. i think its good how the movie didn't at all show what Hell was like, but instead left the viewer to find out why it made the crew kill each other. Its because that by entering a new dimension, human scientific laws do not have to apply in it. This is the case in what the Event Horizon has infected itself with. The ship entered a dimension of pure chaos, where it was complete madness on the crew for as long as they were in it. Its actually quite disturbing when you think about it. A dimension where nothing we apply to science is there, a dimension which the video recording of the event horizon's crew describes perfectly. Having said that, it is possible that any scientific impossibilities with the ship would be excused by the fact that the Event Horizon became a vessel of Hell within the solar system. The grisly images of Hell are truly terrifying, as they clearly represent the more realistic image of Hell. Instead of a place where lava spews from the ground and fire rains from the skies, we are shown images of people going through what seems to be something worse than pain and death. And thats correct because thats what hell is all about, continuous, eternal suffering of the worst kind. But what exactly does hell look like? We shall never know, and nobody can imagine it. The film doesn't even go into showing us, and all the better because chances are, it is a place our minds and eyes are not ready for.<br/><br/>So, while many consider it a bad, typical horror flick, I consider it to be a creative masterpiece. I'm not contradicting anyone here, this is just my opinion and what i think of the film. I havn't seen a movie that really frightened me, or made me think about its plot's content for days. Event Horizon though, while it didn't shock me silly, left some very disturbing thoughts in my head and left me thinking about the implications in the story."

"Mark_Simmons","9","0","1","23 July 2002"," Atmospheric and disturbing. Probably a classic.
","Although 'Event Horizon' would certainly not rate as one of the all time great movies, it is, in my opinion, still a classic. You certainly won't forget watching it in a hurry, even if you want to.<br/><br/>This is a rather strange film that really doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. Sci-Fi movie? Classic horror? Blatant gore-fest? It's all of these. It doesn't manage to do justice to any of them individually. But together though, it does work.<br/><br/>The acting is reasonable to good, given the tacky script, although there are times when the actors look a little sheepish in delivering their lines. Laurence Fishburne, Sam Neill and Sean Pertwee are the most convincing though. The rest tend to look a bit confused on occasions, as if they don't really believe what they're saying.<br/><br/>Visually though, the film does deliver. This is definitely the sci-fi version of a haunted house. Miles from anywhere, cut off from civilisation, thunder and lightning, creepy gothic interiors... Some of the sets are truly unsettling. Especially the medical bay and the gravity drive engine room. Full marks must go to production design for these. I could watch this one with just the sound effects and no dialogue and still get something out of it.<br/><br/>Getting into the mood of the film though, it really does need some more flesh on its bones. As an idea, there is enormous potential to do something very special here. Unfortunately though, it never happens. An extra half an hour, and more depth to the speculation about where the Event Horizon had been, earlier on - maybe between the first Lewis and Clark crew members entering the 'EH' and the ship reacting to them - would've helped pace the story better. As it is, it does tend to head off at a rapid rate of knots towards its rather inevitable and slightly predictable conclusion far too early.<br/><br/>Overall, though? Well, spooky, unnerving, and downright disturbing on occasions, it's like watching a car crash in slow motion. You know what's going to happen and you really don't want to look, but you can't help it.<br/><br/>I can understand why some people didn't like it. There's a lot of schlock without the solid foundations that this sort of film needs to keep it from sliding in its own entrails. But it *is* memorable and it does get a definite reaction from viewers, whichever way they go. It may nod it's head to 'Hellraiser' on occasions. But where Hellraiser was just plain camp, Event Horizon really does scrape it's fingernails over the inside of your skull now and then.<br/><br/>A classic? Yes, I think so.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, I would say, 'watch it'. It's only an hour and a half of your time. And you never know... ...you might be strangely glad you did.<br/><br/>Oh, and I did have some rather weird dreams after watching it. Unusual that. I normally don't have a problem with horror in that way.<br/><br/>Hmmmmm...."

Koontz terrific Christopher Snow novels, the concept of science reaching too far and finding it's  inherent opposite at the other side (the theological 'hell') just screams to be fully realized on screen, and 'Event Horizon' almost got us there.... but then devolves into something akin to 'Freddy v. Jason In Space,' with the crew of the rescue ship Lewis and Clark being knocked off one by one in a ridiculously short time, and Sam Neill's Dr. William Weir going from slightly-obsessive scientist (and creator of the titular ship) to satanic pawn/ killer/ possessee, just blowing it in the end.<br/><br/>Good performances and a solid script in the first hour beg an interesting question- was the script this uneven originally, or were things ruined in the end by studio interference?  The fact that director Paul Anderson supposedly had to remove over 20 minutes of scenes deemed too violent for an 'R' rating in the US, it's quite possible.  The few violent images that remain (in twitchy, disjointed visuals culled from the 'Event Horizon's' log), while intense and violent, are also a fascinating tease of what could have been.<br/><br/>Anderson supposedly plans to release a 'Director's Cut' DVD at some point, and we can only hope he does so in the near future, as this film truly deserves a second chance to get it right."

","Ok, I have read everyones comments and some people don't give it the credit it deserves. Of course, it has played off of other movies, but most movies do. I was scared !@#$-less. I don't get scared very easy. I don't remember the last time I was actually terrified! Jack Noseworthy didn't exactly get a good part but he did a wonderful job as Mr. Justin. I Love Jack and this is one of his better movies. Sam Neill is also H-O-T! Everyone did a great job. People said it didn't make you care about the people. I didn't think so. Cooper was funny and the humor of the story, without him, to me, it might have been unbearable...he kept everything down to earth. Starke, again, didnt really have a place, so she falls. And SMith, he didnt want to be there and he was so scared, it made you want him to get away. And last but certainly not least, Sam Neill aka Dr Weir. Now, he was one you wanted die. He was normal at first and then his ship turned him into something non-human. Personally, this movie is my fav and I think it's sooooo great. ANd definitely scarey! I watch it anytime I can. It's crazy, especially when they flash ""hell"" in your face. I got it not knowing what it was...just on faith, and I wound up covering my eyes during the movie and saying to myself ""OMG, this is something else...I don't know if I can handle it"" I think Jack (Justin) should have had a better part but he says he loves the fact his character gets traumatized and everything that happens to him....so I give all the crew a 10 out of 10 for a great performance.

","""Event Horizon"" is a truly fascinating film, and an incredibly frightening one at that. The best (or the worst?) part of the movie is that it doesn't scare you in the something-suddenly-jumps-out-BOO-type-way like in ""Scream"" (although it does have plenty of that), but more in a mind-boggling terrifying sense.

","""Event Horizon"" scared the livin'...  well you know what I mean.  The taglines say ""Infinite Space, Infinite Terror"".  It doesn't say much, and it gives you the wrong impression of what you will see in this film.  After the poster and the trailers, I wrote this one off.  Then I caught it on HBO, so decided to check it out.  I suffered from insomnia after that.  IT'S THAT SCARY!!!  It's not the ship or the characters that caught my attention.  I thought the characterization was very poor (it's hard to tell or care about who's who).  But what scared me was the movie's ""monster"".  There really isn't one.  Instead, it has a demonic spirit from hell!  Many people say that this borrowed from ""Hellraiser"", but I think this was pulled off better.  It's a bomb in characterization, but it's a masterpiece of horror. I can't remember the last time I was this scared.  I mean, it really scared me!  Plus, the problem with ""Hellraiser"" is that they show you too much of the ""Hell"" stuff.  ""Event Horizon"" blasts its hell in our faces, as quick and as fierce as a strobe-light flash.  It's mean!  And at the end of the film, instead of a resolution, we don't quite get an ending.  Nor an implication of a sequel.  We get the idea that the demon was never really defeated, that the crew was never really saved.  And with that, the intense buildup of fear that is at it's peak at the climax of the film, never really leaves us!  We can't leave the fear thrown at us after the movie is finished. ""I told you she won't let me leave, she won't let anyone leave."" I honestly believe, that when the film is finished, that notorious line is true!"

","It's the year 2047 and the ""Event Horizon,"" a ship designed to bend the space time continuum, has been found after being lost for seven years. A rescue ship, the ""Lewis & Clark,"" helmed by Captain Joe Miller(Laurence Fishburne) and his elite crew and the lost ship's designer (Sam Neill). Their mission: find and salvage the state-of-the-art spacecraft. What they find is state-of-the-art interstellar terror. What they must salvage are their own lives, because someone or something is ready to ensnare them in a new dimension of unimaginable fear. This is a scary psychological thriller and one of the few Sci-Fi movies in the last 10 years to actually almost live up to its hopes. For those of you who think that ""Scream"" and other recent horror films are frightening, take my word for it, go see this movie and see what scary really is. Masterfully balancing sci-fi, horror and action, ""Event Horizon"" is a superbly made film that feels just like a thrilling amusement park ride. With as many jump scenes as a roller coaster has hills, this film elicits the same visceral response.The film also boasts a great cast with Neill delivering a fine, increasingly deranged role and Fishburne making up for his last action role in the ""OK"" film Fled here, he strongly commands the screen and proves to be a superb action figure. Although some plot elements are never fully explored such as what's behind the ""evil"" control, and what the deeper back stories are for the characters personal visions/encounters the mystery of these elements only adds to the film's overall uneasy atmosphere. While this is an extremely thrilling, scary film, it's also extremely bloody and hard to watch at some times but that only makes it a better horror film and the best scifi/horror mix for about ten to fifteen years."

","Event Horizon starts out with much promise: in 2040, a deep space research vessel, the Event Horizon, is sent out on its maiden voyage and was believed to be destroyed. However, in 2047, it returns and is found in a decaying orbit around Neptune. A search and rescue ship, the Lewis and Clark, is sent out to investigate the Event Horizon's mysterious return. On board the Lewis and Clark, as well as the rest of the crew, is Sam Neill, the scientist who designed the Event Horizon. He explains to the crew what the Event Horizon was designed to do: travel faster than light. When they finally board the Event Horizon, they find nothing but the body of one crew member, and what appears to be the partial remains of the other six. From there, the film goes slowly downhill.<br/><br/>If Anderson's only goal with this film is to make the audience jump out of their seats, then it's a masterpiece. However, there is very little suspense. It's a film where you're not wondering who dies next, but, rather, how that particular person will die. There is only one scene in the film that creates true suspense. It involves one of the crew being trapped in an airlock. To make matters worse, you don't really care about any of these people whose lives are in danger. The simplest of backgrounds are given to a few of the characters: Neill's dead wife; Quinlan's son. One thing they left out, though: before Neill cuts Pertwee open you can see a rather large scar on his chest. I wonder if an explanation was originally scripted.<br/><br/>Out of the two previously mentioned backgrounds comes the source for the film's most terrifying scenes: the scene in the green tunnel; Quinlan's son appearing in Medical. With the best scenes now described I can get on with the films main strength: terror. Very few films can give you such a feeling of dread. It's a very psychological film(not in plot, but in atmosphere) that's bound to disturb even the most desensitized of Horror fans. The images you see are only a part of it; the lesser part. The psychological aspect is much too intense for words. It must be experienced. Event Horizon doesn't just contain those feelings of dread and terror, it leaves them with you long after the credits have finished rolling.<br/><br/>The special effects are incredible. The model ships are so good that it's almost a shame to see them destroyed. The destruction of the Lewis and Clark is one of the most realistic and believable scenes in the film. The interior of the Event Horizon is also great. It's the most important contributor to the atmosphere. Actually, it's the only contributor. It allows Anderson to use all his tricks to make the audience jump in the setting they would work the best. This way he doesn't have to do quite as much work. That said, he's given his film a remarkable visual style.<br/><br/>After all of its faults I must say that I found it to be very entertaining. I would strongly recommend seeing this while it is still in the theaters, but beware: it doesn't leave much to the imagination. You get to see bits and pieces of what happened to the crew of the Event Horizon, in very brief, but graphic, images. Also, you get to see what happens to the crew of the Lewis and Clark in not so brief, but just as graphic, images."

","I am a huge Hellraiser fan, and I don't see all of the obvious similarities that everyone else thinks are so blatant.  I didn't think Aliens was anything special when I saw it, but that was a long time ago, so I can't say if Event Horizon ripped it off.  All I know is that this is, by far, one of the most fantastic horror films that I have ever seen.  I wasn't even going to watch it, thinking that it was another boring sci-fi flick, but my brother and my mom convinced me that I should, but left me thinking that it was sci-fi.  I was intrigued almost immediately, and realized that this was horror in the truest sense of the word.  Event Horizon may have some things in common with other movies, but what movie doesn't.  I think that it was a very original concept, and I loved it.  It has some fascinating and thought-provoking lines that just transfixed me.  And to the idiot who coughs about Scream, as if that wasn't the most worthless film ever made.  I gave it a one, but I wish I could have given it a -10.  Event Horizon is innovative and a great and fascinating movie.  It is on my top 5 for greatest horror films ever made (the others being Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Dellamorte Dellamore, Hellraiser, and A Nightmare On Elm Street)."

","""Event Horizon"" is a surprisingly intriguing and scary picture.  I found it creepy that a ship which disappeared seven years before suddenly reappears. That's an intriguing idea which unfortunately doesn't go to the peak it could've.  The movie slightly wastes its time being conventional that it doesn't go for the gold its premise provides.  I did like how we never learned what was on the ship.  The movie leaves that to our imaginations. The characters weren't all that interesting but they kept the plot moving.

It has huge plot holes and an annoying tendency to take the viewer right to the water but just not let you drink any, if you catch my drift. Referring to another reviewer's comments, yes the Event Horizon does look very foreboding and ugly - that my friend is the idea, it helps create atmosphere. The movie does deliver plenty of shocks, especially the 'Hell Scene' which is quite disturbing in all its glory. All in all its a fun ride, just not perfect by any means but it could have been a hell of alot worse, I just wish Paul Anderson had spent a little more time explaining or trying to explain where the Event Horizon had been and what exactly had happened on board, more depth would have been very welcome.

","Having read a few of the comments on this film, I feel obliged to post my own opinion.<br/><br/>It is my view that many of those who have claimed the film to be too bloody and gory did in fact not realize that it is primarily a horror film. Even though it possesses a sci-fi setting, this is but a mere catalyst to a genre which is finding it increasingly difficult to come up with original scripts. And on the mere basis of this, Event Horizon is ground-breaking.<br/><br/>The film succeeds beautifully in creating a tense, nerve wrecking atmosphere that runs from a rather run of the mill first few minutes reminiscent of the likes of Alien, to fully fledged horror and terror rarely seen since The Exorcist. The sheer genius of this film is the director's ability to cast some of the most repulsive and disturbing Hellish visions since Hellraiser and then hint at something even worse underlying in the return of the Event Horizon. Truly impressive. A film hasn't made me feel this since Clive Barker's masterpiece.<br/><br/>The cast was equally impressive. This is without a doubt Sam Neill's best performance since 'In the mouth of madness'. Every time I see this actor on screen, he just seems to get better. My hats off to him, he deserves a hand of applause if only for the 'eye gouge' scene.<br/><br/>Good special effects, a dense and terrifying script and intrigue, a competent and appealing cast, some superb editing... and let us not mention the excellent sound effects and soundtrack.<br/><br/>An excellent, spine-chilling film!"

Its actually the most disturbing and gory film i've ever saw; bloody, scary, thrilling and really horrible. But I wasnt very freaken out at all, I liked it, it entretained me. Some people of the theather went away to throw up but I didnt. In some moments i was reaally frightened!

","This movie has some genuinely creepy moments and great looking set pieces, but it eventually falls victim to the same problem as so many supernatural thrillers -- it doesn't play by any rules.  Are our heroes faced with a physical entity?  A non-corporeal one?  Maybe its all in their heads? Maybe the devil?  Do we even care?  The movie starts off nicely enough, but soon loses all structure and just degenerates into one weird sequence after another without much rhyme or reason.  Its too bad too, as it wasted some good atmosphere and a typically strong performance from Laurence Fishburne. 5/10."

","This is one of the best horror movies i've seen in a while, it's genuinely suspenseful and creepy, and isn't afraid of being gory when it needs to be. There aren't enough gore-fests anymore. It reminded me a lot of a spaceship version of Hellraiser, though not quite as good as that one. There's a lot of plot holes and silly stuff here, but none of that bothered me cause the movie was done well enough to suspend my disbelief. The only part that I couldn't buy into was the way the ship decompressed at the end: The air and everything else would've been sucked out a lot faster and more violently than it was. I really liked the style of the film, very gothic and reminded me a bit of Alien. Basically this is a good horror movie, not very intelligent for a sci-fi movie tho. It definitely works best and is most enjoyable as a horror film."

It does have strengths and weaknesses, and sometimes the cast get a little too Scooby Doo in their investigations. There are a few rather artificial devices used to advance the plot, which depends more on set-pieces than seamless storytelling. The film scores highly on imagery and environment. If you let it draw you in, it does create a pretty good atmosphere which in the early stages owes more to classical horror than cheap shocks. Particularly pleasing is the imaginative use of sound effects to enhance your sensory experience, rather than just as a vehicle for a bolt-on soundtrack.<br/><br/>Good, but not great.

","I really wanted to like this dog, I really tried to find SOMETHING redeeming about it. No film should make its viewer work so hard.<br/><br/>The topic of time/space travel, of bending space to travel through time, were great in the trailer to get me to go and rent this video.<br/><br/>The revolving magnetic thingy reminded me of the contraption they built in Contact (which is a splendid film, one for the ages in my opinion); the space orb that gets into your head reminded me of Sphere.<br/><br/>However, this...this, ""film"" (and I use the term loosely here) was just bad. I like Lawrence Fishburn, I like Kathleen Quinlan, and Sam Neil, but, sheeesh, this film was just bad.<br/><br/>I shouldn't even bother to warn of SPOILERS because I'd honestly recommend never wasting your time with this film, but incase you do have a need to see for yourself, skip this next paragraph, and then come back to it after you've watched.<br/><br/>I just wonder WHY? Why would any parallel universe be so black and white ""evil"", and why would it want to torture people? And, if it was really out looking for people to torture, why not just use ""itself"" to travel to earth and pick up humans to its heart's content?<br/><br/>I've seen some bad movies in my day (Mimic, Deep Blue Sea, etc) but this one was just painful.<br/><br/>I don't hold this against any of the actors, either. Every once in a while a bad script is taken up with hope by an actor looking to bring something to the screen. But, man, as a sci-fi, it had no feel of authenticity, no reasonable situations (Dr. Weir says ""hey, that's not a load-bearing structure"" and macho driver says<br/><br/>""it is now"" -- I mean, REALLY, if you've travelled ""3 billion miles"" and care about your life, would you ignore the specialist who's sent to guide you, and risk scuttling the whole mission?

","This one is not as bad as the rating here suggests. I was drawn into the atmosphere right from the beginning and immediately bonded with the characters. The increase of tension as the crew approaches and then enters the ship is very well paced. The way how hints that something very strange is going on become more frequent and less subtle kept me on the edge of the couch.<br/><br/>As the nightmare unfolds there are some truly scary scenes to be savoured. There is a very personal component to this nightmare for every character, which adds depth and originality to many of the jump / gore scenes. This also creates interesting situations when the characters try to communicate their experiences to each other. It's all in your head, right?<br/><br/>The whole thing becomes a little inane and over the top towards the end, but if you like this genre just the slightest bit you probably won't mind too much.<br/><br/>There is a load of great special effects in this film (I especially liked the zero-g stuff), gorgeous set pieces and all kinds of neat little high-tech props. This combined with some Hellraiser style splatter and gore - a truly enjoyable experience!<br/><br/>If you can get over the flaws that this film without doubt has (read other comments to find out what they are) my recommendation is: lights out, volume up and enjoy the ride!<br/><br/>Rated 7/10"

","You shouldn't go in expecting classical sci-fi when you go into this movie. It really is a horror movie, set on a misbehaving, damaged spaceship orbiting the planet Neptune. The thing is, space really is pretty damn scary; this movie portrays that really well. <br/><br/>I must confess that this movie didn't begin promisingly--basically, it makes you think it will be a standard B sci-fi flick with cookie-cutter characters, a few not-terribly-original tech ideas, and all the rest that comes with that genre. I watched this alone late at night, scoffed a bit, but then...<br/><br/>A certain scene made me think ""whoa, that's pretty freaky"" ... ""and that too!"" I was starting to feel strange watching this B-grade Sci-Fi movie. And then it hit me: I was actually scared. I can't quite explain it, but there it was: for the first time since I can remember, I was frightened by a movie. <br/><br/>For maximum effect, I suggest you duplicate these conditions: watch this movie alone (not a good ""girlfriend"" movie), late at night, turn off all lights and blast the sound. If you have neighbors, use good headphones. Be charitable with your suspension of disbelief. In this case it actually pays off.<br/><br/>This movie is underrated here because I think it advertises itself in a misleading way. Make no mistake: it's a horror movie, and a pretty good one. If everyone who rated it would have followed my instructions above, I'm sure its ratings would have hovered around the 8. Well, maybe 7.5.

"flickaddict","Null","0","1","27 July 2001"," Started a bit lame, but proved worth watching & buying !
","GREAT film, it scared the hell out of me !<br/><br/>The plot seemed a bit lame at first : ship disappears in a black hole, comes back again and shows weird results on life-form scan.....Boring and predictable, was my first thought. And me NOT being a Sam Neill-fan didn't help either. But don't let the simple storyline put you off. As I was watching it, and the ship begins to play with the minds of the crewmembers, it started to scare the hell (even if that's just a word.......I LOVED that line !) out of me. OK, it had some major ""scientific"" crap in it, and some bad acting too (Sam Neill, the black guy that gets blasted into space but -unfortunately- gets back to the ship). And the ending wasn't very good either. But I'm a major fan of Jason Isaacs and Sean Pertwee, so watching them made up for the other stuff. I think Laurence Fishburne was good too, as usual. But I liked DJ the best, because you don't really get to know his character and he does some unpredictable things.<br/><br/>SPOILERS !!! I also saw some things that seemed to predict the way in which some of the crewmembers died. Before Smithy finds the bomb, you see a tag with his name on it dripping with blood. And just before DJ is sliced open by Weir, you can see a huge scar running across his chest. Is this something I was suppose to see, or just my imagination running wild because of the film ? I don't know, but it made the movie even more scary for me.<br/><br/>
And the gore...well, it was only terrible if I watched it in slo-mo (which I did, it IS quite sick). It flashes by so fast most of the time that it only leaves a very uneasy feeling, but no actual memories of what you actually saw in those flashes. I think it at least was 'gore with a purpose', not just put in to scare everyone. It showed a bit of the 'dark' beyond the black hole. They were in fact the only images you get from the 'enemy'. Great that there wasn't some alien being ! A fake or very UNscary alien is enough to ruin a film like this. The ship just made the crew kill itself....Great film, even bought it on tape !<br/><br/>Great and very unsettling film, despite some bad acting and a very simple storyline. I give it a 9 out of 10 !"

","This is simply an excellent movie.  I first saw it on a press show in the cinema, two weeks before anyone else in the country, and was scared to walk outside at 10.30 in the morning.  The DTS also helped.  Then I got the Laserdisc from America, again with Dolby Digital, and cannot change my opinion that this is one of the coolest movies made in 1997.  The acting was great, nods going to Sam Neill, Kathleen Quinlan, Jason Isaacs and Especially Sean Pertwee, the direction was pacy and smart, and the design of the film - from the FX to the sound - was exemplary.  The music was cool, especially the Orbital scetions, and even though the plot is somewhat routine, the way the film was done was fantastic.  It could have been another stupid alien intelligence flick - see Sphere - but instead chose to not really explain itself and be all the more frightning.  Like Billy Loomis said - ""It's much scarier when there's no motive"".<br/><br/>Classy film, all round.  Oh, and to Jim and Isobel of Mutley Plain, back in Plymouth, who trashed my review in Scene magazine, I was right and you were wrong about this film, I certainly don't owe you £8.60, and expect to see these same words on a cinema screen in a few years when my first film comes out.

I feel like the filmmakers and the studios think that the audience is dumber than a bag of hammers.  They figure that since our feeble brains can hardly add fractions, we don't understand anything complex.  So, they trade in an interesting story for a stupid action movie.  True, I'm not an experienced physicist, but I'd like science better than exploitation.  Seen it!  Who knows, by making more complicated films, we might be bemused by this plucky motion picture industry.

Event Horizon was put together well and my only complaint is that the people who created the film should have elaborated more on what specifically happened to the ship. It does touch on the topic but it is generally left up to the viewers opinions on whether the ship was haunted or alive. All in all I would have to give it a nine on sheer fear content alone.

Which I don't!! Anyway, the ship that he designed for the testing of his new invention, the Event Horizon, disappears without a trace, several years later it's back - but where has it been? <br/><br/>To answer this question and see if there are any survivors, a search team is sent that includes Laurence Fishburne as Captain Miller and Sean Pertwee as the modestly-named Smith(!) as well as Dr. Weir - because he knows his ship best. Needless to say, all is not well aboard the Horizon (it's a horror film for heavens sakes!) and bizarro events begin to occur.<br/><br/>This film is best described as 'A Ghost House in Outer Space' (Hey, thats a pretty good title!

There are however some cheesy acting moments that give the film that B-Movie feel (""This is not just something that's in our heads.""), but they are not bad enough to distract from the pure chill factor, chills in the sense that they will be travelling up your spine, oh yes, and there isn't a thing you can do about it.

","This is without doubt the most horrifying movie-going experience of my whole life!<br/><br/>(If you haven't seen it, and don't want to know anything about it, please stop reading)<br/><br/>Event Horizon starts off as a really spooky sci-fi thriller, but rapidly turns into the horror lane as the minutes pass by. There are some intensely powerful visuals in this movie, the Core is an unforgettable example of this. Actually, the whole ship is gracefully designed, and some gothic references in it only help to intensify the mood in the film.<br/><br/>
The star cast does a brilliant job as well, with one of the best actors in the world, Sam Neill, at the helm. He proves it once again that he is THE BEST horror actor in the world today. (Just check out In The Mouth Of Madness and Snow White if you don't believe me:) He is maybe TOO convincing at some times... Laurence Fishburne is extremely cool as the captain of the rescue ship that encounters the Event Horizon. These two horrifyingly good actors are supported with some very good backup team. Joely Richardson, Sean Pertwee, Richard T. Jones, Kathleen Quinlan, Jason Isaacs and Jack Noseworthy all do their parts oversatisfyingly well!<br/><br/>The story is simple, but it doesn't mean it's not good. Event Horizon is a good demonstration of how you can do an extremely, terrifyingly good movie out of a fairly simple story.<br/><br/>There are many scenes in this movie I will never forget, such as all the Core scenes, the scene with Dr. Weir inside the panel-tunnel-room(?) and many others.<br/><br/>If you want to have a good, relaxing time in front of the telly with your mom and dad, DON'T see this movie!!! If you're looking for THE horror film to watch in your home-cinema DVD system on a dark and stormy night, this is the one.<br/><br/>P.S.

","On paper, this movie sounds really good.  Set in the future, a ship with the ability to fold time and space for rapid travel mysteriously vanishes, only to reappear several years later.  A crew is sent across the solar system to board the vessel and investigate, in the hopes of finding an explanation for the ship's disappearance. After a sufficient introduction to the characters and a couple of interesting sequences offering clues to the fate of the Event Horizon, what ensues is complete entertainment deterioration.  There's nothing wrong with the acting in the movie, but they don't have much to work with after the ""terror has manifested itself"".  The director goes for the ""gross is good"" parlay and ruins what could have been an effectively chilling pic. <br/><br/>Perhaps if the actions of the ""dark side"" in this show were delivered a bit more subtly, and if the dialogue and plot turns weren't so dang sophomoric in the latter half, I probably would have been trumpeting this film to all I know."

","*CONTAINS A FEW MINOR SPOILERS*<br/><br/>From my perspective Event Horizon is a film that brims with promise but never quite makes it. The initial premise of a Science Fiction/Horror crossover is a good one and the movie seems to attempt to become a version of 'The Shining' or 'Hellraiser' set in outer space with a spaceship substituting for the box or the Overlook Hotel.<br/><br/> The contrast between the clean, clinical lines of the space station in the initial sequences and the neo-gothic interior of the Event Horizon is impressive and one of the opening shots showing the exterior of the space station from orbit is superb. Also there are a few pieces of religious imagery thrown in (even down to the cruciform spaceship), perhaps to hint at what is coming later.<br/><br/>In spite of the fine effects and some good individual sequences the film never seems to quite fulfil its potential. Many of the horror scenes employ some of the oldest tricks in the book in their attempts to make the viewer jump - knowledgable horror movie fans will be able to spot the shocks coming a mile off! <br/><br/>One day someone might remake this and fully explore the possibilities that the storyline of this film offers.

","Event Horizon is a great movie, and a masterful combination of science fiction and horror.  This movie has it all, great special effects, excellent actors, fantastic set design, good story line.  When I heard about this movie I knew the movie makers tried to basically create a ""haunted space ship.""  So I had my doubts.  But when I saw the movie I was very impressed. They definitely succeeded!  The Event Horizon is scary, but very convincing as an actual space vehicle.  I liked the originality of this film.  A lot of people were turned off by the premise of a genuine horror movie.  I think people went to the movie expecting to see some kind of alien incarnation, and when they didn't see that, they felt short changed.  But to me, this is a strong point.  The whole idea of a blood thirsty alien stowing away onboard a space ship and eating the crew one by one, has been done a million times.  So I really felt like this movie successfully broke new ground.  Its very original and very scary.  <br/><br/>However there were some bad points in the movie, too.  The part where the character of Justin floats out in to space was not very realistic.  He actually exits the air lock without a space suit on, and is exposed to the icy vacuum of space...but he survives!  Impossible.  Scientifically speaking, his lungs would have been instantly collapsed and the nitrogen in his blood would fizz up, like a can of soda that has been shaken too much and suddenly opened.  The next part of the movie that is really weak is the part where Cooper gets blown out in to space and then ""surfs"" back to the Event Horizon by blowing his air tanks.  If you have seen John Carpenter's ""DARK STAR"" this part will remind you of the end of ""DARK STAR"" when the astronaught surfs in to the planet's atmosphere.<br/><br/>Other than those two weak points, EVENT HORIZON is a very good movie.  A scare fest full of originality and some refreshingly gory scenes.  If you are a fan of science fiction movies, you need to see this movie. The ships are great, the set design is fascinating, the ideas about space travel are new and even thought provoking, the scares keep you on the edge of your seat, and its really spooky.<br/><br/>By the way, does anybody else see the similarities between Lawrence Fishburn's role in this movie and his role in THE MATRIX?"

And rarely have I seen something such as this.. Event Horizon is addictive, intense, creepy and gloomy. Sam Neill is great, even if he is over-acting like some people have commented. Definitely NOT a film for the faint of heart, but not too gory in my book either."

","I liked this movie a lot, because every time i see it, i get really scared.. and i like movies like ""scream"", ""i know what you did last summer"".. they are funny, but i never get scared with those movies, they are all the same: a psycho killer who kill teenagers in typical situations and in the end they have to kill him two or tree times until he´s dead. Anyway, ""event horizon"" is really scary, it´s about one real thing, the infinite space, and the possibility that this thing exist isn´t very improbable... well.. is a little grouchy (but this kind of ""travel"" can physically exist), but if you put yourself in this situation ,it´s really scaring and the most frighten thing are your own fears (as this movie shows) and as the tagline says.. infinite space really means infinite terror. And this movie is well done, and you can really get in the movie and believe those things. I recommend this movie to everyone. I rated it with an 8, because the special effects are not very good."

","After his less-than-impressive (but appropriately cheesy) directorial debut Mortal Kombat, Paul Anderson tried his hand at making a 'serious' movie with Event Horizon, and the result is surprisingly decent.  The title refers to a top-secret deep-space experimental vessel that inexplicably went missing, only to reappear - just as inexplicably - seven years later.  So a rescue crew, led by Lawrence Fishburne, is sent to investigate, but needless to say, the get far more than they gambled for.<br/><br/>For the first half, the film does a good job of building up a creepy atmosphere.  In particular, the idea of where the ship has been, and what it has brought back with it, overflows with arresting potential.  Unfortunately for Anderson, however, this potential is never realised, despite some impressive CGI and nifty camera work.  For the second half of the film, he just relies on excessive gore to scare his audience, and therein lies the film's main weakness:  what started off by building up genuine psychological dread just turns nasty and unpleasant - not to mention unconvincing - at the end.  And when Sam Neill's scientist starts running amok among the mayhem committing assorted atrocities, the film completely loses its plot.  The performances are merely passable, with the afforementioned Neill ending up being positively ludicrous. That said, however, Anderson does manage to conjure up some truly intense moments, and there are some inventive special effects that help make the whole thing (just about) worth sitting through.   <br/><br/>Not perfect, then, nor particularly original, but as horror hokum goes, pretty reasonable.<br/><br/>6/10"

","I could follow suit and summarise the plot once again - which, seemingly contrary to the beliefs of most who have seen it, does indeed exist - but it would be pointless. My main feeling on what makes Event Horizon a film of true quality is not only the excellent storyline, highly credible acting and superb special effects, but the impression it leaves on the brain for hours after viewing. If you truly understand what is going on, the film grips you in a vice lock for 90 minutes and, if the environment (i.e. a dark room, late at night!) is right, provides you with genuine shocks and thrills other quite-unquote 'horror movies' such as Scream can't manage. Certainly, there are some very unsettling moments - the subliminal flashes are pretty sickening - but they aren't just thrown at you for the sake of audience reaction, they contribute to the haunting image the film leaves you with, and believe me it does. This is surely displayed in the way that the gore involved in characters' deaths is mainly left to the imagination, that of DJ for example was all the more disturbing for me because of the focus on his facial expression and the sound he makes. The only real blood and guts is flashed up because of brief illumination or a second-long blast of images, which adds to the tremendous intensity. Of course it also has the old-fashioned make-you-jump moments which will seem all the more nerve-wracking if you were as absorbed as I was. And to cap it all, a film with an emotive soundtrack opening with a pounding Orbital track and leaving you with one final shock seconds before Funky S**t by the Prodigy kicks in has to be good.<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>Now I want that Special Edition on R2 DVD."

The big word for Event Horizon is claustrophobic. Right from the beginning when Sam Neill finds himself trapped in the bacta chamber to the horribly cramped and torture chamber style scenes on board the ship, everything is enclosed and it is this that makes this one of the scariest films ever. The whole idea of the crew trying to escape but not being able to is extremely disturbing and alongside the brilliant characterisations within the film help to create a very eerie mood."

It's not necessarily a bad film, it's not necessarily a good film either. Besides a really poor marketing campaign, the movie is very dark. It's weaknesses rely on it's ability to scare people. It uses really loud sounds where loud sounds don't need to be used like the opening of a door was kind of lame. I'd have to say for gore factor, this by far, is one of the grossest films I've ever seen. I remember reading a review that said it seemed all the characters were tossed in a meat grinder. I couldn't agree more because the gore factor is seriously high. There's one stand out scene that I won't have to explain if you've already seen it.

","Warning -- this review has a few SPOILERS . . .<br/><br/>What makes this a bad movie is its assumption that no one will be interested in exactly what it is that happened in the ""black hole"" (or wherever it went -- that was not entirely clear).  I hate to agree with Leonard Maltin, but he's right -- it starts out kind of interesting, but then disintegrates as most Hollywood movies do toward the end as more and more studio execs and market-research people come to influence the plot.  Gotta have a big fight at the end between the hero and the villain.  At least the hero was allowed to sacrifice himself (probably because Laurence Fishburn realized they were going want to do a sequel and wanted nothing to do with it.  Smart boy). And heaven forbid that we bother explaining anything, audiences will swallow whatever we feed them if it's gory enough.  And plot holes, schmlot holes -- wouldn't _you_ stick your hand in a shimmering vertical pool of what looks like mercury in the middle of what is essentially a nuclear power plant?! Sure, that's believable . . . because everyone in horror/sci-fi movies automatically lose about 50 IQ points or something.<br/><br/>It would be one thing if the ""infinite terror"" in the movie was never shown, or didn't acquire a face -- then you could get away without explaining anything.  But once Dr. Weir (Neill) becomes the bogey man, we need to know why it was him and not someone else, for example.  There's no particular reason why the ship picked him, except that he designed it.<br/><br/>""Somebody to listen to"" asks in another comment if the crew on the escape pod died -- no, I assumed they all live happily ever after . . . until the sequel.  BIG SPOILER -- why else have Weir's face show up, except to tell the audience that -- surprise (!) -- Evil's not dead yet.  Well, of course -- they escaped in the front part of the ship (not an escape pod).  The _entire ship_ was supposedly alive, not just the engine room with the black hole drive.

That is where this movies' bad rap comes from (see the movie trailer for an example).<br/><br/>While the idea is not original there are some genuinely scary moments in this film.  I can not recall seeing a space movie, including Alien, which has exploited the claustrophobia of space so well.  The horror of having a monster lose on a space ship should be a scary experience; hence this movie is no longer Sci-Fi but horror.  <br/><br/>As the movie progresses the crew gets more frantic.  It is a great effect but it may have lost a few viewers.  Judging from the reviews, many people fault this point in the movie.  It is a matter of taste.  I don't mind jerky cameras and rapid changes to give a feel of franticness. <br/><br/>

"Anonymous_Maxine","8","0","2","28 August 2000"," An excellent science fiction film that suffered badly during the transition from the big screen to video.
","When I saw Event Horizon in the theater I was terrified, and I loved it! However, when I first saw it in video, the larger than life quality that it once had was largely lost, and problems with the plot and the acting began to come through. I didn't notice (or care) before I saw it on video that there was no effort to describe what ""the dark"" was or where the ship had gone during the years it had been missing (the main goal of the expedition) or where Dr. William Weir (Sam Neill) wanted to take it at the end.<br/><br/>
Jack Noseworthy, who I particularly liked in Breakdown, delivered a terrible performance, and Lawrence Fishburne was also pretty bad, but I have never really been a fan of his. There were also horrible discrepancies in the plot. What, for example, made the film's writers think that the audience would believe that a human being can float around in Neptune's atmosphere for a few seconds wearing nothing but a pair of pajamas and still survive. In ANY condition. I have found myself defending this movie to a lot of people, but there is no excuse in the world for that scene.<br/><br/>
Despite all of the numerous problems that are present in Event Horizon, I still maintain that it is an entertaining science fiction movie and it provides several good thrills. However, in order to do it as much justice as possible, if you watch it on video, turn the volume up really really loud, turn off all of the lights, and the bigger the screen, the better."

The acting and the dialogue is actually really good.  Despite the fairly limited character development, the performances managed to convince me that the rescue crew had been together for some time.  Great cast too; Sam Neill is still in his IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS mode and appears to be having a ball.  The film also contains some of the most unpleasantly realistic scenes around (slow decompression anyone?) It's no world beater by any means, or in any genre, and it all gets a bit silly just prior to the climax.  But it's classy, darkly comical and shocks with aplomb.

","Ok forget all bad comments about this movie. It's the most intelligent horror movie ever! It's maybe even the best science fiction movie ever too. Forget Alien and all the copies of it, they are no match for Event Horizon. This film doesn't need monsters or aliens. The cast is small but amazing and from all over the english speaking world, and they are all perfect for their part. If you look close you will also see that the special effects are much better than in all other sci-fi movies. The ships actually feel real and it looks like real metal not some computer creations.<br/><br/>After seeing Event films like Alien seem ridiculous and not the other way around. It might be a mix of other movies but it is better than them. A lot of people didn't understand the storyline or what this film is about (like in ""Fight Club"" for example), if you do though you can watch the finest sci-fi film ever.<br/><br/>Let's call it a Generation-X movie. You are in another age? Forget it you mabye would not like it.<br/><br/>The cast has short dialogues which are played perfect, and it is shot very interestingly. The music is second to none.<br/><br/>The beginning of the film is one of the best ever (music, titles), and its also no typical hollywood movie since it is directed by a european. Some wrote that it becomes painful at the end, and heck yes it is that frightening :-) It is that good!<br/><br/>This film rocks!"

"toecutter-2","Null","0","1","8 March 2000"," Intriguing premise, poor execution
","This movie epitomizes all that has gone wrong with a gore-crazed Hollywood. An interesting premise, where the concept of Hell and Evil have to be completely re-evaluated and re-analyzed for their depth of horrors leads the viewer's imagination to really open up to terrifying possibilities, and to expect a well made movie exploring this concept. However in the latter half, the plot just collapses and resorts to cheap and ridiculous gore as a scare, found more frequently in movies of the Wes Craven calibre. When will Hollywood realize that true horror is something you imagine and not actually see? Perhaps they worry that they would lose the mainstream audience if they didn't throw in some standard horror film blood and guts? A complete disappointment, considering Sam Neill's otherwise illustrious career. I would give it an 8 for the first half and about 2 for the second. Perhaps this movie should have been released with a PG13 rating and spared us all the anticipation and the eventual anti-climax!"

","Great plot line, that gets lost on most viewers.  The premise of the movie is that the ship creates a hole in space and connects to another dimension. Not exactly new fare here for sci-fi.  The original idea though was lost on most people and in the end on the writers as well.  What the ship entered was a chaos dimension... not hell, although it sure seems like that to the average horror movie viewer.  In the end this movie depended too much on the use of gore, typical horror movie activity, and too little intellectualism to get its point across.  Should have kept with the Chaos dimension theory."

"contronatura","7","0","2","23 February 2000"," Terrifying and bloody film that loses its way
","Event Horizon is a film that I think has been unfairly bashed, though it does have some bad moments. Basically it takes elements of films like Solaris and novels like Rendezvous with Rama and uses them in a pulpy, B-movie horror film kinda way. This isn't necessarily good, since the film ultimately cops out on its initial instincts. After a very creey first half that promises so much, the film doesn't ever really deliver. The problem with this film, as with many horror films, is that the film loses its power once the unknown terrifying presence manifests itself. Upt to that point Event Horizon is suitably powerful as a horror film. And even after it flies off the rails and starts to resolve its situation in typical fashion, it's entertaining. This gets a 7/10 from me - for horror fans this is one to check out. It's not at the level of Solaris, but it stands well on its own."

A rescue and recovery ship commanded by Lawrence Fishburne and carrying scientist Sam Neil races to the rescue.  But WHAT will they rescue?<br/><br/>WARNING:  SPOILERS AHEAD.<br/><br/>EVENT HORIZON is an experimental ship on on TOP SECRET mission. It carries a Graviton Drive, capable of creating its own ""black hole,"" enabling travel between Neptune and Proxima Centauri (4.7 light-years) in ""about a minute.""   However, instead, the ship's gravity drive had opened a tear in the space-time continium, propelling the ship into another dimension; the dimension of Hell. What returned is a spaceship ""alive"" with pure evil.<br/><br/>The concept of ""Hell"" being another dimension is certainly nothing new. However, this is the first time I have seen this concept applied in a science fiction film.  However, that is the limit of originality the director and writers have applied in EVENT HORIZON.  The movie gets shocking a grisly from the opening scene.  I would suggest both writer an director get themselves a stopwatch and sit through ALIEN, THE EXORCIST and THE HAUNTING (1964).  They might be surprised to find how long before ANYTHING genuinely frightening or grisley takes place. Shock, violence and gore are not suspense or fright.

","Few movies blend science fiction and horror very well.  Event Horizon does a pretty good job of it.  Be warned: do not look for very much depth in the story line.<br/><br/>It uses the man vs. supernatural theme well; the characters are still in big trouble despite all of their science and technology.<br/><br/>The set of the ship is wonderfully Gothic.  It makes the viewer uncomfortable just looking at it.<br/><br/>It has good visual effects.  They may be diminished by the quality of the home theatre system you watch it on.  Some of the gore in the movie is a bit disturbing, however, it does add to the evil qualities of the character.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the script does not do the actors justice.  I know Fishburne and Neil are capable of a lot more.  We are given a superficial background and little insight into each of the characters.  They are predictable and act irrationally which is expected in most horror movies.<br/><br/>We are given a slight bit of comic relief but it seems terribly out of place under such grim circumstances.<br/><br/>Do not over analyze this movie; just sit back and enjoy."

"nick L","7","0","1","6 November 1999"," 'Alien' meets 'The Shining'. So there.
","I have read more than one review which has used the above statement, and upon viewing this slick but mixed bag of frights, I can see their point.<br/><br/>Here are just a few things that this film rips off of 'Alien' & 'The Shining': - In Alien, Ash (played by a non-American actor) is the traitor in the midst. In Event Horizon it's Weir (played by a non-American actor) - The tone is almost identical to Alien, what with a largely unseen enemy and the final race against time (and a ticking bomb) - The 'inventor's block' suffered by Weir is almost identical to and is handled in a very similar (if more clumsy) way to Jack's madness in The Shining. - There are two scenes lifted directly out of The Shining - the beatiful naked woman in the bath who turns nasty and the cascade of blood<br/><br/>However, I still found myself enjoying this film immensely and getting completely taken in by it, and the FX and art direction are great. In any case, at least it steals from two good films. There were several good set-pieces throughout (occasionally marred by Anderson's use of over familiar cliches) and some impressive effects shots (the pull back from the space station and the first visit to a zero gravity Event Horizon are perfect examples). For the first hour, the film keeps impressively spooky yet keeping it's tongue firmly in cheek.<br/><br/>The downside of the film is the clumsy scripting. To say that the dialogue is cheesy is an insult to dairy products ('we won't need eyes where we're going' and Weir's constant repetition of 'DO YOU SEE!!!' are prime examples of some lazy scripting). The concept that the ship has gone to hell is severely underused, and is really quite a good concept. Although we are given some brief hints of the Event Horizon's journey into hell with the final, squirming log entry, it never develops into the true nightmare we so wish it to, instead opting for done to death 'eerie' corridor walks and some grisly but boring 'Hellraiser'-style make up effects. Yet the film is still entertaining, and we are least given a juicy, explosion fuelled climax., but for all it's efforts it remains flawed. At least it is this good, given the pitfalls of such an over used genre."

But when when the movie continues, i felt like this was nothing i've seen before in my life!!! And it was more that i expected. The director of the movie, Paul Anderson, wasn't exactly my favourite director (after i saw Mortal Kombat, of course). But Paul got something in his sleeves, that looked like the Wachowski brothers, with this ""spinnig-camera-in-the-space"". That special effect alone was making my stomich mourning.

The special effects were great.<br/><br/>A lot of people complain that the first three quarters is great and the last bit is bad simply because they reveal too much of what's going on and there's no more mystery. Let's look at it this way: people have to realize that the movie makers are trying to sum up the movie at this point. If they didn't, we'd complain more that we didn't get to find out what was going on. If you don't like gore or mind tricks, don't watch the movie. But if you want to, go in expecting a fun ride, not 'art'.<br/><br/>For me the movie was gripping the whole way through! What really made the movie is I came out of it immediately wanting to go back in and watch it again. It was fun. What else should a movie be aside from trying to make a point--and who went to the movie expecting it to make a point about society? Basically people got what they wanted, or they didn't have fun in the movie. Either way, it was a good movie, just that some people had fun and some didn't! The only complaint I had was subpar acting from Jack Noseworthy, who is usually quite good.<br/><br/>And you never know who'll come out at the end until the last few minutes. This movie was complete with a final showdown.<br/><br/>It's basically The Shining crossed with outer space. That's my description of it. Rent it. It's not a new release; it'll cost you about $3.

It's about the lost ship called EVENT HORIZON lost in space in 2040. Seven years later a rescue team goes after them on top secret mission.<br/><br/>Once the rescue crew arrives at Neptune the scary moments begin. I'm not into telling more, because I don't want to spoil the moment of watching it. Remember scary horror scenes in 7 (se7en)??? Well,... multiply it by 10 and add Hellraiser to get scenes from this one. Please, avoid this movie if you're having a problem with nightmares, other wise...enjoy it!"
"MR2DI4-2","7","0","1","20 July 1999"," Needed a rewrite, but incredible effects!
","This movie has all the base material for a really great movie;<br/><br/>good acting, excellent set and graphic design, beautiful special effects and CG, and a soundtrack that won't quit scaring you.  It's just there are so few details given to us and it's hard to understand what's going on with Dr. Weir.  The rest of the cast perform rather well and help to add realism to the movie.  A little more emphasis on the ship and less on Weir probably could've saved this movie."
"R. Cody","7","0","1","3 July 1999"," Disappointing but effective
","As has been noted here, there is not much new going on in ""Event Horizon"". Still, unoriginality is not the greatest sin a movie can make. In my opinion dullness would be a greater crime. ""Event Horizon"" drew me in from the beginning and created a sense of suspense that did not dissipate despite various flaws in the script and direction. These flaws include potentially interesting characters with not enough meat on their bones, and a typical ""explosive"" Hollywood climax. I agree with a previous reviewer here regarding what this film might have been had it been allowed to unfold beyond the time constraints of a normal 90 minute movie. Perhaps then the ""Event Horizon"" could have really taken us to some place new. . .<br/><br/>""Event Horizon"" is beautiful to look at - the sets and effects are wonderfully realized - and the cast, working within the previously mentioned restraints of the script, are solid. There is some extreme gore in the film (most of it shown in rapid, nearly subliminal, shots)but I did not find it gratuitous despite its extremity.<br/><br/>In closing I would say that ""Event Horizon"" is a flawed but none the less effective horror film with science fiction trappings."
"Pretender-5","10","0","4","29 June 1999"," The most ADRENALINED film (plot/action) since ALIENS!
","All criticism  towards this movie is nonsense! This movie rules: it shocks, it goes into your mind it captures and raises your adrenalin! I tell you one thing people - I specifically traveled to London to see it on the EMPIRE's LEICESTER SQUARE big screen!!! It is the only shocker I can watch over and over! It's not about torture only - it's about the technological discovery, which can bring hell on Earth! Awesome!... not for children though blood is very real. Besides Sam Neil vs. Lawrence Fishburne - great! Recommend: 4+ /Leon Sam"
"Deosyne","10","0","4","26 June 1999"," The only movie ever to frighten me. I LOVED IT!
","Oh my god. That's all I could think after I finished watching Event Horizon. An awesome sci-fi/horror movie based on the mysterious reappearance of the first ship designed to travel faster than light after disappearing for many years. Amazing environment, awesome effects and spectacular soundtrack just made this film a rolling frightfest. If you have not seen it, do it NOW! Just don't watch it alone. :)"
"Astro-3","7","0","2","4 September 1998"," I wanted more.
","Top notch cast and stunning special effects couldn't save this movie. I loved the look of this movie, but in terms of the script it left me wanting more. Not much original here.  This movie could have been a great one, but sadly fell short. I'm hoping there's a directors cut out there somewhere with added gruesome footage."
"topealvim","7","0","1","10 June 1999"," Another good horror flick with Sam Niel
","1st of all - the movie isn't half as bad as I have seen portraited here in other comments. The acting is good (not great), the fx are great and the plot is somewhat original: while I was watching the movie I felt like I already knew parts of the story - it clearly has some Alien and Shining influences. It also remembered my of the sphere ( being the core similar to the sphere). Apart from that, it was refreshing to see a movie where the characters weren't dumb teenagers running from a maniac with a knife. This movie is intense, and some of the scenes are (eventually) shocking. It makes a good rental - If you like this genre, that is - Sci.FI+horror."
"khnemu","9","0","1","12 June 1999"," WOW!! One of the best films of the 90:s
","When me and my homies rented this movie I had no expectations what so ever, and when it was done we were speechless!<br/><br/>This movie is unlike any other scifi horror film I have ever seen, it mixes the thrilling parts of ""alien"" with the same lonely feeling of infinitive space you have in ""2001 a space odyssey"". It's very psychological and surprises you several times with it's bizzare twists. The acting is mostly done by Laurence Fishbourne (Apocalypse Now, Matrix) and Sam Elliot (Jurrasic Park, The Hunt For The Red October). Together they make THE best science fiction flick I've seen since Star Wars. And I know I'm not the only one that thinks this movie is superb every person I've asked has said the exact same thing. And therefore I'm having a hard time looking at the grade it got here at IMDB, it should at least scale up to a 7.8. All I can say is this one is goin on my top 100."

","Aaaahh !! I've being watch this at HBO and this is really creepy from the damage spaceship to the weirdo Dr. Weir, i think my heart is very sickness. This Sci-Fi film is 99,99 % HORROR.<br/><br/>THE END"
"decoyb4u-3","8","0","1","27 May 1999"," Revolutionary sci-fi, with a bitter end.
","Event horizon is one of those movies in time that changes the way you think about movies. Many movies today, aren't original at all. They don't have anything new to offer. Just the same story, with some add ons, and some back drops here and there.<br/><br/>With Event Horizon, you get sci-fi horror so magnificantly unique, you'll have a hard time wondering what to expect. The movie Event Horizon focuses on timetravel, a technology I doubt will exist at all in the future.<br/><br/>""Event Horizon"" is the first spaceship that can travel through time. At the launch of the ship, something goes terribly wrong. The ship vanishes without a trace. Decades later, returning, empty, and with no crew members. A group of people with different ethnical backgrounds, and personalities search out to explore Event Horizon, and maybe discover some clues as to what happened.<br/><br/>Event Horizon is a must see. It is near quality of the suspence in Alien that really made the sci-fi versus horror theme. You'll also understand, that with only some movies, the end can destroy so much, even though the rest was excellent. So, if you see Event Horizon, think of an ending, and see what you didn't expect to happen. Believe me though. Event Horizon is exciting and crisp original. Enjoy."

","Event Horizon is simply a bad movie.  The makers of this movie stocked it with some good actors but we don't find ourselves caring much for the characters they portray.  Laurence Fishurne and Sam Neill overact through the whole flick.  Most of the events are predictable and instead of holding us in suspense, there is an attempt to sicken us with gore and a poor portrayal of blood rushing over everything in sight.  Do not waste your rental dollars."
"Phoenix-69","10","0","4","27 May 1999"," A movie deals in the same time with science-fiction and Horror. Must to be seen!!!
","It's a very very good movie. The rest of the title says : Infinite space, Infinite terror! It's true, this film deals in the same time with ""space""-fiction and with horror and terror! We can only regret that the ""horror"" pictures aren't sufficiently explicit. Sorry for my poor english !!!"
"brijess-2","7","0","1","9 May 1999"," Very scary but useless profanity and gore.
","I found the idea behind Event Horizon to be pretty scary and the scenes where they play back the tapes of the former crew entering ""hell"" to be terrifying. But why or why was there so much profanity and gore? For me it ruined the movie, especially the quick nude scene. What purpose did it serve?<br/><br/>The special effects were excellent and I found the acting to be solid.<br/><br/>All in all, it did provide scares and it left a lingering dread feeling like no other has since the bad, but scary Amityville Horror. I give Event Horizon a B-."
"Kennina","8","0","1","8 May 1999"," It's supposed to be gory it's a horror film!
","Ok so there are several parts of this film that have blatantly been nicked from others ( the blood rushing down the corridor - The Shining,the images of Hell - Hellraiser, etc )However when I saw this film at the cinema I was very impressed because although it contained these parts it was an original concept - a horror film set in space where the horror element isn't aliens.I went expecting to see another dodgy Aliens rip off but was gripped by the storyline as it unfolded.There was also some nice directional touches like the filming of the space scene, a great score by Orbital,an amazingly dark moody gothic set and some good acting from Larry Fishburne , Sam Niell, Sean Pertwee, Richard Jones and Jason Isaacs. Ok it's not the greatest film ever but I think it deserves more than 5.7 out of 10."
"Tics","10","0","2","28 April 1999"," Both horrifying and great.
","I saw the Event Horizon one dark night and I thought that it was very bloody and gory. It starts out with a rescue spaceship that is on a mission to find the Event Horizon which we are told can fold time. Laurence Fishburne is the captain of the Lewis&Clark (rescueship) and Sam Neill is the doctor that created the Event Horizon. I won't tell too much about the movie because I think that you should see it. It is like old horror movies about haunted houses but instead we got what seems to be a haunted ship.<br/><br/>My friend, Cathulu thinks that this is a really great movie and that it took his heart away. He says that it got some resemblance to the Hellraiser pictures. Sam Neill is the greatest actor."
"TimH-4","7","0","1","20 April 1999"," Clive Barker meets Arthur C Clarke.
","What would happen if Arthur C Clarke started a book on faster than light travel and Clive Barker finished it off?<br/><br/>This film has a similar feel to Aliens 3, with a mixture of gritty largely familiar (to me) British and American actors. The plot is cleverly developed and adds a twist of horror to that usual SciFi quandary - how to travel faster than light.<br/><br/>The characterisation was intelligent and varied, my favourite being Sean ""Son of Dr Who"" Pertwee as Smith. Fishbourne was a strong, level headed captain who takes over as the focal point of the film from Dr Weir (Sam Neil) towards the end of the film.<br/><br/>There are many overtones from other films, such as Don't Look Now as well as Hellraiser, Aliens etc. but that doesn't mean it's a film worth experiencing."
"Mansilla","8","0","1","16 April 1999"," Well, it scared me
","As other users have said this may not have been the greatest film ever shot, the acting may not be perfect, and I suspect a lot of what was originally shot ended up on the cutting room floor, making some of it difficult to follow, but this kept it to a manageable length, rather than having it ramble on for 2 1/2 hours, which far too many films do at the moment.<br/><br/>The film had some stunning visuals, and while effects don't make a film they certainly help. It also succeeded in scaring me, which is rare. And for that alone it gets a good mark from me. Most 'Horror' now is appalling, it's all either very very tame (I know what you did last summer) or so tongue in cheek it becomes a comedy (Scream 1+2, Bad Taste), so it's refreshing to see something that went out of its way to make me jump.<br/><br/>I gave it 8/10."
"Verona","Null","0","1","24 August 1998"," A rescue crew goes to investigate the Event Horizon, an advanced ship lost for 7 years
","Very, very creepy.  Pile on the gore, genuinely creepy atmosphere, and wiggy ""turn around!"" scenes, this movie is really good if you're in for a scare , or lets say 50.  Superb actors, good effects and a REALLY scary movie, lets this one speak for itself."
"Nando-3","Null","0","1","3 August 1998"," An exploration ship is lost in space. Seven years later, a message from it is received and another ship is sent to rescue it.
","The movie starts very well, creating a lot of suspense among the audience. By the time the ship ""Event Horizon"" is found, there is actually a feeling of fear in the viewer concerning what may be inside her. At this point, however, the plot apparently loses its importance and the audience is shocked with brutal and sudden noises which would be perfectly dispensable. You may be a little frightened by this, but in the end you'll agree that the ""Infinite Terror..."" wasn't quite there after all."
