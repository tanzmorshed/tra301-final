"ametaphysicalshark","Null","915","1063","27 June 2008"," Who says popular films can't be art? ""WALL·E"" is magical
","Who says popular films are not and cannot be art? If anything is proof that popular films can be of a stunningly high quality, the beauty of the animation, writing, music, and sound design in ""WALL·E"" is it. ""WALL·E"" eclipses even Andrew Stanton's ""Toy Story"" and ""Toy Story 2"" in the Pixar pantheon, is perhaps Pixar's best film to date and, call me crazy as I've just seen it, a contender for the title of best animated film, period.<br/><br/>""WALL·E"" is everything we've come to expect from Pixar and more- colorful, vibrant, imaginative, exciting, involving, beautiful, and most importantly a film with interesting, involving characters. Sure, WALL·E is adorable, and as much credit as the animators get for that, this film would be nothing without Stanton's screenplay, which features very little dialogue but is still notably intelligent and surprisingly subtle, making a refreshing change from the 'go green' campaigns we're all so used to. Does ""WALL·E"" have a message? Sure, but it's an important message and it is delivered subtly and beautifully.<br/><br/>""WALL·E"" operates on two levels (and works spectacularly well on both). It is a majestic science fiction epic like we haven't seen in a couple of decades and it is a genuinely touching and never cheap romance. ""WALL·E"" will never get points for originality but it doesn't exactly need them because the homages to great films and figures of the past- Chaplin, Keaton, Tati, the Marx Brothers, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (this one is particularly spectacular), ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" are actually homages and not ripoffs. ""WALL·E"" is a wonderful tribute to a bygone cinematic tradition (well, two or three of them actually). <br/><br/>The social commentary in ""WALL·E"" is sobering because it's never overbearing and most importantly because we see the world through machines, machines who feel more about Earth and life than the humans do. The depiction of humans on the ship could have been incredibly offensive, cheap, and tasteless in concept but the execution here is absolutely perfect.<br/><br/>What is most surprising about ""WALL·E"" is how sad it is. Not even in the 'how will they get out of this, oh I feel so sorry for them' way ""Finding Nemo"", a previous Stanton effort, is, but in a truly melancholy sense. The early portion of the film maintains all the playfulness of a Jacques Tati film but also evokes a striking and powerful feeling of loneliness. It's a brilliant introduction to WALL·E, given that the rest of the film is too wacky to bother with long scenes focused entirely on character, and works beautifully with the ugly yet beautifully-rendered future Earth, a barren wasteland filled with nothing but garbage, a seriously resilient cockroach being WALL·E's only companion before EVE shows up, but I won't go into the story- it's best you see it unfold for yourself.<br/><br/>From the entertaining shorts shown before the film to the memorable characters, locations, and animation we have come to expect, Pixar films are now event cinema, and they have outdone themselves with ""WALL·E"". This film is spectacular, majestic, touching, involving, and achingly beautiful. Most importantly, however, it is perfect entertainment. I may be saying this too soon, but I don't think I have ever seen an animated film that has satisfied me more than ""WALL·E"", and 2008 is going to have to work hard to keep this from being the top film of the year, which it most certainly is at the moment.<br/><br/>9.5/10"
"MR_Heraclius","10","59","64","15 February 2020"," Best movie of the century
","To this day, this is still my favorite pixar film. The animation is stellar, its heartwarming, funny and proves that pixar movies are always bound to be great (except for cars 2 but thats a different story). This has a shot at the title ""best movie of the century"""
"DrWetter","10","816","997","8 June 2008"," Pixar does it again!
","I just returned from an advanced benefit screening of WALL*E, and I want to be careful not to spill too much regarding the movie. I had the added privilege of watching the film at Pixar, which in and of itself, was amazing.<br/><br/>This picture is not a cartoon; it is a film. In fact, it even has the LOOK of film. One of my complaints of more recent 3-D/CG animated films (not from Pixar) is that they all seem to look the same... clean lines, crisp colors, and very ""virtual"", for lack of a better term. WALL*E transcends the typical look of CG animation, and has a true to life ""grit."" The creators at Pixar are true artists, and are indeed masters of their craft. Not only are they masters of the technology, they are masters of telling a story. WALL*E is no exception.<br/><br/>The best way to describe the film is as a science fiction, comedy, dramatic love story. WALL*E, as a character, has dimension, personality, and heart... pretty impressive given that he is essentially a trash compactor. It is true that there is little dialogue in this feature, but I personally did not feel it detracted from the story at all.<br/><br/>WALL*E is very much a different Pixar film from it's previous features. I will be curious to see how it is received by others, but in my opinion, I think Pixar has stayed true to itself, demonstrating a commitment to telling great stories and pushing the edge of technology to leave your jaw dropping! My most sincere compliments to Andrew Stanton, Jim Morris, John Lasseter, Ben Burtt, and all the creative forces at Pixar. Can't wait to see what the future brings..."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","10","299","360","27 June 2008"," Honestly? This is the best Disney/Pixar movie I have seen
","I'm starting to wonder if there is bad Disney/Pixar film, I mean, normally when we think of the combo, it does equal gold, we automatically know that everyone is going to love this movie, it's just a matter of comparison to the other animation films. I'm not just saying this because I had a good time when I was watching this, I'm very serious, this is my favorite Disney/Pixar film. It's completely worth the ticket price, this couldn't have been a more perfect film. Everything about WALL·E is just beyond great: the characters, the story, and the incredible animation. But the thing that I loved about WALL·E is it's message, I know that it does go a little over board with the ""jog or get fat"", ""throw your garbage away"", and the ""we've become too dependent on machines"" message, but I felt this was the most charming way to present it to the children who have to grow up in a world where they're going to have to worry about global warming, this may open their eyes a little.<br/><br/>WALL·E is a robot that is left all alone on Planet Earth, Earth is now covered with garbage. The humans have left onto a corporate ship and are living their lives care free and well, thought free. WALL·E has been collecting little human pieces here and there and making them into his treasures, but the one thing he really wants is a friend. One day a ship lands with a female robot, Eve, who WALL·E just adores, but Eve is on a mission to find a plant to bring back onto the human ship to show that Earth is safe. But when the ship grabs Eve, WALL·E follows her and discovers the mutiny that is afoot on the ship. Everyone is overweight, can't walk, can't think for themselves, and let's all the robots do all the work for them. But WALL·E and Eve are on the mission to get them back to Earth and give it a little love.<br/><br/>WALL·E is seriously the best movie I have seen this summer, I just adored this movie, it has great laughs, cute jokes and is entertaining for the whole family. Like I said before, when it's Disney/Pixar you just can't go wrong. WALL·E is one of their most lovable characters ever and was like the robot version of Charlie Chaplin, he brought great slap stick to the story. This movie delivers everything you can imagine and much more, not to mention a great message. I highly recommend this movie for everyone, it's just a very wonderful movie that anyone can enjoy. The animation, I can't believe how far we've come, but this was a beautifully made movie and couldn't have been better. I loved WALL·E, this is a movie that will bring you plenty of laughs for your summer.<br/><br/>10/10"
"CA_movie_fan","10","636","813","7 June 2008"," Pixar's still producing the best movies out there
","We went to the San Francisco Film Institute's first public screening at their campus in Emeryville. Everyone's sworn to secrecy, but for a film with little dialog, it carries more of an emotional punch and has a richer story than any live-action movie this year. The tone and style of the film is completely different for Pixar, and Disney haven't tried to override the darker thematic elements at all, making the story surprisingly three-dimensional.<br/><br/>This will end up being the animated film of the year and I had the same 'wow' feeling as after seeing Ratatouille. Considering that animated films have always played second-fiddle to live-action, and have been aimed at kids, it's ironic that once again Pixar produces a film that rivals any live action on every level. Bravo!"
"Chrysanthepop","Null","46","53","2 November 2008"," A Most Endearing Love Story In Space...And Back
","Over the years I've become quite a sucker for Pixar movies and just love each and every one of them. While there are the states of the art animation and sound effects, the stories have heart. The characters are adorable yet real. It reminds one of those charming movies Disney used to make but Pixar films are very much a unique cinematic experience. <br/><br/>'WALL-E' is quite unusual compared to the previous Pixar movies. There's hardly any dialogue between the two protagonists other than saying each other's name. In fact, barely a word is spoken in the entire first half hour but WALL-E and Eve's silent and playful love story is such a joy to watch. Even though of few words, both characters have strong personalities and the character development is wonderfully done. <br/><br/>The animation is colourful and vivid. Sound effect is amazing. The robot characters are cute and charming. The score deserve special mention as it's mesmerizing and beautiful. Andrew Stanton has done a terrific job as director and co-writer. The portrayal of WALL-E's loneliness and need for love is very well done and then the change that is brought within after the entrance of Eve and his eventual determination to rescue her is effectively shown. There are many genuinely funny and creative moments and it manages to stay away from being 'just plain silly'. The story is rich with humour, action, drama and adventure. <br/><br/>Ben Burtt and Elissa Knight do a fabulous job with the voice acting for WALL-E and Eve. John Ratzenberger, Kathy Najimy and Sigourney Weaver lend great support. While 'WALL-E' tells a magnificent love story it reminds us that Earth is our home and nothing can replace it. It's a joyous magical experience and another sure winner from Pixar."
"jedi-jones","10","465","625","29 June 2008"," An A+ for Wall-E! One of the best movies this century!
","Wall-E is the movie experience I've been looking for. I haven't seen a new film this richly entertaining, thrilling, touching and satisfying since Spider-Man 2. It is truly the finest Pixar or animated CGI film to date. I can discuss it without spoilers easily because it's one of those films, like 2001: A Space Odyssey, that exists more as a pure experience of the heart and the senses than as a collection of events that we're supposed to keep track of intellectually. Wall-E rises above that kind of unnecessary complication into the same kind of space occupied by dreams and the imagination.<br/><br/>This film is beautifully animated, of course, to that magical Pixar point where even piles of what should be disgusting trash somehow look breathtakingly gorgeous and even fairly realistic-looking roaches look cute. But much more importantly, the heart, the emotion in this movie is unlike anything I've experienced at the cinema since Forrest Gump. Certainly my tear ducts have not welled up while watching a movie this much since then. I fell in like with the character of Wall-E when I saw the trailer. Watching the movie, I fell in love with him within about 2 minutes. Shortly after that, I fell in love with the idea of Wall-E falling in love.<br/><br/>My previous favorite movie romance is Superman and Lois Lane in the original Superman films. The love story, or the love experience of Wall-E and Eve is perhaps the first I've seen since then that operates at and succeeds on that same level. These couples create an uncomplicated, innocent, simple, yet deep and powerful bond. They capture the experience of love at first sight, writ large. They possess an instant chemistry that tells you they belong together from the first time they see one another and makes you root for their relationship throughout the film. Wall-E and Eve share moments together of real cinematic beauty, true hilarity, frightening sadness, frustrating difficulty and delightful satisfaction. It's a testament to the level of genius at which the Pixar storytellers are operating that we feel every beat of this relationship resonate every step of the way despite the fact that the characters are robots that are not modeled off of humans and speak no more than a handful of words throughout the movie (this animated movie is refreshingly free of obvious ""guest star"" voices or any over-the-top stand-up comedians trying to upstage the movie).<br/><br/>Just like in the first Superman films, once you care about the characters as individuals and care about their relationship, it's almost impossible for the rest of the movie not to work. You're hooked at hello. Wall-E adds all the expected complications to keep the would-be lovers from getting together most of the time. There is a truly great ""McGuffin"" that keeps the heroes and villains busy for quite a while (the item in question is something outwardly simple that ends up holding the key to something more important than anything in the world). The pacing during most of these adventures is as breakneck as anything out of the Star Wars films and the action is always staged with crystal clarity. There are several scenes of peril for Wall-E that are reminiscent of that oddly powerful sequence in Short Circuit 2 when Johnny 5 is almost killed. The filmmakers pull absolutely no punches when it comes to running your heart through the ringer over characters you care about. It probably helps that you can do a lot more physical damage to a robot character than you can to a human character while keeping a G rating and still getting the audience dramatically worried about their survival.<br/><br/>Even on top of the action, the emotion, the visuals and the humor, Wall-E goes the extra mile into thought-provoking thematic territory. The film never hits you over the head with anything preachy and doesn't really even outright tell you what its opinions on the subjects it raises are. It also doesn't explicitly lay out explanations for everything that exists in Wall-E's world (there are no ""talking killer"" scenes and very little verbal exposition). I think the bits of ambiguity work here because they add to the sense of mystery, helplessness and alienation that most of the characters in the movie feel to some degree.<br/><br/>There are human characters in this movie too, quite a few. I think that's necessary because if humans aren't shown in a robot world, you have to wonder what purpose were the robots designed to serve? That was a curiosity of the earlier CGI movie, Robots. Most of the humans in Wall-E aren't as developed as the robots, but I think that's because they exist more to represent the whole of humanity rather than particular individuals. We're asked to ponder the consequences of the choices they make as though the whole society was moving in that direction, not just one person. Wall-E and Eve are the heart of this movie but the humans are used to add some intellectual gravity for the audience to chew on.<br/><br/>Other choices made in the movie might also leave room for debate, such as the integration of some live-action footage into the film. But because the movie as a whole is so audaciously stimulating and brilliantly satisfying, it's a plus that they left us with a few unresolved or unusual things to think about and question after getting off of the great emotional and visual roller-coaster experience. Wall-E truly serves up everything that I think an audience could want in a movie experience. It will be very easy for me to watch this one over and over again. It is a modern-day classic that I believe should earn a place in cinema history as the ""2001"" of CGI animated films, both of them movies of indisputable brilliance, unyielding imagination and unending entertainment.<br/><br/>Footnote: The pre-movie short is an awesome, violent Looney Tunes/Roger Rabbit-esquire toon. It wants only to entertain and does."
"Valeen_the_II","10","182","240","27 June 2008"," Not just another Pixar masterpiece....A modern day SCI-FI masterpiece!
","This truly is one beautiful, touching animated sci-fi film....I cannot stress this enough. It's a unique cinema experience that you must enjoy firsthand.<br/><br/>The tale is set in the 22th century , Earth has become a lifeless wasteland full of garbage, that the human race evacuated nearly a millennium ago....Lifeless, that is with the two exceptions being the ""artifical"" life form ""WALL-E"" & his pet cockroach.<br/><br/>WALL-E is a squat humble trash-compacting robot who while continuing to fulfill the duties he was programmed for ( even though it's pointless considering there are no more humans on the planet ) collects certain leftover nicknacks, novelty items and even old films that he can still play. He mentally stimulates himself and enjoys fragments of the culture that is now gone ( that of the human race ). Though, WALL-E has imprinted on his little cockroach & vice versa, the little robot longs for more companionship.<br/><br/>He receives it in the form of a beautiful, sleek, defensive ""fembot fatale"" ""EVE ""....In their own little forms of robotic communication ( repeating each other's names in various connotations depending on moods ; ""WAAAALLL-E,"" ""EEEEEEEE-VAH!"" ) and WALL-E's Chaplin-esquire clumsiness that amuses EVE, the pair imprint on each other and enjoy each other's company.<br/><br/>Sadly, EVE has located a small plant and must return it to her mother ship and leave WALL-E forever...But WALLL-E hops aboard the ship in pursuit of his darling ""EEEEEE-VAH"".<br/><br/>And yes this film has very little dialog, but guess what, IT DON'T NEED NO STINKIN' DIALIOUGUE!....The brilliance and beauty of the film is in the interactions and responses of the little robots : a great representation of what ""artificial intelligence"" really is and what it may actually be one day! <br/><br/>And how ironic it is that in this film the organic HUMAN RACE has become soulless, mirthless, artless, jaded, self-centered cogs in a machine of blind consumerism, yet the mechanical artificial beings still respond to their surroundings like a toddler or pet : with curiosity, wonder, and delight in communication & learning.<br/><br/>And yes there is plenty of comic relief ( albeit sans dialouge ) so no this movie is NOT BORING....It's beautiful, it even made me a little bit misty-eyed.<br/><br/>So yeah if you're an a fan of animated films, sci-fi films, and romance you should definitely check out this movie.<br/><br/>Obviously, it is going to win a very well-deserved Oscar for ""Best Animated Film""."

"seaview1","9","88","117","5 July 2008"," WALL-E Brings Pathos to Computer Animation
","Pixar has produced some of the best animation in the past decade with its computer-generated features (Toy Story, Monsters Inc., and Finding Nemo) that have been marked by strong story lines and vivid characters. The tradition continues in an impressive way with Wall-E. This deceptively simple tale is transformed by the emotional content told almost entirely through visuals. <br/><br/>A polluted Earth has become uninhabitable for 700 years, and one of its only residents is Wall-E, a small robot whose solitary mission is to be a mobile, trash compactor. In his work, he also finds and collects trivial, odd artifacts of mankind's past such as a Rubik's cube. He comforts himself with an old video, Hello Dolly, and as he learns about humans and his yearning for love, it becomes his idyllic vision of happiness amid an insulated, dull existence. Along his travels, he comes across a unique find, a live plant! One day a spaceship lands and deposits a robot probe. Fascinated by this kindred machine, Wall-E follows and eventually befriends this unit known as Eve. Eve has a directive that will hopefully return humans to Earth if only it can sustain life, and Wall-E's plant figures immeasurably. Eve is returned to her mother ship with Wall-E frantically chasing after his newly found love. On a spaceship acting as a living city for its machine-dependent, overweight humans, little robots are not only the caregivers, but in control. Wall-E and Eve must figure a way to return the humans to earth and find happiness even if it means making the ultimate sacrifice.<br/><br/>Wall-E's innocence and childlike wonder (think E.T.), as exemplified by how he introduces himself to everyone he meets, could almost have sprung from Steven Spielberg's imagination. It's in the small details that enrich Wall-E as a character. He brings to mind an amalgam of past robots like Star Wars' R2-D2 and the little robots in Silent Running, and his fears and joys are expressed through body language and squeals. When he shuts down each night to sleep, he rocks himself as a child would. He is clumsy around Eve, and when he takes her to his makeshift home of robot parts and paraphernalia, he is like a little kid. Ironically, he is the catalyst to bring the humans back home. <br/><br/>Writer and director, Andrew Stanton (Finding Nemo), takes a huge risk by basing the film's premise almost entirely on a song from Hello Dolly. I can't think of an animated film that relied so much on visual storytelling. Even Fantasia and Allegro Non Troppo were collections of musical sequences not narrative features. In a way, this film is almost too sophisticated in its display and execution for little kids but is just right for adults. Remarkably, this is a tale with nary a spoken word by the principals. One has to think of silent films to approach this achievement. The operative word here is pathos like the best of Charlie Chaplin's little tramp and, amazingly, this film earns its stripes by emoting body language, action, and sound effects. Yet most of the characters aren't even human! <br/><br/>Fred Willard has an amusing small role as the corporate president. Sigourney Weaver, as the ship's computer voice, is an inspired choice since, like Eve, she was a female hero (in the Alien movies) and had to deal with computer voices in those films. The animation is almost 3-D in its rich detail and simulated, fluid camera-work. The interior of the mother ship, the Axiom, is a futuristic view of a commercialized (think Blade Runner) city in space. <br/><br/>Yes, it is a thinly veiled message for all those 'save the earth' and 'think green' people, but that never detracts from the main theme of saving humanity amid a touching love story. There are moments when you think a scene could have played out a bit better, but that is minor. It is likely that Wall-E's reputation will grow over time as a shining example of stretching the art form by challenging and trusting its audience. Bravo to the folks at Pixar for taking a chance and for entertaining and moving us."

"Bumblebee_Man","9","28","35","20 July 2008"," WALL-E: A Wonderful Achievement
","When it comes to animated films, Pixar are masters of the craft. Ever since their feature film debut, the magnificent 'Toy Story', the animation studio have brought us such instant classics as 'Monsters Inc.', 'The Incredibles' and 'Finding Nemo', a film which remains as one of the biggest selling DVDs of all time. Surely it's about time that they delivered us a bad film? Well, sorry to disappoint, but Pixar's 'WALL-E' is among not only their greatest work, but among the greatest animations ever produced.<br/><br/>The film opens with some astonishing shots of a desolate, rubbish-laden, polluted Earth; a boldly dark opening for a family oriented feature. It is amidst these dystopian surroundings, however, that our hero - arguably more adorable than a basket full of puppies and kittens - is first introduced to us. WALL-E is a character of genius; combining elements of Johnny 5, Charlie Chaplin and Mr. Bean, Andrew Stanton (Director) and crew have created something that will no doubt go down in history with R2-D2 as one as the screen's most memorable machines.<br/><br/>It is the 22nd Century, and mankind have left Earth in giant Space Cruisers waiting for the surface of their planet to finally become habitable again. 700 years have past, and WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class), is the last of a group of robots left to clean up the planet. In a disturbing sequence, our hero ventures home through trash heaps laden with 'dead' WALL-E's... another sign that this is not the usually Pixar fare, but something more meaningful, more bold, more... adult in theme. And this is what the first act of the film is. WALL-E, accompanied by his pet cockroach (who, as a testament to Pixar's genius, we grow to care for just as much as the metal man himself), goes about his daily routine. It is in this mostly silent section of the film that we grow to love WALL-E. As he rumages through human garbage, finding interest in things that seem mundane to us, we discover that after all these years, this little robot has developed something that makes him seem more to us than an animated clunk of cogs and rust... a personality. His incredibly curious nature make for some of the most adorable moments depicted in film (including moments such as WALL-E meets car keys and WALL-E meets... bra). We delve further into this intriguing personality when we invited into the little guy's 'house', a storage space for all his collected junk. Whilst WALL-E watches a VCR of the musical 'Hello, Dolly!"", we see from his large, emotional eyes and clasping hands that he is, heartbreakingly, all alone on this immense world.<br/><br/>Then, the following day, as WALL-E goes about his trash-cube-making business, something extraordinary, both to us and WALL-E, occurs. A space ship touches down on the surface, holding within it EVE, a futuristic, Ipod-resembling droid here to scout the earth for plant-life... and WALL-E's one true love (aww).<br/><br/>This love story eventually leaps from Earth into space and onto The Axiom, an immense Space Ship on which a large number of the American population - depicted as lazy, obese, consumerist slobs - go about the same mundane routine day in, day out. Message heavy, but never preachy. In the end, through WALL-E, everyone learns the true meanings of life: Love and the relationships with those around us. Oh, and to take care of the planet, of course.<br/><br/>Beautiful visuals, astonishing characterisation and a sequence with WALL-E and EVE floating through space that is more romantic than anything your likely to see this year, make 'WALL-E' an outstanding achievement that proudly stands among Pixar's finest work. WALL-E is a completely realised character, and one which I am sure we have not seen the last of. Although, some would argue, not as accessible as other films in the genre (some children may grow resteless during the film's earlier, dialogue-free sequences), 'WALL-E' will leave a lasting impression on cinema goers of all ages.<br/><br/>And that is the genius of Pixar. The only studio ever to create films that are, truly, 'for all the family'. <br/><br/>-Dan Henry, 20th July 2008"

Coming with high expectations, it definitely succeeded mines. It's so beautiful, moving, hilarious & sad at the same time. And for those who has been anticipating Thomas Newman's score for WALL-E, it's certainly one of his best right behind Finding Nemo in which I thought was his best score to date! Like I said it's Pixar best film so far, WALL-E knocked off Ratatouille of the top spot in which I thought it was their best film to date and officially, WALL-E is the best Pixar film i've ever seen with Ratatouille right behind and Finding Nemo, third. Pixar fan or non-Pixar fan, you'll definitely enjoy this one. WALL-E will forever be remembered as one of the most lovable characters ever created on film!!!"
"comixdude3","10","36","48","1 July 2008"," More intelligent, heartfelt, thought provoking, and flat-out masterful than anything that's been released in years.
","I thought that Pixar was one of the greater animation studios of the new millennium; after seeing Wall-E, I'm convinced that Pixar is the greatest modern animation studio, and perhaps one of the most talented and treasured film companies period. Writer-Director Andrew Stanton has not only managed to create a technical marvel with Wall-E, pushing the boundaries of computer animation technology to the limits, but also a work of pure art that's more intelligent, heartfelt, thought provoking, and flat-out masterful than any movie in years.<br/><br/>The film start's off on a simultaneously sweet and sour note: The opening reveals the gorgeous backdrop of galaxies and stars, with music from the movie 'Hello-Dolly!' overlapping it all in a sugary visual treat. Not seconds later, the camera traverses space to slowly close in on the planet Earth which, 700 years in to the future, has gained a sickly green tint to it along with an orbital atmosphere of pure garbage. Further zooming reveals a desolated city (New York, maybe?) its buildings and bridges rotted way. The entire opening is very reminiscent of the recent I Am Legend, except much, much more ruined. It is however, technically beautiful; the images are so photo realistic that you're amazed that they've been generated by computer. <br/><br/>The only remnants of humanity are monstrous skyscrapers of compacted trash and billboards aplenty advertising the bright and colorful, yet somehow ominous company known as Buy n' Large, a thinly veiled Wal-Mart clone. And, of course, Wall-E itself.<br/><br/>Wall-E is far more than a mere 'it', however. Through hundreds of nuanced and heartfelt animation quirks, as well as the ""voice"" given by Ben Burtt, Star-Wars veteran and creator of another famed beeping robot named R2-D2, Wall-E has been imbued with enough life to fill three-dozen cheap summer kids flicks, all without ever saying more than two or three actual words.<br/><br/>Wall-E has been operating for centuries, long after his other Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class counterparts have shut down or broken apart, scouring the wastelands of earth and compacting the land's garbage in to neat little cubes.<br/><br/>It's a lonely job, with the little robot's only companion being a spunky little cockroach. Wall-E has over the years collected an impressive amount of junk with which he passes the time, including lighters, toys, spare parts, and an old VHS copy of Hello Dolly!, which is Wall-E's instructor in the ways of life, love, and keenly choreographed dance. Indeed, Wall-E gazes upon two lovers holding hands and the look in his binocular eyes is both heartbreaking and beautiful. <br/><br/>It all changes however, when a beautiful robot from the human colony in space arrives; her name is EVE. Despite here tendencies to blow up anything that moves, Wall-E is smitten at first sight, and EVE comes to eventually share those feelings. After taking note of a very unique possession of Wall-E's however, EVE reports back to the Earth ship Axiom and is whisked away back in to space. Wall-E, being as devoted as he is, follows her into the unknown, and it is there that the movie really gets going, with Wall-E and EVE taking part in an adventure with the fate of humanity itself in the balance. Characters like the Captain of the Axiom (voiced by Jeff Garlin) appearing to flesh out the film's plot, as well as a gaggle of amusing ""rogue"" robots that aide Wall-E and EVE in their quest. <br/><br/>As the movie develops, however, the leading characters' romance becomes the core of the movie, with Wall-E and EVE's love being one of the few genuinely lovely and convincing romances of recent cinema. The touching moments Wall-E shares with EVE in his workshop, as well as their first ""kiss"" preceding a marvelous dance through space highlight a relationship that tugs at the heartstrings and moistens the eyes far more than movies like Fool's Gold or What Happens in Vegas. The romance between the two leads is the very soul of the movie, and could not have been better executed. <br/><br/>The film is gorgeous to boot: With colors and images that dazzle and linger long after the film is over. Films like No Country for Old Men and There Will Be Blood, as beautiful as they are, seem to revel in the gloom of browns and blacks. Wall-E, on the other is vibrant and alive, turning even the beginning's post-apocalyptic wasteland in to a marvel. <br/><br/>The biggest surprise of Wall-E, however, would be its surprising amount of maturity. Wall-E deals with themes of pollution, rampant consumerism, societal complacency and obesity, media desensitization, and other themes that would frankly fly over a child's head. Kids will see a world full of people who are humorously fat and happy; older members of the audience, however, will see a society that tells of a future not centuries ahead of us but perhaps only decades. The overblown laziness and rampant consumerism is evident already today, and the notion of Wall-E's future being so similar is funny yes, but also a touch unnerving.<br/><br/>It is for this reason that I hold Wall-E in such high esteem: It is a heartfelt work of inarguable art that not only entertains but holds enough conscience and commentary to get even the most casual of moviegoer thinking about the future. It is beautiful and it is heartbreaking. It is funny and it is also a tad scary. It has two supposedly life-less robots teaching humanity the very meaning of being human, as well as learning the meaning of true love themselves. It made me laugh, it made me (almost) cry. It has the distinction of being Pixar's best movie, as wells as the hands down best movie of the year (so far); an almost perfect, if not completely perfect summer movie that kids and adults will almost assuredly love.<br/><br/>And it is also one of the greatest movies I have ever seen."

","Robots falling in love. There is a lot to like about the new Pixar film Wall-E. The animation goes without sayingbetter than anything out there. The glares, the environments, everything is rendered spectacularly, right down to the flame of a Zippo lighter. As for the story, leave it to these wizards for creating a tale that hits on a gut level, letting our simplest emotions come to the surface in order speak to our hearts and souls. With fewer words than Arnold Swartzenegger had to speak in Terminator 2, this movie relies on its visuals and on the movements and actions of the characters. It is appropriate that we are shown clips from older musicals to show humanity before Earth was abandoned. If we harken back to them for the joys of people, why not go to silent era style in order to portray communication between beings that cannot speak? Wall-E, his crush EVE, and all the other robots involved can say little than their name, however, we understand exactly what they mean throughout. The entire film speaks on a level that most people might have forgotten. In an age of Hollywood spoon-feeding the masses by having actors preach the obvious, Pixar has shown their originality again by getting an audience to partake in a film that makes them pay attention and work a little; something that the message of the piece is trying to have come across for humanity in general.<br/><br/>I credit the filmmakers for showcasing a world that has been left unlivable due to pollution and excess, yet never stooping to the level of liberal propaganda to soapbox an environmental agenda. No, the idea of ""going green"" or ""stop global warming"" never comes out blatantly, but instead we are shown the message of how technology is making us gluttons and sloths, reliant for everything and unable to even see what is going on right in front of our faces. Humanity, drifting on a space station for 700 years being waited on hand and foot, has become a giant mass of inactive waste. Watching their awakening at the hands of a little waste removal machine, seeing love, life, and beauty as if for the first time ever is a wonderful thing. Sure the homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey is fantastic, but these moments work on another level altogetherthat of truth. Consumer culture and materialism has destroyed our society to the point that social status depends on the car you drive and the trinkets you can collect rather than the job you do and the work you put in. To see the Captain of the vessel, housing what has become of the human race, slowly open his eyes to what could be is mind-blowingly simple, yet also so necessary for children these days to see what burying their heads in the computer and cell phone is doing to the societal structure of the world. We need to stop being lemmings, droning along without purpose. There is a reason for life, things to strive for and love is one of them, something very prevalent here.<br/><br/>The robots themselves become more human than the humans, showing the emotion and compassion that people have left by the wayside. Curiosity takes center stage as Wall-E finds treasures amongst the trash he has been programmed to clean up for a return of life to Earth. Stacking his compacted boxes of refuse into skyscrapers taller than those left behind, he finds shelter in an abandoned tractor where he keeps spare parts and objects to play with during his solitude. Never expecting a visitor, or the impact that finding a small sapling of greenery could cause, a sophisticated robot named EVE arrives and changes his world forever. Not only does she become the woman of his dreams, but she also causes him to leave Earth and discover the spaceship, which has been trying to find his home for way too long.<br/><br/>Maybe it is funny to say, but the chemistry between these two machines is quite palpable and real, as they discover feelings that they shouldn't have due to programming and such, but they have evolved into sentient creatures. They fight for freedom against the spaceship's auto-pilot and take a stand to end the tyranny that has been subtly and effectively beating the humans into submission. Of course they may not be doing it for the humans per se, there is a matter of needing to go back for spare parts, but you'll understand once you see. Sure the Captain does his part to see the hero that Wall-E becomes to his stagnant race and being voiced by the hilarious Jeff Garlin definitely helps. When he starts viewing the history of Earth and just exudes wonderment and joy, you really enjoy the ride as he attempts to reverse his sloth and actually stand on his two legs for possibly the first time ever.<br/><br/>Where I do have a problem with the film is the pacing. Yes, I know there is very little dialogueand I whole-heartedly praise the film for itbut the beginning does have a tendency to drag. Maybe some of that has to do with it being an extended version of the trailer, but it just gets a little tedious as we wait for EVE to arrive and end the cute monotony of Wall-E playing with his finds in ways they aren't supposed to be used for, we've seen it before in The Little Mermaid. Even once they are on the ship, the cat and mouse game gets a little prolonged to pad the runtime a bit. The story here isn't very complex and I just wish there had been more to it, or at least a bit faster paced of a plot progression. Otherwise, though, this is another solid film from Pixar, showing that they definitely have the creativity and storytelling ability to infuse heart back into cinema and try new things rather than regurgitate for a big paycheck."
"WikusVanDeMerwe","10","38","54","28 June 2008"," Rediscovering our Humanity: A Wall-E Review
","We live in a consumerist era. As any visit to a metropolitan area will prove, there is the unfaltering marriage of burgeoning commerce to a burgeoning population. Retail giants now provide services that would take more than a handful of independent stores to supply and this umbrella is continually widening. But how far can this consumerism go before it consumes us? This is where Wall-E begins, setting up the most scathing, yet perhaps most accurate futurist take on consumerism's affect on society in any animated film I've seen to date. In fact, I can't recall any film in the last several years that has taken this approach so seriously. Andrew Stanton once again throws us straight into a darkly themed film, but once again there are serious points to be had. At the outset of the film, we are introduced to a world where the skyscrapers that once housed the internal workings of business are dwarfed and surrounded by skyscrapers built of that very business' refuse. WALL-E spends his days continuously collecting and compacting the mountains of garbage that fill the streets of the city and adding it the trash skyscrapers, piece by piece. We learn very early on that this is the last functional bot of its kind, and perhaps, the only living machine on the planet. But there is something special about this surviving Wall-E; this robot performs its programmed tasks, but it has also become a curious being, collecting and organizing interesting items seen day by day. Wall-E is, essentially, the last bit of humanity left on Earth, since every other human being is either dead or living aboard the space cruise liner, the Axiom.<br/><br/>But things change once EVE arrives on Earth. In true fashion with his curious nature, the sight of EVE is enthralling to Wall-E. Here is something new from humanity, not just the garbage and trinkets left behind for Wall-E to sift through and compact. What begins here is the most innocent yet basic of love stories I have seen or read in many years. There is a purity to Wall-E's almost hypnotic and naive interest in EVE. I don't mean this in any religious terms, but rather in the vein that neither robot has prior knowledge of love or adoration, apart from Wall-E's surviving betamax tape of Hello Dolly! as his primary source of inspiration. Everything else is rooted in simple curiosity, but it is amazing how far just that can develop one's character.<br/><br/>Wall-E interacts with everything he finds in a very primal manner (the source of that curiosity), slowly learning about the things he finds by essentially playing with them until something happens. EVE is the dedicated but markedly emotional counterpart to Wall-E's primal self. She performs her tasks at the expense of taking notice of Wall-E. By the time she finally catches on to Wall-E's affection, the programmed side of herself sets off their exciting journey into space.<br/><br/>Once things set into full-swing, this film does not let go of you. EVE and Wall-E are quite a dynamic duo, although not the romantic pair envisioned in Wall-E's mind for most of the film. I won't go into any further analysis here, lest I spoil the fun for anyone wishing to go see it. But I must say that the fact that we see two robots, two human creations, act as the primary humanizing force is entirely effective and what makes me love this film so much. The overall message of the film emerges from the dark outset and even darker conclusion... The ending credits are a must-view for anyone who sees the film. There is a very emotional sequence of progressions that twice put me to tears for its poignancy and in light of the beginning of the film. The way this movie ends is the same way it begins: at the core it's all about WALL-E and the things we recognize in him as inherently human: his funny personality, his compulsion toward the good, his child-like curiosity and naivety, his sense of loneliness that he tries (and fails) at anesthetizing with psychological comforts and companion place-holders.<br/><br/>On other notes, the soundtrack is Newman's definitive work in cinema. I didn't think I would say this anytime post Finding Nemo, but it really is true. EVERY bit of music supports the film's imagery and tone while also helping shape it note by note. There is not a wasted note in this film.<br/><br/>Also, the visual imagery is utterly beautiful and affecting. Skyscrapers of compacted garbage, the collections in Wall-E's trailer, the outer heavens, the POV's of EVE and Wall-E... All are fantastic. The cinematography is also top-notch. They might have used the back to foreground focus a bit much, but just the fact that they had Roger Deakins consult on their almost perfected simulation cinematography as well as Stanton's directorial 'mindprint' of the film speaks volumes for the studio. It is all found and spoken for in the final print.<br/><br/>The thing about this movie is that is able to speak so much without much dialogue. Stanton has obviously learned a great deal in how to use the visual image as powerfully as possible.<br/><br/>Verdict: Pixar gets another 10/10. They make films that speak to me in ways no other animation studio ever pulls off. The message may always be positive, but that doesn't mean the trials of Pixar characters are ever just plain and simple affairs. Stanton produced something very very special and endearing here. While the paint may be of a love story and two curious robots, he has captured nothing short of the core of our positive human nature in two inanimate objects. This is a meaningful and important film. How far can we let our lives be simplified before our own creations become more human than ourselves?"

","Well I don't even know where to begin there is so much in this one. <br/><br/>Well maybe if i say i am usually cinical and disdainful towards love stories (at least those type of love stories you see nowadays...), and i usually see them only suitable for girls who wanna cry a few tissue full, and i prefer a Shakespeare-like ending, where every major character dies or loses something (sanity, beloved one etc) over an usual corny happy ending, and then i add, that i still LOVED this masterpiece so much i myself cried in the end, and i was cheering for Wall-E to remember to Eve, to get repaired and to see them ""live happily ever after"". <br/><br/>I was browsing on a video-sharing channel some day and i stumbled upon a video where a guy says the following about Wall-E: ""I am a cinical bastard, but even that little piece of rotten, black glass i call my heart was warmed by this movie"" <br/><br/>And i don't even get started on how delicate and clever the symbolism in this animation is. Or on how sarcastic, yet true all the scenes are, which ones are featuring the humans, who became more like a senseless pigs tied to their chair in front of their computer. <br/><br/>The whole thing feels so gentle, so classy and uplifting i cant even tell. If humanity will extincts one day and some other intelligent species will find the ruins of our culture i want them to find this movie, and remember us as gentle, warm-hearted, intelligent beings, which we weren't most of the time. <br/><br/>And i am not exaggerating.

","Wall-E is the film Pixar has been working toward ever since Toy Story first tested the boundaries of computer animation. It is without a doubt the best Pixar film, if not the best computer animated feature ever made, and it ranks with the rest of Disney's classics.<br/><br/>The story is both timeless and timely. 700 years after Earth's citizens flew away from their dumpster-like planet, one robot, the dirty and old yet clever and plucky protagonist Wall-E, is still condensing the mountains of trash into nice little piles. He discovers many of the trappings of civilization, most notably an old VHS of ""Hello Dolly!"" which teaches him about true love.<br/><br/>His simple life is thrown into disarray by the arrival of another robot, Eve, sent from the humans' ship on a top secret mission. For Wall-E, it is love at first sight. But when Eve is whisked back to the spaceship, Wall-E stows away as well. Soon not only is Wall-E's courage tested, but also the humanity of all the citizens who have now become fat lazy blobs who live gliding along an easy chair.<br/><br/>To start, the film looks gorgeous. While that is something we have come to expect from computer animated films thanks to today's technology, yet again we truly see the wonders and mysteries of outer space. But the film is much more than beautiful: it is also hilarious. On one level it has many topical jokes concerning the humans on the ship. But on a higher plane the humor of the robots has the quality of silent comedy, particularly Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times (in fact, unlike most of today's very chatty animated films, there is very little dialogue). In addition, the visuals are accompanied by an excellent score by Thomas Newman (American Beauty). Songs from Hello, Dolly insterspersed in the movie also enhance the story. Finally the voices are skilfully done. The robots' sounds convey true character and emotion, and Jeff Garlingives a great performance as the main speaking role of the film, the ship's captain.<br/><br/>There is a lot more to say about this film. For one, it owes a huge debt to Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, from the musical selection to the look of the ship. The amount of plunder from Kubrick's genius would be pathetic if the film itself was not brilliant or innovative in its own right. Wall-E is an experience to be seen, to be heard, and to be felt. It is a story of timeless love and a cautionary tale of where we may be going as a species and as a planet. But above all it is a masterpiece of cinema, and a work of art you must see."

","I join the gushing majority and say this is one amazingly done, very touching and important film. <br/><br/>1. A Masterpiece of Computer Graphics & Story Telling<br/><br/>When computers were still in training pants 25 years ago, I studied, worked with and taught computer graphics. I've often watched an animated film (or live film with injected animation) with knowing appreciation at some use of or advance in computer graphics technology. <br/><br/>I have a friend who had been involved managing computer graphics projects for some of the previous Star Wars movies. We have previously discussed the ""state of the art"" and where it's going. The surprise to me in this film wasn't that they could do graphics of this quality now. It was amazement at the scope, effort, skill and creative genius I know it takes to make something so beautiful and moving.<br/><br/>Watching the film, my feelings went from astonishment at the graphics to deep empathy and feeling for the main characters. The people around me gasped and say ""wow"" just the same. You don't need experience or friends like mine to tell you that nothing else has come this close to looking so real and gorgeous, to feel so visceral and well-crafted. <br/><br/>The use of modern live-action cinematic effects is stunning beyond words. The film's reliance on the intelligence of children and adults to understand the serious thoughts and complex emotions being conveyed, well, is just simply an amazing and reassuring experience. And I thought the closing credit art (using different styles of famous artists) was very cool too.<br/><br/>2. Some Small Nitpicks: <br/><br/>Most of the time I felt I was watching an exceptionally crafted film with a tight story and a serious message about the current problems of and future prospects for Earth. An then something would happen in the film that would be, like, ""Huh? That doesn't quite make sense or follow, but it's just animation"". I found 2-3 moments where I was shifted from sobering reality to forgivable fantasy, and it was a bit jarring and distracting But these moments can be easily forgotten with the continuation of the next amazing scene.<br/><br/><ul><li>It looks like the quality (time, money, computer horse-power)spent on the main characters is much more than what was spent on depicting the humans. Heck, even the garbage get's more realistic treatment than the people. And then there is the live video of Scott Willard as the ""Executive in Chief"" talking to the planet....The styles don't mesh well for me. I appreciate the thought-line that the humans look more cartoon because of the surreal and clueless nature of their existence on the ship, as well as our inept and greedy custodianship of the planet. I can imagine that the live video is meant to help connect children with the cartoon-nature of certain government officials and the patronizing policies they always on display these days on the evening news. Maybe this is all true, but it's probably also a way to rationalize a limited budget and time schedule. The bottom-line for me that the discrepancies between the treatments didn't work that well for me.</li></ul><br/><br/>Most of the time the characters are so extremely cute and lovable, it's a complement to their creators. But sometimes the cultural cliché's and visual slapstick are a bit much. Overall, it all adds up to a very sweet and moving film, but just a little less ""shtick"" would have been fine by me.<br/><br/>Some thoughts on other reviews I've read here:<br/><br/>Is the Message Too Heavy-Handed? I don't think so. It's mainly aimed at small kids. They get it, and they take it to heart. Maybe the question should be ""is the message loud enough?"" We earthlings still don't seem to be getting the message. Last I checked, we were still busy polluting the air, water, soil and every life form on the planet...oh, and ruining our climate also. We are feeding our families and enjoying ourselves, but sorry we are each helping to destroy the planet along the way. ""Oh well. It's not like I can make a difference"". Let's just leave the problem for the kids. Good luck kids! Do you think mom and dad are making ""good choices?""<br/><br/>It's a moment of truth for us. Are we up to it? Are we truly awake yet and smelling the rising levels of toxicity in our environment? Maybe the message was said softer people would get it more?<br/><br/>Regarding those people who have posted negatively, that they couldn't connect, and even thought of walking out...everyone is absolutely entitled to their opinion and to state it. But, gosh, If this film didn't make them gasp at beauty, smile warmly, laugh knowingly...if it didn't put a lump in your throat or make an eye or two teary, then...that's just sad, and even a bit scary.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this film yet, run and see it on the big screen while you can. I think you will enjoy taking some kids. You will see them enthralled and fully-attuned to the message. It's a good thing."

","I very rarely give ten out of ten to a movie, but I have no hesitation in giving that perfect score to WALL-E. It is sublime. Not just the best animation I've seen in a long time, but simply one of the best movies I've seen in many months in terms of coherent and effective story-telling and seamless editing. It's extremely well put together. The animation is in a class of its own. My only slightly negative comment might be that clearly this isn't a movie aimed at little kids, and perhaps the marketing strategy is showing too much of the 'cute funnies' and not enough of the sheer artistry of Pixar's vision. This is not a bright, sunny view of the world where everyone lives happily ever after, but quite clearly a message movie; if you agree with the message, you will love this film.<br/><br/>Disney may own Pixar these days, but there is an artistic divide between the two production styles. If you want predictable sentimentality watch Disney. I loved Disney's older classics but some of their later offerings  with the exception of Beauty and the Beast which was very good - made me wince when I took my kids along. But in contrast I have loved every single film that Pixar have made since Toy Story in 1995, and if you want something more wry, but still possessing humour and heart, then Pixar is probably going to be your choice.<br/><br/>The story is simple enough. It's the year 2700 and the earth has become uninhabitable, not through some terrible cataclysmic event, but by a slow accumulation of suffocating junk. It's a wasteland devoid of living things. As the opening shots pan in, we see that the skyscrapers are actually tall mounds of compressed trash, and that the compressing is being done by WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter  Earth class), a small, solitary robot which keeps itself going by scavenging parts from all his clapped out siblings. WALL-E's only companion is a cockroach, and he fills in the time in his trailer home during long dust storms by watching an old video of Hello Dolly. WALL-E is an unlikely hero, rusty but trusty. I hesitate to use the word cute, endearing works better. One day he finds a single plant growing. He doesn't appreciate its significance but takes it home anyway where he squirrels it away with his other treasures such as a Rubic's Cube, a lighter and a trash can lid.<br/><br/>Then a space ship lands and EVE emerges (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator). Eve is in a whole different class to WALL-E. She can fly, he is earth bound, she is sleek, dangerous and single minded while he is bumbling and rather dowdy. They communicate with beeps and eye twitches, and WALL-E is hooked. When WALL-E gives EVE the plant he has found, she recognizes that her directive  to find evidence of photosynthesis on earth  is fulfilled and shuts down. The ship comes back to pick her up and WALL-E clings on, desperate not to lose her. Arriving at the mother ship, we find the last remaining humans (apparently all American!) who have fled the earth at the behest of the CEO of Buy N Large, a conglomerate who ended up running everything. The humans are pretty much big, obese babies, who have lost the use of their legs and are spoon fed artificial food and platitudinous slogans in equal measure. The rest of the movie involves a plot by the auto pilot to take over the ship and keep it on course away from earth, while the captain tries to take it home, aided by WALL-E and an entertaining array of quirky malfunctioning robots let loose from the repair bay.<br/><br/>Some of the best moments are to be found in WALL-E's interaction with everyday objects; a fire extinguisher for example, enables him to zip around in space in a balletic dance with EVE, he uses a lid as a hat to imitate the dancers he sees on his video screen. The humans are not presented as wicked or evil, just unthinking, and the movie ends on a positive and upbeat note, when they recover the use of their legs and return to earth to reclaim it as their home. There are nods to many classic sci-fi movies, Pixar's ubiquitous pizza truck is there near the beginning, and they are not beyond a little self criticism; there's a discarded iPod among WALL-E's accumulated junk.<br/><br/>I found myself caring far more about the animated characters in WALL-E than the supposedly human ones in many 'regular' movies. Director Andrew Stanton and everyone at Pixar deserve huge credit for this movie and I hope it is an enormous financial hit for them. I also hope it gets an Oscar nomination, not for best animated feature, but for best film."

","WALL-E is a robot left on Earth to clean it up while the human race waits in space. Despite being a robot, however, WALL-E has developed a consciousness - he is curious and innocent as a child. Of course, being what seems like the only operational robot left, he also longs for companionship (...someone besides his pet cockroach).<br/><br/>That's where EVE comes in, a robot probe sent from the humans in space to check whether or not Earth is again inhabitable. Once WALL-E sees EVE, he becomes smitten and will literally follower her anywhere on Earth... or even space.<br/><br/>One can empathize with WALL-E, as he has been alone for what seems like the greater part of 700 years, toiling away at work with nothing but the comforts of his makeshift home to give him some small pleasures and distractions in life (although his morning sluggishness is due to his depleted power, we can't help but relate with those mornings WALL-E finds hard to get out of bed). When he sees the sleek, powerful EVE, it's quite understandable that he is captivated by her.<br/><br/>EVE, on the other hand, is completely focused on work (her ""directive""). While we can see her personality come through when she enjoys the freedom of flying around upon her arrival, she is determined to fulfill her mission.<br/><br/>The real love story starts to kick in here. The scenes of WALL-E trying to gain EVE's affection are both lovable and laughable. And when WALL-E brings EVE to his home to shelter the storm, he shows EVE all of the various things he collected, much like how a child would show another companion his playthings. EVE's sense of humor comes to light, and we start to see a connection between WALL-E and EVE.<br/><br/>Still, when WALL-E shows EVE a plant he picked up, she realizes that her mission is accomplished, so she then ""hibernates"" and beacons the spaceship to pick her up. WALL-E, though, doesn't realize what she has done when she shuts herself down - he is confused, and thinking that she's solar-powered like himself, he brings her outside to the sunlight. His concern and care for her in the rainstorms shine through, and he also dresses her up in lights when he shows her the beautiful sunset she can't see.<br/><br/>When the spaceship picks up EVE, WALL-E follows suit, wanting to protect her but still not realizing what is going on. Once they dock on the AXIOM ship, WALL-E gets into more trouble, being a fish out of water.<br/><br/>EVE initially looks down on WALL-E - he's, of course, an older model who's job is just a trash compactor. Her attitudes can be seen on Earth where she initially ignores his attempts to gain her attention. Her desire to protect WALL-E arises not from love but more from a sense of noblesse oblige - even though WALL-E would follow EVE anywhere, she tries to make WALL-E understand that he has to go back to Earth alone, echoing WALL-E's interaction with his ever-present pet cockroach back on Earth.<br/><br/>When WALL-E is locked in a space capsule that is set to explode, EVE again tries to save WALL-E. Luckily, he was able to get out of the situation himself, and they meet in space. WALL-E used what he learned of a fire extinguisher on Earth (a hilarious scene) to propel him - here, we see EVE and WALL-E as equals in a beautiful dance of flight around the spaceship.<br/><br/>More and more, we see EVE start to care deeply for EVE, and it's not only because he's cute and funny but also because he is unselfish and caring. When the captain asks EVE to show recordings of her time on Earth in order to see the state the planet is in, the recording is left on, and EVE then sees the care WALL-E has taken of her during her hibernation. Also, WALL-E risks his life to protect the plant, not because he cares so much the plant but because he knows how much fulfilling her directive means to EVE. He would do anything for EVE, and, in turn, EVE starts to develop the same feelings towards WALL-E.<br/><br/>The two endure various calamity to help the spaceship return to Earth, but WALL-E becomes a casualty in the process. EVE finds replacement parts and fixes WALL-E, but he is not the same - he is only focused on his work, a reversal of roles from the beginning of the film. However, EVE holds WALL-E's hands and ""kisses"" him with a spark, and his memory awakens.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>It's just amazing to me how all of this is conveyed in the storytelling. The characters' expressions and actions are limited to their eyes and gestures of their hands, yet that seems to be more than enough for the artists of the film to express the character's emotions in a visual manner. Each robot can't but say each other's names, yet their bond comes through without any dialogue - in fact, just the tone of their voice when calling each other's names gives all of the information about their intent or feelings at that moment.<br/><br/>In any love story, it's not a trivial task to express both sides - oftentimes, unrequited love 'magically' becomes true love after a single event, when the object of the affection suddenly has their eyes opened. On the other hand, WALL-E provides the viewer with a believable love story where both characters come alive and whisk you away in their universe. It's nothing short of extraordinary.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Of course, to say that ""WALL-E"" is a perfect love story is a miscategorization, as it offers a perfect blend of comedy, action, and suspense, along with so many other interwoven messages and jewels - it's just a perfect story, period."

","In the Twentieth-Eighth Century, Earth is completely depleted and with the ecological system destroyed. The powerful corporation Buy N Large builds a huge spacecraft called Axiom and sends the entire civilization for a five-year cruise while trash collector robots called WALL-E (Waste Allocator Load Lifter  Earth) would clean the planet. However, the equipment fail and seven-hundred year later, only a single robot WALL-E is performing his duty. His only companion is a cockroach and his great entertainment is watching an old ""Hello Dolly"" videotape. When a spaceship lands on Earth out of the blue and leaves the probe Eve, WALL-E follows her and falls in love for Eve. After a hostile initial contact, the dangerous Eve gets close to WALL-E and he gives a small plant to her. Eve gets the plant and automatically sends a signal to the spaceship that returns and takes Eve back. However, the desperate WALL-E grabs on the hull and travels through the space chasing Eve until they reach Axiom and find a full automated facility crowded by lazy and fat human beings unable even of walking with their legs. The expectation of life on Earth brings hope to the Captain against the will and prime direction of the auto-pilot that organizes a mutiny on board.<br/><br/>""WALL-E"" is one of the best animations I have ever seen, with adorable characters and a deep story, showing a possible scenario of the depletion of our planet caused by the lack of concern from the big corporations with the environment. In addition, there is the beautiful love story of WALL-E, the importance of small and forgotten things; a great nostalgia of the old times among many other message. The story is very well developed in spite of having very few dialogs. My vote is ten.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""WALL-E"""

","I went in to this movie with very high expectations, having anticipated it since I saw the first previews. Pixar blew me through the roof. From the opening star-scape with ""Put on Your Sunday Clothes"" playing cheerily in the background, to the closing credits, this movie is in an utter masterpiece. There's never a dull moment in this beautiful film. The audience is taken through such a vast range of emotions, ranging from the pure joy of discovery, to the near-hopeless sense of defeat. Director Andrew Stanton has done it again, adding WALL-E on top of his previous Pixar success, Finding Nemo. Nemo was originally my favorite Pixar film. But then along came this little robot, who tore my heartstrings clear out of my chest and took his rightful place at the top of my favorite films list."
"tedg","Null","17","27","2 July 2008"," The Certainty of Seeing
","You can read elsewhere the ordinary stuff  about how wonderful this is; about how it exploits cinematic characterization, and even how conservative bloggers have decided to criticize it supposedly leftist premise. (Jees)<br/><br/>I did enjoy it. Its an amazing experience. But while watching it, I also was admiring the minds behind it. <br/><br/>There are sometimes intelligent movies being made, and a surprising number of them are from Hollywood. I believe though that in most cases, it is because there is a critical mass of intelligent writers, filmmakers and decisionmakers that are working at the fringe of the establishment. Not so with Pixar. I've been constantly surprised at each project how they encapsulate essays in the advance of the cinematic vocabulary.<br/><br/>Its a bit like French new wave films made by film theorists, the films being more about what can be done than doing it in the service of effect that matters. (Their retort would be that it DOES matter if it changes the vehicle.)<br/><br/>But this Pixar business is a different model. Folks can come and be entertained without having to dip into vats of self-reference. Oh, there's plenty of superficial self-reference, but its all in the service of jokes, and they are all in the service of the narrative.<br/><br/>But other folks  like me and perhaps you  can also see that they are doing a few things that no one else is in quite the same advanced way, and they mark them so that you can read it as a sort of metanarrative. Jobs does the same thing with Apple. They make products that people use and like. But they also are in the business of defining what it is to be cool. They manufacture cool like they manufacture electronic products. You get both, and even in the products there's a reference to leadership, because being cool is all in who defines cool.<br/><br/>So when I saw this, I saw self-conscious art, and stories about the future of cinema. We've always gotten that with Pixar. Usually, it has to do with space, and what you can do with this new medium that is impossible with ""real"" cameras and places.<br/><br/>This last movie, ""Ratatouie"" added in the notion of control. Pulling the strings. I'm sure many have noticed that the shorts that Pixar creates to play before these features are a sort of synopsis of the reflective ideas they will use in the film. Last time the short and film were about control at a distance, with both the puppetmaster and puppet being featured, but the star was the puppetmaster. You can almost see how the whole story could have been generated by this idea: chef, French (who claim to have invented folded cinema of the reflexive kind), and rat. Secret recipes. Love always.<br/><br/>This time around, the cinematic sensibilities are profoundly deeper. A deep certainty. You have to know about 2001 as a start. Kubric's interest there was the warring narrator. Whose world is telling the story, man, machine or god. There is a story, but it hardly matters. Its all about who is telling the story, whose chair you sit in as the viewer. Its a masterful work.<br/><br/>Here, its bent only a little: mankind, machine and nature, but its folded back on the story  which here has effect. Wall-e is natural, machine in form, but more human than the humans we see. But watch how they fold it again. Its a movie about the truth in movies, how the power of cinema can reach into the real world. A handholding there and here is a handhold between the worlds. <br/><br/>And also watch how they built movies in. This isn't accidental. When they put a movie within a movie like this, the intent is to have the watcher of the outer movie join the world of the watcher of the inner movie. Its a reliable trick to get us to invest in what we see. But they go further. When we see the humans  who are supposed to be like us but clearly aren't  we note that THEY are hypnotized by the movies in front of them and cannot see the larger world beyond, and we can.<br/><br/>It happens to also spill over into the great narrative about how some of us can see that the planet is being destroyed and other blithely putter on. That business about saving image- laden artifacts as a memory storehouse... All these layers  yes they are engineered by what is now the most intelligent and adventuresome narrative engineering lab in a studio.<br/><br/>All this extra introspection is used not as dry thesis, but in the service of the love story. It made it deeper, and more true. Knowing makes love true. So yes, it is effective, and fun, and deep.To compensate, the camera and space manipulation is less radical than usual.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

","No problem! Finally an animated movie that dares to be.... animated! Pixar has set a new standard in digital animation. I say digital, because I'd still like to see more traditional hand drawn films. You don't need recognizable voices coming out of animals that resemble them. You don't need cheesy jokes or failed one liners. No musical cues to band either. I don't think I'll be able to watch a computer animated movie for a long time, I'll compare to this for a while. Pixar was not in this for the cheap quick cash in, they made a movie, that I think, will stand the test of time. I can tell people will be watching this for years and years, like Fantasia."
"TOMNEL","10","18","31","27 June 2008"," The most charming cartoon I've ever seen. Nearly perfect in every way!
","My favorite animated movie was, and still is The Nightmare Before Christmas, but Wall-E comes in at close second. Pixar outdid themselves in every possible way, and it seems that though they've done that with each of their films, this one stands above the others. It's cute, without those lame sappy moments that cause you to uncomfortably stare at the floor. It's emotional, with some scenes even leaving a lump in my throat. The animation is amazing and the story is both inventive and original (for the most part). Wall-E is the quintessential Pixar film...no, it's the quintessential animated movie.<br/><br/>Wall-E (or Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth class) is a lonely robot on futuristic Earth. The year is around 2800 and all the humans have ""temporarily"" been taken off of Earth into a space cruise where they are awaiting Earth to be cleaned up. Wall-E's only friend is a cockroach, and he lives in a little storage shelter where he keeps interesting items he finds in the trash he compacts. One day a spaceship drops off another robot, this one named EVE. Her mission is to find plant life on Earth, which would signal that the humans can return. Wall-E is fascinated by EVE, and more than anything just wants to hold her hand, like in his favorite musical, Hello Dolly. EVE sees a plant that Wall-E had previously found, and they both end up being taken up into space on the space cruise ship. All the humans on board have lost track of reality, don't walk or do any exercise, and they are all morbidly obese. Wall-E and EVE end up having to save the plant life they brought up to show to the ship's captain so they can go back to Earth, but the ship computer doesn't like that idea.<br/><br/>I have no critiques for this film. As I've said, this is about as close to perfect as you can come, I'll just explain what I really liked. I enjoyed the romance between Wall-E and EVE, which was so sweet, sort of sad at times, and more real than the typical teen comedy romance. The human characters were great. Jeff Garlin plays the ship captain and does an excellent job. One of the best scenes in the movie has the captain studying up on Earth wide eyed, learning all the things humans (now adays) have known since we were infants. John Ratzenberger and Kathy Najimy voice two humans who face reality before the others and get off their fat rears to have some fun and take a moment to notice the stars. The animation is the best Pixar's ever done, and even with the cartoonish designs of the characters, sometimes I'd forget I was watching a cartoon. Wall-E, as a character, was an amazing lead. Amazing in that he carried the movie flawlessly, and made me truly feel for the poor guy, and amazing in that the only thing that he says in the movie, along with some grunts and squeals, is ""EVE-a!"". I have no clue how Pixar molds these likable characters, but they did a fantastic job. I'd see it 10 more times in the theaters, and I hope it makes a billion at the box office.<br/><br/>Pixar's done it again! They hit gold, more so than any of their other pictures, and Wall-E ranks up there with one of the best animated pictures of all time. It was the first film in months to leave me 100% satisfied. I loved it! <br/><br/>My rating: **** out of ****. 100 mins. Rated G."

","Boy, the visuals were as stunning as I had read they were; absolutely spectacular. I hate to use this cliché, but this is a ""must"" for Blu-Ray fans. You have to see - and hear - this film in HD because it is a great treat for your senses. The surround sounds are everywhere while the colors and artwork are something to behold! And, yes - it's still very pretty on a regular DVD, too.<br/><br/>The story is ""cute,"" but nowhere near the visuals and audio. It's okay, subtlety humorous, dramatic and romantic parts. It gets a tiny bit preachy with the usual environmental digs and a comment about how fat we humans can get by lying around too much, but otherwise just plays it for comedy and cool-looking characters. Everyone and everything in this film is pretty amazing-looking.<br/><br/>It's kind of a strange story, with much of it taking place on a big space ship. My favorite parts were in the beginning on Earth with the little robot WALL-E and his cockroach friend.<br/><br/>There is so much to see in this film, it makes multiple viewings all the more attractive but, I'll assume, you're always going to catch some things you didn't see the first few times. Overall, not a super story but yet an amazing film, one that is one you want to show off your Blu-Ray DVD player to friends. This sets yet another new standard in animation."

","The stunning virtual world of Wall.E shows Pixar at the top of their creative graphic powers. Going over the beautiful CGI in my head, I'm still in awe of how the designers portrayed Wall.E's integrated world and their attention to detail will serve as a benchmark for years. That said, I'm less impressed by the simple and very predictable plot. Pixar/Disney married state-of-the-art visuals with a worn plot line from an early childhood fairy tale. I'm guessing the target audience for this movie is somewhere around 6th graders. Great summer family fare but not a great movie if you want something more substantial in terms of plot and character development."

","I just returned from a midnight showing of WALL-E, and all I can say is 'amazing'. Pixar have clearly outdone themselves, producing what is sure to be one of their best films ever. All the characters have personality, and there are no throwaway characters. Every character that is introduced in the story has their own unique personality, and it really shows how hard Pixar worked on the movie.<br/><br/>The movie serves as both a sci-fi futuristic love comedy, and also a warning to humanity. We've got to take care of our planet now, because as charming as the movie was, I personally would not like to see those events transpire here, 700 years in the future or any other time.<br/><br/>I would give this movie an 11 if I could. It is an absolutely brilliant piece of cinema and one that should not be missed. If you're a parent, take your kids. Even if you don't have kids, go see this movie, it's fun and lighthearted and will make you laugh out loud several times over.<br/><br/>A+ Pixar, I can't wait to see what they cock up next."
"rogerdarlington","Null","8","12","9 March 2009"," Destined to be a classic
","The odd title is actually an acronym: Waste Allocation Lift Loader, Earth-Class. This little robot unit is the last of a series originally intended to clean up a massively polluted Earth while humankind left the planet for a temporary five years which, after the failure of the project, has resulted in an absence of 700 years. The pacing and atmosphere of the movie would be remarkable for any work, let alone one of animation, with a long opening scene with little action and no dialogue. Even when another robot EVE arrives from outer space and a technical romance ensues, the dialogue is minimalist but the action accelerates at a exciting and satisfying pace.<br/><br/>Pixar have here given us outstanding work and Andrew Stanton, who conceived the story and directed the film, deserves special praise. The film is entertaining with action, humour and great visuals, but its is also subtly instructive with clear messages about the damage to the planet and to our bodies from our adoration of consumerism, making it appealing to children and adults alike. Many science fiction classics - from ""2001"" to ""Silent Running"" - are referenced, but the treatment is so original that ""WALL·E"" itself is destined to be a classic."

","My reaction to the early TV trailers for WALL-E was ""ok, another Pixar movie. No biggie."" Consider, though I've seen almost every Pixar movie (girlfriend renting them on DVD) my reactions ranged from ""mildly amused"" to ""cute, but mostly CGI eye-candy"". Of course, as a thirty-something male, I never assumed Pixar movies were targeted to my demographic in the first place. ""Pixar is for kids"", after all, right? Then one day a 5-minute sneak peak was shown on TV featuring WALL-E and Eve (scene where he gets stuck in space capsule with plant). During those 5 minutes, the essence of WALL-E's character took hold and never let go. My girlfriend and I decided we wouldn't be able to wait any longer than opening day to see it. Embarrassing to admit, but I go the theater twice in a year at most, and yet I actually bought our WALL-E tickets 2 weeks in advance.<br/><br/>Having seen the movie today, he's honestly no less than the most adorable and brilliant animated character of all time. His personality and mannerisms spread themselves like sunlight - turning even the coldest of hearts to liquid, and bursting preconceptions to dust. Until now, no character (fictional or otherwise) ever managed to awaken the kid in me with the old notion ""I wish this character was real so I could take it home with me"". <br/><br/>The way this movie ends is the same way it begins: at the core it's all about WALL-E and the things we recognize in him as inherently human: his funny personality, his compulsion toward the good, his child-like curiosity and naivety, his sense of loneliness that he tries (and fails) at anesthetizing with psychological comforts and companion place-holders. All of the film's characters other than WALL-E are really just props, like arrows pointing your attention back at him, and always when it's the last thing he would want. His plant also seems symbolic of him (and that will make sense after you've seen the movie).<br/><br/>All that aside, the graphics are brilliant, especially the WALL-E character, in that it looks like a real physical robot shot on film. Great care was taken on subtleties like focus/defocus and depth perception to make him look real-world, all *within* a real-world (especially the scenes during which he's alone on earth).<br/><br/>I wish it would've been longer, but only because like all great rides, it went by fast and eventually had to have an end. Can't wait to see it again."
"jfrorie","8","28","55","25 June 2008"," Wall-E is A-dorable
","I saw Wall-E at a special sneak preview. I'm not a Pixar fanboy. I've enjoyed a number of their movies, but this is first I've seen at the theater.<br/><br/>Wall*e was an enjoyable diversion. The titular character is robot that has spent his many days performing his task in isolation. All the other robots have worn out over time. Wall*e is different in that he is a survivor. In the many years he has worked, he has evolved a sense of self. Unfortunately, that involves a feeling of loneliness. After a significant event, it is resolving this loneliness that becomes his quest.<br/><br/>The stars of the shows are the various robots. Their emotions are inferred through their actions, grunts, clicks and the occasional verbalization. This however is not a limitation. Pixar has created characters you care about. Wall*e is a hero in the tradition of Danny Kaye. He is a simple guy with simple ambitions that just happen to coincide with the events in the movie. He isn't glory seeking, he just wants companionship in the sappiest Disney tradition. It is this purity of soul that is his most endearing quality.<br/><br/>This more of a kid's film that past Pixar efforts and the hand of Disney is firmly felt. There are sweeping scenes that designed to evoke adolescent dreams and emotions. That is not to say adults won't find it enjoyable. Pixar takes shot at a couple of themes; Consumerism, the environment, even some mild political humor. There are even a couple of gags relating to cockroaches and Twinkies which have oft been repeated. However, it lacks some of the sly adult wit that some of the previous films had.<br/><br/>There little highbrow comedy here. Most of the gags come from slapstick pratfalls and such. However, the gags are executed with such precision, and the characters are so compelling that they were very effective. The rest of the humor consists of sight gags. Most not rising to the point past a chuckle, but taken as whole weaves a rich tapestry of the world that Wall-E lives in.<br/><br/>Adults will find it enjoyable. Kids will love it beyond words and you're going to have to buy them Wall-E dolls for Christmas."
"Buddy-51","8","13","23","10 July 2008"," visually astonishing but somewhat lacking in drama
","""Wall-E,"" the latest offering from the movie-making geniuses at Pixar Studios, is a certifiable visual masterpiece that provides an endlessly inventive vision of what life might be like in the 29th Century - although, come to think of it, the term ""life"" may be something of a misnomer, for in ""Wall-E""'s post-apocalyptic image of the future, Earth has been rendered uninhabitable by pollution and garbage that have risen to toxic levels. The humans have long since fled to a high-tech way station located somewhere out in the far reaches of outer space, leaving the planet virtually deserted except for a sweet trash-compressing robot named Wall-E and his indestructible cockroach sidekick. Like all good little robots, Wall-E tirelessly performs the one function he has been programmed to carry out, even after the reason for that task no longer exists. Thus, he spends his days dutifully collecting all the litter generously strewn about the deserted city and converting it into skyscraper-high mounds of compacted trash. At night, he wiles away the hours watching an old videotape of ""Hello Dolly"" and pining away for a female companion who will alleviate his loneliness and bring some meaning to his life. Then, one fine day, his dream becomes a reality when a sleek, sexy little number named Eve - actually an environmental robot sent from the way station to see if any signs of life have returned to the planet - shows up unexpectedly in Wall-E's neighborhood.<br/><br/>The early section of the movie, in which Wall-E wordlessly goes about his business against a haunting backdrop of a decaying infrastructure and heaps of garbage, has much of the delicate beauty and sense of wonder we find in the opening moments of ""E.T."" (whose main character obviously served as the model for Wall-E). Written and directed by Andrew Stanton and brought to life by an army of miracle-working animators too numerous to mention, ""Wall-E"" is one of those rare films that, through sheer visual design alone, is able to magically transport us to the unique little world it's created. The burgeoning romance between the two mechanical creatures is handled with a great deal of tenderness and wit, and the film is sprinkled with subtle little homages to ""West Side Story"" (in the aerial views of the city), ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Titanic"" for the more cinematically astute among us to revel and delight in. In the second half of the movie, ""Wall-E"" travels to the spaceship housing the colony of ex-patriot earthlings, where he encounters problems with a sophisticated computer who wants to control the humans and prevent them from returning to a planet that just may be becoming inhabitable once again.<br/><br/>This is a sweet and wistful fable about not only how each individual must find his own special place in the universe but how we as a species must cherish and preserve this one special place we all call home. Yet, for all its rare and wonderful qualities, I wish I could say that I loved this movie more than I do. For like some of Pixar's other products, ""Wall-E"" is more impressive in its visuals than in its storytelling. Too often in ""Wall-E"" we feel as if the narrative is lagging a few paces behind all the technical ingenuity. Indescribably beautiful as it is to look at, the movie doesn't generate sufficient conflict and drama to pull us all the way into the story. And for that reason, ""Wall-E,"" while a true cornucopia of visual delights and easily one of the most spectacular-LOOKING films ever made, still falls just a hairsbreadth short of greatness when all is said and done."

","I was ready to be wowed by this film and the first 20 minutes or so were ecstatic for me. Sometimes I think there's no comparison between Japanese anime and the stuff Hollywood puts out, but this was clearly inspired and ingenious film making that can hold its own against Japan's best. But then the film has trouble dealing with the problems it poses, not unlike how we're failing to deal with the REAL problems of over consumption and the mindless accumulation of waste that it alludes to. The setting changes and the story takes a rather depressing turn into frenetic activity that made me anxious to see it over. It's not that the film's point is misguided or even over sold. It's just that it's a different issue and not necessarily a consequence of the first more successfully contrived part. That second issue is our becoming overly serviced by robots in a blind pursuit of entertainment and sensation. Still, the creation of a robot with a completely engaging personality is so brilliant and indelible that no one should miss this somewhat mixed film. Clearly the people who made this have their head's on straight and have a better vision of what could result from our culture than some of our most highly respected leaders."
"theskulI42","9","9","15","20 July 2008"," Glorious animation with heart outclasses everything this year.
","From Curious George to E.T. and right on down to the present day, cinema-goers have always had a strong affinity towards, for lack of a better term, ""curious little critters"", small animals, aliens or other beings who are simultaneously inquisitive and clueless about the ways of Earth, and are preferably also quite clumsy, and Wall-E, as a character and as a movie, delivers in spades. Taking a pratfall as effortlessly as Keaton, and doing a terrified double take better than the most racist of cinema servitude, the sentient being, whose job it is to pick up and compact trash on a desolate future Earth, is equally fascinated by the inner workings of lightbulbs, Twinkies, garbage can lids and iPods, but can't seem to cover his head, as countless manner of things continually seem to be crashing down upon it. This mundane existence is shattered by a mysterious craft that deploys a scanning probe, another sentient being, this time with an infectious giggle and an itchy trigger finger, named Eve.<br/><br/>Pixar has an uncanny knack for turning familiarity into universiality. Case in point: the love story presented in ""WALL-E"" is a story that doesn't take a single turn that hasn't been preordained by 80 years of cinema history, but Pixar still manages to turn it on its ear: The love story here is between robots, and our protagonists, despite only having model numbers and call signs for names, and literally knowing four words between them (two, discounting their own names), are more human than any couple seen on the silver screen in some time, and when life and responsibility intervene, there's a sense of heartbreak and loss seldom possible with flesh and blood.<br/><br/>The second act takes us as far in the other direction as possible, as Eve is picked back up by her ship, and Wall-E hitches a ride on the side, desperate for his only love. The scenes of travel here function as both a sort of montage, a transition between acts, but also serve to provide the audience with what may be the most awe-inspiring presentation of space seen since ""2001"", which also gets an immediately recognizable character nod that could work as a gap to that film when they're older. What he finds when the ship arrives is a completely autonomous society, co-existing between morbidly obese humans on floating chairs, no longer required to do anything of effort, even communicating on viewscreens directly across from each other, coexisting with all manner of robotic denizens, who have far more of the human experience than their living counterparts, including frustrated custodians, tough-as-nails security officers and even a mental health ward.<br/><br/>I won't take the time to explain the particulars of the humans' situation, or any more of the plot, because part of the fun is exploring for yourself. Pixar has never been one to skimp on the details, and every inch of the screen is filled with glorious colors, wondrous intricacies and charming touches that just add to the amazing glory unfolding before you. The fact that you know what's going to happen is less of a detriment and more of a comfort, much like watching a old video of your favorite sports' team's greatest triumph: You may know all the ups and down, but on screen, it's always happening for the first time, and damnit, it feels that way too, a testament to the skill, expertise and above all HEART, something Pixar has always seemed to possess just a little bit more of than everybody else, like they discovered some hidden secret on how to entertain everybody, to transcend labels like ""children's movie"", ""animated movie"" or even ""family movie"", to where all you have to say is ""Pixar"", and the inference is there: You're going to love it, and Pixar has stepped up to say, ""Don't give up on 2008 just yet."" As for ""WALL-E"", the message is clear: All you need is love (All together now!). All you need is love (Everybody!). All you need is love, love...<br/><br/>Love is all you need.<br/><br/>{Grade: 9.5/10 (A) / #1 (of 53) of 2008 / #187 of all time}"

","Many are complaining about the hypocritical message that Disney/Pixar is offering by making a movie about the evils of commercialism and capitalism and then marketing it and its products. On that point they've missed the mark because it's not about the evils of commercialism and capitalism, it's about gluttony and what can happen when you stop paying attention. I think the movie itself is a representation of this, don't get distracted by Wall-E's charm, Eve's streamlined features, and the ever mesmerizing animation. Instead pause and remember the film is trying to offer you something besides entertainment. If you just sit there and let the film wash over you, you've only had a pleasurable experience (not unlike a smooth hover chair ride). But if you engage with Wall-E, Eve, the captain and their struggles you can take away more from the theatre, you'll need to get out of your hover chair to do it though and actually take a good look at the stars outside. <br/><br/>Secondly environmentalism, capitalism, commercialism, monopolies, and so forth were not the only topics addressed in this film. I felt undercurrents of both self-discovery and appreciation for others uniqueness. Wall-E apparently already wasn't quite like other robots. He's curious, inventive, and protective. However Wall-E doesn't learn what he's really made of until he takes his journey into space to ""save"" Eve. There he proves that he's not only loyal and creative but also courageous, tenacious, and friendly. This rounds out his character as a hero and one that changes over the course of the story even though he was designed with a single purpose. <br/><br/>Eve is purposeful, career-oriented, and a little bit dangerous. She does her job well and defines herself by her directives. Through her journey she expands her programming by learning what friends can and will do for one another. She learns other things are sometimes more important than carry out your duties. No more clearly does she learn this lesson then at the end of the film when the Wall-Eness of Wall-E seems to have disappeared. I feel this is also the point in the film that drives home the message of self-discovery and individuality. Without that certain spark, Wall-E is just like all the other Wall-Es around him. <br/><br/>Finally there is the captain. No one knows how he got his position on the ship but however it happened his position merely has the illusion of power. From the trailers I thought the captain was going to be the villain of the story, but he is a good guy and he too goes on a journey of growth and exploration. It seems he is just like the other humans, but instead he proves himself to be capable of bettering himself through self-starting education and changing the way he functions on a daily basis. Though he remains somewhat a bumbling character throughout the film he does the right thing and passes his newfound knowledge and hope onto the other humans. <br/><br/>On that note stick around until the credits start scrolling on black. The story doesn't end when the computer animation does. This story was told mostly without words so when the other sound effects leave the screen don't assume the message ends. At that point the purest form of film is left: story through images. I think the negative reviewers forgot that too."
"paulo20","4","29","61","30 November 2008"," Great animation (as ever) but lacks a compelling story
","Nothing much to say, really, about the animation. PIXAR steps it up another notch. Simply stunning, which is par for the course for PIXAR. I gave the film six stars and at least five of them go to the visuals.<br/><br/>However, the story didn't really match those visuals. And the two robot leads were cute, I'll grant, but not much more than that.<br/><br/>SPOILERS FOLLOW.<br/><br/>Basically, humans created the mess that made it necessary for them to leave the planet. And we're supposed to root for them to come back? I'm sorry, I just don't get it. It's not a strong enough reason for me to root for the protagonists. And the antagonists are, likewise, not compelling enough, with no real apparent motivation for keeping the humans from re-inhabiting earth, unless it's to protect the earth from humans overloading the world with trash again, in which case, I'm not sure we shouldn't have rooted for them instead.<br/><br/>And what about the other species? We see fish in the end credits. Presumably, the planet was okay for them and other species? The movie doesn't really go into that, unless I missed something.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, while the humans were away, they came to rely on being carted around on hover-chairs. As the film explains, this leads to some bone loss. And their ability to walk has apparently atrophied over the centuries. Only it hasn't, as we see the uniformly obese humans learn to walk again, much like overgrown infants learn to walk. Perhaps this is meant to be symbolic, but it doesn't make a lot of logical sense.<br/><br/>Finally, I'm not sure why a live action Fred Willard was used, but this is a minor point. Given the rest of the movie, I find that I really don't care. I just find it a little odd."
"whatever_123","10","8","13","2 October 2009"," Thank you, Pixar!!
","DO NOT listen to those who say this is a bad movie because there's hardly any dialog. Everything in this movie is so perfect, it doesn't NEED dialog!! The animation was so REAL. Everything was perfect!! The landscapes were beautiful, the technology was creative, smooth, and incredibly flawless, the robots were great! I thought it was interesting how real humans were used in small parts of the movie, and the humans in the future were animated, shown as really large, lazy people we may become in the future, if we're not careful. As soon as the movie started, I fell in love with Wall-e. He was possible the most adorable thing I have ever seen! His character was so deep, you could forget he's not human. Wall-e has the biggest heart of any of the characters I've seen. You have to be insane to not love Wall-e. I really enjoyed seeing the chemistry develop between EVE and Wall-e. They are so different, EVE being a fast, powerful, advanced robot, and Wall-e being a sweet, simple, rusty little trash-compacting robot, and they work together PERFECTLY!!! They are the cutest couple in Pixar history. The messages in the story were very well-presented. It showed what could happen to our planet if we trashed it and took it for granted and what could happen if we all get too lazy. The perfect combination of humor, CGI, heart, and lessons to be learned, this is truly a Pixar triumph."
"KissEnglishPasto","8","6","9","2 August 2016"," Pixar Hits a Home Run with Wall-E...They Just Didn't Hit It Out of the Park!
","..........................................................from Pasto,Colombia...Via: L.A. CA., CALI, COLOMBIA.....and ORLANDO, FL <br/><br/>Shame on me for ignoring my own rule of thumb and slurping up so many of the gushing reviews for Wall-E. My expectation was somewhere around Pluto, but this only managed to take me to Saturn. Normally, Saturn would warrant a rave review, but not when a film falls somewhat short of that ever-so-high bar you've set for it! Don't get me wrong. Pixar has hit a home run with Wall-E. They just did not hit one out of the park, as so many others would have you believe.<br/><br/>The movie really does work on just about every imaginable level. The Pixar animation team most certainly outdid themselves, taking CGI to an impressive and breathtakingly realistic new level for 2008. Wall-E is, at times thought-provoking, ironic, laugh-out-loud funny, poignant, entertaining, and perhaps, somewhat romantic. Yes, all of this with a highly original story line and offbeat musical accompaniment. Those elements which are borrowed from other movies are at least incorporated with a fresh twist.<br/><br/>Wall-E most definitely has its shortcomings: A little over the top at times in the ""Gee, aren't we just the cutest on screen Bots you've ever seen?"" Department. There are also a couple occasions where the substitution of dialog for assorted sound effects becomes a bit tedious.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the movie is very low key as regards the results of long term ravaging of the environment, not at all in-your-face as so often is the case with movies made in the recent years. Taken as a whole, though, Wall-E deserves between 8 and 8 1/2*. In any case, please, simply put aside the reviews and just watch Wall-E, hopefully, leaving your expectations behind. You'll probably have a very enjoyable and entertaining 90 minutes.<br/><br/>8* STARS*...ENJOY/DISFRUTELA! <br/><br/>Any comments, questions or observations, in English or Español, are most welcome!"
"darren_wall_2001","6","13","24","21 July 2008"," I must have been tired
","Watched Wall-E this weekend with my five year old son, an avid movie watcher. With all the hype it is hard not to go into this movie with high expectations. Yet after the first half hour of the film I did feel this was not living up to these high hopes. For me, I love the work of Brad Bird, I think it's physical and very human and clicks along at a fair pace, and although they don't make you think deeper about your life, you still have a great time watching them. As with all Pixar movies the visual work is excellent and earthy tones used on Earth are beautiful. The problem really is with the pacing and the pretty obvious plot of the story. Even my son half way through asked how long to go, and this seemed to be the general state of many of the children in the audience. I don't want to add spoilers because you're figure it out pretty quickly anyway. For me this is a date movie or even a 'chick flick' so beware parents it may be a bumpy ride. But I could have been tired!"
"dforster","3","74","177","10 July 2008"," I am at odds with majority of IMDb audience
","I decided to add my voice because this film is highly rated and I have never found myself at such odds with the majority of the IMDb audience.<br/><br/>Spoiler at end.<br/><br/>I read enough to see that I have nothing to add concerning its technical achievement, obviously well done.<br/><br/>I am an avid science fiction fan (books and film) so I agree with those who find this story weak. I went because I wanted to know why this film was so highly rated across all the demographic areas although I had my doubts based on the preview.<br/><br/>Apparently many do not agree with me but I would like to caution others that if you look forward to thought provoking ideas and having your preconceived notions challenged you will be disappointed. Even younger audiences may become bored after 1/2 hour although the visual stimulation may be sufficient.<br/><br/>My background includes special effects in film and computer program development so I naturally appreciate the films technical prowess. But I also know well almost all the science fiction films made to date including those with serious as well as comic presentations and WALL-E does not rate well for me when compared to them.<br/><br/>WALL_E missed being sufficiently provocative or amusing so I found it bland. The film, however, was much better portraying the emotional connections between the two main characters which is quite an achievement considering WALL-E was a garbage disposal unit who apparently developed over a long period of time a more than human heart (think of your feelings for roaches).<br/><br/>Spoiler follows: The ideas of planet ruin via garbage and humans becoming fat, technologically catered to, isolated in space, and thus unmotivated beings after 700 years is interesting but each of these is not original and I, at this time, cannot clearly describe why the film failed to engage me. Perhaps with such a future there should be more angst."
"tieman64","Null","11","20","9 April 2012"," Like a stop-smoking ad starring Joe Camel
","When Pixar's not sucking on the Disney Empire's sinister teat or filling landfills with discarded kitsch packaged in slow-to-biodegrade plastic and made by suicidal kids in China at environment destroying mega-factories...they're making eco-cautionary, anti corporatist films. In this regard we had the clean energy advocating ""Monster's Inc"" and ""Cars 2"", and the eco-loving, anti-consumerist, anti-corporate ""WALL-E"". Pixar's other films have a stranger tension, ""Cars"" decrying urban sprawl, gas guzzlers and life in the fast-lane by celebrating retro-cars, speedy races and old-school, ""good"", ""small town capitalism"", whilst the ""Toy Story"" movies yearn for the tactile, nostalgic pleasures of solid-state toys even as Pixar's dependence on pixels, processors and Pentiums pulverises whatever pull pre-digital entertainment ever had. Want to play with Mr Potato Head, honey? Screw that, Mom. Hit me some X-box. Now! Disney once performed a similar magic trick, making billions off public domain material whilst militantly copyrighting the same material (Disney lobbies were behind the drive to extend copyrights to a full century), aggressively suing everyone from the Academy Awards to daycare centres who dared place Snow Whites and Quasimodos in classrooms or playgrounds.<br/><br/>Directed by Andrew Stanton, ""WALL-E"" revolves around a cute robot called WALL-E. He's (why do we assume WALL-E's male?) a cross between ET and ""Short Circuit's"" Johnny 5, with big robot eyes and a perpetually sad, puppy-dog look. When he's not mimicking old Chaplin, Keaton and Harold Lloyd routines, WALL-E's patrolling a now derelict planet Earth, stacking garbage, junk and dutifully doing his best to repair a polluted planet. Enter EVE, an apparently female robot who has been sent to Earth to scan for vegetation. While WALL-E resembles an old VHS system, EVE's a cross between a tampon and an Ipod, all sleek enamel, digital readouts and laser beams. The duo embark on an adventure which teaches us about the fragility and strengths of our ecosystem and condemns mega-corporations/branding/advertising/rampant-consumerism (shades of the sci-fi eco-parable ""Silent Running""), before launching into a second half which takes place upon the Axiom (literally, ""the worthy few""), a spaceship where fat, lazy humans are doted on by machines.<br/><br/>The film's best moments occur in its first, Earth-bound quarter. Here our robots share a courtship that evokes Chaplin's ""Little Tramp"", ""Modern Times"", Virginia Cherrill's blind flower girl in ""City Lights"" and the love affair in Keaton's ""The General"". This section is also quite melancholic, WALL-E a lonely outcast thanklessly tasked with cleaning up humanity's mess. We feel for him. He's also a bit like Neville of Matheson's ""I am Legend"" (pet cockroach instead of dog), barricading himself in his bunker each night in an effort to escape sandstorms.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the film quickly becomes Pixar's most saccharine, manipulative, contrived, obvious and heavy handed. Cheap death scenes are frequently rolled out to elicit tears (WALL-E keeps dying and his cockroach keeps getting squashed), WALL-E's big sad eyes are relentlessly milked, and the film's ""GARGANTUAN EMOTIONAL MOMENTS"" are mostly all forced and obvious. Throw in a generic ""red button"", ""ticking clock"", ""countdown to explosion"" finale, a series of second-rate action scenes (and obligatory ""poetic flying scenes""), last-minute villains (""2001's"" HAL meets ""Flight of the Navigator's"" Max), weak comedy, corny characters and you have one of Pixar's worst. The film also struggles to cook up interesting visuals and virtual sets, its aesthetics becoming conventional as soon as the film launches into outer space. Stanton's previous Pixar effort (""Finding Nemo"") kept its two sections – expansive ocean reefs and claustrophobic urban fish tanks – much more fresh. With ""WALL-E"" you've seen it all before.<br/><br/>""WALL-E's"" message is all over the place, which upon release resulted in it being embraced by both American liberals (hug a tree!) and conservatives (pro free-market, anti big government). Regardless, the film has little real world bearing. Historically, machines increase work, obesity is linked to social class (ie, the poor, not the indolent) and in the real world consumerism/fatties are bolstered not by machines but skinny slave labour abroad. In this way ""WALL-E's"" a very white, middle class, American-centric film: it's an appeal to stop consuming and start recycling rather than a look into the reasons for and futility of both. Bizarrely, the film's ""anti-consumerism"" but fetishizes retro objects - silent films, Zippo lighters, plastic forks, hubcaps, Rubik's cubes, nuts, bolts and bits of treasure - treasure which WALL-E identifies as being representative of humanity. For WALL-E (cool: he's more a historian than garbage-bot), objects have souls, which is capitalist nostalgia axenic.<br/><br/>Like most ""environmental films"", ""WALL'E's"" aching for a pure, untouched, unpolluted, pre-globalisation, pre-digital past. A return to the wilderness (see ""Survivors of the Dead""). And like these films (""Avatar"" etc), it wrongly turns ""environmentalism"" into a personal choice. But people are mostly frugal and it is systems, not people, which make society ""happen"". It is not your fault you're inundated with packaging, spam and products with short life-spans. Rather, capitalism as an ordering system hinges on waste, overproduction, expansion, over-accumulation, exponentially increasing consumption, and is designed such that most products go trashed and/or unsold (corporations destroy tonnes of merchandise to prevent sales on the black market and horde goods to manipulate demand/prices etc). It is the ""normal situation"" of bourgeois society for a great part of existing products and of the previously created productive forces, to be wasted. Much of this waste comes from an economic system which pits the same products against one another and requires copious labels and advertising as weaponry in this war. There can be no ""environmentalism"" or ""green movement"" unless one first radically re-figures our whole concept of production, wealth and ""money"" (wrongly, ""WALL-E"" is post money), ""money"" having long been exposed as a powerful political tool for expropriation, as opposed to a mere ""neutral medium of exchange"", as is commonly believed.<br/><br/>7.5/10 – Almost as annoying as ""Avatar""."
"dbborroughs","7","17","34","4 July 2008"," Good but not great, despite some wonderful pieces
","This is the story of Wall-E a robot who is alone working on earth cleaning up the polluted planet. One day he finds a plant and takes it home. When one day a space ship lands Wall-E meets EVE who has been left on the planet for some reason. The reason is to find signs that plants are returning, so when Wall-E shows EVE the planet she sends a signal for pick up and is whisked back to a space ship where all of mankind has been living-with Wall-E in pursuit.<br/><br/>This is a mostly wordless feature film not only about robots who fall in love but also what it means to be human and what it means to be alive. Its also a satire, of sorts, about the fat lazy people that we in the West have become.<br/><br/>Technically this is one of the most beautifully animated films that Pixar has done. Its wonderful to look at. The places and spaces and the characters are all beautifully rendered. The film creates more than good number of real characters, both robots and people and its the characters that make the film worth seeing.<br/><br/>The problem is that the story is a bit of a mess. On the one hand you have the central story of the romance of Wall-E and EVE, but you also have this glaring social commentary looming over everything. From the polluted Earth of the first half to the fat people in space during the second. Which is more important? To me its the romance and its there that the film shines. Frankly I got teary during any number of sequences dealing with the romance. Unfortunately the ""get the plant so we can go home story"" kind of goes nowhere smoothly as situation keeps being inserted again and again to keep it going. On top of that we have the not so hidden messages about how lazy we all are and how happiness is ""not following the path"". The story goes from well told story about Wall-e and Eve to the Captain (who is wonderful and under utilized-I wanted more of him) to the two human ""lovers"" John and Mary who begin to see life out side of their hoover-chairs.<br/><br/>There is this really good robot romance stuck in here thats gotten lost somewhere along the way. I was sobbing during the four minute trailer that was floating around a few months ago that focused beautifully on the romance. I went from not being sure if it would work to being sure they hit it out of the park. There's this wonderful simple story locked in there with all this not as wonderful stuff around it. (A word of warning- the trailers give a good number of gags away) Yes I've complain about every Pixar Movie. (Toy Story 2 isn't as good as the first one, Bugs Life is too slow, Monsters Inc was not quite Toys Story, Nemo didn't completely thrill me, Incredibles is too long, Cars is too simple and their eyes wig me out, Ratatouille, while very good, isn't the the great second coming many claimed) Say What you will I own all but A Bugs Life. Other than Cars I think all have improved with time (thanks to the critical claim that this Pixar is the next big thing no loner being considered) And while I do think Ratatouille has too much story and needs to be trimmed down, I don't think that any of them have as many problems story wise as this (certainly none has as many character needing exploration and fleshing out).<br/><br/>What is this film about-really I don't know. I adore the romance and wish I had someone to take to see it since its so charming, but at the same time...I don't know it all doesn't come together for me.<br/><br/>Perhaps I could see some of the story line too clearly. I could tell what the next shot was or the next motion would be. Perhaps I saw too many jokes in the trailers and commercials. Maybe it was the god awful Hello Dolly clip playing over and over and over. Maybe it was the one movie too many that played Le Vie En Rose. I don't know. there is something about the film that doesn't allow it to hang together for me. I admire its construction but I don't love the result.<br/><br/>I still like it. I'd give it between 6.5 to 7 out of 10, but at the same time the parts are better then the whole.<br/><br/>Go see it and make up your own mind-if nothing else there are some really neat things in it."

","Having won the PR war, there is now no means by which a viewer can allow himself to judge a Pixar product as wanting or in this case, horrid. A movie so underscripted (and over messaged) that if you wasted five words describing the plot you'd give everything away. Audiences still don't know when they're being narratively cheated, or when a slightly promising idea has gone off the rails, or become a bloated, maddening mess. I never ever imagined when I rented this that I would be swearing at the screen as the unbearable latter two thirds of this movie wore out their welcome.<br/><br/>So here we are (AGAIN) with the unpromising clichés of a robot who wants to feel love, a ships computer issuing a self-destruct countdown, a crowd that requires one person to save them.<br/><br/>Wall-e himself makes sad eyes over and over. The movie milks this in every scene - Put ""robot"" and ""love"" into the big Hollywood script writing machine and you always get something like this. The movie becomes bloated with surface activity whose conception calls for dragging out tired computer animation, and the familiar set of unnecessary/lookalike obstacles to be overcome. It devolves into the usual thought (and time) wasters. In the end, things have reached the same frantic, overproduced excess that execs have been pushing for 50 years. Wall-E is exactly as bloated as Hello Dolly was in 1969. (& I challenge you to sit through that forgotten dud.)<br/><br/>In the 1968 movie Oliver, at an emotional bottom, the title moppet sings a song called ""Where is love?"" Lionel Bart was criticized for writing a song with sentiments too developed for a child to voice. While a child may seek the love a missing parent, they don't seek love in general as a disembodied ideal. Likewise for Wall-e. Here, barely three minutes after Wall-E is introduced, he's dreary little headcase pining for love, which is a limp idea dramatically for a kids film, and forces half the problems that ensue. The other half come from the wearying agenda, and this is coming from someone who is relieved we are finally in the green era.<br/><br/>Vain, high-concept viewers have taken pride in their ignorance of a device here, which is old news; large stretches of silence are novel only to audiences who are unfamiliar with Jaques Tati, the 28 silent minutes that open 2001, enormous silent stretches of the ingenious Blow-Up (& countless other examples) and who can't fathom the silent era.<br/><br/>The movie asks two tiny things of an audience; to nod in agreement with its simpleton moral pronouncements, and to pass the time distracted by a bunch of surface activity. Right in the middle, between those two things, is where any good movies soul resides, what the movie ask you to cogitate over; ideas! Sorry no ideas here, just an abundance of messages: Towers of garbage taller than the skyscrapers we built (check, message delivered) An indictment of bignesss and Wal-mart (check, message delivered) Headed by a craven CEO (check, message delivered) A single remaining plant (check, messaged delivered) A space-ark filled with helpless fatties (check, message delivered) etc. etc. etc. etc. (message delivered).<br/><br/>A glimpse into the future has never been so hopelessly stuck in the narrative past, and never looked so much like Victorian corn. The movie just cannot rest until a parade of morals has been pounded home. There is little sense of wonder in it. It ain't surprising that it was directed by the guy who made Little Nemo.<br/><br/>The movie becomes exactly as dreary, tiring and preachy as the premise of a largely wordless movie about ecology sounds. It does not overcome its major decisions. Regardless of it's popularity now, no one will be watching this in ten years because no one will be able to trudge through it. It is grotesquely unsubtle hideously preachy.<br/><br/>Wall-E is is as insufferable as a dinner guest who explains the correct moral stance on every topic that comes up. Message delivered."

"iKramerica-1","6","13","25","13 July 2008"," Like watching someone play a video game filled with propaganda
","I love animation. I love Pixar. I love the character of Wall-E, and enjoyed the relationship with EVE. Is the animation amazing looking? Sure. Not as great as last years wonderful little rat movie or even as enthralling as Finding Nemo, but still an achievement and better than what most other studios can even dream of.<br/><br/>But <br/><br/>There was about 15 minutes of story here. Maybe 20. Much like a silent film of the past which doesn't hold up to today's standards, Wall-E just wears thin after a while. Yawning was contagious in parts, as was seat squirming. I've only experienced that once before at a Pixar film, Cars. Which also had a very shallow story, BTW.<br/><br/>Wall-E felt longer than it was, never a good sign for a film. That they can carry a film that long with almost no dialog is amazing, but the pacing could have been stronger. <br/><br/>But frankly, what you watch is a very compelling character basically run around in a video game environment. It's as if the whole movie was created just so it could be put onto an Xbox. ""This is the garbage collections stage."" ""Now that you cleared that, here's an interstitial story element."" ""Now this is the run away from EVE stage."" ""Now the run away from the guard robot stage."" ""Now the run away from cleaner robot stage."" ""More guard robots, different floor"" Etc. And watching someone play a video game is just not that exciting. How many chase scenes does one movie need? If you thought the end of Monsters Inc. was overly long due to the drawn out chase, you ain't seen nothing until you sit through the 40 minutes of chases in Wall-E.<br/><br/>A technically distracting problem was the mixing of LIVE ACTION footage of Fred Willard and Hello Dolly with animated humans. It made no sense from a visual standpoint, and I really don't know what Lasseter was thinking here letting this idea get into the final film. Why Fred Willard wasn't animated like everyone else is just beyond comprehension.<br/><br/>Another major problem with the movie is that Wall-E doesn't matter much to the story. He is not concerned with getting from A-B, which is kind of important. Without giving too much away, Wall-E is only interested in making EVE his girlfriend, which means that the ""mission"" that he is put on is not important to him. Which means he has no stake in the outcome. He doesn't care if it succeeds or fails other than it would please the girl robot, and even then, she doesn't really care either. And the resolution is full of deus ex machina moments. All of which reinforce the video game feel of the movie, where it's about clearing levels and completing tasks rather than a uniquely compelling story.<br/><br/>In addition to the lack of a layered story and main character who has any stake, the environmental message was heavy handed and logically flawed to the point of being laughable. Goes far beyond the most outspoken doom and gloom propaganda you've ever heard. And it's not an ironic extreme, it's just a stupid one. The opening of the film was annoying in it's stupidity, no matter how well crafted it was. (The wall-mart bashing was similarly stupid, but at least that was more ironic.) But in terms of the trash and the air, humans could not have survived on the earth they left long enough to create the technology to leave it if it was in that condition. And no matter what some would like you to believe, it would be impossible to reach that state in less than 100 years. Not to mention that if humans create a giant biosphere to live in until they fix the earth, why do they fly off into a far off solar system it it? There is no need. Just create it ON earth. Self-contained is self- contained. And this shouldn't matter at all except it is a film aimed at children (and simple minded adults) with the goal of indoctrinating them into an extremist way of looking at the world, and specifically the USA (the world was deserted, but there was no mention of any city or country other than the USA). <br/><br/>And I truly believe that the reason so many critics liked this film so much was this last point. It was anti-USA, anti-business, and environmentally alarmist, and fits perfectly with the Hollywood and media agenda of the last 15 years. I really respected Pixar for not falling into the ""message film"" trap, but I guess that combining Pixar management with Disney brought some of that influence into the fold, which is a bad thing for all of us."
"keenan-1","7","11","21","11 August 2008"," Worth watching, especially for the short!!
","I just came back from seeing WALL-E with my 9-year-old son. I walked out of that theatre feeling as though I'd been hit over the head with an anvil. The message is about as subtle as a kick in the crotch, but it needs to be said and I'm just a little tired of some of the diatribes I've read that are masquerading as ""reviews"". People--it's a movie, and meant to be entertaining. If you personally are not entertained, that does not make it a bad movie, just not one that is right for you. And if the message strikes a little close to home and makes you uncomfortable, then maybe it's time to get off your backside and do something constructive about it, hmmmm? I go to the theater about three times a year at most--I end up renting most films from the shop because I don't like being pummeled with the noise that seems necessary on the big screen because people will not stop yakking away at the theatre. I really enjoyed the experience of watching WALL-E, and found myself laughing out loud repeatedly--and I enjoyed it far more than I did either the over-hyped DARK KNIGHT or INDIANA JONES AND THE LATEST PILE OF MONEY, both of which gave me sick headaches by the time I left the theatre.<br/><br/>My summary says it all. I just about peed my pants while watching PRESTO, the short. As always, PIXAR is at its best when it's working with cartoon shorts. I haven't laughed so hard since the first time I saw FOR THE BIRDS, the short attached to MONSTERS INC.. It's a great homage to the style of Warner Brothers (you'll understand when you see it; the feel of it is pure Bugs Bunny) and if the only way I'll be able to own it one day is to buy the disc for WALL-E, I consider that a bargain.<br/><br/>Oh, and for the record, my son, diagnosed ADHD (and currently not medicated), adored the movie, even the long stretch at the beginning when people's biggest complaint seems to be that ""nothing happens"". He was riveted to the screen the whole time. I'm not jumping on the bandwagon and claiming that this movie is some kind of cinematic masterpiece, but I felt that it was definitely worth the price of admission--and that's saying a great deal these days. Go to enjoy the quality of the animation, to be reminded of HELLO, DOLLY! (I'd forgotten about that movie--I really must rent it soon!), and, yes, to take away a message that perhaps it's time to be just a little more aware of what we're doing to our environment and where this might lead us. Rather than make excuses and attacking the message behind the movie, it might behoove us more to stop and ponder, if only for a moment, where we will be going."

","I was lucky enough to see this film last week at a cinema in Spain on my holiday, it's not even released until Friday 18th July in the UK. However, on Friday, I will be sitting in the front row of a cinema watching this film again.<br/><br/>'Wall-E' is quite possible one of the best films to be made in the last 10 years. With such a simple plot, classic jokes and a script that contains minimal dialogue, this is the summer blockbuster of 2008, without a doubt. I didn't want this film to end, that's how much I loved it. It's got the widest audience appeal, infants, teens, adults and the elderly will adore this masterpiece. Disney/Pixar seem to never really fail us as viewers, there films are always original, quirky and are quite possibly the most beautiful creations to be shown on the big screen. Andrew Stanton, director of 'Finding Nemo' and co-writer/director of 'Toy Story' has written and directed one of the greatest animation films of all time.<br/><br/>'Wall-E' is also painfully intelligent for what most people would call a 'Children's/Family' feature. With obvious references to Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece, '2001: A Space Odyssey', parents will find themselves giggling when the kids are sitting silently. This film pays close detail to life, it shows us how to appreciate the better things we have, not the material goods. The character of Wall-E wants to find love, to never be lonely again, something that everybody can understand and relate to.<br/><br/>I honestly believe 2007 and 2008 has helped save some of the importance of cinema and why we, as a nation enjoy the flicks so much. Films like 'Wall-E', 'Juno' and 'No Country For Old Men' have proved to the world that films can still be about passion and not about money. Sure, this is a summer blockbuster and sure, it's got one of the biggest budgets since 'Titanic' but the main principles of film-making are easily apparent.<br/><br/>This is the film I've been waiting for. One that sucks in it's audience properly and holds them tight, one that shows true cinematic creativity and passion and one that shows just how much film is important to us.<br/><br/>'Wall-E' should be your choice of summer film this year and I'm sure it will be. This isn't just a fantastic film, it's a spectacle of genius and greatness."

A definite winner.<br/><br/>My autistic child has been obsessing on being able to see WALL-E for almost a year.

","Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Ratatouille. It would be a bit of an understatement to say that Pixar has had its fair share of successes both critically and commercially. So its comes as no surprise then that their latest WALLE manages to not only outdo all of Pixar's previous attempts but it also manages top spot on 2008 score board. So effortlessly brilliant that it manages to captivate its audience even when no words are being spoken. Both WALLE and EVE will, undoubtedly go down in history as two of the most charming and influential characters of all time.<br/><br/>Sure there is a dip in quality when both robots leave earth to board the mother ship but even with this dip it still manages to soar avoid all previous attempts at creating what I perceive as the perfect animated film only really out shone by Princess Mononoke 11 years before. For this generation at least WALLE manages to be the greatest animated film, filled with warmth and wonder and so brilliantly original. Miss this and your missing 08's very best.<br/><br/>Disney and Pixar join forces for this computer-animated tale about a wide-eyed robot who travels to the deepest reaches of outer space in search of a newfound friend. The year is 2700, and planet Earth has long been uninhabitable.<br/><br/>For hundreds of years, WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class) has been taking out the trash, and collecting precious knick-knacks in order to stave off the boredom of his dreary routine. Little does WALL-E realize that he has recently stumbled onto a secret that could save planet Earth, and once again make the ravaged planet safe for all humankind.<br/><br/>When highly advanced search robot EVE makes friends with WALL-E and realizes the value of his remarkable discovery, she excitedly races back to let the humans know that there's hope for their home planet after all. But after centuries alone in space, WALL-E can't stand the thought of losing the only friend he's ever known, and eagerly follows her into the deepest reaches of space on the adventure of a lifetime. Along the way, the friendly trash-collecting robot who has always known what he was made for gradually begins to understand what he was meant for. Finding Nemo director Andrew Stanton returns to the helm for this family-friendly sci-fi adventure featuring the voices of Fred Willard, Jeff Garlin, and Ben Burtt.<br/><br/>The main credit deserves to go to mastermind director Andrew Stanton who so confidently glides these characters round their fully believable world. What with this being his third feature film there's no doubt he knows his movies. The cramped sub-section is quite easily forgiven thanks to WALLE powerful presence. Trust me this is a stunning film.<br/><br/>VERDICT: Pixar are no strangers to success. With each film being stunningly entertaining. WALLE is no exception. The film is soaked in character with both WALLE and EVE being flawlessly charming. 2008 best film by far bold, beautiful achievement."

","My son wanted to see this, and so I looked it up on IMDb.com just to see what it was about. There was a lot of debate about it on the forum. A lot of people hated it and said they walked out; some were offended. This made me actually want to go see it. My favorite movies are written and directed by David Lynch, and so many people hate those movies. Sometimes I think that people just need their sh*t handed to them on a silver platter - they don't like to actually have to THINK about the plot. ...Not that Wall-E is hard to follow, but it takes a certain caliber of intelligence to appreciate a film that doesn't have any dialogue for the first 40 minutes. In my opinion, to pull off getting your audience to connect to a character so intensely without him saying a word of dialogue is just pure brilliance. This doesn't sound like a kid movie at all, does it? In fact, I do not think that young children could understand the true meaning of the movie.<br/><br/>It's 700 years from now and we have Wall-E, a little trash compactor robot, whose only job is to clean the mess that the earth has become after humans have turned it into a giant landfill and abandoned it for another planet. There is no life on earth, no grass, nothing - just garbage. He spends his days doing this along with one cockroach who has also survived this ""apocalypse."" Occasionally Wall-E finds a piece of garbage he wants to keep, and he has his own little area which he made for himself where he keeps his collections. One day he finds a small plant growing in from the dirt and is amazed by it as he has never seen vegetation or life of any kind. He scoops it up and puts it in an old boot with some dirt and adds it to his collection. Wall-E realizes he is lonely when he finds a video tape and watches the humans dancing happily, holding hands and laughing. He sees that his ""hand"" (claw) is very similar to a human's hand, and wonders why he has to be alone.<br/><br/>After a spaceship landing to deliver another robot sent to clean up the mess (EVE), Wall-E and EVE become friends and Wall-E shows her all of his collections, but when he shows her the plant, her ""body"" opens up, captures the plant, and then she shuts down completely. The spaceship returns to get her but Wall-E, determined not to lose his friend, holds onto the spaceship and flies into outer space.<br/><br/>The destination is the other planet ""Axiom"" that the humans now live on. Everywhere you look is bright flashing lights and signs for food and shopping. The humans are all grotesquely overweight and travel around in hovering chairs. They are brainwashed and memorized by flashing screens in front of their faces - which from what I gathered seemed to be a combination TV/phone/ordering service. Consumerism is out of control as everyone is eating and shopping and glued to their TV screens. Up until now, there was no dialogue in the movie. The humans never get up from their chairs, and they never have to, because of the technology. There are robots everywhere doing all the work so humans are free to do whatever they want; however, all they want is to shop, eat, and watch TV. They are also obviously a lot less intelligent. At one point even, the captain of the ship needs to look at some sort of manual, and doesn't know how to read or even open the book - nor has he ever even heard of a book.<br/><br/>Once they find out there is life on earth again, they are disappointed because they'll have to go back to rebuild it and give up their lifestyles.<br/><br/>Throughout all of this the sub-plot is about the connection that Wall-E and EVE have, which is definitely more picked up by the kids. They get separated, and back together, one is in trouble and the other one helps ...etc. Sounds kind of cheesy when I describe, but was also extremely powerful in the ways in which it was conveyed. I won't write anymore, in the event that someone is still reading this and actually wants to see it. But seriously - go see it. ;-)"

","WALL-E is set in a dystopian future where the Earths surface has been over-run by waste, poisoning the atmosphere and rendering life impossible.<br/><br/>Abandoning the planet, the Humans of Earth seek sanctuary in the stars, leaving the dutiful task of cleaning up after themselves to a legion of Robot's - Waste Allocator Load Lifter's - Earth class (Wall-E's).<br/><br/>After 700 years, civilisation has forgotten about Earth and the WALL-E fleet has worn itself down to 1.

The Luxury Cruise vessel which houses the remaining few humans who have become totally reliant on their technology and are oblivious to the fight for their true homes survival.<br/><br/>The protagonists' communication is restricted to a few awkward phrases and limited expression, posing a significant challenge to Disney/Pixar. Yet throughout the film I passionately longed for the happiness and safety of the animated duo. The characters are complete and well rounded and far from a hindrance, the lack of spoken language gives a totally unique perspective to their story.<br/><br/>Disney/Pixar have achieved a monumental masterwork worthy of admiration. It's clear that a lot of love has gone in to this movie, with every scene a visual masterpiece, offering overpowering aesthetic beauty and minute attention to detail which creates as much a work of art as any sculpture or painting.<br/><br/>The film lacks many of the sneaky Innuendo's that often tickle the adult viewer, but manages to reach all age groups in an effective and powerful manner. Through explosive laser battles and dramatic backdrops, hilarious miss-haps and a torturous climax, every range of emotion is comprehensively invoked leaving the audience exhausted and exhilarated.<br/><br/>The plot is fairly typical of a Disney film and leaves few surprises, the three-phased story telling that has made Disney famous has always proved successful and does not fail here. An imperfect balance is torn to shreds and eventually put right, bringing a brighter future for all.<br/><br/>The much criticised ending symbolises the ideal of Love conquering all, and relies on the immersive characterisation over believability, which far from a weakness, perpetuates the theme of the piece.<br/><br/>Up against strong competition, WALL-E's chance of big box-office success is mired by its Target Market, but unlike the blockbusters it's up against, it truly will appeal to everyone."
"ClaytonDavis","9","6","10","30 June 2008"," WALL-E, the most innovative animated film in years...
","Animation is a key element in the lives of children but somewhere around adolescence, a young person feels they're ""too mature"" or ""too cool"" to be watching ""cartoons."" Then a change occurs in adulthood, which the same young person misses something from their childhood and a film they watched while playing with Lego's brings them back to that. As of late, animated films have tried to be something their not, perhaps lost their spark. In the new millennium, I haven't really experienced the Bambi, The Lion King, or The Fox and the Hound of our time. Finding Nemo and The Incredibles raised the bar but still hadn't been the perfect dose of entertainment, writing, and emotion. WALL-E, has achieved where its predecessors failed.<br/><br/>WALL-E is the most touching, real, emotionally moving film this year so far. The film is about a little robot named WALL-E, (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class) who has become exceptionally lonely on the desolate planet of Earth, that has become a wasteland of filth, debris, and pollution. Life has ceased to exist on the once populated planet until a rocket lands and drops off a ""surprise,"" to say the least. Enters our heroin, which might be an understatement, EVE, a robot with an edge, that is searching for ""something"" that might be the key to life's existence. But alas, WALL-E falls in love with her charm, wit, and blaster gun and when circumstances force her to be picked up, WALL-E will travel across the galaxy to find his love.<br/><br/>WALL-E makes a statement loud and clear about today's political factors, from pollution to exercise, love, life, it speaks of it all in volumes without any words; it uses images to baffle the viewer as we are thrust through the film. Writer and Director Andrew Stanton creates wonderful details as we are engulfed into WALL-E's world and within seconds of the film starting, fall in completely in love with the robot.<br/><br/>The film doesn't pretend to be something it's not and Stanton isn't afraid to let the film be both for the mature and the innocence of our youth. With limited dialogue, Stanton takes a chance of losing his viewers but rest assured, there is never a dull moment and while the film does lose a little flavor from the start, resonance of childhood and contentment fill the viewer in images of awe and splendor.<br/><br/>As the already declared by many, Animated Film frontrunner of the Academy Awards, the film studio Pixar may have a winner on its hands to make a strong push for Best Picture. Not since Beauty and the Beast has an animated film been nominated for Best Picture and we've had some potential candidates over the years. But with the induction of the Best Animated Feature category, voters feel there's no need to validate the films twice so to speak. WALL-E is technically beautiful which makes it a contender in the Sound and Editing categories, and Stanton is more than just the writer of the film as he directs the film with power and precise. I'd go so far as to say this is the best directed animated film I've ever seen. That is where Stanton's magic is, his direction, but writing is definitely a strong suit for the film as well. We'll have to wait for the upcoming awards season to see how it plays out.<br/><br/>But go and catch WALL-E on the big screen, and enjoy the masterpiece for what it is and the wonderful short film at the beginning of the film which is a treat for all.<br/><br/>***½/****"

","So yeah, this is a pretty good movie. It's something that the everyone in the family can enjoy; and is well worth the 9 bucks I paid to see it.<br/><br/>However......<br/><br/>this movie probably shouldn't be in the top 250, let alone top 25. It's not even Pixar's best. Both of the two Toy Stories, AND Finding Nemo are better movies! They may not surpass WALL-E in animation, but they are better, and more original stories. Even the animation doesn't leave me in awe as it does so many others on IMDb apparently. It is repetitive, and lacks style in a way. An example would be ""scared"" WALL-E (even if you haven't seen the movie, you've seen it in previews). He just shakes! That would be OK, except he does it 3 or 4 times in the movie! Do something different! To add to that, both the story and music is basically stolen. 2001: a space odyssey, star trek, star wars; all stolen from."

","I can't believe wall e's on the IMDb top 250 list, and that too at no. 29 when i write this.<br/><br/>The film is strictly average. Agreed, that the theme is a little unconventional, and a little refreshing at first, but it soon becomes run-of-the-mill. The way the romance between the two robots has been depicted is contrived and plain irritating. All the two robots can say, are their names, and that too, in highly pitched, irritating sounds. Wall e's urge to grab eve's hand is just unnatural for a robot, and very awkward.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie, when the interactions between wall e and the cockroach are shown, is interesting, but the second half of the film is cheesy, clichéd, and boring. As usual, you have the good robots, and the bad robots, and wall e defies all odds and emerges the hero. I mean, how unexpected is that.<br/><br/>The only thing about this movie that stays with you after you've left the theater, is a headache from the incessant cries of 'wall e!' and 'eve!' from the two robots.<br/><br/>6/10, that too because of the brilliant animation."
"symphonyofnames","3","23","53","30 June 2008"," Not that great
","In lieu of a plot, this movie has a series of plot holes strung together, which all get overlooked on the premise if it being a kids' movie. This was not as great as everyone is making is out to be. I don't know why everyone has picked this particular Disney Pixar movie to make a stink about. The humor was nothing new; it's the same stuff they've been doing for years. They did start off with some good ideas. These ideas, unfortunately, were not developed nearly as thoroughly as they should have been. The first part of the movie features Wall-E rolling around doing nothing in particular, and some superfluous shots of a cockroach. When EVE's ship takes off, I was sitting in the theater, hoping and praying that Wall-E would get on it, as I watched everything that could be vaguely interesting in the movie try to fly away. What happened up in the ship wasn't much better though, so I don't know why I wasted time hoping. The focus was taken off of what could have been the real message of the movie: a commentary about how the corporate world and our increasingly leisure-filled lifestyle will one day destroy the planet and leave everyone in space. This is not a particularly new or original idea, and certainly not as brilliantly demonstrated as someone like Orwell or Huxley has already already done. The focus of the movie was taken off of this, and put onto a cutesy little romantic story about two robots who chase after the film's Macguffin (a plant). This really should have been more of a subplot. I felt like a lot of things could have been cut out without really changing the movie at all; a lot of mishaps the main characters face aren't really pertinent to the story at all. For example: the plant is taken away by a bad robot. The film's characters chase after it, invoking a lot of slap-stick comedy. And then, just when they get close to their goal, THE SAME THING HAPPENS. It's not needed. I felt like if they wanted to really make a point, they should have made their point and not tried to dumb it down. It works well as a kid's movie, but I really don't think it's any better than any of the other animated movies about robots, or fish, or animals that they've done before. Just my take on it."

I sat watching most of this film with my mouth agape and disdain in my heart. The first 20 minutes were just uncomfortable and unpleasant. Wall-E is neither charming nor endearing. The post-apocalyptic vision of Earth was more pleasant in Mad Max. This mish-mosh of clichés was unbearable, making the Battlestar Galactica TV Series (and I mean the 1979 Series!) appear to be Shakespearean in its depth. <br/><br/>By 55 minutes in, I was so aghast at the mess on screen, I couldn't wait to start writing this. Exactly what audiences find appealing about this film has totally escaped me. Is it truly that in the mind of the public, Pixar can do no wrong? (That would put them in league with Microsoft, Coca Cola, McDonald's, etc. - companies that have consistently inferior product, but just enough good PR that the public is blinded to their failings.)<br/><br/>Best Picture? Please... you cannot even put this next to Casablanca, Godfather II or even Mary Poppins. Best Animated? Well, if you discount the dreadful story, I guess on the Artistic Merit alone, you can put this against Kung Fu Panda and others from this past year (although, I think Blue Skies' over-looked ""Robots"" from a few years back looked better than this).<br/><br/>I just don't get this film or why it was popular."

It has little content for the younger generation and the curdling environmental message leaves little desire to put myself through it's agonizing 90 minutes ever again.<br/><br/>What started off as an original offering soon ended up being a ""wannabe classic"" - they tried too hard, or maybe they didn't even try at all.. either way, it just simply doesn't work.<br/><br/>Disappointing."
"ehco58302003","10","5","8","1 March 2010"," My admiration for the greatest animation
","I have seen a series of Pixar animation, such as Toy Store and Monsters Incorporation, and all have especially good effects and elaborate drafting. Besides, every animation has a unique and interesting story that fascinates children as well as adults a lot. I can't help but watch it again and again. I just imagine me as a character in the movie, and then I will thoroughly enjoy it.<br/><br/>I'll bet that WALL-E is the best Pixar animation I have ever seen. The movie's background is something significant for our human beings. The story starts after 800 years and the earth becomes unsuitable for people's living because of the pollution we make. And there's only a robot, called WALL-E, remained to sweep and to allocate the waste. This kind of story reminds us of the consequences if we keep wasting. In addition, I notice another point—obesity. Human beings who living in a space ship, called Axiom, more rely on machines and even don't need to walk eventually. It's too lazy. I'm sure this is not a good phenomenon for us. No one would like to be like that.<br/><br/>Refer to the part I most like, it is definitely the friendship between WALL-E and Eve. Although they're robots, they do have the same emotions as humans do. There are no more words but spirits' meet. When Eve can't recognize who WALL-E is, WALL-E reveals a feeling of sorrow but never gives up arousing her. At that scene, I am heartbroken and dropping tears. Nevertheless robots are made of iron and look emotionless, their true love can be so sincere and touching. It speaks to my heart even more.<br/><br/>To sum up, the animation has some characteristics, like romantic story and significant parts, which I love. I only have a sentence,"" the director really did a good job! """

An animation showcasing humans destroying themselves and earth this has a strong encoded message specifically designed to shock other animations.<br/><br/>Apart from Warner Brothers terribly awkward Happy Feet there has been little in animation genre to say a great deal about the earth's natural wellbeing. Even that paper thin plot crammed it in to the last twenty minutes whereas here everything is thought of and built around. The shot as the spaceship takes off from earth into the rubble surrounding it is brilliant. The nature of Wall-e himself is to clean up earth's wastage. The point of EVE is to salvage a rescue attempt. Bearing in mind this film has so little dialogue this is a remarkable achievement to get across. It is told through movements through actions and the saying ""actions speak louder than words"" is more than recognizable in this picture.<br/><br/>Wall-e a lovable appearing robot becomes infatuated with EVE when she arrives on earth and the time the two spend together is heart-warmingly sentimental. When EVE goes into sleep mode that actions Wall-e takes to revive her are adorable, and not in a cheesy way. His holding the umbrella, the sunset picturesque montage, the trip in the boat all demonstrate a kindness and typically romantic conceptual motives for a character who has been alone for such a long time.<br/><br/>The character development of the central protagonist plays a pivotal role in the emotional core of this film. Wall-e, a robot, has over the years developed a human personality, collecting items that mean something, caring for insects and greeting people and machines and becoming friends. And the contradictory in humans is remarkable. Like today's modern stereotype, we are obsessed with technology and food, which in this picture leads to our demise, sitting in chairs and having everything on a plate for us.<br/><br/>The score for this picture is truly excellent also, having intertextuality from 2001 and Hello Dolly allow us to be brought into the moment and dare I say such a claim, the finest score Pixar have generated? Pixar get better with every outing and Up! was a marvellous showcase of adventure and love which just topped his outing and yet this is still one of the finest animations you will ever see."

Well yes, there is a good hidden message behind this all, that human should start stop dumping too many garbage into the earth because earth would one time reach a very high toxic level that can not be tolerate by human body any more. That's why there is wall-e who has the job to tidy the garbage and make it into a tower of garbage boxes. <br/><br/>The sound of eve calling wall-e ... wall-e ... wall-e all the time in this movie is also quite annoying.

The computers took it to a whole different level. However, the computer animation is a big let down in the second part of the movie. Can computers get lazy? Many of the actors seem to be phoning it in. And the script is not much better with cheesy lines such as, ""John, get ready to have some kids"" and ""I don't want to survive, I want to live!"" Leave your brain at the door and just take in the movie for what it is....a good animated motion picture. Not Oscar worthy, not even as good as Kung Fu Panda. Pixar has definitely borrowed heavily from the non-dialog of great cartoons such as Mickey Mouse and Tom and Jerry Cartoons of the 1930's/1940's.

That Wall-E contains several such moments is a testament to the continuing brilliance of Pixar.<br/><br/>The story is a simple one but the execution is breathtaking. It is ironic that the most genuine characters to emerge from a movie in years are in fact computer generated robots. Without saying more than two words to each other WALL-E and EVE convey subject and emotion with a subtlety that only serves to enhance the meaning.<br/><br/>Watch this movie and revel in its majesty."
"TheLittleSongbird","9","4","6","1 December 2009"," Simply amazing!
","I heard mixed reviews on WALL-E, there were those who said it was magical, and those who said it was one of the most overrated movies ever. I will say I loved this movie, it is a truly beautiful movie. It could have done with being a tad longer perhaps, but essentially this is more than a movie with A List vocal talents, WALL-E has genuine heart and will definitely enchant children and any Pixar fan. All I will say is that I am sorry it took me such a long time to see it, I will admit I was differing whether I should see it or not. But I am glad I did. The animation is simply incredible, the whole film is wonderful to look at. The whole movie is done in a very sophisticated visual style, and the bright colours and sublime backgrounds were a delight to the eyes. The music is stunning, the orchestral themes are gorgeous but the song from Hello Dolly! was great and fitted in with the story well. Speaking of the story, it may seem thin to some, but it is a very simple heart warming one all the same with depth and poignancy. There are some very imaginative moments, such as the zero-gravity dance and the ride through space. The voice cast that includes Fred Willard, Sigourney Weaver and Pixar regular John Ratzenburger did an exceptional job, and all the characters were endearing. What made the movie was WALL-E himself, he has to be one of the most lovable and in-depth Pixar characters ever, and the writers create a very haunting atmosphere in the early scenes to match our little hero's isolation. All in all, brilliant, quite possibly one of the best films of 2008. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox"

","I don't know if I would have liked this movie better if my expectations weren't so high.<br/><br/>I agree with those critics who say the first half hour, which contained so little dialogue, was excellent. However, in the remainder of the movie, the animation got in the way of the story. The animation was stunning, but it was also distracting. In Ratatouille and Toy Story 2, the story drove the movie, and although the animation was great, it wasn't so overwhelming that it interfered.<br/><br/>I recently took my granddaughter to see Kung Fu Panda, which was not as well animated but overall was much more enjoyable. The greatness of the animation can detract from the greatness of the movie."
"TheUnseenMovieLover","10","7","13","20 July 2008"," An Imaginative and Heartfelt Masterpiece
","Though there have been some exceptional movies so far this year (Iron Man, Forgetting Sarah Marshall etc), there have been few which I would call a classic. With WALL-E, things have just changed. WALL-E isn't only the best film of 2008 so far (I might eat those words when The Dark Knight comes out in a few days), it is also a pure masterpiece. From start to finish, the film wraps you in utterly delightful charm and humanity. WALL-E is a piece of inventive beauty and wonder unlike any other that you will see at the cinema this summer. I absolutely guarantee it.<br/><br/>WALL-E (voiced by Ben Burtt) is the last operating robot on Earth. As for the human race, they left 700 years ago, when the huge amounts of self-produced trash caught up with them. WALL-E's task is to clean up the planet for the return of the humans. However, after being left on his own for so long, WALL-E has developed a personality. He is curious about many of the items that he finds whilst compacting trash, such as an old tape of the musical ""Hello Dolly!"" But he is also becoming lonely, which is understandable for someone who only has a friendly cockroach for company.<br/><br/>However, all of this changes with the arrival of EVE (voiced by Elissa Knight). Thought EVE is initially hostile towards WALL-E, this doesn't stop him from becoming smitten with her and trying to connect with her. However, EVE has come to Earth on a classified mission. Once that mission has been completed, EVE shuts down and waits to be taken back from whence she came. When her transport arrives, WALL-E can't bear to lose his friend and sneaks aboard. His search for EVE brings him into contact with the remainder of the human race, who have been taking refuge on a huge spaceship and who have become excessively reliable on machines to supply their every need. They don't even walk. However, WALL-E's arrival sets many events in motion which may help the human race to return to normality...<br/><br/>First of all, WALL-E's animation is flawless. However, as with the rest of the film, there is also a sense of risk and bravery which adds extra dimensions to the glorious animation. The first moments in the film, which show us the beauty of the stars before swooping down to gaze upon a barren and deserted Earth, are so detailed and emotionally engaging that you are immediately sucked into the tale without any hesitation. Even when the story becomes more traditional (that is in no way an attack on the film), the creativity and power of the film's visuals never falter.<br/><br/>The main focus of the plot is on the growing affection between WALL-E and EVE. This is one of the most moving romantic relationships in years. No, they're not even human. But watching the initial conflict of EVE's determination and WALL-E's innocence slowly mix into love and companionship is magnificent. The scenes between the two characters on Earth are simply wonderful, perfectly paced and confident in the set-up of this unusual couple. However, the best scene comes in the second half, when WALL-E and EVE dance through space together. Everything in this scene is perfect, the comedy of watching WALL-E propel himself through space by use of a fire extinguisher, the lovely visuals, Thomas Newman's marvellous score and the interaction between the two characters. When WALL-E looks likely to float off into space after the fire extinguisher runs out, EVE flies in and scoops him up in her arms. This scene is pure cinematic genius. Overall, there is a humanity and grace of execution in the relationship between WALL-E and EVE which elevates it far beyond the emotional impact of other romantic relationships. <br/><br/>The term of ""cinematic genius"" can also be applied to the iconic character of WALL-E and the fantastic direction by Finding Nemo director Andrew Staunton. Staunton shows that he is willing to inject some risk into his movie-making if it makes a better film. This decision pays off magnificently here. Staunton has lovingly constructed this film with invention, depth and bravura, and in doing so has crafted a piece of movie making which is likely to go down as at least a family classic. Not only will children be enthralled by the sheer brilliance of this film, but other audiences will also be open to its bewitching magic. <br/><br/>As for WALL-E himself, he is one of the most original movie creations in years. Speaking in sequences of robotic speech (bleeps, whirs etc) with only small moments of mechanical dialogue, the filmmakers have still managed to create one of the most human characters of the year. By mostly using his eyes, the animators are able to flawlessly display WALL-E's emotions. In one scene, his eyes droop with sadness when EVE calls him Wally. When he panics or is happy, his eyes rise in an outburst of emotion. The life that the filmmakers are able to find in such simple mannerisms is incredible. Even the beeps and whirs, provided masterfully by legendary sound designer Ben Burtt, increase an already rich and lovable character to terrific heights. The character of WALL-E is just superb, as is the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>WALL-E has just raised the bar for future animated movies. Pixar Animation Studios has already crafted many animated classics. WALL-E joins them without question. The visuals are compelling, the characters are endlessly endearing and the story is told with beauty, wit, imagination and humanity. I couldn't have asked for more."
"ColdNightz","10","7","13","15 July 2008"," Out of this WORLD!
","I saw Wall E not too long ago, and It was one of the BEST Pixar animated films made.<br/><br/>It takes animation to a whole new level. The fact that there are little to no words conveyed in the first half and the movie was still so amazing? Just dazzles me.<br/><br/>This is a movie you can watch with family, a girlfriend, even alone, and still enjoy it undeniably.<br/><br/>This is a movie that you can really feel the passion Pixar put in it. You can feel the emotion that all the characters are feeling. <br/><br/>Wall E was also moved along very nicely. Not too rushed, not too slow. If you haven't watched Wall E cause you think It looks silly, you are wrong, and I suggest that you watch it as soon as you can, because this isn't a movie that is better to watch on DVD."
"swlabr413","10","7","13","9 July 2008"," The Best Pixar Film
","When I first heard that there would be little to no actual dialogue in the first 40 minutes of Wall-E, I was skeptical. But then I remembered what is considered the greatest Science Fiction movie of all time (and as a matter of fact, AFI just named it that), 2001: A Space Odyssey. That also had almost no dialogue for the first 40 minutes. So my opinion changed and my view of the movie changed. I thought that Pixar was going to take a risk by doing this, and leave behind the typical kids movie. And the movie itself is not a typical kids movie. It passes as a very good Science Fiction movie as well as an animation movie because it gives us a scary look into the future, but done in a humorous way. Buy n' Large, which is obviously supposed to be Wal-Mart, takes over Earth in every way, economy and government. Soon, because they pollute the Earth so much, they have to send the human race out to space, and they'll have robots clean it up. Enter the title character. Wall-E is the last of his kind, and because he's been alone for so long, he develops a personality, collecting the trash and bringing them to his home. Soon Eve comes, and becomes Wall-E's love interest. When she discovers a plant, it's off to space. Again, Wall-E comments on society of today by showing how lazy we are coming and then at one point, all humans know how to do is sit in a hover chair and watch T.V., and drink meals from a cup. Wall-E of course brings light to not only the captain of the ship Axiom, but to a few passengers as well, who even though have lived their entire life upon the ship, failed to recognized they had a pool. But in the end, Wall-E isn't about trying to warn us about the future and what we will become. Above all, it is a love story, as most Disney movies are. But this one is one of the best, right up there with Beauty and the Beast, because it is a universal love story. The robots Wall-E and Eve don't necessarily speak a certain language, it is through their attitude and movements that they tell their love story. And of course being Pixar, it is an incredibly fun ride, with great funny moments (like the captain researching Earth). A truly great movie."
"werewolfpumpkin","10","7","13","9 July 2008"," Maybe one of the best stories ever...
","This is perhaps one of the best movies I have ever seen, sci-fi, animated, Pixar, it doesn't matter, its simply awesome.<br/><br/>It is essentially the story of how one person, can save the world, how each little act of kindness, reverberates throughout the universe, and the world at large, and thus it is that WALL-e saves the world, at first it seems innocuous and strange, this littlw robot slaving away, for 700 years. When the aptly named EVE comes along, and shows WALL-e that the world indeed the universe is larger.<br/><br/>Through out the movie WALL-e helps random people, and robots, and changes their lives, for the better, not in spectacular ways does He help either, but simply helps by doing what He can. Thus does WALL-e save the world and all of Human kind, and if I may quote from another movie ""And we must remember that all these things, the nuances, the anomalies, the subtleties, which we assume only accessorize our days, are effective for a much larger and nobler cause. They are here to save our lives."" and thus it is so with this movie, which while being a fable is at heart a love story, between and Adam and an EVE..."
"terranj","10","7","13","6 July 2008"," One of the Best Movies Out There
","I have kept my review ""non-spoiler"" for those who haven't seen the movie.<br/><br/>I thought that this was a great movie, possibly my favorite. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, as did the two hundred in my theater.<br/><br/>The first thing I must add is the reviews of this movie. I cannot believe the utter lack of comprehension in the one to five star reviews. Most if not all of the reviews for this movie in that category are by people tired of being told the same message, and there's only one way to stop that message from being told. I am talking about the Save The Planet message by the way. Some other of the people who reviewed in that category either thought the movie was boring, which meant they couldn't sit for at least ninety minutes and listen to music while watching beautiful art, it's hard isn't it? Or they thought the movie was recycling the same art of past predecessors and doesn't deserve to be in the top 250.<br/><br/>That being said, those very eccentric people gave it a one, even though they clearly said it didn't deserve it. Now, I would like to talk about the movie, which some people have clearly avoided in some reviews and what I don't want to do here. The first half was absolutely magnificent, with little dialog, Pixar had to rely on their art and character depth, yes there is depth in the characters. Try to look past the screen sometimes, or at least think.<br/><br/>When EVE arrives, at about the fifteen minute mark, WALL-E finds himself in love with the plant searching robot. after that, they embark through space to the Axiom, the ship where all of the fat humans live in a industry controlling anarchy. By the way 'jim pyke'(IMDb user, review for WALL-E on the third page of Best I believe, which is about how fat people will react to the movie), the humans are fat because of the lack of gravity, which deteriorates at bone marrow overtime, and is passed through genes.<br/><br/>I don't want to give anymore away that has not already been publicly advertised. If you go see this movie, and want to give an opinion here, do so respectfully and thoughtfully."
"rosco29","10","7","13","5 July 2008"," Ignore the haters. The best movie of the year, and maybe Pixar's best ever
","Let's start with this: This movie made me care about a rolling trash compactor. Out of all the Pixar characters over the years, I've never felt a closer connection than I did with Wall-E. Just a simple, loyal, dutiful little 'bot and I was with him every step of the way. The emotional ties were every bit as real and moving as Jessie's ""When she loved me"" song in TS2, or Mr. & Mrs. Incredible fighting to save their family.<br/><br/>One of the greatest tributes I have to this movie is that it kept a theater of young children ENTHRALLED. They followed everything, and paid rapt attention. Even thru the credits!<br/><br/>This may also be the purest sci-fi film to hit the screen in ages. By all rights, it shouldn't work. Can you imagine the pitch session: ""Yeah, our hero is an electronic garbage man on a desolate, abandoned Earth, and there's almost no dialog."" If it wasn't Pixar, this movie would have never seen the light of day. But it did, and it's magic.<br/><br/>And do ignore the clones screaming about ""thinly disguised environmental propaganda."" ""Wall-E"" is like all good fairy tales: a story that teaches us something about the angels (loyalty, sacrifice, love) and devils (gluttony, apathy) of our nature. <br/><br/>In some aspects, Wall-E reminded me of Spirited Away. A slow-moving tale at times, but appropriately so. A family film to make you sit back and say, yeah, there's something more important than gag-a-minute writing, and bodily function humor. As others have said, this is the family film as art.<br/><br/>Wall-E brought tears to these 44-year-old male eyes. And it made me laugh uproariously. Somewhere, Charlie Chaplin is smiling, because The Little Tramp has been reincarnated, and now he's solar-powered.<br/><br/>Pixar has gone nine-for-nine. And just for chuckles, PRESTO, the short that precedes Wall-E, just might be the out-and-out funniest thing Pixar has ever made.<br/><br/>Wall-E is brilliant. If you're not moved by it, check your basement. There's probably a large pod there right now."
"raypdaley182","10","7","13","5 July 2008"," Pure Brilliance!
","Pixar have done it again. I'm going on the record here, this is THE best movie I've ever seen in my entire life. It's simple, beautiful, enchanting, it has a message & has memorable characters.<br/><br/>Wall-e (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class) is a robot. His job is to tidy up rubbish. A very noble cause & even more so when it's all the rubbish we humans left behind before blasting off into the stars to leave The Earth in hope that nature could regenerate itself. And this is Wall-e's (he pronounces it Wally) huge task.<br/><br/>I assume centuries ago there were millions like him (you get to see 1 that has broken down that he scavenges parts from) & they all compacted the rubbish until they broke down, leaving only Wall-e left to continue the job on his own over a period of 700 years during which time he became self aware & developed a persona with only a cockroach for company.<br/><br/>The film looks amazing, Wall-e is based the design of Johnny 5 from Short Circuit, he also has elements of E.T in his persona along with the robots Huey, Lewie & Dewey from Silent Running. If you were to take all the best parts of those movies & put them together then you'd start to get close to Wall-e.<br/><br/>Wall-e is alone until a probe lands on Earth containing Eve (Extra-terrestrial Vegetation Evaluator) who is there to search for life. And what does she do as soon as she encounters a hint of life? She shoots at it. That was the cockroach. And again when she meets Wall-e who falls in love with her and helps her to achieve her mission when he finds a plant growing under the rubbish he clears.<br/><br/>This means Wall-e has to protect Eve from the elements until her ship returns to take her back to the last remnants of Humanity. A society living in complete apathy, reliant on robots for everything and have atrophied to the point where they are even unable to walk or sit up without assistance.<br/><br/>Eventually we find out that 700 years in space have caused this to occur & that the autopilot was given orders never to return to Earth as it was declared uninhabitable. Obviously Eve's return with the plant throws a spanner in the works and we spend a short time having Eve & Wall-e being declared rogue robots, being hunted down for destruction so the Autopilot can cover up that life has returned to Earth.<br/><br/>The film does end with the ship returning the humans to Earth & Eve having to repair Wall-e after it seems he has been destroyed but her repair job is too good and he no longer is aware like before. We do have a happy ending as Wall-e regains his awareness and the Humans decide to help earth rebuild itself and get it green again.<br/><br/>There is a strong message behind this film about pollution and the destruction of the ecosystem but its never rammed down your throat or made to seem preachy. It's done tactfully & thoughtfully and does make you leave the film thinking about the issues. M.Night Shamaylan tried to achieve this in ""The Happening"" & failed miserably. Perhaps he should take a leaf out of Pixar's book and not try so hard.<br/><br/>A simple film with a very strong idea, an excellent & well thought out plot with a positive message and strong ending all put Pixar's message across very well. As Disney were involved, sadly there are moments of too much saccharine but the very strong film makes these bearable.<br/><br/>I would recommend this to everyone!"
"ymghali","10","7","13","4 July 2008"," cry of warning
","Stupendous. although my comment says there might be spoilers, I'll minimize talking about the events of the movie to the extent that helps prove my point of view. Pixar takes us through the short cartoon at the beginning that smartly relaxes the audience and puts them in the right mood, to a stunningly well-animated well-woven story where machines have feelings and humans have been automated. It can be described as a ""cry of warning"" about the currents human and political condition of the world. In his efforts to anticipate everything and protect life, Man has forgotten the basic principles of logic and even instincts. The political dimension isn't absented as there is a character that leaves very little room to maneuver in guessing who it is, or what it represents (let the auto pilot take over). On the other hand, a robot follows his instincts and finds a love so great that it can save humanity. Beautifully illustrated, the facial expressions and animations are amazingly illustrated, the E voices are so full of emotions that they surpass all ex-Pixar films and leave no doubt that they are The Masters. Wall E is a great work of art that has a strong message for those who want to use their heads."
"mariomguy","9","7","13","29 June 2008"," Pixar's deepest, realistic, and most original masterpiece
","Wall E is set far in the future... 800 years into the future. By that time, Earth would have been so full of mess that life could not be sustained on it. So, all the Earth's citizens left Earth on a spaceship cruise and left behind thousands of robots known as Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-class. The robots are supposed to clean up the Earth, and once evidence of life is found everyone can return. But the program was forgotten, and there's only one sole remaining Wall-E.<br/><br/>I've seen all of Pixar's work, and I can say very confidently that the first half hour of Wall-E is full of the darkest and deepest scenes Pixar has ever created. The story opens in a ghost city, revealing the life of Wall-E. His ultimate job is to... compress garbage. However, while rummaging through the garbage, Wall-E adds certain items he finds while rummaging through the garbage to his personal collection. Wall-E breaths life and personality and remains a lovable character while still being a robot. Throughout the story, Wall-E encounters Eve, a robot sent to search for life on Earth, and he falls in love (any further about the plot, and I'd be spoiling the film). But Wall-E has the personality, while Eve is... a robot. She's cold, cruel, and insensitive.<br/><br/>What makes Wall-E untraditional to most cinematic masterpieces is its lack of dialog. The robots feelings are shown through a compilation of sound effects, body language, and expressions. Wall-E's emotions can always be detected by his binocular-eyes alone. The story is still told without much dialog between the main characters, and told rather effectively. Hey, I understood it much easier than Ocean's Thirteen, so the lack of dialog can't be that bad.<br/><br/>Wall-E is among one of the few Disney-related Science Fiction movies, and the only one with an (mostly) ecologic theme. The ecologic theme is secondary to the love one, so it's not overwhelming (especially for children). The depiction of life in the far future is however depicted to be incredibly twisted, so some kids could get hung up on ""drinking"" lunch instead of enjoying the film. In a world controlled by computers, the human effort stands above all, and if kids end up watching this movie, they would realize it as well.<br/><br/>All in all, Wall-E isn't an adventure anyone should miss. The movie isn't restricted to kids or to adults, which is a key label associated with Pixar. The movie is without error, and Pixar once again stole the big screen. I want this movie on DVD as soon as possible."

Pixar has done it again but with a different formula for success. Instead of using certain actors for personality traits the characters had the traits in the way they were created. All i have to say is:<br/><br/>AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"DonFishies","9","7","13","28 June 2008"," Pixar knocks another one out of the park
","I did not quite know what to make of WALL-E when I first saw the previews for it. It did not look like a typical animated film at all, and seemed like a huge undertaking, even for as big a giant as Pixar is in the realm of animation. But imagination and originality is something Pixar has always been known for (as well as making great movies aimed at all ages), and this film is no exception.<br/><br/>WALL-E tells the story of a robot who seems to be one of the last inhabitants living on Earth. He spends his days collecting immense amounts of trash, and then compacts it into smaller squares of garbage that he ends up building into large structures. He collects specific items that he categorizes in his pseudo-trailer home, and watches Hello Dolly! at night, hoping for some sort of interaction with something other than a cockroach. And as anyone can predict, his prayers are answered in the form of the female robot EVE who lands on Earth to carry out a classified mission. And getting to know her is only the start of this robot's adventure.<br/><br/>I had my doubts, but Pixar have really outdone themselves with this one.<br/><br/>Without a shadow of a doubt in my mind, WALL-E is one of the most original pieces of cinema I have ever encountered. While not necessarily a silent film, the film features very little talking, and mainly features characters who speak to each other through machine noises and the use of their name (and WALL-E and EVE are not the only two kinds of robots featured in the film). But one would be hard-set to notice the lack of dialogue because of how enthralling the film is. From the mere first glance at WALL-E, the film draws the audience into this little robot's role in life, and his inevitable adventure. This could have easily been made into a gimmicky film, but Pixar never lets it stray too far from the epic scope it set out for the film from the opening shot onwards.<br/><br/>The story, without ruining it, is very simplistic. But not in a way that will make people easily write it off. Rather, it is simplistic in how very uncomplicated it is. The characters of WALL-E and EVE can only show so much depth, and for that reason, there is not a whole lot to their story. Yes, there are some genuinely moving scenes I thought impossible to see coming from CGI-animated robots, but this film manages to make a whole group of robots emote in all kinds of ways. There is a bit of social satire thrown in for good measure as well, which helps deepen the spiritual conscience of the film, and helps flesh out a few of the key points WALL-E's chosen career and lifestyle seem to nod at. But as said, the film never gets too ahead of itself, and never once bites off more than it can chew. It knows what it wants to accomplish, and it manages to do it very easily.<br/><br/>But with it being a Pixar film, there is a certain assumption that the animation will be pristine and nearly perfect. WALL-E, although released a mere year after the visually stunning Ratatouille, could be the best any of their films have ever looked. The vast landscapes (both on Earth and through space), diverse range of characters and the breathtaking amount of action taking on place are all nearly jaw dropping. Watching the scene with WALL-E flying through space is a marvel all on its own, if only for the brilliant usage of so many colours. The animation is so detailed that you can see the ingrained dirt and patches of rust that cover WALL-E's body. Pixar just keeps upping their ante in how marvellous their animation is, and I can only imagine it is going to get better as the years go on.<br/><br/>What truly sets this film apart from others, is that it does not try to be different. It feels just like any other Pixar film, and despite the lack of dialogue, is just as funny and charming as the rest of them. Somehow, director/writer Andrew Stanton has realized that the simplicity of the film can only help build up its charm and real world wit. The film is crafted in a way that makes it nearly impossible not to fall in love with and hang on every moment that passes. WALL-E wants to be seen on the same level as other animated flicks, and it looks like the filmmakers spent an immense amount of time making the film accessible to anyone, dialogue plagued or not.<br/><br/>The film is not perfect however. The ending seems a little forced, and a touch silly (especially based on what the audience learns over the course of the film up to that point), but the genuine sense of adventure is enough to not make a big deal out of it. As well, even though the movie practically flies through its running time, there is still a bit of dull weight in certain scenes. They accomplish what they are set out to do, but there was more than a few instances where specific scenes could have been cut, and the film would have turned out the same way.<br/><br/>But even through its imperfections, the film sucks you into its naive and adorable world where our hero is a robot who makes robot noises and says his own name a lot. It speaks absolute volumes that this film can be made and not make anyone at Pixar or Disney break a sweat. WALL-E is one of the most original and heartfelt films of this or any other year, and skipping it would be a disservice to the animation genre. It is one hell of a cute and funny movie, and easily one of the year's best.<br/><br/>9/10."

Its surprising how much emotion can be conveyed with two simple words. And from the few words, Pixar captures the audience to have more emotion for the two robots, than any of the humans. It was so easy to relax, enjoy and to suck in all of the wonders of the film.<br/><br/>This movie is a pleasure to watch as the animation is fluid and just excellent. The film is riddle with irony, symbolism, and parallelism, which many will enjoy, whether or not you catch on to them.

"wildcats890","10","9","18","8 July 2008"," I'm an 18 year old male, and i thought this was a great movie.
","I went into this movie having pretty high expectations, many of which came from the ratings on this site as well as those of critics. The movie works so well simply because the creators made you care so much about the characters, especially Wall-e and they do this without Wall-e having the ability to talk, which is a remarkable feat. The problem people seem to have when going to see a movie like this ( i am one of them, but i put it to the side for this one) is that they think, oh this is animated and rated G, its a kid's movie. Maybe some of them are, but this one surely was not. In fact, i'd say someone would have to be at least 14-15 years old to understand the concept the movie is going for. I know my 12 year old sister liked the movie, but did not understand the true purpose behind the plot. But because i did, i thoroughly enjoyed it until the end. Does Wall-e deserve to be in the top 20? At first i didn't agree, but after thinking about it a little bit, maybe it does. Not because this movie was groundbreaking, it wasn't. But because this movie did so many things, and it never faltered. It could have failed in so many ways, and yet it did not. It passed as a love story, sci fi story, and a story about modern day society and where we are heading. It 's the fact that it did all of this, and did it so well, that maybe it does deserve to be in the top 20. In conclusion, the movie does have some aspects for kids, but this is not a kid's movie and to deny yourself a chance at viewing an amazing movie like this on that basis alone would be stupid. This is a great movie, and the only thing that amazes me, is just how damn good pixar actually is."
"Quinoa1984","10","9","18","28 June 2008"," adorable and haunting, delightful, joyous, and ultimately funny
","I never thought I'd say this but... WALL*E is better than Toy Story. This might not seem like such a high claim given how many other wonderful movies from PIXAR have come out over the past 13 years, particularly the ones by Brad Bird (Incredibles and Ratatouille). But since Toy Story blew open the front door for CGI animation, and stood as the pinnacle of awesome, great entertainment and film-making, I wasn't sure if anything could top it. WALL*E does by far, and then some; I'd even say that this is probably the best Disney movie that, technically, they never made. For years Disney, the studio joined at the hip (and now, practically, submissive to whatever PIXAR wants in animation), didn't want to do WALL*E, as it was a somewhat bleak science fiction movie with 3/4 of the movie not featuring any distinct human dialog at all. And, no cute animals talking either; the closest we get here is a cockroach, and, thankfully, we only get cute chirps and squees of joy.<br/><br/>It was a risk, but after waiting for so long to make it, Andrew Stanton has what critics have been dubbing the ""M"" word: masterpiece. It works on the levels that satisfy simply for the levels of a comedy. WALL*E the character is one of those classic character straight out of Disney movies that you don't see ever done this well, or at least this purely: he's wholesome, innocent, curious, lovable and loving to the robot that comes to earth, Eva, looking for any signs of life, and we want to cheer for him every step of the way. It's a quasi-Chaplin character, if Chaplin were obsessed with a video of an old 1950s musical (somehow, in the post-apocalyptic world of 2700, still intact), and only wants to hold Eva's darling hand, despite getting into mishap after mishap and eventually leading to his trip out into space. No quirk of behavior, no amazingly adorable physical bit of comedy is unturned, and every one works, even ones that you don't see coming.<br/><br/>At the same time, it also works as a science fiction parable, one that works splendidly for our times without pushing it down our throats. Its message is one that is general, which is why when poised around satirical overtones on the AXIOM ship- where WALL*E finds Eva bringing a plant to the ship's captain and then stopped by a HAL-9000 type of computer- it's enriched by a context we all know very well. Taking care of the planet and taking care of ourselves physically are points that are put forth without being preachy, and there's lots of good humor to go with that too (the moment when the pudgy captain finally walks, put to Thus Spoke Zarathustra, is one of the funniest damn things I've ever seen). AND, it's also an incredibly touching love story to boot; two robots who can't quite seem to get together until one sees how much the other cares for the other. The simplicity here, too, is awe-inspiring, and like a silent film brings on the tear-ducts in the final moments of suspense.<br/><br/>So, it's a superb comedy, a fully-realized and somewhat original science fiction story (then again what is original entirely), and the best date movie of the summer. On top of this, director Andrew Stanton and the vast PIXAR team have gone once again another leap forward with their technological skills for all use in telling the story. I don't care who you are, adult, child, old dude in a wheelchair, this is top-notch film-making, some of the finest one will see in this new decade of the 21st century. While points ahead to the future of animated movies, it doesn't stop or go corrupt in basic film-making. For those who would be wary of a movie with very little dialog, don't fret: there's enough ""pure"" cinema here to suffice. It left me speechless, in-between laughing and crying and whatnot. Grade: A++"

None of us enjoyed the movie much at all and we probably would have walked out if we had communicated better in the theater about how hard it was to sit through.<br/><br/>Unlike previous Pixar films, which we have all enjoyed immensely, this was an extremely linear and slow moving story. There was little of the two levels of story for young and old that you see in other Pixar stories.<br/><br/>The small children all around us in the theater seemed as bored by it all as we were.<br/><br/>Particularly distracting was the one human character.

","An almost intelligent robot (WALL-E) goes about his business of cleaning the earth up after an apparently devastating war. Humans are far, far away on a luxury space ship until the earth is ready to receive them again. In the meantime WALL-E encounters a female probe, EVE and is smitten. <br/><br/>OK, let's get this out of the way: WALL-E is Waste Allocation Load Lifter  Earth Class. <br/><br/>The last full length cartoon I watched was The Jungle Book and it had class, good lines and a good story. I suppose there are other good ones out there since The Jungle Book, but .. This animation cartoon had possibilities to say many things, but failed to do so, and it wasn't funny. Clever, yes, but not hilarious as some have postulated. <br/><br/>The humans on the luxury ship were not eager to get back to earth, only the Captain was the eager one. They were happy doing what they were doing because for hundreds of years in space they knew nothing else. And, if you saw the over portly humans there would be the tendency to blame them for their physical condition, but the rigors of space did all that to them. So we are not surprised to see there were none of the reasons expounded upon to never let this happen to earth again, no more war etc etc. For hundreds of years in space they knew nothing about war and seemed to have forgotten all about living on earth. They knew nothing else. But, the Captain had an inkling. <br/><br/>WALL-E's flight to stay with EVE as she reported back to the mother ship showed us the human condition on the luxury ship. And, that is how it all happened, boys and girls.<br/><br/>What would have made this more interesting was to have WALL-E actually speak besides his repeating his name over and over and over and over again. He had artificial intelligence. His speaking would have gone a long way to making this a more fun movie. What made the robot in Short Circuit (great movie) so endearing was his ability to speak, exclaim, wonder, ask questions, be surprised etc. Yes, that was not WALL-E's purpose but it could have been built in by the humans so to speak, and I would have given this a better review than a mere C. I would have laughed, cried until it became a part of me. Didn't happen.<br/><br/>Yes, the kids will like it but would have liked it better if WALL-E actually spoke. Listen to the kids if there is a sequel.<br/><br/>Visually, this is excellent and deserves an A. Some want to put this up for an Oscar: Best Picture. Give me a break. A ""C"" doesn't beget an Oscar. Give it the Oscar for Visual Effects. Are we done now?<br/><br/>Violence: Yes, in a cartoon kind of way. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No, although the humans almost went there"
"villard","6","10","21","5 July 2008"," An Inconvenient Ruse
","We've come to expect Pixar animated cartoons to be intensely funny, imaginative and adventurous from beginning to end. Despite tremendous efforts this one doesn't make it because the story warps out just when things are getting good. <br/><br/>I'd say that for kids, going to this movie is like going to dinner where they serve the dessert first and the broccoli and cheese later. For adults, it's like spending a night at a vacation condo and getting a sales pitch on time-shares the next morning.<br/><br/>The first 40 minutes of this film is totally adorable and very memorable. It's just extraordinarily delightful, clever, imaginative and nonstop laughs. Then it abruptly goes off the cliff with an unexplainable need to get pretentiously preachy about ""saving the planet"". This self- flagellation goes way over the heads of young viewers and doesn't do much for adults who don't need or care to see *yet another* caricature of our sloven culture.<br/><br/>A space film with two adorably cute robot companions had tremendous potential for all kinds of fun misadventures among the stars  weird aliens, maniacal robots, lost worlds. What's more, the lack of dialog makes this film uniquely delightful, especially for kids. <br/><br/>But as soon as the humans show up its ""wha wha wha!""<br/><br/>Instead of going on an adventure across the galaxy, halfway through the film we are plopped down into something that looks like a cross between the Love Boat and the Mall of America. We're distracted by endless grotesque images of fat lazy humans of the 28th century. They're just stupid and very un-entertaining. They can barely take care of themselves (where's a good Morlock when you need one!). Of course they are that way because we stopped hugging trees centuries earlier and turned Earth into a junkyard of consumer waste, blah, blah, blah . . .<br/><br/>The only scary ""bad guy"" is a failed, ineffectual take off on 2001's HAL 9000 homicidal computer. So, there is never any enthralling climatic moment of good winning over evil.<br/><br/>""Bee Movie"" was just as obnoxiously preachy, but I didn't watch it with much of an expectation. To see Pixar fail at its consistently and wonderfully entertaining formula is heartbreaking. Did Al Gore put something in California drinking water a few years ago that compelled the cartoon animation industry to go all environmentally squishy and ""green""?<br/><br/>I saw WALL-E in a theater full of children. I could just feel their energy drain as the film got entangled in all the confusing shenanigans aboard the space mall. This is the first Pixar film I've sat through where the audience didn't spontaneously applaud at the end (as they did in Kung Fu Panda a few weeks earlier)<br/><br/>I'll rent a DVD of WALL-E when it comes out, only to relish seeing WALL-E and EVE playfully get to know each other again. <br/><br/>But the moment the dumb humans and the dialog starts, it will be time to hit ""eject"" button on the DVD player. I wish cute little WALL-E had a chance to do this to the humans in this film."

","In the distant future, the Earth has been an inhabitable wasteland and humans are now living in artificial environments in space and left to clean the trash are waste disposal robots named WALL·E. Almost 700 years later - 2815 to be exact - only one WALL·E (voice created by the film's sound designer Ben Burtt) remains functional and it begins to show signs of sentience and emotions, longing for someone to share a romantic touch with.<br/><br/>Enter EVE (Elissa Knight), a feminine-like probing unit sent to Earth by Axiom, one of the human cargoes in space. WALL·E falls in love with Eve, and this sets for an adventure in space.<br/><br/>Much has been said about how the film lacks dialog for the first hour and relies solely on gestures and emotions shown by the robots. It's also grimmer than previous Pixar films and save for a cockroach, WALL·E does a Will Smith in the first few minutes of the film, interacting with no one but his environment. Sounds like a turnoff especially for the little ones but director Andrew Stanton shows enough resourcefulness to use what's on screen to produce a more emotionally resonant and believable spark (pardon the pun) between the two robots than most real-life actors could ever dream of grasping.<br/><br/>Serving also as some sort of a cautionary tale about human's role in preserving our environment, the film does so in a subtle and amusing manner without resorting to the mawkish approach that's prevalent in other otherwise well-meaning-ed films. As usual of Pixar, the quality of animation is superb, which is, really, just a cherry on top of the cake.<br/><br/>Inasmuch as I hate to sound like a fanboy who will throw superlatives on just about anything Pixar churns out, I have to say that the geniuses behind the animation studio have done it again - create a movie that's not only magnificent to look at, but with a soul as well to back it up."

","This is simply put a masterpiece. No other Pixar film comes close to this one. From the beginning of the film to the end I felt everything was so deliciously perfect, I was struggling hold in my tears. When something is as outstanding as this film turned out to be, I tend to be a crybaby. I just can't help it. When something so ingenious finds its way to the silver screen, I see it as a big victory. Having to live with all the garbage that's being produced in Hollywood, it's almost worth it, when something so beautiful contrasts to it and makes you think about what storytelling is all about. This movie had a strong influence on me, one that I've not felt since I saw the Mexican film, Voces Inocentes (which I highly recommend by the way). Why was it that good? Well, imagine pure eye candy for 98 minutes straight, a tear jerking love story with amazing characters and a rewarding plot.<br/><br/>Loved it... Absolutely loved it. 10/10 Only downside is.. Pixar has raised the bar. It'll have to try and do equally as good films from now on or better and that's no easy task. But having seen this wonderful film, I'm full of hope and belief.

"shortyjoe10","8","6","11","12 July 2008"," One of the best of the year!
","First of all, how come there are so many people that think a new movie can't be an instant classic, nor can it surpass other great movies made in the past? Half of the '1' comments report that the movie was good, but they just voted low to bring down the rank. I feel that eventually, there will be a film that portrays enough to be better than some of the best. Whether Wall-E is it, is questionable. However, I don't think people should vote a 1 just to bring down the ranking of this film - the ultimate flaw of this site. Too many people are afraid of their favorite movie being taken over by something else. Vote on the movie, not on its ranking. People also need to stop complaining about the ""green"" material in the movie. Seriously, get over it.<br/><br/>That said, this movie is a glorious achievement. Nothing has been characterized so much by using so little, especially in animation. The CGI is second to none, and I fell in love with the characters from the start. It's one of those movies that has a little bit of everything: laughs, cries, surprises, drama. The storyline is seamless, and I didn't get bored at all. I walked out truly mesmerized.<br/><br/>The downfall of the movie, if any, is the target audience. Being an animation and made by Pixar, many children are expected to see the movie. However, I don't think children have the mind-set for this film. It is so much more than animation; more than silly humor with silly cartoon actions. It is a drama, with meaning behind everything - something a child can't yet recognize. It may be difficult for a child to watch without lots of dialogue, so you shouldn't be surprised if your child falls asleep while watching.<br/><br/>An Oscar for best animated film is without a doubt. Bravo."
"infornographic","10","6","11","7 July 2008"," Where have all the perceptive robots gone?
","It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity. -Albert Einstein<br/><br/>While reading on certain criticism drawn by the underlying social and ecological commentary in Disney Pixar's recent WALL-E, I cannot help but believe that these alleged displays of irresponsibility shown through the movie are inferred only through the critics' total lack of perception and their completely missing the point. <br/><br/>The post-apocalyptic climate is not a staggering, clumsy accusation against the imminent outcome of big business or consumerism. Indeed, the city-sized shopping centres laid to waste, the spectacular sky-scrapers of garbage awaiting disposal, all shockingly remind us of true dilemmas of our time, but the movie does not stop at such a simplistic accusation (and instead, goes on to make a much more complicated one?). No, once one sees the human u(dys)topia far off in a mind-bogglingly gigantic space vacation resort, it is obvious that big business has not only rid us of a garbage-ridden existence, but supplied us with a perfectly sanitised, convenient, comfortable, effortless hedonism. <br/><br/>It is this hedonism that the movie attempts to unveil, I consider, as the true antagonism of mankind. In our world, while pollution, energy, and quality of life each make up an intimidating problematic in themselves, there is an underlying human tendency, a techno-crazed, comfort-fueled desire like a ghost, which is shockingly mirrored in WALL-E's world. In this world, humans are saturated with information, over-connected through their internet devices, yet entirely unattached to themselves, each other, and the world around them. A lack of variety bores them, but this same lacking deprives them of the imagination and ambition to act differently, so that when a couple of characters have their devices accidentally de-activated, they discover pleasures in activities completely unbeknownst to them. <br/><br/>But technology in itself is in no way to blame. The robots in WALL-E's world are only built to service our needs, to keep us clean, fed, comfortable, and (for the most part) informed. In truth, it seems we have created a robot-infested heaven. Robot labour in this movie has given solution to poverty, healthcare, pollution, but has done nothing to aid our humanity. In fact, it has, to an appalling degree, served to isolate humanity into innocuous, septic, uneventful lives. <br/><br/>It is no surprise then, that Andrew Stanton takes this Albert Einstein quote to a literal dimension when creating his character: the more human-than-human last Waste Allocation robot on the face of the Earth. He embodies ""mankind's"" lost satisfaction of physical achievement, the satisfaction of doing, of working, of purpose. WALL-E reminds the public that creating a humane personality takes time, exploration, solitude, adversity, and a never-ending spirit of curiosity. And love, and the fascination, hurt, pain, and sacrifice that entail it, all those conditions that mankind in WALL-E's world pushed away and forgot while protecting their lives of perfect comfort. <br/><br/>Like Einstein, I can only hope for the day when our technology will aid our conscience, our humanity, and help us make more incredibly perceptive movies such as this. ;)"
"dmrotstein","6","8","16","24 September 2009"," The only problem is suspension of disbelief
","Once again, Pixar has created a masterpiece in terms of animation, character development, fine details, and humor. As always, the plot is hardly original, but feels like it is. The musical score isn't as good as in Cars, but what would be? Sufficient to say that I was mesmerized by this movie and couldn't help but watching it over and over again. So why 6 and not 10, like any other Pixar movie to date (except Finding Nemo, which is simply too sad for a review)? Here's my problem: A plot can suggest anything, no matter how weird, but whatever happens, it must be internally consistent. There is nothing unbelievable about toys that come to life, or a world of cars or monsters or sentient bugs - those are legitimate concepts in the context of their respective movies. But here we have a world much like our own, which was destroyed by garbage, of all things. Why is it not self-consistent? Because we are presented with a civilization, which, despite its flaws (commercially oriented, monopoly-ruled), have achieved unimaginable technological wonders in terms of efficiency and reliability. Forget the hyper-drive, hover-cars, and blasters - those are sci-fi banalities. But here we have a ship, built for a five-year mission, but lasted centuries without any major malfunction. We have a robot the size of a child that flies with supersonic speeds, hovers constantly (even in a dormant state), and has a firepower of a large 20th century battleship. And she doesn't even need to recharge! Obviously she has an incredibly efficient but very small power source. And I mean very small, because we know she's almost entirely hollow inside! WALL-E himself is even more amazing - he's capable of fast motion and heavy lifting, not to mention a laser-like cutter, and his processor is powerful enough to sustain intelligence. But to power all that he has only a square foot worth of solar panel. Even if the panel is 100% efficient, its maximum output can't be greater than a 100 watts. But it only takes a few seconds to charge the batteries for many hours, if not days. That implies power requirements that a single AA battery can easily provide! And remember that those batteries are 700 years old! But the most amazing item is the fact that there is a lot of garbage on the ship, and it's constantly being ejected into space along with the air in the ejection chamber. At this rate, over the course of 700 years, the amount of ejected garbage would be many times the total mass of the ship, and the air would be completely gone long before that. Obviously, there is some sort of a matter-energy converter on board that keeps producing new raw materials, new air, and so on, and this production is easier and cheaper than garbage recycling, otherwise why dump it? The bottom line is that a civilization having such a technology shouldn't even produce any garbage, but even if it does, then with the resources which allow to send the entire Earth's population (and a very large one, considering the amounts of garbage we see) to luxury space cruises, it will not, can not meet its downfall because of garbage. In fact it could easily reconstruct the entire Earth's ecology from scratch. It would even make more sense to stuff the BNL fleet with this garbage and dump it all into the Sun. It would be enormously cheaper and safer to construct underground or domed cities, if the population was indeed interfering with the cleanup (and why would it?). An army of EVEs could melt all the garbage in a matter of days. And so on. But the best they could come up with was a bunch of tiny garbage picking robots? Give me a break! No, the very basis of the plot is too weak to make sense. Worse yet, unlike the characters, the plot is severely undeveloped. Where are all the other ships? What about the government? It's like the humanity was intentionally ""simplified"" to make life easy for the writers. But the second half of the movie is based on the most simplistic concept ever - put object A into object B (the plant into a detector in this case), and all the problems will be magically and instantly solved, with no additional effort. Such primitivism can work only once - and so it did in ""Lord of the Rings"", but enough is enough. Finally, the movie is plagued with silly and totally unnecessary astrophysical mistakes (too many to mention here). Carl Sagan was right when he suggested that every sci-fi film should have at least a graduate physics student as a consultant. The Galaxy is only a billion miles wide? People fall down in space? Microgravity!? Come on! Given all that, a 6 is more than this movie deserves. But it does deserve at least that - it's a wonderful, magical, emotional movie with an appropriate happy ending. It's just that it's based on a very poor script."

There's humor, intrigue, anticipation...and for children no doubt...some moments that may be a bit scary.<br/><br/>The story is cute...but it doesn't contain many surprises.<br/><br/>The characters designs were Pixar's biggest roadblock to giving a heart to this film. For example, the title character has virtually no facial expression except for movement to it's eyes. The animators were able to put some expression into Wall-E's ""body"" movements...but again this was very limited by Wall-E's mechanical, metal body. Wall-E speaks in a ""computerized"" voice that even further limits his expression.<br/><br/>EVE, the other lead character, is even more limited, with expression mostly conveyed though very simple LED eyes and no other facial features. Her body is somewhat rigid and her arms are joint less and she has no legs...so most of her personality comes through her computerized voice.<br/><br/>Wall-E has an insect companion...again with no facial expression so again all of its ""expression"" is conveyed through its body language and movement.<br/><br/>This design concept is repeated with all the other mechanical characters in the film.<br/><br/>The 3D human characters, especially later in the film, are identical clones of each other with very little differences allowing you to tell one character from another. At this point, except for one, they all even wear the same clothes.<br/><br/>If Pixar was trying to tie its own hands...and make it as difficult to create endearing characters for an audience to connect to...they did an excellent job.<br/><br/>The children sitting behind me sat quietly through-out the film and at the end they lightly applauded.<br/><br/>So while this film is up to Pixar's usual impeccable production and animation standards...the story and characters held it down for me.<br/><br/>Pixar's short feature before the film was very enjoyable with lots of heart and laughs...and may make this a DVD worth adding to my collection some day.<br/><br/>Sorry Pixar...I'd still work for you any day!!!! : )"

I know when I go to see a Pixar film that they will have given it the best they've got. Their animation is peerless, they really work the story.

And, additional point taken, we, the humans, are really okay, once we wake up. Is there anything that's not cliché in here? Ungh. <br/><br/>And the human characters.

BUT, the story was even worse on 2nd viewing. It just doesn't hold together well. EVE is looking for life, but blasts anything that moves. EVE is looking for life, but the cockroach doesn't set off her alarm. They make a point of showing the artificial gravity turning on when the ship carrying EVE returns to the AXIOM, so how come when OTTO tilts the ship everyone slides to one side? If OTTO got these orders not to return to Earth, why send working EVE probes out? Wall-E is so broken at the end that after EVE repairs him, he's just a standard issue Wall- E...but only for a while.

It also seemed that the message was thought up on the spur of the moment as Pixar probably agreed that it lacked substamce. It is a SHOCKINGLY BAD FILM. A one out of 10 is generous."

The movie started out slow and didn't pick up till nearly half an hour in and even then it still wasn't very good. It didn't get reasonably descent till about halfway into it+. I thought the story was very common and the only real modification to it was that it was set 700 years in the future and the main characters were robots.

","I went to see ""Wall-E"" today and expected to get my money's worth -- but did not. I was gravely disappointed and appalled at its content. It does not measure up to previous Pixar movies. Within 5 minutes, I felt sick to my stomach. It seemed as though I was watching an unrealistic version, even though it was computer animated, of Al Gore's global warming hoax, ""An Unfortunate Truth"". Throughout the entire film, I felt I was being barraged by a propaganda tool as I sat among many families with young children in the theatre. ""Wall-E"" depicts a dead, life-deprived world of the near future, machines in control of people, and portrays all people as fat, stupid, and irresponsible with no idea of outside issues. It has a very unpatriotic theme designed toward creating an atmosphere of despair, fear, and uncertainty. Pixar should remember that it is a family-geared entertainment company. This film openly and shamelessly presents the desire to be politically correct and passes it off as appropriate entertainment for children."
"marclenard","6","7","14","3 July 2008"," Wall-E - Good concept for first 30 minutes
","I attended this movie on the first day, with my wife and two sons aged 8 and 2. We own all of the Pixar films except Cars, which I thought was mildly entertaining but largely beneath Pixar's other offerings. Our favorite remains Monsters Inc. I think that I'll buy this movie when its released to DVD, but its not on its merits as a kids film. I'm not sure they would care to watch it again until they're older. The children were not transfixed by the whole movie, and its adult subtexts were a little too - Dreamworks-y.<br/><br/>The quality of the animation is unquestionably good, and the first part of the movie where we meet Wall-E and then Eve is fun and could even be considered a breakthrough in terms of their limited vocabulary and pantomime. The live action scenes of humans didn't mesh with the devolved animated humans that we meet later, so I found that to be a limiting factor to the continuity. Use of show tunes mixed with polluted Earth was felt so cynical and was such a downer, that it colored my whole attitude from the opening on. The rampaging robots on the ship felt like filler. It seemed like a means to tie this to other Pixar films with some forced whimsy. I didn't feel like human's deserved to have the Earth back. It felt like a hollow ending that was unrealistic. I don't like that the humans return to rule the Earth.<br/><br/>Overall, I find it technically good, but sloppy in execution and heavy handed with its message."
"KrazzyDJ","9","5","9","3 January 2010"," A highly entertaining, delightful science-fiction film that should not be dismissed as childish animation
","I had heard about this film since quite a long time. My first thought was that could an ""Animation"" film supposedly created for kids work as a science-fiction movie for me ? After realizing the positive reception that this film had garnered, I decided to watch this. It would be a first for me in the sense that this was the first animated feature film that I would be viewing. And now, after having done that, I'm glad that I stepped into the territory of animation. WALL·E is not just a fun-filled animation movie meant for kids. It is at par with any feature film featuring big stars, sets and budgets ever made and is much better than most of them.<br/><br/>The story is mainly told through visuals (although quite a bit of dialog creeps in during the last hour) and is best deciphered by the viewers themselves instead of being explained in such a review. It's set about 700-800 years into the future when Earth is in a mess, mankind has settled into space and the only moving thing left on Earth is a robot named WALL·E - this should more than suffice. Although there are no dialogs for a major portion of the film, it is much simpler to understand yet gets more complex as you start analyzing it in detail. This kind of treatment comes across as far more effective (at least for me) than say the one in 2001: A Space Odyssey which relies heavily on visuals leaving almost all of the deciphering to the viewer. As such, WALL·E is as simple or complex as you perceive it to be (although for the most part, it is the former).<br/><br/>Despite having a short running time, the film packs in much more than many 2+ hour extravaganzas and credit for this must go to the writing, direction and editing - all absolutely first rate. The screenplay is packed in with twists and turns that rarely do we come across moments where nothing happens on screen. Some people have criticized as the opening minutes of the film boring - WALL·E apparently simply goes about doing his stuff. But according to me, those sequences do exactly what they're meant to do - they not only provide us with a glimpse of the everyday life of WALL·E (which is boring and mundane) but also gives an insight into WALL·E's loneliness as also the fact that he longs for companionship. The editing is flawless and one scene just flows into the next (many scenes spring up a surprise or two as well).<br/><br/>Technically the film looks polished and the first twenty minutes will leave you wondering whether you're indeed watching an animation film or a shot live-action one. It's only when the humans enter the picture that you realize that its animation. The lighting in the future earth sequences is so live-action Esq, it makes those sequences all the more appealing. Just looking at the principal characters, you can see that it has taken a lot of effort.<br/><br/>The main reason that the film works (for me at least) on such a huge level is (besides the story and treatment) is the main character WALL·E. He is simply put the perfect representation of an endearing, hard-working, polite yet cute robot representing humility and empathy. And his eyes are probably his best feature - they are so expressive that WALL·E doesn't need the mouth, shoulders, or even words to communicate or express the emotions that he goes through - the eyes say it all. In short he is the star of the film.<br/><br/>WALL·E works on any and every level you want it to. What then is disappointing about this film ? Not much except that I was really looking forward to the music in the trailers being a part of the film and was heartbroken to find out that it wasn't. Also, the future humans could have been a bit better - they look far too cartoonish especially when compared to the film's look in the earth sequences. I guess I've become used to complaining which is what makes me feel as if something's missing from a movie. On the positive side, I believe this prevents me from rating a movie 10/10 at the drop of a hat. Nevertheless, these complaints do not take away from the fact that WALL·E is, in almost all aspects, a superior film and should not just be dismissed as an animation film meant for kids - it has a good message hidden inside it. And yes, this film has allowed me to open the doors of my mind to a new genre of movies - animated films. For me, Toy Story's next.<br/><br/>Score: 8.7/10 (Rounded off to 9/10)"
"cosmorados","9","5","9","27 January 2009"," Not just one of the best animated films, but one of the best films of all time
","As the film starts in space with a song from Hello Dolly, you wonder just quite what you're getting yourself into. A few moments later we are transported to Earth, up-to-it's eyeballs in garbage, however help is at hand, in the cuboid shape of WALL-E, a waste allocation load lifter, Earth-class. Once WALL-E was part of a huge herd of robotic trash compactors built to help the human race get out of the mess it had made, while they stayed in space, waiting for everything to be sorted. However, it's 700 years later and only one WALL-E is left and on his own he has become a tad eccentric. With only a cockroach as a friend he spends his time doing his job and trying to learn more about the people who once inhabited this little world. Of course if that was the entire film it wouldn't be very good and shortly after it starts WALL-E is joined by EVE, a far more advanced model whose mission is a secret.<br/><br/>This is Pixar's most ambitious film to date. From the moment the title appears and the music really kicks in we feel this is different to the cutesy world of superheroes and talking cars and animals that have gone before. This is a film that has elements that are grim, unsettling and ask difficult questions about what we are doing as custodian's of the planet. The script and story are an absolute triumph as the skill's of the animator's to make those hundred's of pixels perform in such charming, heart-warming ways is a joy to watch.<br/><br/>The pacing of the film, unlike Nemo, The Incredibles and Cars is flawless and you get the feeling that a lot was sacrificed to keep that running time as tight and precise as it is. There is not a frame wasted, nor one shot too many. However, the thing that gets me most about this film, no matter how many times I watch this film I see something new that I haven't seen before. The lighting looks like a real film, the pauses and reactions from the robot performers are exquisite with more than a nod being shown to the silent pioneers at the turn of the last century who started this thing called cinema off. After watching this I think they'd be proud to see how far their medium has come.<br/><br/>There's a saying that you can't polish a turd, and sadly in the media these days hundreds of millions of dollars are spent polishing so many expensive summer turds (Dark Knight anyone?) This was a joy to watch and discover that in spite of the stupidity of this business of show, there are still worlds full of sparkle, Barnaby! A Masterpiece of the medium.<br/><br/>Nuff said."
"Dushqueen","9","5","9","21 December 2008"," Definitely did it for me! - An Instant Classic from Pixar
","After Finding Nemo I thought Pixar will never make another movie that will touch me as much as Marvin and Dory duo did. Wall-e is their successor, no question. Neither Incredibles, Cars or Ratatouille did it for me, but this year Wall-e has make a huge impact, not only for their amazing ""out of this world"" animation skills but also for the subtle but yet well made environmental message and the great ability of telling a meaningful story with few words.<br/><br/>As soon as you see Wall-e on the screen, you can't help your self of being all cheering and caring for this little fellow. Great work developing this character and giving a heart and soul to a metal rubbish carrier. Just amazing!. The interaction Wall-e/ Eve was very cute and sad at the same time and the whole story keeps you laughing and entertained the whole 98 minutes.<br/><br/>One of the great things about Finding Nemo which I think was the key of their success, was the fact that you actually care for the characters (especially no being humans) and that chemistry between the 2 very different main characters transcend beyond a clichéd romance. This is the case of Wall-e, a lonely character that for the first time in his robotic life he finally found a true friend. A simple but very profound story that works perfectly and is attractive, not only to kids but adults too.<br/><br/>Wall-e is certainly a big triumph for Pixar and easily an instant classic of animation. I can see a season full of awards for Disney this year ahead."
"howie_yippy","10","5","9","24 October 2008"," Hugely entertaining with lots of messages
","As usual, WALL-E is a hugely entertaining animation movie brought to you by Disney/Pixar; however, I think WALL-E is much more than that: it has more messages than an average kid can get hold of. It deals with matters such as consumerism, people's reliance on technology and, of course, environmental protection.<br/><br/>The film also embraces a number of classic objects (e.g. the Rubik's Cube) and movies (its reference to 2001: A Space Odyssey and its use of Hello, Dolly!). For the main story, I particularly like the romance between WALL-E and EVE: it's quite rare to have a love relationship between two robots being so adorable!<br/><br/>I really, really enjoy WALL-E and would recommend it even to those who don't normally like sci- fi/animation movies!"
"bob the moo","Null","5","9","15 September 2008"," Beautifully crafted and charming film that appeals to adults and children without having two films in one but by making it all work for both
","It took me a minute to get round to seeing this film, mainly due to letting the kids clear out of the cinema and the hype / pester power effect on the audience demographic settle down some. Finally getting to see it for myself I was pleased to find that it is the probably the most accomplished Pixar film since, well, since the last one. Of course the most obvious way that things has stepped up yet again is technically as the film is beautifully animated with even convincing dust hanging in the atmosphere and even the humans ""real"" (well, real in the context of the Pixar universe anyway). The level of detail is not only technically impressive but also impressive in the imagination and creativity in making this world and characters. However its in the characters where the film is most impressive. Without a great deal of dialogue to speak of it is amazing that the film manages to create characters that are not only cute and funny but also that the audience care about and for, and this is what the film achieves, making Wall-E an ET for this generation. The plot operates on two levels and the characters are most important for the simple, very human, love story between Wall-E and Eve. This thread is charmingly delivered throughout and it is hard not to feel for Wall-E as he seeks out the simple feelings and gestures that he has watched nightly for hundreds of years.<br/><br/>Operating above this is a plot that owes a debt to Silent Running in the same way as Wall-E himself owes something to Huey and Dewey. With a heavier hand at the wheel, this would have been a very preachy and obvious eco-message but with Stanton it is actually pretty smart and manages to reach children without being clumsy and obvious for adults. Actually this also applies to the humour as well because there is not so much of a duality where aspects of the film are divided  so the character falling over is for kids but the one-liner that follows is for adults; instead Wall-E pretty much pitches everything to the benefit of the film and story. OK so we still get the references but they are not put in so much as woven in  hard to explain perhaps but if you watch this versus, for example, Shrek, you'll see what I mean  Wall-E is not some pop-culture reference-driven film that will be old in a few years once people forget who the celebs were that year. This strengths the film further by just feeling like an all-round engaging and enjoyable film  OK the level or depth that you watch it to will vary between adults and children, but it is this that is different  not WHAT they are watching so much as how.<br/><br/>The ""cast"" of the film are really the animators because, aside from a nice touch of casting in Weaver, the majority of work is done by them. As such Wall-E and Eve are very expressive considering what they are. It is all in tiny movements on the ""faces"" and in the body language  actors struggle to always do it without dialogue so how much harder is it to get it right when you are creating it on a computer? The answer I guess would be ""much harder"" which is why it is so impressive that with barely a word spoken we manage to care so much for these robots.<br/><br/>Wall-E will almost certainly win the Oscar for Best Animated Feature but, for probably the first time, Pixar have a film that genuinely deserves consideration for Best Feature  it is that engaging, well crafted and charming and manages to do that for all sections of the audience without resorting to the oft-used (and mostly fun) ""one for me, one for you"" style of some of these films."
"Alise_shenle","10","5","9","4 September 2008"," A Convenient Truth
","Wall E is the most excellent, thought provoking film there is since SpiderMan's (with great power comes great responsibility). It gives us the haunting truth about the 'utopia' life we'll have, if we don't do something NOW to conserve this wonderful planet, to stop pollution. Using actions instead of words, Wall E continues to do his duty though he is the only one left. He is also very humane, caring for the cockroach, and very friendly towards Eve, though she tried to kill him many times at first. He would also sacrifice himself for Earth, and he nearly died. Wall E might tremble at the sight of a spaceship, but he is incredibly brave in rescuing Eve and the shoot. The scene with the couple singing and holding hands really strikes a chord into our hearts. He might be outdated as a robot, but he would do anything to save Earth. Eve was at first a cold robot, but after Wall E touches her, she became more interesting, especially when she thought Wall E had forgotten her, she looked so crushed. She was also cool as a flying supergirlfriend. Also, though she likes to laser many things, she is nice to the cockroach too. The captain is a nice guy, he is willing to do what many generations ahead of him had opted for the easy way, face the damage of earth and do his best, because THIS IS OUR HOME!! He'd rather do the right thing than the easy thing. GO! The idea of humans becoming lazy and dependent on robots is frightening. We would only care about ourselves and dump Earth. Maybe dump the spaceship too if it's got too much trash. I hope we will not end up like this!! Can't even stand, or turn over, relying on a robot and chair. Wall E is great! DON'T MISS THE BEST MOVIE THERE EVER WAS!"
"DICK STEEL","10","5","9","29 August 2008"," A Nutshell Review:
","In some strange twist of Fate, the local release of recent Pixar movies always had us here twiddling our thumbs wondering when it'll finally make its way to the screens, while we hear the accolades ring from the rest of the world in marvelling at the quality that Pixar continually churns out. It's likely that the distributors want to coincide the release with the local school holidays, but frankly, the money also comes from the adult crowd, as testament to this full house in one of the largest screens downtown during a late night screening with nary a noisy kid in tow.<br/><br/>And I may sound like a broken record, but Pixar has done it again. Quality stories with quality animation, and it kept the run time to a manageable under 100 minutes, compared to the previous offering Ratatouille, which clocked near 120 minutes (or actually felt that long). I never expected WALL·E to pack in such a strong emotional punch, not that Pixar has never animated non-living objects before (such as Cars), but there's a certain child like innocence appeal that WALL·E possesses, that makes him very charming, and very endearing to the audience.<br/><br/>As a Waste Allocation Load Lifter-Earth-Class, Isaac Asimov's Robot directives has him firmly and dutifully carrying out his duties of compacting Earth's rubbish, as the last of its class on Earth to clean up the mess. Humans have now polluted the world so much that they took to Space in Star Trek inspired ship designs, to live out there while WALL·Es take over to do some massive spring cleaning. Until of course, our WALL·E becomes like The Last Man, erm, Robot on Earth with a cockroach companion, acting and emoting superbly that puts Will Smith to shame.<br/><br/>The fantastic thing about WALL·E is that it can tell so much by so little. The first few minutes establish everything we need to know about the current world, and paints a very humanistic, soulful value to the dusty, dirty and rickety robot. He (see what I mean?) has a lot of eccentricities, and in performing his duties, develops quirks and becomes a collector (of junk) of sorts, which allows the creators to pump in plenty of sight gags and inside jokes ranging from sound effects (I swear my Apple is now a WALL·E pre-cursor) to paying homage to movies such as 2001: A Space Odessey.<br/><br/>In essence, WALL·E is a love story in human terms, where the boy tries hard to get the girl, only to have her spurn his advances. EVE (which stands for Extraterrestial Vegetation Evaluator) is WALL·E's object of affection, who got sent to Earth as a probe for life. And my, she's a difficult one to handle, being state of the art, as well as packing a mean self-defense mechanism that makes breaking the ice really difficult. Not to mention as well, a fiery temper to boot. Which means our guy has to really try, and try hard, to break that wall down. Poor thing really, because all he wanted to do, was to hold her hand. The Beatles would have been proud.<br/><br/>But of course you'll have to throw in tougher adversary and events to make it all the more worthwhile in WALL·E's pursuit of EVE, which spans lightyears and a plant that becomes the catalyst for their romance. A lot of the movie takes place on board The Axiom, the human ship where a vision of the future is presented, which metaphorically holds a mirror up to ourselves in our over reliance in technology that we're beginning to grow sideways, and not noticing the things that nature has in store for us, human to human communication, and the things that matter. It also has an soft environmental message and stance thrown in, but done so subtly that you wouldn't feel that it's being preachy and a turn off.<br/><br/>I hate to admit it too that the movie turned me into a big softie, especially its clichéd finale, where you know what will happen, but yet want to second guess if the filmmakers could be so heartless with an ending that I thought would really make me shed a tear. However, it's Disney after all, and when you think of merchandise opportunities, then business sense prevails.<br/><br/>WALL·E deserves every acclaim that it's got, and let me contribute mine too. If you have time to only watch one animated movie this year, or want to bring your kids to one, then make no mistake, WALL·E is the perfect choice, without a doubt, hands down. It makes it to my books as contender for the top 10 movies of the year. Highly recommended stuff, and the leads don't even speak much save to call out to each other!<br/><br/>Oh, do put your bum on the seat early too, as with all Pixar features, there's always a short that preluded it, and Presto is nothing short of hilarious, and a crowd pleaser to rouse the audience into a frenzy before the main act takes over. I guess it's high time I purchase the collection of Pixar shorts available on DVD as well."

So when I went to Yahoo and saw a number of users rating it in the C,D,F range (causing the user aggregate to be a B-) I was perplexed and a bit saddened. The reviewers who didn't like it REALLY hated it for all the reasons I loved the movie: great story (they were bored and thought it preachy), fantastic characters (they were annoyed by the multiple utterences of ""eva"", ""walle""), stunning visuals (they thought was too bleak), perfect direction (again - they were bored. that 1st 20-30min of no dialog should win an Oscar - just brilliant), mesmerizing score (they didn't comment on this, but man I love Thomas Newman's work. and Andrew Stanton's use of the Hello Dolly songs is just genius). I know that nothing, no film, no proposal, nothing will every get 100% approval, that's just how life works - everyone has an opinion, but when I read some of the negative scathing comments it just makes me wonder who these people are and why they are that way. The Pixar folks tell timeless tales using state of the art technology and good old fashioned creativity.

No originality in creating a different looking robot. I could only watch the first half hour and then had to leave the room and let the kids watch it. I have read all the good and excellent reviews about it and I just don't get it. I haven't seen any good animated films over past few years and I think it's because the animation is being done by computers.

"thelastfabares","6","8","17","6 July 2008"," The best animated movie EVER MADE in human history.......NO!!!
","I am tired of everyone praising this movie as absolute perfection and saying that it is the best animated movie ever. Come on! Please.....<br/><br/>The movie was a visual feast with excellent animation, but it has much less heart than many other films and some major story-telling flaws.<br/><br/>Most of all, I am tired of seeing someone point these flaws out, only to get lambasted by all of the other Wall-e lovers that do not even consider some of the valid points made. <br/><br/>I love robots and i think that the animation in Wall-e was excellent. I like the Luxo Jr. short too, but I wouldn't want to watch it for an hour.<br/><br/>Instead of writing a novel, I'll just list some of the reasons why Wall-e is not the end at best animated movie ever in the history of the art form.<br/><br/>1) writing was weak, with way too much physical chaplinesque humor filling in the gaps. 2) there was no antagonist until 3/4 the way through, and once the conflict started it was over too fast. 3) did not identify with any of the characters, especially the humans. Why would the fat captain change everything to go back. 4)Wall-e, the main character, goes through no change whatsoever. It is EVE who actually evolves as a character.<br/><br/>PIXAR, the first to make a feature length 3D animated movie----used live action actors in the scenes referring to Earth's past. Live actors! They should have committed to either using 3D characters or live ones. This is PIXAR we're talking about here, the leader in 3D animation. They could have figured it out.<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda was a much better movie for one reason - it was a joy to watch and a lot of fun. After seeing it I wanted to see it over and over again. After Wall-e, I was disappointed, especially after the amazing films that were Ratatouille and Cars.<br/><br/>Just because it is a PIXAR movie doesn't mean that it has the necklace of immunity and can not get voted off of the growing island of 3D animation studios. I could list dozens of better animated features if I only had the space."
"H_Spengler","3","10","23","11 January 2009"," Well, at least the animation is good
","Because nothing else about this movie is likable. I said it about Ratatouille and i'll say it again for this movie. After such amazing films as ""Finding Nemo"", ""Monster's Inc."" and ""Cars"", I thought I could depend on Pixar for a great story, engaging characters and top notch animation, here, as with Ratatouille only one third makes it....the animation!!<br/><br/>After hearing all the hype about this for months and months, I rented it out. This has to be one of the dullest movies i've seen in a long time. Worker robot (Wall E) who trash compacts alone on the pollution scorched Earth(which by the way, how successful is he working by himself on a whole PLANET?!!) becomes lovestruck with robot scanner droid sent to find vegetation. He spends the duration of the movie in pursuit of said Scanner Droid (Eve). A ROBOT LOVE story? Give me a break! Robots do just what they're programmed to do, they lack emotions, or even the capacity to feel or develop them. At least offer me a reason why a robot would have emotions, especially a trash compacting worker bot.<br/><br/>The movie is so dull, boring and repetitive that I was actually shocked. Aside from that the not so subtle hit you over the head concepts of ""pollution is bad, and we need to act now."" Humans are also fat lazy, slobs who look like large doddling infants having grown morbidly obese with lack of mobility. Aside from the herd of humans, the only other characters are the aforementioned robots and a couple of other late in the movie robot sidekicks. None of them manage to be interesting, and I honestly could care less what happened to ANY of them. <br/><br/>Wall E himself, i'll have to admit is interesting looking. If ""Johnny 5"" from the ""Short Circuit"" series and ""Herb"" the dish-washing robot from the underrated ""Robots"" movie, had a child, it would look like Wall E. ""Eve"" reminds me of a Japanese toy robot. Overall I really can't complain animation wise.<br/><br/>Both robots barely speak more than their own names, or each others names throughout the film. It really grates on your nerves after a while. Anyhow, I guess besides the not to subtle ""green"" plot, the whole point is for ""Eve"" to bring back a seedling/weed to a giant spaceship filled with the obese humans, so they can go and return to the now ""clean"" Earth. Wall E, of course inadvertently becomes part of this plot when his love sickness causes him to hitch a ride on the ship carrying Eve to the large spaceship. <br/><br/>There's some crap about the ""auto pilot"" not wanting to return to the Earth despite the captain's orders (BTW-do any other 80's nerds think that the ""auto pilot"" looks like ""Max"" the pilot robot from ""Flight of the Navigator?"") Good of course triumphs as the human pilot and the robots win, and are taken back to Earth. Of course when they get there Earth is not renewed completely as it still is filled with cubes of scrap and some scattered weeds/seedlings. I felt like standing up and saying. ""Yeah, you thought it was gonna be like in the pictures didn't you?!!"" With how morbidly obese they appear it'd be a miracle if they were able to help with restoration at all! Besides, with all the mysterious dust storms that were seen over the course of the movie, how the hell did those vulnerable seedlings even survive?! <br/><br/>Here are the things I liked about the movie: Sigourney Weaver's voice, John Ratzenberger's obligatory Pixar cameo, and Wall E's pet roach who believe it or not is the best character in the movie. The only time I laughed when it was something roach related. Kids are probably to young to appreciate the subtle humor ""factoids"" about the almost indestructibleness of the roach. This little guy is squashed or vaporized at least 3 times and just gets right back up, brushes off and continues like nothing happened (pretty much like a real roach.) Also, I didn't fail to notice that on apocalyptic Earth seemingly the only things to survive would be roaches and twinkies (both probably very true!) <br/><br/>Giving 3/10 for animation, and the roach/twinkie thing. In the meantime i'll keep my fingers crossed for the old Pixar formula on their next venture."

","It is undeniable that Pixar make pretty pictures. The animation is amazing but this story is mellifluous mindless drivel and spectacularly boring.The vote results have again confirmed for me that the majority of IMDb users have no appreciation of film culture or history. I have no issues with mindless entertainment but giving this forgettable summer fare a score of over 9 and having it rank higher than ""The Godfather"" and just about every other true cinematic masterpiece ever produced is a reminder of how the American general public are pathetically devoid of film culture.

I really started watching this movie with an open mind, but from the tedious intro, to the completely forced romance, the boring non-existent story and up to the stupid final I was utterly and completely disappointed. I think the rave reviews come from the kind of people for whom whatever's new is the best thing ever.<br/><br/>Wall-e falls in love in a second, with a robot the audience has never seen. Whenever I see this kind of romance in a live movie, I know I'm watching a bad romance.<br/><br/>All the humans are extremely fat. All of them. They can't even walk. Men and women. So that means no one is having sex? It's just not realistic. Sex is a basic need. At least for men it is! ;)<br/><br/>--- SPOILER ALERT ---<br/><br/>Read the following sentence only if you've already seen the movie... When the humans get back to earth, at the end of this drivel, they are happy to find that earth is a complete dump?! There's no way to survive like this!

Ratatouille was so-so, 7.5/10. It had some good elements. I'm not sure if Pixar's growing down or if I'm growing up, but this movie was pretty dull. The short film at the beginning is wonderful, 10/10. But the movie itself was not. There were quite a few laugh out loud scenes. (Like when WALLE and EVE kiss with their foreheads and he floats away, or when he continually scratches M-Os floor.) But most of it was not entertaining.

","Wall-E...<br/><br/>This movie is truly amazing. Before Wall-E I hadn't seen a movie in which there was no, or almost no, dialog. And yet, using hand gestures or facial expressions, the viewer can perfectly fill in what is going on.<br/><br/>But I am getting ahead of myself.<br/><br/>Wall-E is the story about a small, clumsy cleaning robot that got left behind on Earth to clean up the mess we, mankind, left behind when we fled for the stars. Poor Wall-E fulfills his daily duty even after hundreds of years. Then, one day, a strange spaceship lands on Earth and deploys a searching drone, called EVE. Wall-E falls in love with the female (apparently) drone, but the feeling isn't mutual. EVE is looking for something important. Wall-E slowly tries to make contact with his mysterious visitor, and eventually succeeds. And when EVE returns with her mission completed, Wall-E follows her. A crazy adventure in space is what results from there...<br/><br/>The computer animation art is truly beautiful. Everything looks so smooth, so detailed and so very... alive. You'll forget after awhile that 80% of the characters in this movie are robots. They seem so human! It's a bit hard to explain here.<br/><br/>There is very good music in this film too. Very moving, powerful music that fits with the scenes nicely.<br/><br/>Like I said, there is almost no dialog. It really adds to this movie and makes it an unique experience.<br/><br/>Wall-E is in my honest opinion the best Disney/Pixar movie of 2009. A wonderful movie for young and old; it's a gem you will not forget anytime soon and will probably watch multiple times over the years to come.<br/><br/>On a side note, I think it was a nice touch that Sigourney Weaver did the voice for the space ship's computer...<br/><br/>Wall-E is definitely a must-see for everyone. Your heart will melt.<br/><br/>10 bright stars!"

Also, this movie is for adults too since it had a deep plot about the end of the world. So to tell you the truth, I think parents and other grown-ups might enjoy it more than regular kids, but of course kids will enjoy it as well.

"dj_xand325","9","4","7","18 July 2008"," Astonishing Animation, Beautiful, Cute with an unusually powerful message
","Wall·E is an animation with a distinct difference. Not only does it contain somewhat slapstick kiddy jokes to obviously appeal to children, it has a deep, dark message that will automatically stand out to all adults alike. Wall·E has been described as 2001:A Space Odyssey for all audiences, I agree. They share many similarities such as the lack of dialogue and the breath taking visuals. Furthermore, the story near the end is resembles the man vs machine storyline that was present in 2001: A Space Odyssey with the HAL situation. Not only that, the AUTO looks EXACTLY like HAL. Pixar wanted to pull off a Kubrick inspired animated masterpiece and they have. Its obvious with their use of Kubrickian classical music and the cold robotic voices for the robots.<br/><br/>Anyway, heres the story briefly as in to not ruin it for you. Wall·E is a waste disposal unit who is programmed to clear garbage. He lives on the dystopian earth where mankind is inept due to the heaving amount of rubbish. Wall·E is the only one of his kind and therefore lives a lonely life of waste disposal. Until EVE comes along and builds an ironically romantic relationship with Wall·E. He follows EVE to a strange giant space ship that seems to harbour a new world. Wall·E then finds himself wrapped into a race which could save Mankind.<br/><br/>I mention in the title that this film has a powerful message. I think that I can on behalf of many people that this film really is an eye opener. Its a realistic symbol of capitalism gone wrong, Technology gone wrong and finally waste disposal gone wrong. These commercial problems relate perfectly to current world events and Pixar has released this film at a perfect time. Pixar satirise all of these problems. In this odd world, you can buy lunches in a bottle, advertisements are plastered everywhere you can see, robots help every little movement you want to do and of course the inhabitants are disgracefully obese. People are lazy, stupid and unpleasant. The appearance is glossy and shiny yet cold and distant. This city of Pixaristic satire is a grim image indeed. Is this simply a whining attempt of protest from Pixar? No. This is feasible and people should see it as a reality check. Obesity is rising, Technology is becoming increasingly ridiculous and commercialism is ever rising. Ridley Scott's Bladerunner presents a similar commercial future yet Scott's representation is much darker which Pixar simply couldn't implement for a supposed kids movie!.<br/><br/>As for Wall·E and EVE's relationship, they are both extremely cute and they're relationship was heart warming and beautiful. Its also somewhat ironic that they built a relationship. Wall·E is a clumsy and rusty looking machine yet EVE is a graceful and beautiful robot. But they have one thing in common, they are both alone. I feel that Pixar reveal another message here, that appearance isn't everything. Not the most predominant message but i saw it.<br/><br/>As for the sound, the music used was rhythmic and surprising serious at some times. For example, the opening begins with a rather serious deep tune as the piles of trash on earth is revealed. This is a realisation that this is no kiddys film this is a serious animation beholding serious messages we need to consider. This is what made this so powerful for me. Kids will be watching this but deep down this is not a kids film. Furthermore, the score is consistently exceptional throughout the film and I would some sort of sound based Oscar nomination for Pixar.<br/><br/>The animation was absolutely breath-taking. Pixar have wowed us every year ever since the animated triumph of Toy Story. Last year i was astonished by Ratatouille's animation but Wall·E is a step up. The animation is truly unbelievable, a triumphant achievement of technology.<br/><br/>Pixar have pulled off a masterpiece, a unique conqueration of animation. This must be considered as a serious sci-fi film because it simply is. Only the greatest sci-fi's are as powerful as Wall·E. Pixar should expect many Oscar nominations, Best Animation, Best Cinematography, Best Sound and maybe even Best Picture. Who Knows? Its deserves it Praise for Pixar as they have pulled it off again with their most powerful yet comical sci-fi adventure film.<br/><br/>Well what can i say? Its the best animation I have ever seen so go see it! 9.5/10"
"MrPink08","1","30","88","16 July 2008"," What happened Pixar?
","I liked Toy Story, Cars, and Finding Nemo. Ratatouille was OK. I didn't care much for A Bug's Life or The Incredibles, but that's just me. But Wall-e was an endurance test. It was to see if a person can really watch an annoying film for an hour and a half without falling asleep. You won't fall asleep though. The film is just a loud montage of sound effects, so that will keep your eyes open.<br/><br/>The Wall-e character saves this film. It's one of the cutest things I've seen. He's a little trash collecting robot who roams an abandoned Earth collecting trash and collectibles left behind by the humans, who have disappeared into space and have become fat and lazy. The first 20 minutes of the film were basically I Am Legend with a robot instead of Will Smith and sandstorms instead of vampires. Then a robot named Eve comes to gather a plant on Earth so the humans can go home. Wall-e falls in love with this robot. This good and everything, but their ""conversations"" are unbearable. After a five minute conversation between these two, I had a migraine. The film then moves to space, where it just goes downhill from there.<br/><br/>Wall-e could have been another Pixar classic, but instead goes down the drain. The human cast is given little, if nothing to do. The usually funny Jeff Garlin acts like a moron in his few minutes on screen. Fred Willard is given a pointless role as a CEO of a company. But I must give props to Sigourney Weaver. Hearing her voice as the ship's computer brought back memories of the Alien films.<br/><br/>So, to all you amateur film makers out there, I say this. If you ever feel like your latest film is going nowhere, take a badly tuned radio and place it next to techno music video. Film that for an hour and a half. Who knows? People sure liked it in Wall-e. Maybe they'll like it when you do it, too."

"danpink-1","6","7","15","5 July 2008"," Great beginning, but disappointing
","The first 30 minutes of this movie are brilliant: grim, funny, touching, wonderful visual style, and the wordless creation of a truly lovable character.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it's not only downhill from there, the last ten minutes completely undermine all that was brilliant in a desperate attempt to tack on a ""Hollywood ending."" The director, artists, and screenwriters hauntingly create a believable planet full of garbage, toxic dust storms so devastating that even the indestructible WALLE has to take shelter when they come up. WALLE's loneliness, his breaking heart, his consolation in an old artifact of a dead civilization, and his love for EVE are all heartbreaking, endearing, and carry their message lightly. I was swept away, and until WALLE left earth, I was ready to call this the second greatest animated film ever (after SPIRITED AWAY).<br/><br/>But then it turns into a pretty standard quest film (see WIZARD OF OZ, FINDING NEMO, etc.). Worse yet, when AUTO very sensibly tries to stop the humans from returning to an uninhabitable planet, AUTO is suddenly the bad guy and the authors steal SHAMELESSLY from 2001.<br/><br/>In the end, the humans win out, because if they do in Kubrick, they sure as hell HAVE TO in Disney. Our descendants go back to Earth, and GUESS WHAT! The brilliant opening of the film? Gosh, the filmmakers were just kidding, folks! The earth was habitable after all. All the pathetic roly-poly humans have to do is plant a few geraniums and the sun comes out! The earth turns green! The toxic storms disappear! <br/><br/>I don't insist on popular entertainment being relentlessly down. But my message to the filmmakers: if you want the upbeat ending, then tone down the opening. If you want the grim opening, then the ending is a patent lie. Make up your minds."
"Peter Elefant","4","8","18","9 October 2008"," Too many short circuits for grown ups
","Looking for a movie, that your kids will love and adore? Look no further. This'll do the trick. <br/><br/>Looking, for something for the whole family? This movie fails. <br/><br/>This movie could have been so much more! It could have easily been amongst PIXARs bravest and best! The story pitch really suggested that they were ready to try something new; something bold. Imagine:<br/><br/>A love story between two robots. 'Real' robots, that is, without the physical human attributes found in other animation features like, well, 'Robots', set against the backdrop of a post-apocalyptic Earth.<br/><br/>If one can accept that pre-programmed machines are able to feel love (and that concept was good enough for Kubrick!), this would truly be a movie for the grown ups, investigating that strange, obviously platonical romance between two 'artificials' (echoing the likes of 'Blade Runner'). Two man-made objects, seeking each others companionship in a desolate world of human remains. An idea of such fragile beauty, that one could throw in quite a lot of robo-stick comedy (you know, for the kids!), and still leave something for the everyone. Children wouldn't understand the haunting quality of a dusty wasteland, inexplicably void of people, nor would they get the love story; they'd just enjoy a robot falling on it's metal bum.<br/><br/>It never became that movie. The end product abandons the pioneering spirit of the original idea, and the movie falls back on clichés, predictable gags and an eco-message so heavily stamped in our faces throughout the story, that it becomes borderline sickening, by the end of the film. <br/><br/>The problems are obvious from the get-go: The visual design of WALL-E himself is annoying. He's mainly a dwarfed version of Johnny 5 from 'Short Circuit', with the big dark eyes from ""Puss In Boots"" ('Shrek 2'). The design reeks of ""play it safe"" producing: It's obvious that some producer ""liked the wicked idea"", and then demanded something that was <br/><br/>a) done before b) something cute. <br/><br/>WALL-E is cute; Cute as step-dancing penguins, another safe bet with an ego message.<br/><br/>More annoyingly: this lonely robot is  in fact  not alone. A cockroach, has befriended him. It's called 'Cri-Kee'. Wait. Sorry. That was the name of the cricket in 'Mulan'. Easy to get confused these days...<br/><br/>This benign, loyal side-kick serves no narrative purpose, and seems present only because side-kicks are demanded in these kinds of movies. Again, you can see the producer's memo: ""Love this story, Jones! But.. could the lonely robot perhaps be not entirely alone?""<br/><br/>It wouldn't be fair to discount WALL-E because of cuddle-factor or lack of original design, and that's not his primal malfunction: His problem is that he's a freak! A strange robot, that collects artifacts from an alien (human) civilization, and studies it, caught up in his own lonely despair. <br/><br/>SO when the other main character, EVE, arrives, he immediately starts following her, dragging her around, oblivious as to whether she's 'there' or not.<br/><br/>Okay, I'm being a cynic. The part between the two robots actually works! She's an advanced model, way out of his league, what plays into a ""uptown girl, downtown boy"" kind of romance. Also EVE is by far the funniest character in the movie (the girl has a temper). <br/><br/>WALL-E attempts to impress EVE, with generic slapstick montage sequences to follow. They're predictable, but would again be harmless, if we had any incentive to root for WALL-E, and his desperate wooing of EVE. Being cute/clumsy just doesn't cut it as interesting character traits, and he fails to be likable. <br/><br/>""Puss in Boots"" was also adorable, but also quite deranged in his delusions of grandeur, while self-conscious enough, to use his fluffy-factor, when in a tight spot. WALL-E lacks those comedic layers, and his effectuation for EVE seems desperate.<br/><br/>If the first half of the movie is patchy, that's nothing compared to the second half, where EVE travels back to the spaceship she came from (WALL-E ever desperately clinging on to her).<br/><br/>We now see what has happened to humanity, and the second part seems more engulfed with them, and their dependency upon technology. People have become insanely overweight, uneducated and complacent. They now rely on machines to take care of everything from food to control of their spaceship.<br/><br/>The satire seems thick. Yes, there are overweight Americans. Yes some Americans are less educated. But to suggest that the human race has become stupid, fat and irresponsible, is just a bit thick for me. <br/><br/>EVE and WALL-E become tools in a story bigger than them, and their own romance is drowned. Arguably, by then you'll be happy to look at anyone/thing but WALL-E. I know I was!<br/><br/>People might say: <br/><br/>""Look at how simple the story is! Enjoy the beauty of it!"" <br/><br/>I respectfully disagree. I think they should have gone all out, and created an even simpler story, between two robots. What would have been PIXAR's most mature work yet, becomes it's most simple.<br/><br/>This movie seems overproduced, caved in by the fear of what the public might want. They seem to have been desperate to make this feel good politically correct picture, right down to the notion that even though some machines might be ""faulty"", they can still help you.<br/><br/>To conclude: In the end it turns out, that there's not much in 'WALL-E' that hasn't been seen before. Judging by PIXAR standard this movie is just not 'that complete package', that we've come to expect from 'Toy Story', and 'Finding Nemo'. It remains a visually stunning, tragically empty shell, seriously lacking a courageous, wicked ghost."

","I went to see Wall-E with my wife and 3 year old; I wanted to see it badly after watching the trailers in IMDb and on TV. I was amazed at the technological and artistic level that Pixar has brought with this movie, by making a world that is very difficult to picture - one of grit, dust, rust, chipped paint, dereliction... this requires a level of detail that previous movies did not show, because of the programming and memory requirements. So, the visuals themselves makes the experience of watching worthwhile.<br/><br/>The plot, simple enough (boy meets girl) is nevertheless well told in a very poignant manner. You just gotta love Wall-E and his advances on EVA, trying to woo ""her"". The robots are in themselves works of art.<br/><br/>However, the cluelessness of Hollywood had to spoil the movie for me, with an extremely childish ""green"" message, showing a lack of understanding of economics that dumbfounded me, and many plot holes you can drive an aircraft carrier through. It was clear that the writer took no care when writing the script, leaving in many instances of irrationality and nonsense.<br/><br/>*Warning: Possible Spoilers* For example, Wall-E was able to repair himself using other robots' parts. Why didn't the other robots do the same? What was EVA's purpose? If the executive order given to the Autopilot was NOT to go back to Earth, then why did it bother to send a probe?<br/><br/>(It is clear it had to be the first probe back, since Wall-E became surprised the ship it carried it landed in Earth) How come the captain became curious about Earth 700 *years* after they left it? Do Pixar people really think humans prefer to live inside a space-faring shopping mall? If the ship had the technology to keep the inside of it clean, how was it that the builders had NO success cleaning the trash? It is clear the writer or writers have no knowledge of economics. People PAY to have their trash removed. If places to place the trash became scarce, then the price to remove it would have to go up, making people change their habits. This means that the scenario pictured in Wall-E could never happen. The silly environmental message the writers wanted to convey stems from a wrong premise. This failing and the others exposed above, for me, make the movie a good example of bad sci-fi. If judged for its science fiction, this movie would not be any better than Battleground Earth.<br/><br/>So, I give it 10 stars for its well told love story, superb artistic achievement... less 5 stars for badly done, badly written, not well thought environmental message."

BUT, this was a kiddie indoctrination movie of the highest order, celebrating the new religion of environmentalism uber alles, poisoning little minds while screaming about the putative poisoning of our planet Earth.<br/><br/>And of course, evil personified is the mega-corporation, a combination of Wal-Mart, GM, GE, Halliburton and Home Depot (cleverly) called Buy and Large, with Fred Willard as its CEO (and the only non-animated being in the movie).<br/><br/>In this twisted and distorted view, computers have more humanity than the fat, lazy bloated humans who do not interact, but float along in hovercraft lounge chairs drinking ""shakes"" as they drift in a Royal Caribbean-equivalent space ship. You see, in real life, even though most of the world (with the likely exception of the Chi-Coms) has gotten with the program and cut down significantly on pollution, we're not doing enough as far as the Pixar geniuses are concerned. And, the result is that we've ruined Earth and must drift aimlessly in space because we can't live here anymore.<br/><br/>Why can't the talent in Hollywood get off this stupid bandwagon and make movies where character counts and big government tyranny is the bad guy?

","This was one of the uncommon situations when I saw a movie without knowing anything about it beforehand. I tend to believe that in such situations one's reactions are most genuine, without a trace of foreign influence.<br/><br/>It turned out that WALL.E was quite a disappointment. For brevity, I'll list only three reasons. <br/><br/>(1) First, the movie's message: it's heavy-handed, to say the least. And it gets rather thick towards the end. I leave it at that, for fear of spoiling.<br/><br/>(2) Animation is about characters. The character of WALL.E is very predictable. It's completely human/childish (and clichéd, at that!). It seems the challenge for the creators/animators was simply ""how do we convey this emotion, given the mechanical constraints"", ""how do we relate this trait, given the expressive limitations"", etc. <br/><br/>(3) Being essentially a silent movie (question: how come a rather sophisticated robot -- watching TV, making plans, and all -- has such rudimentary speech skills -- he can barely utter a syllable or two?), it strongly resembles a pantomime: For 100 minutes, the audience is asked to guess what the character is attempting to do. After a while, it gets tiresome.<br/><br/>BTW: I noticed that it's much easier to praise a popular movie than criticize it.

The animation isn't bad, it's just that unlike the undersea world in Finding Memo or the toy chest in Toy Story, there's just nothing pretty to look at for large chunks of time. And because the main characters are robots who don't exactly speak English well, the movie depends rather heavily on two things: the visual landscape and the nonlinguistic communication of the metal duo. As a result, the movie isn't quite as charming or self-effacing as its predecessors, but it's still amiable and heartwarming when it needs to be.<br/><br/>WALL-E is the last remaining robot on Earth. See, the place got so polluted that everyone had to zoom off to ships in outer space just to survive; the plan is to let the WALL-E units compact and store all the garbage, and when life can be sustainable again, the humans will return. This was 700 years ago. And every day, WALL-E compacts trash (all the other units have broken down), blissfully un-self-aware. The humans send down probes to determine if life can return to the planet, and that's when our WALL-E meets EVE, who's quite a bit more advanced and intelligent than WALL-E.<br/><br/>WALL-E is adorable. He looks quite a bit like Johnny 5 from the Short Circuit films, and he's about as smart and curious. As he collects and compacts trash, he grabs various items that seem interesting to him and stores them in his storage crate. But although he's been at it for centuries, his world's turned upside down when Eve the probe arrives on Earth in search of plant life. Wouldn't you know it, our inquisitive little toaster falls in love at first sight with the sleek Eve, who looks sort of like a giant toe (her visor would be the toe nail - try to stay with me on this).<br/><br/>On Earth, although the atmosphere is lighthearted and full of hope, the scenery (and hence the overall look and feel of the movie) is downbeat and gloomy; everything's washed out in a sea of brown and gray. The planet's a wasteland, you see, along the lines of the postapocalyptic horror of Mad Max.<br/><br/>But once we leave the planet and land on the ship Avion, things perk up. Here, everything's red or blue (the colors in the BuyNLarge logo - that's the conglomerate that owned, like, everything on the planet and that now owns and operates the deep-space ships. You should see these places - the whole idea is that the humans will never have to lift a finger. Robots wake them up. They're dumped onto these motorized recliners that whisk them everywhere. They shop and drink milkshakes from their recliners. They literally never move. So of course they're all tremendously overweight.<br/><br/>Can WALL-E and Eve help bring life back to Earth? It's a Disney/Pixar film, so you probably already know the answer, and if you thought about it for a second, you could probably map out how the movie would shake out. But one thing you might not realize is that for a G-rated movie, there's a lot of tense, scary-toned scenes. There are several moments when you're led to believe something incredibly awful has happened to WALL-E, and unlike in its cartoon progenitors there's a perceptible delay before it's revealed he's okay - long enough for you to wonder if, indeed, he is.<br/><br/>So I was a little surprised to find out this was a G-rated movie. Aside from the desolate, acrid, lifeless landscape of Earth, there are plenty of robot-in-peril scenes, sequences that seem more action-movie-like than cartoonish. This is partly because Pixar's animation is so advanced now that WALL-E looks and behaves exactly as you'd expect a robot in real life would. Which brought me to this question: Why even make an animated movie about robots? It's not as if you're giving human qualities to, say, a fish or a stuffed animal; you're anthropomorphizing something that's already been given human qualities.<br/><br/>In short, WALL-E lacked the amazing, imaginative premise and theme that earlier classics had. I wasn't bowled over by the animation, and I just wasn't terribly impressed with the execution. WALL-E is not a bad movie by any means, but it suffers by comparison with its own ancestors. In the end, it's done in by its subject matter (not conducive to gorgeous animation), its setting (vast, colorless), and its penchant for robot-in-peril scenes."
"bmcdannell","1","32","100","16 July 2008"," Just Plain Not Good
","I have to give Pixar credit for being faithful to their green theme - by applying the concept of recycling and conservation to their own movie. I can think of not one original idea offered in Wall-E - but could trot out a laundry list of earlier movies it has borrowed from, paid homage to...or just plain ripped off. The hero himself is nothing more than an amalgam of ET, Short Circuit, Silent Running and a few other robotic movie characters, and what voice he has is that nasal/adolescent whine that movie makers seem to have en masse declared to embody the essence of innocent or cute. Actually, it's just a nasal/adolescent whine.<br/><br/>I'm not going to echo those who bash the movie for its preachy environmental theme. After all, name a kid's movie or animated feature that isn't preachy. That's nothing more or less than I expected. But I will give Pixar a tarnished star for its cynicism. The film's Buy N Large mega-corporation is the villain as it entertains humanity into oblivion, while Pixar itself rakes in billions not only from the movie but from every tie-in, placement, and merchandising deal it can get its hands on...while doing its level best to become the mega-corporation of its cautionary tale and entertain humanity into oblivion.<br/><br/>We went to the movie because our ten year old granddaughter is spending a chunk of the summer with us, so we caught it at a drive-in (yes, we still have some - thank heavens!) where it was double billed with Get Smart. All of us enjoyed Get Smart much more than Wall-E. Knowing that our granddaughter was coming, we loaded up on rented kid's movies, most of them animated. We've seen much better than this in the past few weeks. As a matter of fact, just a few days after the drive-in, Robots arrived - and we felt it was far superior to Wall-E. It's preachiness was more direct and more easily absorbed by a ten year old - ""You Can Shine No Matter What you're Made Of"" - and ""Find a Need and Fill It"". And it displayed far more imagination, character development and humor than Wall-E. I realize that Pixar took a big gamble in choosing to do much of this movie without dialogue, but there is just so much you can accomplish by repeating ""Wall-E!"" and ""Eve!"" with different inflections. In other words, the gamble didn't pay off - at least for the audience.<br/><br/>If you're looking for state of the art CGI you probably won't find anything better...yet. But if you're looking for humor there are tons of better choices and if you're looking for something heart-warming you can also do much, much better. Actually, the funniest part of the movie happened when my wife and our granddaughter took a restroom break. They returned to report that the feet of the woman in the stall beside them looked exactly like the feet of the Axiom's passengers. Sad - but still funny."
"sibelian","10","5","10","21 July 2008"," We all know Pixar are incapable of making bad movies, but THIS movie has taken them to a new level.
","WALL-E was perfect.<br/><br/>Of course it was perfect, it's a Pixar flick! ALL Pixar flicks are perfect. They've never once even made a film that's a flawed masterpiece. They don't DO flaws.<br/><br/>The design is fantastic. The most stunning thing is the way the robots are animated. Pixar have reached a new level in minimalism here, they hit some brilliant new peak in using the least necessary cue to signal emotion. My favourite robot is halfway through the movie. It's not so much a robot as some sort of processing unit, processing *what*, I don't know. It's attached to the wall, pushing buttons slowly and deliberately. All it has to express emotion is one big sphere for an eye and a couple of robotic arms that can barely move outside a very small and obviously highly ordered and... well, I suppose ""prescriptive"" way.<br/><br/>It looks bored. It looks SO. BORED.<br/><br/>WALL-E waves at it. It looks at him slowly and at it's own ""hand"", which it wiggles. ""Oh"", it thinks. Later on in the movie, as WALL-E is passing, it waves back, still bored, but just a teeny bit less so.<br/><br/>That whole sequence for me is the best bit of the movie in terms of Pixar's artistry. I'm really glad they did it, because it goes right back to the roots of Pixar. Remember the short with the anglepoise lamps? Pixar have been showing for years that they can make the simplest of inanimate objects have dreams, adventures, failures and victories as convincingly as any other character. Robots was an obvious choice for them. I'm surprised they didn't do this movie earlier.<br/><br/>Oh, and they've taken a leaf or two out of Studio Ghibli's book in some areas. They usually have ""out-takes"" at the end but this time there's a Ghibliesque confection that really made the point of the movie, for me.<br/><br/>Brilliance."

","Wall-E. Wow. I was quietly hopeful that this film would be good as Pixar normally deliver, but this film is truly exceptional. Just when you think that Pixar surely must have peeked, they raise the bar again. Their brilliance is in the realization that eye candy will only take you so far, it's the characters and the story that will decide whether the audience invests emotionally. That's the measure of this film, there is almost no dialogue between the two main characters, it's all animated, neither are human and yet they manage to articulate their emotions far better than many a living breathing actor. OK so you may not be getting the shades of grey that accompany a gifted actors performance, Daniel Day-Lewis can sleep soundly, but in my opinion Wall-E stands up when compared with the very best that ""real world"" cinema has to offer. This film really has it all, amazing characters, brilliant story, vibrant universe, incredible animation, a message. Wall-E has all the right ingredients to make it an instant classic. I will take up no more of the time you could be spending actually watching this movie. Go see it. Now!<br/><br/>I give this film two thumbs up and 10/10."

","The past decade of films have seen its fair share of fads; from big-budget fantasy movies and comic book adaptations to a multitude indie films, this era of cinema is rife with them.<br/><br/>However, maybe the biggest current one is the computer-animated movie. And as the undisputed king of this, Pixar constantly pushes the envelope for this young genre. Yet, even after stating this, no one could have expected what they did with their newest film.<br/><br/>They created art.<br/><br/>Pixar's 2008 contribution is ""WALL-E,"" a fish out of water story about a cute and cuddly robot who finds himself in love, and unknowingly, carrying the torch for humanity's future. Sounds generic.<br/><br/>Well, that's why plot synopses never do the film justice! This is the case with ""WALL-E."" The plot's purpose is to bring us to a beautiful, yet ugly, world where humanity has lost its way. The film tackles such subjects as consumerism, environmentalism, America's fast-food culture, and our increasing dependence on technology. With this list of themes, I might as well be talking about an Oliver Stone movie.<br/><br/>Thank God I am not; Oliver Stone could never produce something as good as ""WALL-E"" (""Platoon,"" you don't stand a chance). Man, this catapults the kids movie into art. There are so many beautiful images, like WALL-E scraping Saturn's rings as if they were water or WALL-E and his mate flying in space locked in a romantic helix.<br/><br/>Furthermore, even the structure is somewhat unconventional. There is little dialog, especially in the first part. And there are really no overt villains, as the film tries to point out that humanity is really its own worst enemy (it's not cheesy like ""Dawn of the Dead""'s take on this concept). Sure, there is a happy ending, and clichés show up once in awhile, but the movie is so awe-inspiring in its execution and its message that it doesn't matter.<br/><br/>If I told you my least favorite genre in moviedom, I might tell you that kids' movies are at the top of my list. ""WALL-E"" doesn't change my mind on this, but it does give me hope that the genre will actually try to become more than poor dialog, unbearable storytelling, and most of all, flagrant bathroom humor. Pixar's new outing not only gives one hope for the family film, but for all movies in general.<br/><br/>A pop film can be art."

","It is ironic that the portrayal of a lonely mechanical being is the best reminder of what is best in all of us, of the divine spark that makes us special, able to create, not destroy, of keeping our hopes and spirits alive. ""Wall-E"" charmingly presents the idea without preaching, and its warnings are presented with no distractions, the consequences of our present lack of respect for ourselves and our world is shown in sad, broad strokes. ""Wall-E"" is part of the landscape, but he stands out because his spirit is able to break through and recognize that something is amiss, and that his ""heart"" beats strong waiting for the right moment to set things back in the proper order, even when that might not be his true intention. However, something has changed him the robot with the ability to feel and love. It is up to us to learn the lesson by watching his sweet odyssey.<br/><br/>At first, Wall-E leaves in a desolate universe, a place that was once wonderful and strong. His program keeps him performing a routine that keeps him going; along the way he picks up and discovers thousands of little treasures that he saves in his ""home"". Eventually, his routine is shattered with the arrival of a stunning new presence. She literally and metaphorically storms into his world, and he is not the same anymore.<br/><br/>Amazingly, it is the introduction of the setting that breaks our hearts, and it is the marvelous depiction of the courtship between EVE an Wall-E that restores our faith in the power of the ""human spirit"" because even though the mechanical wonders created through the process CGI, there is something sublime and divine in the mix, and it comes through in the portrayal of two beings that are representations/versions of what we can and might be if we get to believe in our own potential. As I mentioned before, there is a message here, subtly presented, unspoken but powerful enough to move worlds and travel through galaxies, to hit us with its universal power. This is an important movie, and it we really pay attention to its wonderful story, we can get far.<br/><br/>How did it get so good? It is put together with several references to the best of many of the best films that have ever come out. It combines the forces of creative talent and the inspiration or the forces that are unleashed when a great film comes. The vision of ""2001"" with the heart of ""E.T."" finally explodes through the eyes of a simple, everyday robot that still has faith and believes in wonder. Even through the moments when the film becomes a ""thriller"", Wall-E as a character retains his innocence and never transforms itself into an empty headed display of fancy CGI work. In fact, he remains, a rather unsophisticated looking collection of mechanical pieces that has done well this far, and needs only more thing in his existence to be complete. When EVE arrives, we know she will be the perfect complement, and in the most exciting parts of the movie, EVE (wonder about the symbolism here), with her actions, allows humanity to pull through.<br/><br/>""Wall-E"" is breathtaking, funny, sad, always engaging, and a masterpiece in every sense of the word, a work of love, consistent, accessible, beautiful to look, sweet in its depiction of a situation that is of utmost importance to everyone who lives in this world. Its message is clear, and it is not anyone's personal agenda or a direct attack on anyone. It is just a call to look back at what makes us the best we can be, to our ability to pull through in the worst of times, to that special feeling that we can't understand, but that we all yearn for, the ability to love ourselves, as well as the rest of what is around us.<br/><br/>Typically a classic earns five stars; this time I wish this film could earn more, let's make it five gold stars..."

","In short, WALL-E is perhaps just shy of Iron Man in terms of sheer coolness for the summer movie season. Pixar is unabated in their effort to control all that is animated and adorable in this world or the next. WALL-E is the pinnacle of animation, successfully steamrolling lesser animations in its path, ahem, take THAT kung fu panda. Capitalizing not on sheer star-power like every Dreamworks animation preceding it, instead, Pixar utilizes brilliant animation and wonderful storytelling to unfold a tale of love featuring the loneliest of characters, WALL-E. WALL-E's story has environmentalist overtones not unlike a decidedly far inferior movie this summer, but it's never brought to the forefront of the movie as it is, again, a love story. WALL-E captivates us with his human-like curiosity, and his very vibrant yet glassy eyes will reduce you to a swooning 12 year-old girl. I promise. The robots chirp, purr, and beep all in their own very cute dialect, but the absence of dialog, especially for the first twenty minutes, does not hinder the progression of the story. We see, for all of WALL-E's robotness, he is far more human, and like any human, he does not want to be alone. Highly, highly, highly recommended."

It's nowhere near Shrek and Toy story 2 which were very witty and funny and are among the best I've seen of US digital animation.

","I knew Pixar would pull off something new and original,and I knew it'd be classic Pixar, and thus at least good. What I got I didn't expect. Near perfection. This movie blows you away, with one heck of a dramatic opening. This could very well be one of the best openings you'll ever see, not only in animation, but perhaps in all of movie history. The tone set, and the characterization built encompasses so much in such little time you instantly fall in love with the character. Moving on from the 1st act you move into the 2nd act, where the absolute visuals and stunning emotional buildup slow a bit, following a few absurd moments you move into the even more quirky third act. While the movie moves away from the perfection of the first act, the remaining acts hold up very well, and you eventually settle into a train of thought like ""Well you can't really make it all perfect."" It's still very entertaining, and still very good. Just a touch slower and less dramatic then the first act. Oddly enough this may not be a great movie for the youngest ones to see. Most of the humor is complex, and I find that adults will get more of the jokes then the kids. While the kids will still have a great time, I think adults will really understand this movie, and will find it to be one of the best Pixar films ever made, kids may prefer the humor of Finding Nemo over the humor of Wall-e. Speaking of Wall-E, and his various companions, you will find yourself questioning some of the voice tactics at first, but they will grow on you, and you'll eventually find yourself saying that there is no better way to do it. The sound of the movie was utterly fantastic, and will keep you hooked just trying to figure out what original way they are going to express the world ""hello"". You will become attached, quite emotionally, to these characters, and there's even a touch of progression of AI technology as the new robots seem to have far more complex personalities, while Wall-E has a simpler yet more attachable personality. In short, this is a fantastic movie, with great music, and fantastic visuals that will blow you away. Watch it! Go!<br/><br/>I say this can easily be nominated for Academy Awards in: -Best Original Screenplay -Best Art Direction and of course -Best Animated Feature"

Under this prejudice I review WALLE: <br/><br/>The movie's beginning brings you to a much darker and curious realm than you may be used to from Pixar. Get used to it WALLE is a darker (albeit rated 'G') cinematic experience that I would never describe as a kids' movie. The live action sequences and slight details of character animation and environmental interaction drove the humor in the direction of wit at tastefully waltz-like cadence. Some viewers will not appreciate such an approach to laughs in a world breeding seemingly generic comics, but that's another reason why I think WALLE succeeds in being excellent. Pixar once again breaks the mold and demands with excellence that the industry conforms to their standards.<br/><br/>WALLE is one of those experiences your kids will have and then rediscover as adults, only then realizing how much they took for granted. If you're of an age to appreciate intelligent and beautiful cinematography and scripting you will thusly feel right at home.<br/><br/>I would recommend WALLE to anyone, regardless of age or movie taste.

Yeah, this movie was safe to take my 8-year-old son to--so safe, in fact, that he nearly fell asleep! My son wanted to rate this movie a 1, but since we were able to sit through the whole movie (barely) and not walk out I thought we should be generous. I couldn't stand that feeling of ""This is basically an excruciatingly long, detestable PSA on what we humans are all doing wrong."" And robots having feelings? Please! How overdone is that?! What an incredible waste of resources and talent...the movie was so colorless and bland and BORING, not to mention that there is hardly any dialogue! And more annoyingly, most of the dialogue involved Eve wailing ""WALL-EEEEEE!"" throughout the film. The Axiom scenes were somewhat redeeming, but not enough to compensate for this flop.

But thats when I watched Wall-E. It still baffles me to this day that how much I understood and felt for the characters despite the main characters only being able to speak 1 or 2 words. That was the ambition of pixar, to create a absolute masterpiece with the main characters never speaking a word (I know there are other stories with main characters not speaking but still non of them are as heartfelt as Wall-E). I recently watch this movie again, and I could not stop crying. Wall-E and Eve are absolutely brilliant, they are two characters that were able to form such a heartwarming relationship without ever speaking their emotions. That is what good storytelling is. I could go on so the TLDR is Wall-E is a must watch."

","Disney/Pixar animation at its most beautiful, but also at its most annoying. In Earth's distant future, trash and refuse has replaced all life on the planet; a waste-reclamation robot (with human emotions and feelings) has a daily routine of condensing and piling up the junk-cubes into skyscrapers made of garbage. WALL·E is an amusing, resourceful, lovable hunk of metal and rubber who is also something of a happy hoarder (his collection includes Christmas lights, utensils, a cigarette lighter, a video-cassette of ""Hello, Dolly!"" and, most importantly, a small plant still encased in dirt). Director Andrew Stanton also co-wrote the screenplay with Jim Reardon (based on Stanton and Pete Docter's idea), and they have fashioned a mind-blowing, heart-tugging first act. WALL·E, whose only friend is a winsome little cockroach (!), is visited one day by EVE, an Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator, who inadvertently leads (and lifts) WALL·E off the Earth and into the galaxy (the film's peak moment) where he discovers obese, computer and soda-addicted humans living on a space station. This is arguably the moment where the movie begins losing some of its heart; Stanton shoots-up on the imaginative possibilities of the circumstance, revving the pace and sending the editing into overdrive (possibly to compensate?). There's a revolt of man-serving machines, a Captains' mutiny with the main power source, comedic elements derived from various popular films, and WALL·E's desire to be reunited with EVE (which is all we really care about). The film goes out of its way to engage younger viewers by immersing itself in cute behavior, cute responses and one-liners, and manic action-action-action. Cuteness is a prerequisite for Disney/Pixar, of course, but Stanton really lays it on thick delivering several false endings, all manipulated for that ultimate sentimental sock. Pixar Goes Green!

","I was skeptical when I heard that this was a movie about machines falling in love. This kind of thing has been done before and has left me cold.

He has learned about love from watching a dull old Disney-like musical. One of those forgettable things that children hated, but were frequently brought to by their parents. He has established himself a sentient being with a loving soul. One day a slick rocket ship drops a probe into his garbage infested landscape. It is a porcelain-like, egg shaped beauty with deadly capabilities needed for self-preservation. This critter is egg shaped, unlike Wall-e's dumpy presence. He falls in love with her (she is definitely quite feminine. Like all desperate males, he does what he can to impress her, almost at the expense of his existence. The other interesting aspect of this film is the human element. Humanity has devolved into fat, slovenly lumps, with no thoughts or ambitions.

","""WALL-E"" represents the perfect mix between innovation and tradition. Pixar, the supreme leader in computer animation, has conceived a feature film which expands animation to a technical level which had never been reached before while treating it with very simple narrative concepts, which we could recall from old silent movies from the era of Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton.<br/><br/>The director of ""WALL-E"", Andrew Stanton, treats his movie as a huge tribute to science fiction, by inserting many different themes and concepts, such as robotics, interstellar travel, the apocalyptic concept of a desert Earth, mega-corporations and space colonization.<br/><br/>""WALL-E"" is a family movie, but that doesn't necessarily mean that audiences have to content themselves with simple themes and ideas. And it's fine. But the fact that the movie works so well is intrinsically linked to the genius of Pixar's screenwriters. Those guys have effectively created a complex story with an extremely simple narrative structure.<br/><br/>The story opens around year 2800. The first shot opens on a spatial background with planets and galaxies and the camera then moves to reveal the Earth. But is that really the Earth? A first look seems to show our planet enveloped in a yellowish atmosphere, contrasting with the ocean blue to which we're so accustomed. When the camera then zooms upon the Earth, our initial fears are confirmed: the whole planet is a huge desert, complete with totally empty cities and huge towers of garbage compacted in cubes. That sight fills the entire landscape.<br/><br/>Those garbage towers are the work of WALL-E, the hero of the movie. For the last 700 years, his workdays are exactly the same: he picks up the garbage he finds (and he's far from lacking of work on that level), transforms it in huge cubes and organizes them in towers. But he keeps in his shelter a few objects which catch his attention and which he doesn't dare to sacrifice.<br/><br/>And then one day, a huge rocket arrives from the sky. From it appears EVE, a female robot whose primary function is to inspect the Earth in order to determine if it can sustain life once again. The timid WALL-E makes contact with EVE and shows her his artifacts, among them is a small plant, an ordinary discovery for WALL-E, but a rather significant one for EVE.<br/><br/>In less time that it takes to say it, the two robots find themselves aboard the giant spaceship Axiom, where human beings, now ridiculously obese, gelatinous and lazy, live in an Utopian lifestyle, courtesy of the Buy 'n Large mega-corporation.<br/><br/>WALL-E and EVE live an extraordinary and thrilling adventure during which they will fall in love. Yes, you read that well. Not only do the robots in this movie have a well-defined gender, they are also able to express emotions as strong as love.<br/><br/>Even if some of the robots in this movie have a language and a vocabulary as developed as humans, most of them communicate with only a few words, often pronounced in a slow and detached way. WALL-E, for example, reminded me of R2-D2, since he primarily communicates and expresses himself with electronic sounds rather than with syllables. And I think it's way better that way, because it makes him more innocent, more charming and more attractive than if he'd expressed himself with more words.<br/><br/>The way that these robots express their state of mind lies mostly in specific movements, body language and facial expressions. For example, when WALL-E curls up his mechanical limbs towards his body while lowering his tremendous ""eyes"" (actually cameras), you don't need words to explain what he's feeling. That's the same situation for EVE. She has some kind of video screen instead of a face, where luminous blue spots light up to simulate eyes. When those blue spots are arranged in her face in such or such pattern, a very precise feeling is expressed.<br/><br/>What a fusion! I had never seen such a convincing mix of technology and emotion in a film before. Even in ""A.I."", where a robot designed to look like a boy is programmed to express love.<br/><br/>This masterstroke is due to the animators at Pixar, who clearly demonstrates once again who is the master in the domain of computer animation. Not only character animation is exceptional, but the presentation of an apocalyptic desert world is also breathtaking. The realism of the opening scenes is mystifying for an animated movie. There are some moments in which you could forget that you're watching an animated film.<br/><br/>""WALL-E"" is an excellent science fiction movie, but it's also an excellent tribute to science fiction movies. Andrew Stanton has inserted in his film a lot of references to pictures such as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""Star Wars"", ""Blade Runner"", ""Idiocracy"" and ""I Am Legend"". And in the great tradition of Disney movies, important life lessons are learned in ""WALL-E"", and their importance is as capital as it can be, considering the state of the Earth after humans have decided that it was easier for them to forget those precious life lessons.<br/><br/>However, I found very ironic the fact that a Disney picture would carry a message against mega-corporations and against the concept of brand loyalty.<br/><br/>Overall, ""WALL-E"" is an absolutely extraordinary movie. Fans of animation and science fiction will surely appreciate it for its technical and narrative qualities, but families and kids will definitely fall under the charm of those two robots and their heart-melting love story. A must-see!"

","I am not a fan of animated movies in any form. The only one I recall that was worth watch was Fritz the Cat back in the 70s. That one was X-Rated (NC-17 today).<br/><br/>Of course, I had to watch this, not because it won Best Animated Feature Film at the Academy Awards, but because there was a push to get it nominated for Best Picture period. It did win a couple of Best Picture awards from film critics, but the Academy wasn't buying it.<br/><br/>I feel that it did meet the requirements for consideration as Best Picture, as it presented a story that was interesting and credible, and just had animated robots instead of humans. Of course, nominating it for Best Picture means someone would be left out, and I can't see that as there were other films that had a better claim to be included.<br/><br/>It was charming, tender, funny, and exciting. A film that is worth watching over and over."
"fantasyescapist","Null","3","5","24 July 2008"," Essentially a sweet and very involving robot love story where the two robots have the task of getting humans back to Earth that they've left behind temporarily
","First things first  to be accurate, the film's pronounced 'Woll.Ee' not 'Wally', like the red-and-white stripy shirt boy and his dog that you were endlessly searching for on your telly screen and in the books as a kid in primary school  <br/><br/>The voice acting is really good. Wall.E, himself isn't completely silent  he does vocalise some few words(like 'Eve-a!'), while others are bleeps. EVE( a vegetation evaluator), who he loves, talks in a computerised robot voice which sounds really effective. The Captain on board the ship, and some other humans the little robot meets all have natural delivery in terms of their voices.<br/><br/>Pacing/Plot: Quite simply the plot is: Earth's been overtaken by our own produced rubbish that's piled up really tall over the years, so all humans have fled to space but they've left behind the title robot to clear up after humankind have abandoned the planet  and he's only got a cockroach for company. He's later joined and falls for a female shiny white robot then tries to rescue her when she's taken back into space on board a vast space cruise line. It seems inspired by old sci-fi films when Wall.E later ends up in space on board the vast cruiseliner and the film here turns softly but effectively satirical. Maybe quite anti-consumerist I'd say, especially when you get to see the appearance of the humans in space. Yes, it has a green message but it's not of the preachy heavy-handed kind Happy Feet had towards it's ending, in my opinion, and it's set in a realistic context for the film  700 years in the future! It constantly engages by scenes with even just with the lonely Wall.E and his cockroach being funny and sweet, due to his clumsiness, so there's a fair bit of slapstick and clever sight gags. Adventure, romance and a critique on our society and lifestyle all blend together well.<br/><br/>Animation: Wow! Wonderfully realised visually  standout scenes for me is when Wall.E's followed into space and we see Saturn's rings and the Sun, goodness! The character design of our robot hero isn't original as it's a lot like Short Circuit's Johnny Five meets a robotic E.T. but even so he's still lovable all the same. EVE's egg-shape and general shiny white design is very good. Backgrounds are also detailed and I like the subtle way their personalities are shown just by their nuances in movement.<br/><br/>Music: I love the score and the use of songs from Wall.E's favourite film in his lair: Hello Dolly.<br/><br/>Overall: A dazzling animated story with a welcome subtlety done green message at it's core, and a lovably sweet robot. What sets this apart from loads of other CGI films released from other companies is it feels as if a lot of passion and inspiration created this and the film truly has a heart too, as big as it's own binoculars-head hero. This matches or even surpasses Pixar's own high standard laid down by the studio since their 90s output, in my opinion. I also loved the hilariously funny Presto short with the Magician and his rabbit before the film."
"SandroTheMaster","9","3","5","2 July 2008"," A Piece of Art That Proves Pixar Has Found Its Way Again
","There will be some Minor Spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. I have a personal oath to NEVER give a 10 to a movie, so bear with me.<br/><br/>After a few meh... movies, Pixar seems to have found its own way with Ratatouille and now Wall-E. Especially Wall-E. It has put in its company head that it can't actually beat Dreamworks Animations in pure humor, so it has now embarked in a new direction and went back to try and make animation an art. And we should all be thankful for it.<br/><br/>Hell, if you had any doubts Wall-E was supposed to be a work of art, the Epilogue shown in the start of the credits at the end should clear any doubts, as it is shown through all art styles through history, from pre-history art to modern art. Finally, after that, when the credits are actually rolling up, there's a tribute to gaming as robot characters are shown pixelated like old time games doing small chores.<br/><br/>About the movie, I was intrigued from the start when I heard it would be about a little robot that was left on earth to clean it as mankind took off to space. That's a very original premise that caught my mind so I waited on it.<br/><br/>As it turns out, mankind had left Earth and, in it, an army of Wall-Es to clean it, or Waste Allocation Load Lifter - Earth-class. About 700 years later, only one Wall-E unit is left surviving from savaging parts from unresponsive Wall-Es scrap. He carries on with his duty of cleaning the planet, but the centuries of interaction with the ghost of mankind and apparently co-existing with roaches made him develop some form of personality as it collects everything it finds interesting.<br/><br/>The movie takes on from that because that's when another robot, Eve, gets to earth with unknown purpose. The movie is very adamant about how its possible for an AI to develop personality given time and exposition to the right kind of stuff, like another ""rogue AI"". At some point of the movie other robots with personality are shown, but they're taken as broken and are in a repair bay. Eve exposition to Wall-E gives her, too, some hint of personality that she eventually develops. Wall-E falls in love with Eve thanks to a mixture of various factors, one important being old video footage Wall-E used to watch, where there are men dancing with hats and a final scene where a man is singing with a woman and they hold hands. After Eve showing up Wall-E tries to mimic the holding hands scene various times unsuccessful, mostly because of Eve's aggressivity and curiosity that made her unaware of Wall-e's intention. She is quite trigger-happy with her plasma cannon mounted in her arm, and almost annihilate Wall-E a few times during their first encounters.<br/><br/>There's also eventually a human component. Humans are shown as fat bloats costumed to have robots doing everything to them and only knowing the universe around them from a visual hologram that's mounted in front of their heads, from which they talk to each other and see stuff. Wall-E bumps into a few of those and turns off the hologram, making them ""awake"" once again to the world around then. So Wall-E isn't only giving personality to other robots, but to humans as well. Even so, save from one human in particular, you usually wish you were watching the robots rather than them whenever they show up. Not that they're poorly characterized, but the robots are so appealing you don't want to waste a second watching anything but.<br/><br/>There's also a small cleaning robot Wall-E gives personality by the fact he was completely dirty and the robot obsessed in cleaning him. So he dared to move away from his pre-determined path so he can clear up Wall-E's track. Also, it is interesting that the movie has no actual villains... well, maybe save from the humans of the past who turned the planet into a giant trash can (and that's us). The humans just forgot about earth and the AIs getting in the way are only following their prime directives from 700 years ago. Finally, Eve is unbelievably cute when she's mad.<br/><br/>Damn, this movie even made me shed some tears in a particular scene, and that's a hell of an accomplishment I assure you reader. That's from a man that only raised an eyebrow at Aeris Death in FF VII and who movies get at most a slight chuckle at their most dramatic deaths."

This is really quite a shame (and hopefully not an example of what we can expect from Pixar/Disney going forward).<br/><br/>However, adults held captive by their spawn in the theaters will manage to give up a few yucks, but very few.

This movie should not win any Oscar and it should be the pucca flop movies of the year.I think Pixar will do the upcoming movies well.

"dromasca","5","8","20","14 July 2008"," an overrated film with memorable scenes but no solid story
","Every summer lately has its big animated hit, and sometimes more than one. 'Wall-E' will certainly be the big one of the summer of 2008 and will make a lot of money in the process. I do not share the enthusiasm of the crowds on this one however.<br/><br/>There are a few remarkable things in 'Wall-E'. The principal character is cute and nicely drawn, with an E.T. like silhouette. His romantic interest is however deprived of any charm, exception the way she voices 'Wall-Eeeeeee' and we hardly share his enthusiasm for her. The love dance in the starry night is a beautiful piece of animation. The visions of Earth reduced to a garbage dump and the one of the humanity turned into sacks of junk food are haunting, although a little too ideologically explicit. But then between all these we do expect a movie line and a story, and those are not missing but so simplistic and naive that they lack any interest for the adult viewer, and by this I mean anybody older than nine. Graphics are OK but I have seen better from Pixar.<br/><br/>When the first viewers enthusiasm will fade out this film will slowly decrease in rating (it has by now a stellar 8.9 in IMDb, and is a neighbor of Lord of the Rings and Usual Suspects) and will melt out from Top 250. We will be left with an animated movie of a few memorable quotes but no real story to connect between them."
"Joejoesan","8","8","20","22 June 2008"," Funny and engaging, but foggy in the second half
","The guys at Pixar are known not to take the easy road. A world filled with speaking cars? Monsters that scare kids in order to keep the electricity flowing? Their fantasies are not the easiest ones to be put on the screen. Wall-E is also a daring project. It's the story of a lonely robot who falls in love with another robot, follows her across the galaxy and in the end saves mankind. Sort of.<br/><br/>The problem with Wall-E is also the challenge of the whole movie. How can you make the audience care for a creature that is a machine? How can you make a love story that revolves around robots? Pixar does it with lots of visual Buster Keaton-like humor. Wall-E is clumsy, strict, kind and... lonely. Although E.T. immediately comes to mind he also shares a lot of characteristics with Mr. Bean. The first part of the movie - in which we see Wall-E doing his thing in a deserted human world - is actually the best. Visually stunning we immediately believe in Wall-E's world. It's dark, stuffy but fascinating.<br/><br/>His dull life changes when EVE lands on earth. EVE is a high-tech investigating robot who has to report to a group of surviving humans. The two fall in love but when EVE must go back, Wall-E can't let her go. He follows her to a big spaceship that has been entertaining the surviving humans for 700 years. The ship was supposed to do so until earth was safe again to go back. But are the spoilt humans up to the change?<br/><br/>Somehow the second part of the movie doesn't entirely work. The idea of a ship traveling through space is not new. Classic SF writers like Robert Heinlein wrote books about it. Pixar does a nice job by showing a society in which humans don't have to do anything anymore and all become physically supersized. This sarcastic tone is well done. But from the moment Wall-E arrives at the spaceship the story becomes unclear. What is Wall-E's mission? What does he have to achieve in order to save the humans? And do they really want to be saved?<br/><br/>The end - where the humans give up their luxury lives to return to earth - seems somewhat illogical. The deserted earth that is presented to us does not seem that inviting. And that's a pity. Because Wall-E remains great entertainment and deserves to be a great hit. But compared to Kung Fu Panda the Pixar movie is maybe a little bit to ambitious to reach its real goal. Wall-E is a great movie, but not Pixar's best."
"nkskipper92","5","7","17","13 July 2008"," A very dim view of the human race ...
","SPOILER ALERTS ... relatively minor, but I will still put this warning here to placate IMDb.<br/><br/>When I first saw previews for this movie, I thought, Hey, that was a really good movie ... 23 years ago, when it was called ""Short Circuit."" After taking my son to see it today, I think it compares favorably to ""Short Circuit"" in terms of bringing humanity to its robot characters.<br/><br/>Those who are old enough to remember ""Short Circuit"" and its sequel, may watch Eve's efforts to save Wall-E toward the end and recall the last several minutes of the Short Circuit ... or, for a closer comparison, holding their breath as the defibrillator was used on Number 5 in SC2.<br/><br/>Some have criticized the fact that two words comprise 70% of the dialogue in the film. It's not an entirely unfounded criticism, but certainly, it's a testament to the film that so many different meanings, and feelings, and emotions are conveyed with those two words.<br/><br/>I actually went in considering a criticism I saw on here about the gender politics in play - Eve as a sleek, attractive, sophisticated female versus Wall-E as a clumsy, unattractive male. To this I say: first, consider that Eve represents an advance of 700 years in technology, and second, that Wall-E was able to maintain himself, something none of Eve's compatriots could do. I could do more to counter this criticism, but I want to conserve my space.<br/><br/>If you have seen the ""Disney Store"" promotions - Wall-E fighting with a vacuum cleaner, for instance - you will be disappointed, as there is not as much of this type of physical comedy in the movie.<br/><br/>My big problem with this movie, however, is its portrayal of humans. It has a very fatalistic view of human beings, and of humanity in general. All this movie's humans are fat, stupid, lazy, mindless sheep. (""Blue is the new red"" is all it takes for everyone to, at the push of a button, change the color of their clothes.) I mean, come on. Humans in 700 years are so lazy that walking, or touching another human being, will be a revolutionary experience? Humans will allow this planet to deteriorate into such a state of disrepair that it will be buried in garbage? Global warming (excuse me ... ""climate change"" ... the term ""global warming"" got replaced as the earth demonstrably started cooling down over the past couple of years) turns the entire world into Phoenix in July? (Note the ""radiating heat"" that shows up a lot.) The atmosphere is a simple repository for floating garbage? <br/><br/>Look ... we, as humans, are not going to let it get to that point. We don't even want it to go back to it being as bad as it was a generation ago. I choose to have more faith in humanity than this movie does."

A robot left behind and forgotten about cleaning up the Earth for 700 years and the only friend he has is a cockroach. Well I guess that he doesn't have very much else to do anyway.

"grandslam40","6","4","8","10 January 2009"," Is this REALLY the best Disney/Pixar film?
","Let me start off by saying I have grown up with Disney/Pixar movies. The day a brand new D/P movie came out was like Christmas morning for me. And I was never let down. Ever. Toy Story 1 +2, Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Cars, and Ratatouille all have amazing aspects to them that make them classics and some of the best family movies ever made. It is hard to pick a best one of these - they are all great in their own ways.<br/><br/>That being said, I just finished watching Wall-E, the latest D/P ""masterpiece."" When I first saw the trailer, I was skeptical. It looked pretty stupid to me and I did not end up seeing it in theaters. After reading the rave reviews for it all over the place and the 8.5 rating on IMDb, I thought I would give it a shot.<br/><br/>The first 30 minutes or so I was very confused. Some of the few other negative critics have used the word ""uncomfortable."" But, honestly, I thought it was stupid. There. I said it. Not even because it was not physically correct or whatever...or showed Liberal propaganda to children... but because it was just STRANGE. When EVE came it picked up a little bit. But one thing I have to say was that Wall-E annoyed me a little bit. OK - the first couple times he said ""EEEEEVE-uh"" and EVE said ""wwwwwuuualll-EEE"" it was kind of ""cute."" But after the 3 or 4 hundredth time, it started grinding on my nerves. I was not ""swept off my feet"" by the ""adorable"" romance of Wall-E and Eve. Again - a bit strange. I was really disappointed because I REALLY wanted to join the hordes of people who endeared this film, but I just couldn't. First 30 minutes - 3/10 As for the positives, OF COURSE the cinematics, visual effects, animation, art, and technical aspects were stunning. (I will say Wall-E was the best D/P movie in those terms.)A positive turning point came when we met the humans. I particularly liked the Captain for his bumbling, yet heroic aura. It was funny how they satired and exaggerated the American culture and what may become of it. It had a nice ending and an overall good story. I will not go into anymore of the positives, since the have been covered by the 70,000+ who gave this film a 9 or 10. For the rest of the movie I give a 7/10.<br/><br/>But please, Wall-E doesn't come CLOSE to other D/P masterpieces such as Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Toy Story, Monsters, Ratatouille, and Cars. And best of animation of the year - Kung Fu Panda and Horton Hears a Who were both better. (OK - Wall-E WAS better than A Bug's Life - and Space Chimps).<br/><br/>Again, I enjoyed this film and was thoroughly entertained by it. Also, I agree, it does reach a plateau in computer animation with its visuals. The story was nice. But a lot of it was just bizarre and definitely NOT D/P's best. Again I write these negatives with a heavy heart and I hope maybe if I let it ""digest"" I will be able to comprehend what others have heralded as ""an incredible cinematic achievement."" Overall for Wall-E - 6(sigh)/10"
"Atreyu_II","6","4","8","19 November 2008"," Not as good as they say
","With all due respect, ""WALL-E"" is said to be such a great movie, but for me it isn't as good as they're making it sound. Although I rarely appreciate a CGI film, I had good expectations about this one. But it seems that my expectations were a bit too high. So, it's an overrated movie. I don't use the word ""overrated"" frequently, but this is one of those cases which I think deserves such word.<br/><br/>The movie is visually triumphant. For a CGI film, the visuals are excellent, fresh, advanced and obey to high standards of quality. The sceneries look futuristic either, which is no surprising considering that our story takes place in the 22nd century.<br/><br/>The movie actually starts very well and promising, with the WALL-E character doing his duty: to clean the garbage and mess of a lost, sad and desert Earth where everything is destroyed and humankind is a rarity now. The first 15 minutes are very good for this and for its sceneries. Speaking of these sceneries, the place itself and all those destroyed buildings made me think of Steven Spielberg's ""A.I.: Artificial Intelligence"" and also of a Citroen C4 TV commercial, where the car transforms itself into a robot and dances at the sound of the music ""Jacques Your Body"" by Les Rythmes Digitales. The only minor thing that bothers me a bit in the beginning is that WALL-E befriends with a cockroach which is always behind him.<br/><br/>The sceneries in space and inside a spaceship (seen later in the movie), on the other hand, made me think a bit of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""Star Wars"" and that Pizza Planet place in ""Toy Story"".<br/><br/>Anyway, back to the beginning, when WALL-E meets a female robot named EVE, the movie begins to lose some of its original impact. For a story like this, romance was absolutely unnecessary, even more when the story is about robots and machinery. Plus, once the story in the spaceship begins, that's when it loses all its interest. That Captain guy annoyed me and the villains. The Captain and many other human characters are very poorly designed, as usual in most CGI movies. They tend to overdo their proportions. Not to mention that there are many silly moments, the story gets silly and so on.<br/><br/>Despite that, the visuals inside the spaceship are very nice and interesting. They show quality and they look very realistic, almost looking like a giant shopping center from the future.<br/><br/>One more thing: what was the point of those live-action scenes when the movie is supposed to be animated? And what is the music from ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" doing here? As if it wasn't enough inserting that music in ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", now they put it in here? I wonder how many more movies will do this in the future.<br/><br/>The character WALL-E (an acronym for Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-class) is likable and interesting. Although he's a robot/vehicle from space, he looks a little like E.T. - besides, his voice sounds a bit like E.T.'s and combines a brilliant robot-like quality. I loved his voice, fits perfectly well for the character.<br/><br/>Overall, a nice try, but like most CGI films, it's no match for ""Cars""."
"Delmare","7","4","8","12 August 2008"," Not Pixar's best, by any stretch of the imagination
","It's the future, folks, and once again, life on Earth is a shoddy bit of business. Environmental abuses have destroyed the planet, human beings have spent the last 700 years getting morbidly obese while cruising naively through space in an interstellar ocean liner, and the only sentient entities left on the mother planet are cockroaches (the only apparent life-forms) and Wall-E, a tiny robot whose job it is to clean up trash. He's been doing this for centuries, long past the point where his original mission was abandoned, but without any orders to countermand his initial instructions, he must continue on his course, and does so, dutifully and without complaint.<br/><br/>That is, until the unexpected arrival of Eve, a significantly more advanced robot, who flies in from space and tours the surface of the Earth, apparently looking for life. Glad for the company, Wall-E befriends the newcomer and shares his recent and miraculous discovery: a plant of some kind, growing inside a boot. Subsequent adventures return Eve to the Axiom, the aforementioned ocean liner, with Wall-E in tow. Therein, the two must resolve a dispute between the Captain of the ship, who sees the plant and wants to re-colonize Earth, and Co-Pilot, an automated navigation system that refuses to deviate from ancient instructions labeling Earth life-threatening.<br/><br/>It's a good movie all in all, but it's not good enough, at least not for my taste.<br/><br/>I take my sci-fi seriously. It's a fault of mine, and I willingly admit it. I don't like cute robots, I don't like explosions that are audible in space, and I'm highly annoyed with the overwhelming mass of thinly supported ""space fantasy"" that's given the genre a light-hearted, superficial, and escapist tone, marginalizing such intellectual literary greats as Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke and preventing science fiction from ever receiving the respect and recognition it deserves.<br/><br/>Wall-E is certainly better than the average offender. Astonishing visuals, a solid sense of humor, and the good old Pixar charm combine to make it one of the more enjoyable films of the summer. I was especially amused with the Apple references: Wall-E's Macintosh startup sound, the ubiquitous iPod design, the use of MacInTalk for Co-Pilot's voice, et cetera. Like Ratatouille, The Incredibles, and the rest of the Pixar canon, there's a lot of depth to the movie, more than enough to lift it above the shoulders of standard kiddy fair.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, no amount of glamour could distract me from the plethora of unanswered questions that by the end of the movie had piled up higher than Wall-E's towers of junk. Why, for instance, would Wall-E's designers make him capable of empathy, when the tediousness of his job description made any kind of emotion a severe liability? As an emotional creature, how could he spend 700 years performing history's most repetitive task without going insane? Why would a perfunctory probe like Eve come equipped with facial expressions and the capacity for romance? What were the cockroaches feeding on if Earth had been lifeless for seven centuries? What can you make of a robot strong enough to hang onto the outside of a spaceship blasting into orbit but weak enough to get taken out by a handful of shopping carts? Why would the passengers of the Axiom slide down the slope of the deck when the ship clearly created its own gravity and, as such, could assume any number of positions in space without anyone on the inside of the ship ever knowing the difference? And how could a society of obese layabouts with seventy decades of sloth at their backs so quickly warm to the challenge of ""re-colonizing Earth?"" Sure, it's a G-rated cartoon, and children are the primary audience, and part of me feels like a nit-picking A-hole to even think about getting this technical, but I can't shake the feeling that Stanton could have invested a little more in the way of plausibility without making his movie any less appealing. The kids would still have been happy, the fantasy lovers wouldn't have known the difference, and the small batch of sci-fi curmudgeons like myself could have basked in the certainty that finally a director cared enough about our interests to pitch us a story we believed."
"masterofsillythings","6","4","8","2 August 2008"," Hmmm...bit of a let down
","Having read endless reviews that this was going to be (i quote) 'the film of our generation', I have to say I was very disappointed. What Pixar have accomplished here is a film of incredible merit...for about twenty five minutes. The opening scenes on earth are, a little odd, but there are lots of guaranteed laughs within, and Wall-e is a truly tremendous character to have been concocted by an animation studio; in deed, thanks to this little robot, for about fifteen minutes, this is probably the finest animated film ever made; it is unique, it is thought provoking, and it gives great promise of what is yet to come; however, what is yet to come is a terrible waste of a great initial idea. The scenes on board the spaceship are at best 'quirky' and the film is weighed down by too many unnecessary characters, several plot devices of absolutely no sustenance, poor scripting, and an hour of film where the same scenes seem to be flashing before our eyes again and again...it really does get monotonous. The last five minutes go someway to undoing the damage, but for all the stunning animation and 'make you think' messages, Wall e never really finds it feet. If only the first half hour had been fleshed out, developed, and not flushed down the toilet in favour of an irrelevant and idiotic 'look at the pretty lights' plot line that takes far too long and never really gets anywhere, we would probably be looking at top 100 material.<br/><br/>It seems to me that Pixar have set out to do something wonderful, different and incredibly brave, but got cold feet, wondered too much about 'is this going to work?' and opted instead for the usual heartwarming and vaguely amusing mulch.<br/><br/>I'm maybe being a little unfair here. The bloated mid section is probably, upon comparison, about as good as bits of ratatouille, the incredibles or finding nemo; Wall e fails to cut the grade simply because it promised to be better, and because it never really seems to know what it's doing.<br/><br/>A disappointing effort"
"commandercool88","10","4","8","7 July 2008"," Masterpiece for the Ages
","Some time ago, I stumbled across the new rumblings of Pixar's next film, 'Wall-E'. And as I read through a story detailing a planet that could no longer sustain human life, and a cute little robot who held the weight of the world on his shoulders, a thought dawned on me. That if Pixar did good on their initial proposal, they could open a door of epic opportunity. That if they took a chance and held nothing back, they could make a film that wouldn't simply entertain audiences, but instill change.<br/><br/>Pixar has now released their brainchild for the world to see and judge, and the film that I hoped would carry a thoroughly spine-chilling message has done more than just deliver an environmentally friendly message. Many times I sat in awe, choking back tears as I watched a monumentally beautiful story unfold before my eyes. Change. Hope. That's what 'Wall-E' is. Pixar has created a masterpiece, and I don't say that lightly. Like a swift kick in the gut, 'Wall-E' is not only a revolutionary love story but a wake-up call to a world that may not be too far away the one 'Wall-E' so tragically portrays.<br/><br/>Welcome to the future. Welcome to Earth. Welcome to a world where pollution clouds the skies and the landscape is little more than a staggering garbage heap. Welcome to a world where a wholesale retail giant has taken over, its CEO now Earth's global president. A president who at one point utters the now reproachable phrase, 'stay the coarse'. But more importantly, welcome to a world without human life. A world so far gone, human's deserted it for a space station long, long ago. Earth, a memory.<br/><br/>'Wall-E' doesn't merely criticize our way of life. It doesn't simply frown on our increasing dependence on technology, our desire to make daily routines as effortless as possible. It doesn't wag a finger at our sky-rocketing obesity rates and a mounting detachment to human interaction and the world around us. No, 'Wall-E' effectively slams our very way of life. 'Wall-E' sums up the future of humanity, and it's one of the most shocking visions of the future to ever touch the screen. It is a film whose implications are severe and utterly devastating, a cry to the world to not just sit around and do nothing, a cry to the world to not simply survive but to live. An urgent message that has to be heard and acted upon.<br/><br/>But when all seems to be lost, 'Wall-E' reminds us that hope never dies. And as long as our will power is strong, there is a way. There's no denying Pixar's natural talent, because they've done it again. Through its powerful and vastly important message, 'Wall-E' is a space odyssey for the new millennium, and a love story for the ages. Who else could create such an adorable robot and so effectively grant him human characteristics, and above all else, the ability to love. Perhaps the most basic of human instincts, the desire to love and be loved in return. And as this devastatingly cute trash-compacting robot travels the universe for Eve, the object of his affection, we're witnessing one of the grandest and most eloquent stories ever told.<br/><br/>'Wall-E' is a film that may very well be studied for years to come. Parents who take their children to see this may be taken completely off-guard to find that 'Wall-E' isn't just a light piece of kiddie entertainment, it's a sweepingly beautiful and historic film. One can only hope that people who see it will listen, and take with them a new outlook on life and the future of this planet. It's a stinging bite from Pixar, but a timely one. Without a doubt their boldest move yet, and one that will be remembered as long cinema has an audience. A legacy of forever.<br/><br/>More reviews: rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public"
"jon.h.ochiai","10","4","8","6 July 2008"," WALL-E has great heart
","""WALL-E"" accomplishes nearly the impossible. During the first half of the movie ""WALL-E"" charms and mesmerizes without any vestige of human dialog. WALL-E is a refuse collecting robot, basically a box with two round camera eyes, left behind on Earth in the distant future. That would be 750 years in the future. Undeniably WALL-E (brilliantly voiced by Ben Bartt) is becoming sentient. In fact the cute robot is a passionate fan of the classic movie ""Hello, Dolly"". Clearly and touchingly, our hero WALL-E is profoundly lonely, and yearns for companionshipperhaps, even love. Perhaps this is a leap of faith beyond mere disbelief, and the distinct beauty of Director and Writer Andrew Stanton's amazing animated feature ""WALL-E"" from Pixar.<br/><br/>Pixar is now something like 10 for 10 in making movies that capture and connect with the audience. The CGI and animation are like nothing seen before. In fact the sequences with WALL-E on the desolate Earth wasteland look like live action film. Andrew Stanton's weird and wonderful robot love story also delivers humorously biting commentary on the sedentary direction of our society; as well as punctuates the consequences of not being ""green"". ""WALL-E"" is brilliantly whimsical, hysterical, and surprisingly touching. ""WALL-E"" like its hero has a big heart. ""WALL-E"" tells its story on a vast visually stunning canvas: The CGI and animation are beyond amazing.<br/><br/>As we first observe WALL-E, he is doing his programmed deal of collecting and compacting trash in one of Earth's barren metropolises. WALL-E discovers a living plant in the midst of all the garbage. Perhaps this newfound plant indicates that the Earth may again have a viable ecosystem, after over 750 years. A gargantuan space ship arrives, carrying with it a scouting robot, sleek new age Eve (charmingly voiced by Elissa Knight). Apparently, Eve is searching for any signs of life on the long vacated Earth. Obviously, more technologically advanced and powerful Eve appears formidable. However, WALL-E sees in Eve the love of his lifeat least for a robot. Robot hi-jinx ensues. Inevitably WALL-E ends up accompanying Eve back to the displaced human civilization, albeit unintentionally. Ironically WALL-E may be the savior of all of mankind. WALL-E and Eve's adventure becomes a hysterical and ultimately touching journey. ""WALL-E"" is high on cute and fun.<br/><br/>Director Stanton creates and navigates contrasting worlds of ""WALL-E"" with ease and confidence. Granted the visuals awe and amaze; however, his storytelling yields ""WALL-E"" its big heart. The fact that the main characters are robots with virtually monosyllabic vocabularies is even more stunning an accomplishment. You really pull for the happy ending for WALL-E and Eve. And they are robots! Okay, this is a Disney and Pixar movie, so you need not worry too much. ""WALL-E"" is sentimental, very sweet, with enough of a quirky edge to keep you guessing. ""WALL-E"" is a great movie, well worth seeing. Pixar has done it, again."
"jimpyke","9","4","8","6 July 2008"," How do overweight people feel about WALL-E?
","I read one very short thread on the message board for this movie about whether people think that WALL-E is ""anti fat people,"" but I'm interested in thinking and writing more about this topic.<br/><br/>Personally, I am not overweight, but I was growing up, so I might have a thinner skin on this subject than some. I could tell that the filmmakers were working hard to be as kind as they could given the facts of the plot and characters that they had created - and given the fact that they were pushing an overall message of individuals taking personal responsibility for some very broad social problems.<br/><br/>Of course they weren't able to incorporate a nuanced social critique of the psychology of obesity-as-eating-disorder or some such thing that might be better left to Oprah and Dr. Phil. But it did seem to me that the filmmakers were pushing what I thought was a pretty well-reasoned thesis that people can be led by the profit-motivated logic of capitalism into behaviors that are unhealthy at best and devastating at worst.<br/><br/>I also thought it was interesting that the unhealthy behaviors that had lead to their extreme and infantilizing form of obesity were depicted very precisely as de-humanizing (or stated more precisely ""de-adultizing""). As viewers we see that humans at the time of the launching of the AXIOM were indeed human (the use, jarring to some, of the human actor Fred Willard, and other ""live action"" images of humans in the movie), but over the course of 700 years humans had become ""giant babies"" in hovering incubators - their every need indulged by extreme high-tech devices.<br/><br/>This progression from human to... something else is underscored when we see the pictures of the series of ship's captains, each of which looks more ""cartoonish"" and infantile that the one before it.<br/><br/>I liked the fact that the overweight, de-adultized people were heroic in the movie, but I'm not sure how I feel about the overall message and whether it will come off as just more anti-fat negativity to adults who truly struggle every day with overweight/obesity concerns.<br/><br/>I think that perhaps my biggest concern might run somewhere along the lines of this: do people (especially overweight people) think that the anti-overindulgence / pro-personal-responsibility message of WALL-E was delivered with enough real love behind it to actually inspire change in people's lives and in our culture (and I mean US culture, because that is the culture to which this movie's message is clearly pitched)? I hope so, and this is something that I always wonder about when movies come along that seem to genuinely desire to create social change through the power of their artistry."
"come2whereimfrom","9","4","8","6 July 2008"," A true Pixar classic.
","Well I've just been lucky enough to go to a preview screening of 'Wall-E' and all I can say is its brilliant and simply one of the best films in Pixar's ever expanding cannon. Director Andrew Stanton whose previous film was another Pixar classic 'Finding Nemo' has excelled beyond anything we could have expected and here everything works perfectly. The animation is pristine and I'm sure sharper than the human eye can actually see, the score fits and flows with the story and the sound done by Ben Burtt (think all the weird noises from Star Wars) is crisp, clear and beautiful. Like any good Pixar film and any kids film worth its weight it works on many levels allowing the more grown up amongst us to laugh along with the younger audience and laugh you can as the practically dialogue free film sees Wall-E himself as a kid of robot Chaplin with each slapstick visual timed to a tee. A lot of this relies on the design of Wall-E a kind of cross between 'Short Circuits' Johnny five and 'The Black Holes' V.I.N.C.E.N.T. and the fact that he is so aesthetically pleasing while also being able to be so animated is part of the overall charm. The story a simple boy meets girl or should I say robot meets robot has been done to death but here seems to dazzle with a new lease of life and my only criticism of the movie is that at times the whole moral message of recycling, looking after the planet etc is a little shoved down your throat and I know it's the zeitgeist of the moment but I wanted to be entertained not bummed out. Elsewhere there are great pastiches to '2001' and 'Close encounters', the misfit robots are hilarious and never have fat people been so funny. Wall-E has everything you could want; it looks good, sounds good, is very funny and has all the magic you have come to expect from the boys at Pixar. Not only is Wall-E a great film it is as close to a perfect movie as you could hope to get. A big triumph for a little robot."
"Setho10","10","4","8","4 July 2008"," Pixar has done the impossible and improved their game in every way, and made what will likely be considered one of animation's greats in the process.
","It's been a rare occurrence over the past 5 years or so to see an exceptional sci fi film. Most films have fallen flat, disappointed, or never taken off. As we wait for a hopeful resurgence next year with such planned epics as Intersteller, Avatar, Battle Angel, Ender's Game, T4, Star Trek and others, we have on our hands a small masterpiece in the form of Pixar's latest and greatest film Wall E. It's been said many times that Pixar would never outdo the incredible Incredibles, at least until Ratatouille came out last year, which many called an even superior work to Bird's previous masterpiece. I can't say I agree with that, but the latest from Finding Nemo director Andrew Stanton has to be up there with the greatest animated films ever created, and indeed, the greatest films in sci-fi cinema's history.<br/><br/>The first 20 minutes of the film are almost completely silent save for the hum of Wall E's wheels. In the background the lonely robot listens to a taped rendition of Hello Dolly. He spends his days with his insect friend compacting trash and collecting odd knickknacks which he saves in a collection. His life is changed forever when humanity sends Eve to Earth to look for plant life. While there she and Wall E fall in love and her departure leads Wall E on a journey through space and into the last vestiges of human life.<br/><br/>The plot is simple, but it is almost poetic in how delightfully it moves forward, each twist, while expected, gives the viewer joy. It seems strange how in a year full of unromantic romantic comedies, the film that rises above the pack is an animated film about robots. But truly, Wall E has to be one of the most romantic movies since Titanic. The emotions shown by these robots is just staggering, especially considering their single digit word vocabularies. It seems just unreal how two non-talking animated machines can deliver a greater emotional package than real human actors, but such is the case, and such is the magic of the geniuses at Pixar.<br/><br/>In addition to love story and slapstick comedy, Wall E is also a stinging message about consumerist society, the dangers of our desire for bigger and larger, and the risks of laziness. Added to this are humorous punches at Apple, sci-fi film-making, and apathy. Indeed this is easily the most adult Pixar film to date, and shows maybe more than any animated film before it that the cartoon can be both a source of entertainment and a springboard for the furtherance of important issues.<br/><br/>As Wall E draws to a close you feel that you have experienced something special, a film so extraordinary that it transcends its perceived limitations to create what is easily the best film of the year and truly one of the greatest sci-fi films ever made.<br/><br/>Helping with this are the visual masterminds at Pixar. The world of Wall E is an artistic and technical masterpiece. The remnants of Earth deliver a haunting glimpse into our planet's possible future, with the sky covered in brown, trash littering every inch of the landscape and massive stores taking up blocks of city streets. It is easily the most frightening and oddly beautiful post-apocalyptic future shown in American animation, and actually comes close to comparing to the haunting visions of the Japanese post-apocalypse masterpieces like Naussiccaa of the Valley of the Wind, Ghost in the Shell or Akira. When Wall E leaves this planet the audience gets treated to a breathtaking view of outer space only possible in an animated feature. The cruiser that Wall E finds himself on is an inspired masterpiece, feeling more alive, more real, and more immersive than other iconic ships like the Death Star or the Enterprise. Indeed, the ship and its inhabitants possibly more than anything else sent shivers down this viewer's spine. Trust me when I say, if you are bored by the Chaplinesque opening act stay around for part two as things get if anything more disturbing than during the first half.<br/><br/>Wall E is essential animation. Pixar has proved for 20 years that it is the leader in computer animated cinema, and Wall E will most likely serve as the height of their illustrious lineage when historians look back upon them. Many said last year that Brad Bird's cooking rat would remain Pixar's most enduring achievement. Well let me say right now, Pixar has done the impossible and improved their game in every way, and made what will likely be considered one of animation's greats in the process."
"tomok97","10","4","8","2 July 2008"," Amazing
","I can't imagine how demoralizing it must be to work for Dreamworks animation division. They've made some very popular cartoons but they always seem to missing a little something. No matter how good they might get, they somehow always pale in comparison to Disney/Pixar. <br/><br/>And then they make Kung Fu Panda. As good a movie as they've ever made. It's charming, heartwarming, beautifully animated with a great story and exciting action. They seem to have finally out ""Pixar-ed"" Pixar.<br/><br/>And then comes WALL-E.<br/><br/>WALL-E opens in the year 2700. Earth has been abandoned due to an out of control consumer culture. Earth can no longer sustain life due to the enormous amounts of refuse that mankind has created. WALL-E units are used to collect, compact and stack the trash. (WALL-E is an acronym for ""Waste Allocation Load Lifter  Earth Class"".) However, Earth has been abandoned for so long that all other WALL-E units have broken downexcept for our main character.<br/><br/>WALL-E continues collecting, compacting and stacking. Trash stacks are everywhere and reach as high as skyscrapers. It's a futile task that rivals that of Sisyphus. WALL-E's only friend is a cockroach and a VHS copy of Hello Dolly, which he watches repeatedly.<br/><br/>Eventually EVE, a robot probe from the Earthlings in exodus, arrives. WALL-E falls in love with his new robot companion. EVE is also an acronym, but I won't reveal what it stands for as it would be a bit of a spoiler. Upon completing her mission, EVE is retrieved and returned to AXIOM, a floating city-sized (or perhaps even larger) ship where humans have been living for the last 700 years awaiting Earth to regain its life-sustaining ability.<br/><br/>AXIOM is completely run by robots that cater to the humans' every whim. Because of rampant obesity and the deterioration of their bones (due to reduced gravity in space), humans no longer walk, they are transported on a device that looks like a hovercraft and a Rascal Scooter had a baby. All humans exist in their own virtual worlds, enraptured with their personal holographic computer screens that are an ever-present fixture in front of them. <br/><br/>But we aren't meant to have disdain for these people. What could have come off as mean-spirited is actually treated with compassion. They've lived for generations in an environment like this. It's all they know. They would want something different if only they knew that there was something different.<br/><br/>What's amazing about WALL-E is how much could have gone wrong. Here's a short list: <br/><br/> It takes place on an Earth that's a post-apocalyptic wasteland.  Mankind is lazy, obese and happy that way.  WALL-E's best friend is a cockroach.  WALL-E plays songs from Hello, Dolly throughout the film.<br/><br/>Oh, and this is essentially a silent movie.<br/><br/>Yeah, you read that right. There is maybe 15 (non-consecutive) minutes of dialogue in the whole movie. <br/><br/>But the beauty of it is nothing went wrong. Not. One. Thing. Everything about this movie works. WALL-E is, quite simply, a masterpiece of storytelling. <br/><br/>It is so richly layered and works on so many levels that, even after only one viewing, I feel confident that we will be discovering things in this film for years to come. I can't imagine another studio making this movie. They would have second-guessed it right out of existence. <br/><br/>If it wasn't for the fact that Stanley Kubrick has been dead for close to a decade, I would have thought he had created this film under a pseudonym. There are so many Kubrickian flourishes: from the use of classical music to the meditation on mankind's relation to computer technology and artificial intelligence to the role corporations will play in the advancement of said technology. There are some pretty heady themes explored in this film. But it does all this without ceasing to be a film for children. It's a movie that children won't outgrow but grow into. <br/><br/>This film has depth, but it never forgets to entertain. It's cute, charming and heartwarming. It's briskly paced AND remarkably detailed. And let's not forget, it is genuinely funny. This is not an ""eat your vegetables"" cinematic experience. This movie works on every conceivable level. Even its closing credits are good.<br/><br/>And, as an added bonus, Pixar continues its tradition of including a cartoon short that precedes the film. Titled Presto, the plot involves an adorable, hungry rabbit and his magician owner doing battle over a carrot in front of an oblivious sold-out crowd. Presto is a crowd pleaser. It manages more laughs in five minutes than most feature length cartoons can muster in ninety.<br/><br/>On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being Aladdin and 1 being Aladdin 2: Return Of Jafar, WALL-E gets a 10."
"Nastasha","10","4","8","30 June 2008"," The best film I've seen in years!
","Just saw the film on opening night in Vancouver, and I must say that I have not enjoyed a movie this much in many years. In the first few minutes everyone sitting in the movie theater falls in love with Wall-E, a character so superbly written, he doesn't need to speak. As I watched, I realized that I bought into whatever Wall-E wanted and desired, and hoped that he would find someone to share all the little bits, that made him so lovable, with. I loved how, much like children, he found joy and value in things which people generally consider worthless, such as the diamond ring box, but not the diamond ring.<br/><br/>The clasping of the hands was a clear and wonderful setup of defining to the audience, what Wall-E's objective was, and what that meant to him. Often films try so hard to create a complex and hard-to-follow objective, that just becomes, well... hard to follow, and eventually hard to care about. This film can hang its hat on many things, such as excellent animation, but most of all, it is one of the best crafted stories I've seen.<br/><br/>Bravo Pixar, you did it again!"
"zgamer-1","9","4","8","30 June 2008"," Whimsical, humorous and thought provoking. In other words, pure Pixar!
","Face it, where would Disney be without Pixar? Not only does the company continually push the boundaries of CGI imagery and craft incredible movies, but they do it on such a continual basis that it defies modern film-making. Surely they must have one bad movie that would merit a Disney license? If Wall-E is any indication, it's not going to happen for a very long time.<br/><br/>Now there have been quite a few people complaining that Wall-E's political undertones (or overtones, I can never tell which one) are too blatant or overbearing. To them, I say lighten up. Sure, the fear of corporate control and human's causing their own downfall through waste themes have been covered before. However, none of them were presented in such a unique and approachable way as in this film. In fact, I say the film benefits greatly from these themes because it helps expand the film to an adult audience. This could have easily been a mindless romp with cute robots (much like the miscreant animated films Robots), but the messages beneath give the film brains to match its heart.<br/><br/>And boy does heart really mean something here. It still surprises me that Pixar can create such deep and involving stories on simplest of premises. A robot, yearning for companionship, finally finds a chance for romance in the form of a sleek, Macintosh white female robot. That's pretty much all the actual plot is about, despite the political themes. What carries the plot so far is the in depth characterization, effective use of nonverbal communication and a surprising range in emotion. The boys at Pixar follow the philosophy of Walt Disney to the bone hear, matching every laugh with equal amounts of tears. But not tears of sorrow mind you, but tears of joy. There are so many tender moments in this film that its hard not to let out a tear when everything comes to a close. Classic Disney.<br/><br/>Really though, Wall-E is all about...well, Wall-E. He is by far one of the most likable lead characters to come out of a Disney film in a very long time. For one thing, he hardly says a word, which is an improvement from the Disney characters that never shut-up. Two, the fact that an artificial being can develop emotions and desires and maintain our sympathies is a triumph to itself. And three, he's just such a little trooper. He faces the cold emptiness of space, menacing robots, malfunctions and all sorts of perils all for the robot he loves. I dare say he's braver than any of the Incredibles. Plus, you just got to love his speech, which is a delightful range of electric boops combined with a sort of garbled Microsoft Speech voice when attempting words.<br/><br/>All of Wall-E's characters are equally as deep as the lead. Eve is more than just a typical love interest, expressing moments of short tempered anger as well as compassion. Though it takes her a while to truly respond to Wall-E's advances, the progression of their romance feels natural. And again, there is no sappy dialog to ruin the experience, so the romance feels pure and simple to understand. The human characters, who are all morbidly obese due to their use of hover chairs and almost trance like existence under corporate control, actually stand on their own too. Even As more humans become aware of their existence and past one by one, we are just as sympathetic to their curiosity of what they missed all this time. I chuckled to myself as two ""freed"" people splash happily in a pool they never realized existed, only to realize perhaps this is the first time they have ever truly experienced such a leisure. Perhaps one of my favorite moments is when the captain of the humans' ship begins probing the computer over human history. As hours fly by (or so we assume between the intervals), he innocently continues this quest with a childlike curiosity, fascinated by simple things like pizza, farming, dancing and such. It really made me treasure the simple pleasures of my life so much more.<br/><br/>Maybe Wall-E isn't the best movie of all time. Then again, I bet people said that about The Godfather, Lord of the Rings, The Shawshank Redemption and even the first Toy Story. If so, then I will have to say that by Pixar standards, Wall-E is by far their most ambitious, simple and heartfelt outings yet and definitely the best of the year so far."
"moutonbear25","9","4","8","29 June 2008"," Out of this World
","To be animated can mean a number of things. While it obviously refers to the artistic process in which still images are strewn together in sequences to appear as though they are moving, it can also mean to bring someone or something to life. Pixar Animation Studios are masters of both of these animated meanings and their genius lies in their seemingly effortless ability to accomplish both of these feats simultaneously. In the studio's history, they have managed to make toys playful when no one else was looking, the plight of a bunch of ants seem monumental and rats in the kitchen somehow not only normal but entirely justifiable. Despite all of these milestones, Pixar has outdone themselves with their ninth feature, WALLE. It might be unfair to suggest that no other company could accomplish this but there is certainly no other company that could have done as good a job. WALLE is short for Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class and the character himself is a collapsible box with curiously wide eyes that gets around on tank treads and solar power. He may be made up of nothing but rusting metal and parts that need frequent replacing but he is also the most endearing, romantic dreamer that Pixar has ever crafted. You just want to squeeze the little guy. Trust me; the tetanus shot you'd need after that would be totally worth it.<br/><br/>WALLE takes place about 700 or so years from now. Taking an abnormally critical stance on humanity's penchant to waste without fear of consequence, three-time Pixar director, Andrew Stanton (A BUG'S LIFE, FINDING NEMO), paints the future earth as being uninhabitable. It seems that somewhere around the year 2100, there will be so much garbage on the planet that not only will we need to stack it as high as the highest skyscrapers but we will also need to vacate the planet until the mess is brought under control. Enter WALLE. Hundreds of similar units will work over the next six or seven centuries on a job that was only meant to last five years. The humans who once fled have inevitably all passed on but their future generations continue to float through space on giant cruise ships, oblivious to their history and unaware of their present selves. After so much time has passed, humanity has succumbed to its laziest impulses. We no longer require the need to think for ourselves when we have a multi-conglomerate doing it for us or the need to walk from here to there when we have a ""hoverchair"" to bypass this menial task. Earth is practically a forgotten memory for all but it is still there. Despite being covered in smog and dust and despite also a failed mission to clean up the mess, one WALLE unit remains to keep the pursuit of love, happiness and hope alive.<br/><br/>WALLE is an unfortunate loner and even though his closest companion is loyal cockroach, he never loses faith. He presses on every day in his near impossible mission to make earth inhabitable again without discouragement and with a nagging sensation that there is more to life than this. Considering he isn't actually alive, that's pretty impressive. When another robot, EVE, arrives on earth to search for signs of sustainable life, WALLE finally gets the chance to see and understand what that greater meaning might be. Aside from being an eco-friendly science fiction piece, WALLE is also a moving romance that is unexpected and unmatched by most recent films featuring actual human beings. When WALLE first sees EVE, he knows it is love at first sight. He proceeds to follow her around everywhere she goes, shyly inching closer towards her whenever he feels the moment might be right. He is like a teenager in love for the first time. He doesn't know how to make his move, just that he always wants to be around her. There is no desperation born out of ages of loneliness, just a certainty in what is in the air. The courtship of WALLE and EVE is so innocent and simple that it seems almost silly that we as humans should have such trouble getting it right. <br/><br/>WALLE's ride is pretty smooth, full of laughs, touching moments and inspired cinematography (under the meticulous guidance of contemporary visionary, Roger Deakins) but all of this is expected from the Pixar peeps. There is a misguided attempt to incorporate live-action into the mix that adds a slight level of confusion but can do nothing to take away from the deeply satisfying whole. It is quite an extensive journey and it rests on the shoulders of one little waste management robot. WALLE is unforgettable. His curiosity is matched only by his appreciation for everything in life that humanity has left behind. He may be goofy and clumsy but he is always open to possibility and hope. He is more alive than I am most of the time and the bewilderment and awe that fill his optical devices opened my eyes to things I had stopped seeing altogether. How can so much yearning and wonder come from one little robot, let alone one that is not actually made of real metal but rather drawn that way? WALLE is simply a marvel to behold and the pinnacle of Pixar's progressive mission to redefine what it means to animate."
"Tivor X-09137","10","4","8","29 June 2008"," Absolutely magical
","This is by far the BEST movie that Pixar has ever made, hands-down. If WALL-E is a 5-star movie, then all other Pixar movies are 4-star movies in comparison. It is that magical.<br/><br/>A big part of the magic comes from the fact that the two main characters, robots Wall-E and Eve, barely speak more than one word at a time. Just about all their lines can be written with just one of these three words: ""Wall-E,"" ""Eve,"" and ""Directive."" Despite that, through excellent animation and wondrous voice direction, the audience is always aware of exactly what those two robots are thinking and feeling every second.<br/><br/>Now, I love movies with good dialogue, and we all love witty banters between characters. But by their very nature, language -- especially the witty sort -- requires intellectual interpretation before it can appeal to the audience's emotions. By minimizing the role of language in portraying the relationship between the two robots, Pixar has gone straight to our emotions, and they have succeeded magnificently.<br/><br/>Of course, that's not to say that the movie is only about sappy emotions. The movie also makes a lot of satirical fun at everything from global corporation (everything is Buy n Large, and there is no sign of US government, or any government for that matter), environmentally irresponsible consumerism, cellphone- and television-addicted culture, lethargic and obese general public (and commercial billboards that portray fit models), internet generation who don't know what a book is (and think that pizza grows on trees), so on and so forth. Plus, there is also a pretty refreshing gender role/stereotype reversal between Wall-E and Eve, especially near the end.<br/><br/>Visually, the movie is breathtaking. Particularly of note are the smoke and particle effects, like the scene early in the movie where Wall-E finds a fire extinguisher. Jawdroppingly beautiful and realistic. It makes you want to pull out all other movies with CG smoke effects and yell ""FAKE!!"" at them. It's amazing how Pixar keeps on finding ways to push the 3D CG envelope.<br/><br/>It is not often that a movie exceeds my highest of expectations, and WALL-E did with ease. You can be sure that before the theatrical run is over, I'll be watching this movie at least one more time. And then I'll get it when it's released on Bluray. I do not say this often, but this movie is, without a shred of doubt, a true classic."
"BobaFettFunnaGetYou","10","4","8","27 June 2008"," omfg. plain and simply awesome.
","I was expecting a fun family movie when I went to see it this afternoon, but my expectations were blown out of the water. Overzealous as it may seem, this is one of the most excellent films I've ever seen. I have got to say that I am completely amazed at the greatness of this movie. In my opinion, Pixar has surpassed every single one of its hit films exponentially. Wall E is an amazing movie, with a heart-wrenching love story that made me want to weep at several occasions. In a good way, of course. I recommend this movie 100%. Wall E is amazing in every way. The animation, action, adventure, fun, tragedy, love. The wait for DVD release will be hell. Go see this movie. asap."
"complete_fanatic","10","4","8","27 June 2008"," Perfect in every way, like only Pixar can deliver.
","I've been excited for Wall-E ever since I saw the first ""teaser"" preview for it about a year ago. The trailer was about 20 seconds long, and consisted of Wall-E scooting around some piles of garbage, then looking up at the stars and saying his name. So, obviously, my expectations were pretty high - and I'm happy to say that the movie didn't disappoint me in the slightest. It was funny, adorable, touching, meaningful, and basically perfect in the way that no one but Pixar can manage to achieve.<br/><br/>Lately I've been seeing a lot of news stories about the fact that there's no actual dialogue for most of the movie - in fact, I don't think there's dialogue for at least a half hour - and that Pixar is taking a big risk by doing that. You shouldn't worry about it at all, though. Words aren't needed - in fact, they probably would've ruined the feel of the movie. You'll fall in love with Wall-E anyway."
"michaelnakan","10","6","14","27 June 2008"," Best Pixar Movie yet, and coming dangerously close to perfect.
","A robot who picks up garbage on a deserted Earth. Virtually zero dialogue. A message regarding pollution. A true recipe for disaster. But in a move surprising no-one, Pixar has made it work, and work it does. It's truly a brilliant movie, with virtually no issues to bog it down. The plot revolves around Wall-E, a dinky little robot which goes around picking up garbage, from which he salvages a few things. A rubics cube, a spork, a plant; all interesting things which Wall-E finds and keeps. He also watches an old copy of ""Hello, Dolly"" which he finds endlessly amusing, to the point that he reenacts a dance scene with a garbage can. But Wall-E wants someone to love. And thats the true plot that guides this movie. Wall-E falls in love with an apple-ish robot named Eve, and the movie chronicles their time together. I suppose you could go anywhere for informed opinion about how great this film is, but I wanted to go over some of the faults found, namely pacing. Do not let these comments throw you off. This film has virtually no repetitive moments at all, and Wall-E more than makes up for it with its titular main character, who invokes immediate sympathy and trust. Wall-E is so good because of the pain you feel for the little robot, and the fact you can identify with him. He's the everyman whose fallen for the supermodel, and when him and Eve get closer you really feel a connection. Well it's late, but I must urge you to see this movie. It carved itself a hole in the top ten movies of all time (top 5?) for me, and it's very nearly perfect. Hilarious and charming in good measure, Wall-E really is the best time you'll have at the movies all summer."
"racheljg","10","5","11","7 August 2008"," Better than The Dark Knight. Yes, really.
","***Contains one vague spoiler for The Dark Knight***<br/><br/>Wow, you're still reading after seeing my subject line, good for you. But this truly was better than TDK, or for that matter, any movie I've seen in probably years, and I'll tell you why. Like everyone else has already said, the animation in this film is nothing less than revolutionary. It is simply breathtaking and gorgeous, it must be seen to be believed. But of course we all know that great animation does not a good movie make, so what else did I love about this movie so much? It has real heart, and a solid, believable, touching love story. Now I ask those of you who saw TDK, yes it was full of peril for the characters, but did you truly care for even a minute what happened to any of them? Did you manage to form even one connection with a single character in that movie? I really didn't. Through all the excitement and in-your-face spectacular action scenes, although I was entertained, I never became truly concerned. I barely blinked an eye when one of the main characters was killed. Now compare that to Wall-E, and there is a world of difference. What makes this movie so unique is that hardly any conversation is ever exchanged between characters, and yet you know exactly what they're thinking and feeling, and you can't help but fall in love with them and root for their relationship. I was completely mesmerized within 10 minutes of the movie's beginning, and it only gets better. It is simply beautiful. This movie also stays with you, unlike the TDK which I pretty much forgot 3o minutes after watching it, I was still thinking about this one for days after I saw it, until I finally decided I had to go see it again. <br/><br/>Pixar truly has outdone themselves on this one, I don't see how they could possibly ever beat this. It is a masterpiece, right down to the perfect score, the dead-on sound effects of the robots, and the humor which is subtle instead of over-the-top, in contrast to some of Disney's other movies. I have seen this movie twice in the theater because I am of the opinion that such great animation needs to be seen on the big screen, it just won't quite be the same when it comes out on DVD. I also agree with other reviewers that this movie is a little less kid-friendly than some of Pixar's other films; as I said the humor is often quite subtle and on my second viewing of the movie there were lots of small kids in the theater who seemed to be getting antsy, whereas the adults were entranced. So in conclusion, don't miss this one. It needs to be seen in the theater. If you can't find anyone to go with, go alone. It is truly that good. <br/><br/>In case any one was wondering, I am a 26 year old female who is a fan of most of Pixar's other work, the exceptions being Finding Nemo and Ratatouille which didn't do much for me. I didn't think Pixar could possibly top Toy Story, the long-time champion, but Wall-E has proved me wrong. Yes, really."
"therubixtheory","10","5","11","21 July 2008"," I cant believe anyone human could've conceived this
","This film is just the animation i've been waiting to see, one that's as artistic visually as it is mentally, one that leaves you in running for tissues at the end and makes you think about the way you live your life or can send a message to the new generation.<br/><br/>The short film at the beginning was perhaps even funnier than lifted, i wont spoil it for you but they should really have more of these before any animated film.<br/><br/>I was starting to go that way where I thought Pixar was just all hype, their last two movies ratatouille and cars were extremely anticipated and I had problems with both, but with Rat i saw Pixar moving away from their usual ""Kiddie Flicks"" and started doing something with a little more edge.<br/><br/>And here comes Wall-E, a film that even made me cry reading about it, and after i watched it I opened the floodgates that where my eyes.<br/><br/>I thought the future was portrayed brilliantly, it was believable and made me a little scared of what we might become, I guess I don't really have anything else to say but this.<br/><br/>If you don't cry at the end, whether it's over the environmental message, the vision of how technology could undo us all or the sensationally warm love story between two robots, then you weren't born with a heart inside you."
"zetes","10","5","11","29 June 2008"," Pretty much a masterpiece
","I honestly want to throw every superlative I can think of at this movie. I'm an unabashed Pixar fan, and have been since Toy Story 2, but I was a little disappointed in their last two films, Cars and Ratatouille. Both were good, very good at times, but I don't think they hit the level of what came before. To me, WALL-E is a return to form. No, that's too weak. It's their peak. No, that's wrong, too. A ""peak"" implies that they're about to go down. I doubt that's true, although it's going to be hard to beat this one. WALL-E is my favorite of the Pixar films so far because I think it goes past the point of merely fantastic to that of being transcendent. It's a truly visionary film, one that inspired my jaw to drop over and over again. And it's intimate, too. It's hard to believe, but you're going to fall in love with a couple of robots when you watch the movie. And it's incredibly smart, too. Pixar has actually had this vein in most if not all of their movies, where they deliver moral lessons without any pandering whatsoever. The movie also contains deft social commentary. It's a pure joy to watch, and, without a doubt, one of the all-time great animated movies. Thank God for Pixar."
"stargunner","9","5","11","28 June 2008"," Wall-E is more than just a movie
","Wall-E, to me - as an animator - is a lot more than just a movie. I think it represents a turning point in the world of animation. Ever since Disney took a tumble these past couple of years with a lot of misfires, I think people were starting to lose hope in the animation industry.<br/><br/>But Pixar has always stood from the crowd. Pushing the boundaries and dodging the conveniences of the 3D, Pixar has treasured the traditions of the old masters of animation and brought them to the new dimension of animation.<br/><br/>There's no doubt Wall-E is insanely detailed down to the finest grain. But that's just the icing on the cake to the three things that I think Wall-E will change about animated feature films.<br/><br/>First off, Wall-E breaks the stereotype that animated films are just for kids. There's still a strong feeling amongst moviegoers of the opposite. To remedy this, many animated films have simply thrown in a couple cheap innuendos that their parents kids won't get for another five years to get a couple laughs. Wall-E, however, unites audiences of all ages with brilliant staging and acting, and I think it will begin to break the stereotype that animated films are only for children. No matter if you're 9 or 90, the happy and the sad moments were shared by everyone.<br/><br/>Secondly, Wall-E proves that you don't need to drop the G rating to make an entertaining film. I don't know if a lot of people do know this, but Wall-E does in fact have a G rating, and I can't remember the last time I've seen a widely released film with one.<br/><br/>And lastly, Wall-E demonstrates that acting always triumphs over ridiculously jam-packed and gimmicky scripts. There's hardly any dialogue in this movie, and rightfully so. From every wild action scene to the most delicate detail of animation, not a moment is wasted to convey every range of emotion through acting. And 90% of the characters aren't even humans. I felt more connected to a robot with an eyeball and two fingers than I did with most of the human characters in this film. And that is something that is very precious.<br/><br/>If that isn't enough, Wall-E at its roots is simply a ridiculously charming and beautiful film. I recommend it for everyone, and I'd have to say it's my most favorite Pixar film of all time. It's got a great message and is a wonderful escape from a lot of the frantic and often shallow animated features you see today.<br/><br/>If you've lost faith in the animation world, let Wall-E bring it back to life."

","i love the way i feel moments before walking into the theaters to see a Disney and pixar movie, as i know i'm going to see something spectacular. With that said, i must admit: WALL E is by far the BEST Disney and pixar film yet. the look of the film itself sets it far apart from other DP movies. don't expect to see a cartoon when you see WALLE, it looks so real and really is unbelievable.<br/><br/>besides the look of the film, another amazing aspect of WALL E is the sounds. I Guarantee that the guy that came up with all those sounds will win the Oscar next year. people keep saying that this film has little dialouge. a more accurate description would be to say that the dialouge used most in this movie is robot sounds.don't let that distract you though - beeps and blurps make up the most emotional parts of the movie.<br/><br/>The last thing i would like to say about this film, and the reason this film deserves an Oscar for best picture is because of the beautiful and intelligent political message WAll E provides. Fortunately, becausee the dialogue is all robot sounds it will universal for every human being and the message will have the chance to get its point across.<br/><br/>pay close attention to the music in this movie too, it's particularly beautiful.<br/><br/>WALL E is great, please do yourself a favor and go see it. it's not for kids, it's for EVERYONE.<br/><br/>oh, and the short film they play before the film is also the best of em all."

","I know I am going to get a lot of negative feedback from this but I was not very happy with the film. I like going to the movies with my kids to see uplifting and funny films. It did have funny parts in it I have to admit...but what I was sitting there thinking the entire time was that Pixar was trying to send a message and a big one at that. I think it just highlighted how wasteful we are and how fat, lazy and complacent we have become as humans. I honestly think Pixar had an ulterior motive in this one and figured a lot of parents would be seeing this with their kids. The kids would see cute robots but ultimately the parents would see what slobs we are. This is just my opinion....don't hate me."

","OK... This is a good movie. Pixar is definitely the best when it comes to animation. The animation is impeccable. I was most impressed by the sound: Ben Burtt and whoever else...awesome. But, seriously, what is all the buzz about? The plot has a message... Great. But it's way too slow! I went into the film expecting it to be slow, knowing there were few characters and still found myself looking for ways to amuse myself. What's even worse is that it was so unbelievingly boring. Every Pixar/Disney movie until this one infused a brilliant blend of great animation with comedy appropriate for all ages. Oh and by the way, what the 'bad word' is up with the animation of the humans? It was like the movie makers spent up all their good graphics and stuff on the incredible space sequences and intricate trash-laden landscapes.<br/><br/>READ THIS: However, in all fairness, this is a movie worthy of watching. It is not the best animated film ever (and though that's only an opinion I can't even see how someone could think that). It is not worth the #19 spot on the IMDb Top 250. But go see it. The graphics and sound are good enough to make up for the other aspects. I would give this a 7/10 stars but I can't get over how everyone is so 'oh my gosh it's Best Picture' worthy. Just bear in mind what I've said."

The Wall-e animation, even though it represented a harsh truth and an end of the world concept. It also delivered a sweet and hopeful outcome that captivates the audience. In the first 40 minutes of the movie, the most interesting thing is how it demonstrates the story line without the use of words to show all the emotions that the characters go through. In the second part it demonstrate show the technology has effect the humanity and how their selfish and wasteful behavior has doomed their lives on earth to the point that they had to take refuge in spaceship. The citizens in this so called ''Space Station'' are so dependent to the technology that even their most basic activities are being done for them by machines. If you think about it , this is somehow similar to the life style we have today. As we evolution our god gets, our daily activities become easier and there for we don't have to work as hard. It has been quite some time that Pixar has changed its perspective on making animations. Their image has changed from making fairy tales to delivering more realistic story. Wall-e cannot be considered as just an entertainment for the children because adults can relate to its audience. It shows love, drama, action, humor and so an... You can't just consider Wall-e as good animation to me it's a masterpiece that could remains as an inspirational story that would last for many years to come."

","A love letter to science-fiction films of old with a modern environmentalist message, WALL-E is another winning confection from Pixar, the folks who have made an art out of wrapping adult themes in childish whimsy and coming out with movies that please both elements. Starring a box shaped little robot with more than a passing resemblance to E.T., WALL-E is quite possibly the cutest Pixar hero ever, despite the fact that he's a trash compactor with eyes. A story centering on a wordless robot could be cold and uninviting, but not in Pixar's capable hands. Never has a robot been this compassionate: WALL-E's got heart.<br/><br/>The story of the film is deceptively simple. WALL-E (Waste Allocator Load Lifter - Earth Class) is the last of his kind, a robot created by the Buy-N-Large Corporation to clean up the piles of trash left on Earth by the conspicuous consumption of human beings. The humans themselves have evacuated the now-lexically trashed Earth for a Eden-like spaceship habitat called the Axiom (also created by BNL corp.), where they spend their days sipping meals out a cup and reclining on floating easy chairs. Though all his robotic compatriots have long since compacted their last, WALL-E continues plugging away at his job in an endearingly human way. He wakes up each day to the chime of a Macintosh starting up (score for the folks! Thanks Steve!) and heads out for another day among the trash heaps. He brings a battered coolie along with him to save the things he likes: a ping-ping paddle, a plastic dinosaur toy, a light bulb, a small seedling saved in an old boot. He ends each day in his home, watching an old video tape of Hello Dolly! - an important motif throughout the film.<br/><br/>Things change drastically for WALL-E the day EVE shows up. She is slick and futuristic and quite obviously a girl; WALL-E falls in love almost immediately. It turns out EVE has been sent from the Axiom to scan the earth for signs of habitable life. Their convincing courtship is done completely without dialog, quite a feat for sound designer Ben Burtt who found a way to make ambient noise into recognizable words for WALL- E. Trying to impress the coolly modern EVE, WALL-E shows her the seedling he found, at which point EVE goes into a hibernation state and awaits the return of her spaceship. WALL-E, of course, cannot abide by his beloved EVE's status and hitches a ride into space to save her.<br/><br/>A bit disturbingly, all the humans on the Axiom have regressed to babyhood (enormously fat, with chubby extremities and little bone density) after 700 years of living up in space and drinking their meals through a straw. It seems that this may have been the aim of the BNL Corporation, who have instructed the ship's Computer Auto (Sigourney Weaver) to never let the humans return to Earth, even if it is found to be habitable once again. Though WALL-E's only aim on the Axiom is to find his beloved EVE, he finds himself wrapped up in a race to save the seedling he collected on earth from the treacherous tentacles of Auto. Along the way he meets a variety of robots, each with their own supposed job, all of which are related to cleaning up. It becomes clear that human consumption is what has trashed the earth and is now trashing Outer Space as well.<br/><br/>Though he is tiny and relegated to the dirtiest of the dirty jobs, WALL- E truly understands how to find value in sullied things and how to create magic out of useless objects. He is more human than the humans in that way and slowly, without preaching (he can't even talk), WALL-E begins to show them how to regain what they have lost through sloth and over reliance on technology. It's an environmentalist film, but also a poignant homage to simple joys in this era of pods and digital everything.<br/><br/>Half of what is so enchanting about watching WALL-E, as in all Pixar films, is seeing how the filmmakers have created a working universe in which to play. There is no skimping here, no visible shortcuts. WALL-E himself has a million ways to express his emotions, from compacting into a box when he feels shy to wiggling his binocular-like eyes in awe when he first beholds EVE, all of which are related to physical, realistic components. That allegiance to authenticity allows the film to send its narrative to fantastic heights without seeming over the top or phony.<br/><br/>Like all previous Pixar films, the meaning of WALL-E is deeper and more profound than the merchandising opportunities found therein. It's a love story, yes, but it's also a story about staying true to your own heart in the blandly evil face of authority. It's a tale about saving the small things and cherishing the world you live in, no matter how imperfect its surface might seem. Andrew Stanton, who won an Oscar in 2004 for Finding Nemo, has certainly earned his place in the pantheon of animation pioneers, but with WALL-E, he has taken not only the art of animation, but the art of storytelling to new, unimaginable heights.<br/><br/>As a bonus, Pixar have affixed a Looney Tune-y short about an arrogant magician and his hungry rabbit to beginning of the WALL-E. Presto! is pure Looney Tunes and a fitting appetizer to the lovely film to follow."
"djansen24","10","2","3","13 November 2010"," This is what movie making is all about!
","This is so far my favorite Pixar film. It expresses so much in its running time. It is truly a film for all ages and audiences that dazzles the eye and takes your breath away. The attention to detail is awesome which makes the slower pace of the first act of the film absolutely mesmerizing. And that is the key to Wall-E. While the storyline is trimmed down to razor tight telling (that is, not wasting time on what is not essential to the story and themes), it feels open and relaxing. Some of the best moments come when Eve and Wall-e simply fly together or gaze on the stars. The conflict in the movie grabs ahold of you and pulls at your heart strings while leaving a sense of wonder in you. That's because there is a sense of hope and love that permeates the story; exactly what you expect from a film primarily targeted for children. But adults will relate to because of the depth of the storytelling. Andrew Stanton and crew should feel great about what they have made here. It is not only good sci-fi and good animation, but it rejuvenates you while you watch it. My 4 and 3 year old absolutely love this movie and so do my wife and I. Don't miss it!"

""Wall-E"" not only have an incredible animation, but also the characters were simply adorable, likable and interesting, and the history was funny and charming form beginning to end, with lots of heartwarming moments and captivating scenes, beautifully made. The plot was brilliant: Most of films aimed to children have very simplistic or silly plots, but ""Wall-E"" has a deep, meaningful story that everyone from the public could appreciate, from the youngest members of the audience, to the most cynical adults. ""Wall-E"" is simply one of the best films ever made, and it's a film that deserves everyone's recognition. I don't think that it is overrated at all; actually I think that is pretty underrated, because this film don't have any single flaw."
"ValleyOfScarletFever","9","2","3","24 February 2010"," Great Movie
","I really had no idea what to make of the new Disney/Pixar movie ""WALL-E"". I mean, I heard great reviews of the movie, claiming it was ""The definite best animated picture Oscar"" or even ""best picture worthy"". I seriously doubted this. At the same time, I heard people say that it was ""overpreachy garbage"", or ""Pixar rubbish spewed at us again by the marketing advertisers at Disney"". I also highly doubted this. I heard that it was lighthearted, yet at the same time really depressing. In short, I had no idea how this movie would be.<br/><br/>Oh dear.<br/><br/>So, I came in the movie with a pretty open mind, yet still skeptical. The last few Pixar movies, with an exception to ""Ratatoullie"", haven't been that great. I was worried that ""WALL-E"" would have been over-hyped, and that it wasn't really all that great.<br/><br/>I was wonderfully mistaken.<br/><br/>First off, I'd like to say that the opening short was great. Not good- great. It was funny, witty, and flat out cute. Just wanted to say that.<br/><br/>So, I've heard many people saying that the opening was artsy. I'd have to say I'd disagree. It wasn't artsy- it was a representation of WALL-E's life. It had a few sight gags that will entertain the kiddies, yet at the same time was pretty emotional. It opens on a ruined and not green Earth, yet in the background plays music from ""Hello Dolly"". But after that amazing opening, we finally get to the story.<br/><br/>EVE arrives. Immediately, WALL-E (unsurprisingly) is enamored with her. (Even though she keeps trying to shoot him with her laser.) There is a cute little montage with WALL-E wanting desperately to hold her hand, a very sweet theme throughout the movie. The movie hits off with WALL-E trying to show EVE the ""wonders"" of his Earth, and meanwhile he shows her the last remaining plant that he found. THIS is when the movie begins.<br/><br/>WALL-E and EVE get trapped on this Space Cruise, which has been going on for about 700 years. In other words, all of the people are all fat and ugly and lazy. But they're so lovable! Again, this moment could come off as preachy, but it doesn't, and moves quite smoothly. There are also many funny robots doing- well, funny things. Getting back to the plot, pretty much the plant that WALL-E finds and EVE gets becomes the center plot, proving that life is capable on Earth- but it's not as easy to get back as it sounds. It becomes somewhat of an action type movie, with comedy, and a little romance. I can't say anymore because it'll give too much of the plot away, but let's just say I got a little teary eyed.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to all ages, but really I'd say 6 and up. I mean, not saying that little kids won't like it, they just might find it boring after a while, and might hunger for something with a little more in your face comedy, more of a ""Toy Story"" or ""Monster's INC"". In other words, it's not a ""kiddie flic"", but rather a ""family movie."" I still don't like the product placements for this movie every five minutes, but at least the message wasn't IN YOUR FACE obvious. It was subtle, which was nice.<br/><br/>In all, I'd say that this was a really good movie and would recommend it. (Oh yeah, the animation was beautiful. Just wanted to add that.)

","I highly recommend people to watch this film. It doesn't matter what your age is. This film is appropriate for everyone. It is a cute,enjoyable,fun movie. It is just great. Many people can relate to this film. Because WALL-E is kind of like an underdog, we all cheer for him. :) This movie shows us very important advice to never give up! The music in this movie was very sad. Overall I love this movie, it has so much going for it. You won''t be disappointed. So I had to give this movie a 10/10, I liked this movie more than other previous Animated movies like the Lion King. For kids, this movie is enjoyable and cute. For adults/teens it is much more than that! 10/10"
"DukeSantos","6","8","21","27 June 2008"," Pixar's 'Inconvenient Truth'?
","Good flick. Nicely done from an art/production design standpoint as expected, with nods to 2001/Star Wars/Silent Running, etc. Sweet moments with just music and barely any dialogue, which made this feel a lot like a Pixar short sometimes. The Spork bit is one of the best moments in the movie...and sound designer Ben Burtt even sneaks some of his old R2-D2 effects into Wall*E's vocabulary.<br/><br/>Not sure, however, that I jive with some reviewers out there who are calling it 'an instant classic' and 'epic', etc. Maybe they see WALL*E as a pro-environment, anti-big-corporation message? They could be forgiven for doing so. It's a great movie, but I wonder whether some people out there are perceiving it as an affirmation of an agenda and are aggrandizing the movie for the wrong reasons.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. I appreciate the movie's message that Americans need to get off their asses, unplug from the screens and ear buds and associated inputs, and go out for a walk, plant a garden, or fall in love. And yes, some of our landfills might encroach on our cities someday soon (fed in no small measure by Happy Meal toys from Pixar movie tie-ins). WALL*E comes just short of getting unbearably preachy about all this, but I worry that many reviewers will pick up the preachy ball and run with it, and will laud WALL*E as ""Pixar's Inconvenient Truth"".<br/><br/>Maybe I'm over-thinking things too much. At the very least, Advocates of Morbidly Obese Individuals or the 'Gravity Challenged' (are they a group yet? If not, they will be) are gonna be boycotting this flick. Just wait.<br/><br/>But all the robots and spaceships are cool."

","WALL-E is damn near perfect. I have never felt such emotional attachment for robots than when I watch this movie. Every character has a distinct personality while being a robot. The sound mixing is stellar considering they had to create these abstract sounds to represent the deepest parts of imagination. The story is super easy to follow even though most of the characters are limited to making random robotic noises as dialogue. In fact the first 30 minutes of the film are played out like a silent film.
Many complain that this film should have gone 100% with the silent aspect, and while I do see where they are coming from, I feel like the plot didn't have much elsewhere to go if they had just stayed on earth. There also seem to be many complaints about the environmental preachy-ness.

Amidst evidence of the very worst of human nature, we're also reminded of its most redeeming qualities, and experience many of them through fresh eyes.

"elicopperman","9","1","1","17 June 2018"," Possibly Pixar's Crowning Achievement
","10 years ago, Pixar released Wall-E, which started development as far back as 1995 when Toy Story was released, but was never put into full production until 2002 by Andre Stanton. What followed was a movie going experience unlike any other Pixar venture ever before crafted due to the raw emotions and intellectual philosophies it contains. While Ratatouille still remains my personal favorite Pixar film, there is no denying how brilliant Wall-E is from start to finish. Imagine what would happen if ""Walt Disney, Charlie Chaplin, Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg decided to collaborate on a movie together"" (Stefan Ellison).<br/><br/>For starters, what makes Wall-E stand out from many animated films is its usage of visual storytelling. As it centers around two distinct robots, one named Wall-E from a trash ridden Earth and one named Eve from a maximum spaceship, they mainly communicate with vocal effects and bleeps. This is the perfect representation for animation, as the first ten minutes establishes Wall-E and its position on a deserted wasteland to an understandable degree to the audience. As the old saying goes, actions speak louder than words, and it's fantastic how Wall-E's interests and interactions with the environments around it tell more than any amount of dialogue ever could.<br/><br/>Speaking of vocals and lack of dialogue, most of the robot sound effects were provided by former Star Wars sfx technician Ben Burtt. Burtt doesn't simply create mechanical beeps, he creates multiple vocal ranges and sounds that define each robot depending on what they're conveying, let alone Wall-E. Another cool touch was having the Apple product MacInTalk to be the voice of Auto, as it emulates its artificial intelligent presence throughout the film. There are of course other noteworthy voice actors like Jeff Garlin, John Ratzenberger, Kathy Najimy and even Sigourney Weaver, but as good as they are, none of their contributions will ever live up to the specific sounds for each robot that make them come off as more than just interactive machines.<br/><br/>At its core, Wall-E is a love story, and the progression of Eve feeling uncomfortable around Wall-E to soon falling in love with it transitions believably throughout the feature. This is because Wall-E never directly forces its feelings towards her and mainly wants to have a friend to no longer feel alone. Even though Eve was initially designed to be ""directive"", she does develop outside her duty upon seeing the positive qualities of Wall-E and the Earth itself. Not to mention, despite Wall-E's attempts to approach her romantically not growing outside of Hello Dolly, the scenes of it taking care of her or following her around come off as charming due to its unselfish attitude. It isn't until she views footage of Wall-E taking care of her that she decides she loves him back, making her arch all the more touching.<br/><br/>Now the one aspect of the film that has been debated ever since its release is its social commentary, mainly the environmental message depicted in the conflict between idealism and capitalism in the Axiom spaceship. The main reason the humans can't leave the ship is because of a massive government corporation taking control of the world. A plant that Wall-E and Eve discover hightens the environmental message to remind the humans to take care of the Earth, yet it does not come off as preachy and instead works as a major goal. While Wall-E initially came aboard the Axiom to save Eve, it discovers the bare necessities in how effective the plant is to humans, making it more determined than ever to save them. <br/><br/>The main reason the humans are so infatuated with their own technology is because they've become too careless to do anything else, something unfortunately common in today's era of social media dominating people's lives. However, the film at no point ever mocks the humans and instead sympathizes with them, down to Captain McCrea giving orders all the time by his auto pilot for no other reason other than his naivety. Even two humans aboard the Axiom named John and Mary come face to face in romance thanks to Wall-E himself, showing how the unlikeliest of coincidences can be more meaningful than everyday occurrences. <br/><br/>However, what I like most about Wall-E is how optimistic it is, as it shows a genuine love and respect towards planet Earth through the simplest of things, hence why Wall-E itself finds so much joy in stacking up cubes of trash. In addition, Captain McCrea represents the best kind of optimist, the ones that are highly determined to save their own life based off the smallest form of natural evolution, while Auto represents the pessimists who refuse to believe that anything can bring a positive change to the world. Seriously, there are plenty of people out there who only live and breath on nothing but pessimistic thoughts, and they'll also try to manipulate you into believing their ideas, regardless if you have your own feelings or not. This makes the moments of McCrea and Wall-E standing up for what's right all the more captivating, showing how positivity and hope helps one more than negativity ever will.<br/><br/>Finally, the animation is stellar beyond belief, mainly because of how experimental it is. The acting from Wall-E and Eve is quite clever, given how the crew chose Wall-E to have binoculars for eyes, which convey all its emotions and outer thoughts beautifully. Eve's various eye expressions are also enough to sell herself as a fully realized character. The depiction of outer space is gorgeous to the eyes, and the define dancing sequence just might be one of cinema's greatest moments due to the stunning effects and crisp flying scenes. The usage of color is a notable highlight, especially the contrast between the brownish and grainy wasteland of the world and the Axiom's blueish sterile interiors, creating an identity for each area the film takes place in. The camerawork is also fun to watch, given the influence of 1970s cinematography, swooping crane shots, and even the camera going in and out of focus, all of which to help bring us into the world much more.<br/><br/>In conclusion, after ten years of existence, Wall-E still stands the test of time as one of the most magical, touching and downright brilliant films ever made. As both a major game changer for the sci-fi genre and an adorable romance story, it succeeds in flying colors with its unique take on storytelling, characterization, and themes of fundamentalism vs cynicism. No joke, if we had more beings like Wall-E in our lives, chances are the world would be a much better place, and it all starts by shining hope around the world, let alone with plants. Thank you to not only director Andrew Stanton, but also the likes of Jim Morris, Pete Docter, Jim Reardon, Ben Burtt and all the talented animators, artists and technicians at Pixar for bringing his movie into our lives. Even after 700 years, there's a high chance that audiences will still be immersed and enchanted by its wonderful story and characters."
"teodorodontosaurus","9","1","1","25 April 2018"," An exception within the computer animated movie business
","I've always had a problem with computer animations, even in the early stages. With very few exceptions, they all look the same and follow the same ideas and patterns. Of course, the major problem is that they're keep coming, and getting more and more duller.
The graphics are simply not appealing to me; 3D computer generated animations simply lack emotions and depth. They might be on the right side of the uncanny valley, but there's still a problem with textures and facial expressions - eerily cold and somehow mechanic expressions. Hand-drawn animations are clearly more expressive, with natural movements and more spontaneity. This adds a warm touch to the overall atmosphere.
Now, for plot ideas and jokes; everything is recycled; same jokes, different faces. The jokes are a combination of wacky, witty and semi-satirical moments taken straight from Tex Avery or Hanna-Barbera production cartoons and the classy, emotional and romantic moments from the early Disney cartoons; actually, some ideas are copied even from other computer animated movies.
Of course, there are indeed some very few exceptions; this movie for instance; the computer generated images actually work here and paradoxically, the protagonists have real emotions. The fact that this movie doesn't rely on dialogues is another highlight here. There are some major mistakes here (ex. the effects of a ship leaning in space), but what the hell, I really don't care. I appreciate the sincerity of this movie.
A charming romance with a subtle satirical content and ""Do androids dream of electric ship"" concepts, for all the kids in the world.

"iancmtexas","10","1","1","11 April 2018"," An animated masterpiece
","Pixar is known for making high-quality animated movies, but out of all of their films, in my opinion, THIS is their magnum opus. WALL-E is almost perfect, with great characters, clever commentary, creative scenes, an interesting plot, an amazing score, and, even 10 years after its release, fantastic animation that hasn't aged a day. Also, in the entire first half of the movie, along with many scenes in the second half without human characters, Pixar is able to show us the setting, establish memorable characters, and fully immerse us in the world with practically no dialogue. To this day, I have never seen a film that did this on the same magnitude and with the same success as WALL-E.
 Overall, I highly recommend this to anyone who hasn't already seen it, and even some people who haven't seen it in a while. Despite how memorable this film is, every once in a while, I still find myself watching it once in a while to experience the charm of WALL-E all over again."

"TheOny13","10","1","1","20 February 2018"," Surpassed my expectations in every way possible!(no spoilers)
","Until 2008 Pixar has made a name for itself with great movies like Toy Story and Finding Nemo, but after seeing this movie I realized that that was only the end of the beginning for Pixar. Wall-E is a movie directed by Andrew Stanton and tells the story of a cleaning robot in a futuristic Earth who unwillingly gets involved in a space journey that could very well affect the whole humanity.<br/><br/>Honestly the first movies that brought me into Pixar universe were Toy Story trilogy and Finding Nemo and some years later (as in this year) I decided to watch some more. Firstly I started with Coco then I watched Zootopia and they quickly become my favorite from Pixar. That was until I saw this movie which honestly is at least as good as those if not even better and maybe best Pixar movie ever? The story is so simple and yet so captivating and full of mystery. It quickly caught my attention from the first moments blending humor and intrigue with mystery extremely well. Let me tell you that the main robot in this movie is adorable and at times extremely inspirational. The movie itself is inspirational and also very mature with themes that resonated with and spoke to me. For example themes like: what will happen if our self-convenience would put a hold on us and made us lazy? or... What will happen in the future to our planet if we continue to exploit it as hard as we do it now and not caring for it at the same time? What could happen if we could create AI and let it slip from our control and having them controlling us? These themes are so well explored while the movie is also entertaining that it makes movies like T2 or Matrix (which in my opinion are not at all good) or Interstellar look like a child written movies. I had expectation before watching the movie expecting a entertaining animated movie with a lot of fun but what I got was even more: excitement, entertainment and inspirational art. I understand how this movie got nominated for best screenplay because it's maybe as good as The Dark Knight was that year (also that movie didn't got nominated for screenplay although is one of the best movies of all time). That's why for me this is The Dark Knight of animated movies. It is on a different level from any other animated movies along with Coco, Zootopia and Toy Story 3. The animation was incredible... I mean 10 years later and it still looks like a movie released at least last year if not this year. The music was phenomenal and it is a shame that such a wonderful and brilliant composer like Thomas Newman still hasn't won an Oscar although he deserved at least one or two Oscars. As for gripes with this movie... there were certain parts where it was hard for me to think about certain events' explanations while enjoying the movie although by the end everything comes full circle and it's extremely well done. Aside from that this movie is pretty much flawless and one of the best if not THE best from Pixar.<br/><br/>Overall a fantastic movie with superb story, great animation, mature themes and messages and a wonderful score. 10/10"

"XxXMinecraftPVPGodXxX","9","1","1","17 October 2017"," Big ol' humans
","Wall-e, is perhaps one of the greatest movies ever released by Pixar. The movie begins with a small, rusty robot named Wall-e. He is a trash compactor for a future earth, abandoned by humans because of all of its filth. But, one day Wall-e meets a robot named Eva. This robot was sent by the human race in order to find plant life to prove that earth was again livable. Eventually, Eva does find plant life and is called back to her ship. Wall-e follows her and makes it on to the ship. As Wall-e boards the ship, he sees, for probably the first time, what time has done to the human race. Humans are all insanely fat wasting their time away drinking food, sitting in transportation chairs, and using their futuristic screens. Although most remain captivated by their technology, there are many small scenes inserted into the movie in which humans rediscover parts of life they have forgotten. Wall-e, a wonderfully crafted Pixar movie, shows the small joys of life that humanity often takes for granted.<br/><br/>One of the first things that this movie shows us, is that we take being able to move around for granted. Have you ever thought about how cool it is that you could walk, because I know I haven't. In the movie Wall-e, people are pretty much contained to wherever their chair can go. In one scene, a man is knocked out of a chair by our beloved robot and is left to flounder around helplessly calling for help. Although Wall-e does eventually gets him back into his seat, the movie goer knows that humans are essentially helpless by themselves. Imagine what kind of life we would live without being able to move. There would be no beach going, no water parks, no rollercoasters. Life would be terrible without being able to move. Wall-e shows not only movement is taken for granted, but also lack of technology.<br/><br/>When I write technology I mean everything whether it be phones, tablets, or even roads. Sometimes we just need to take a break from everything and look away. I am fairly certain that no one ever really thinks about how lucky they are that they are not completely surrounded by technology. This is what is awful about life in Wall-e. People are so caught up in their video conversations and what not that they don't pay attention to the what surrounds them. In one scene of Wall-e, Wall-e accidentally bumps into a women on her space chair. When he accidentally stops her video screen, she looks away and is almost paralyzed by awe at the gigantic ship surrounding her. But, because almost all of the humans in the movie are always lost in their screens, they almost forget where they are. Hopefully, we never take for granted the wonderful world we live in and have our earth end up like Wall-e's. Although we should never take these two things for granted, they are both not even close to being as important as living.<br/><br/>""I don't want to survive, I want to live"". This was said by the captain of the ship towards the end of the movie and I feel like it sums up the entire point of this film. Humans are so lost video chatting, eating, or whatever when they should be living life. This can be shown by the two of the main human characters John and Mary. These were the two people that Wall-e bumped into earlier. Not only do they stop living wired to their screens, but they end up falling in love. They stare into space and take trips to the pool with each other while others are completely oblivious. Humans should never forget about this. Sometimes it's better to go and live your life rather than just play it by the book. <br/><br/>In conclusion, Wall-e shows us many things that we take for granted. These abnormally large humans prove that some of the little things that we have in life aren't treasured as much as they should be. Humans should always be aware of their gifts whether it be living, being away from technology, or just moving. Thank you Wall-e."

","Pixar has a reputation of not making bad movies, until Wall-E (in my opinion.) After all the amazing reviews, I saw it expecting a spectacular fun Disney flick but instead got an annoying robot loving another robot with a message about the environment. Disney is supposed to cater to little kids, they do not know about the environment, so kinda threw me off. The only thing I knew the kids would love was seeing Wall-e make a mess out of his clumsy self. Also, I don't know if it's just me, but all of Pixar's humans are always fat. Yes, this one's plot line makes them that way but still, didn't seem any different than the humans in any other film. I loved the short before the movie, and honestly I wish that was the movie and this wasn't. If anyone can explain why this movie is so highly acclaimed, inform me (But not really, I know i'm going to be hated for saying all this, it's just my opinion.)"
"MovieKen","3","7","18","17 February 2009"," Sorry, I'm not impressed
","I didn't like this movie, and I think it's overrated. I expected a lot better from Pixar. I can't really explain why I didn't like this movie without sharing details about the film, so stop reading now if you don't want to be spoiled.<br/><br/>Spoilers start here.<br/><br/>First, this is a very boring movie for the first 45 minutes. As I've said in other reviews, I don't need constant action to be entertained. Some of my favorite films of all time are very heavy on dialog and very light on action - for example, 12 Angry Men, Vertigo, and Judgment at Nuremberg. These three films have virtually no action, but they do have intelligent dialog and realistic story lines. I'd rather watch any of those three films all day long than sit through even one more viewing of WALL-E. It has no intelligent dialog at all. Why should anyone want to see a movie with two robots repeating each other's names 100 times? Well, I certainly didn't. Besides, I couldn't figure out why these robots should have been programmed to speak in the first place.<br/><br/>Second, it takes forever to find out that humans have completely wasted the Earth and turned it into a lifeless chunk of rock. Then we're supposed to be happy that humans want to return to Earth since it's safe to live there again. Humans created this mess in the first place, and I don't think they should deserve to come back. I'll say more about this alternate ending later. But if the point of the story was that the humans are lazy and ignorant, a better ending would have been for them to have returned to space in their cruise ship where they could live the life of ease they are used to living.<br/><br/>Third, I was really turned off by the Robots in Love storyline - it was just ridiculous. What purpose would it serve for a trash compactor to have feelings? Sure, it's a kids' movie, but they'd love the robots anyway. And for me, there were just too many scenes showing WALL-E's emotions. It didn't make me care about the character - it just annoyed me.<br/><br/>Fourth, the trash in orbit was insanely stupid. If humans go through all of the trouble to launch garbage into space, why would they go to the additional trouble of putting it into orbit? Sooner or later, all that trash would come crashing down onto the Earth. Why not launch trash into empty space or into the Sun? At least then it would burn up and never have the chance to return to Earth.<br/><br/>Fifth, the names of the robots were so contrived, and that did nothing but bother me even more. Waste Allocation Load Lifter - Earth Class? Really? He doesn't allocate waste, nor does he lift loads of allocated waste. He compacts it, and then stacks it to make lovely skyscraper-sized piles of junk. His name should have been Waste Disposal Artist. But you can't make a nice name out of WDA. So we get some nonsensical contrived name that another robot can repeat until you go insane.<br/><br/>Sixth, the ending was just stupid. So the humans all come back and rebuild the Earth and everyone is happy because we're all living an agrarian lifestyle. The ending I actually expected to see was all the humans getting back onto their cruise ship and going back into space because they couldn't handle the rigors of life on Earth. Then, WALL-E and EVE are left on Earth to take care of it and repopulate it with their robot-kids. I'm not sure I would have liked that ending either, but when one of the robots is named EVE, what would you expect to happen?<br/><br/>I could go on and on, but there's no point to that. I just can't understand why this movie is rated so high. If I ever wanted to see a film about environmentalism and robots, I would watch Silent Running. At least that one is more interesting."

But If Toy Story 2 is your pinnacle to compare all Pixar movies ever to, then you will probably be disappointed as I was. Why do most people love this movie? Well my guess is because they watched it just at the right time emotionally. Sometimes that happens. You are maybe in a bad mood or what ever, and this movie might pull out that giggle or wow factor etc and thus, your overall experience would be very positive. I went into this movie with a very critical eye. Things bothered me from the start and that has never happened to me in a Pixar film... EVER! <br/><br/>Below are plot spoilers so avoid to those who have not yet watched this movie. <br/><br/>Maybe someone can help answer some of these questions?<br/><br/>##SPOILERS##<br/><br/>Well I will organize my thoughts by phrasing them into questions: Why is there a roach that breaks the realism of how bugs really act? Why are the video clips real video footage while the fat future people are 3D cartoons? How does that plant survive in outer space with not oxygen? Why is the planet rendered soooo realistic and rustic and dusty yet the spaceship was very cartoony?"

","While I enjoyed the movies score, animation and the inventiveness of the movie, WALL-E is hurt by the fact that the filmmakers shove the environmental message down our throats and the film succeeds in becoming a propaganda movie that will indoctrinate our children to the ""green"" cause. Humans in the movie, despite what the writer tries to tell us in a 10 second explanation for our girth, are depicted as obese, slovenly destroyers of the Earth and machines, with infant minds capable of learning, are the saviors for all mankind. Change the topic and set the movie in 1930s Germany and you the perfect goose-step movie. On a side note, I would be curious to know why the directors chose the movie ""Hello Dolly"" to be the inspiration for much of the main characters behavior. That movie seems a bit remote of a reference for the young children in the audience."

The movie sets out by asking a clichéd sci-fi question ""what if robots could love?"" and by that point the herds of sheep are already entranced nodding in approval with every tired sentimental comment the movie makes about society. This movie is therapeutic in that it allows the audience to project their personal problems onto the humans in the film who are an exaggerated embodiment of present day society and thus negate themselves as the problem itself.<br/><br/>I have read a dozen 10/10 and 9/10 reviews for this movie and I can tell you that a 10/10 says more about the person rating this movie than it does about the movie itself.<br/><br/>Go to this movie if you have absolutely no standards for plot complexity, subtlety, or art and want to be lulled into a sort of self-denying comma that apparently won't go away until you rush home to rate it 10/10."

","I feel compelled to write a review to balance out some of the hyperbole on these messages.<br/><br/>This is a fine children's movie: humorous, with a good morality message. The animation is outstanding, at least as good as The Incredibles or Nemo.<br/><br/>However, it is not a classic picture for most adults, for several reasons: The plot focuses mostly on robots, which makes it hard for many to really get engaged. The humans in the movie are portrayed as clichéd caricatures, so extreme that it distracted me (where are the ""normal"" people ... no population is _that_ homogeneous?). The plot is very predictable and simplistic: a genuine classic movie would have a genuinely creative and interesting ending. The movie contains several ""car chase"" scenes that are very Hollywood heart-rate-increase boilerplate. The tear-jerking scenes are a dime a dozen.<br/><br/>In summary: the movie has outstanding animation, and is a great kids tale, but this movie doesn't rank up there with 2001 or even ""The Incredibles""."

And 97% of diets fail, so there's not much to hope from there.<br/><br/>Pixar's stern lecture on the sedentary life style doesn't prevent them from offering a video game of the film to keep you firmly planted in one place, nor are their action figures biodegradable. So they don't set much of an example.<br/><br/>If you or someone you love is heavy, do not see this film and don't let them see it either.

"sddavis63","6","4","9","11 July 2009"," Disney's Look At The Future
","In many ways this is a pretty typical piece of Disney/Pixar animation - except in this, instead of cute, adorable animals we have cute, adorable robots. Set about 700 years in the future, the story begins on an earth that is now uninhabitable because of the mounds of garbage that have accumulated. Humans are extinct (on earth at least) and the star of the movie is a little robot called WALL-E, programmed apparently to collect, sort and dispose of garbage. He continues his job long after the humans have disappeared, his only companion being a cockroach (they really can survive anything) - and WALL-E is lonely. Suddenly an alien robot named Eva drops in from space, and WALL-E falls head over heels, eventually accompanying her (somewhat against his will) to her spaceship. Once aboard the spaceship I thought the movie started to take on a bit of a ""Battlestar Galactica"" feel, as the descendants of the humans who had escaped earth find themselves struggling for control of the ship against a group of rogue robots.<br/><br/>A lot here was very good. The animation was brilliant. WALL-E especially seemed almost real rather than animated. The relationship between WALL-E and Eva was developed nicely, and I felt a great deal of empathy for WALL-E as he battled his loneliness. The writers also managed the difficult task of telling us a story with very little dialogue (neither WALL-E nor Eva talk, except to stammer out each other's name.) There's a rather obvious political message in this, warning us about the environmental damage we're causing to the planet. On the down side, the story was rather predictable, and I'm not too sure that this movie would get a great reception among children, since the lack of dialogue and somewhat complex storyline might make it difficult especially for younger ones to follow. As its rating suggests, this animated feature might have more impact on adults than on children.<br/><br/>On balance, I liked it, although I'm not inclined to add it to a collection so I could watch it over and over. 6/10"
"mintho","6","4","9","3 October 2008"," Descent movie
","Wall-E begins on a deserted earth, where our little robot friend seems to be the last functioning unit of a once giant army of waste disposal machines. Humanity has long left the uninhabitable earth, yet Wall-E is still relentlessly doing his job.<br/><br/>But Wall-E is more than just a robot, he has a personality which becomes clear early on as he interacts with his pet roach. He has his own little home where he has a huge collection of items that are either useful (like spare parts for himself) or just seem to be interesting, like a collection of lighters or an old video he regularly watches. However, watching the movie also makes Wall-E feel rather lonely as he realizes that he's all alone on this entire planet (save the roach). <br/><br/>However, fate seems to smile upon little Wall-E as some day a giant space ship lands on Earth to drop off a probe (Eve) which seems to be searching something specific. Wall-E immediately falls into robot-love and tries to make contact with Eve which at first isn't as easy as it sounds.<br/><br/>When Eve finds what she has been looking for, Wall-E and Eve go on a long trip to where the rest of humanity retreated and it's up to the two of them (with a little help) to save the day.<br/><br/>So much for the story. First of all, let me tell you that from a technical point of view, this movie has the best animation you'll find out there. If it wasn't for some characters like the cockroach and the humans who were (purposefully) cartoonish, this movie would look almost real. Especially the first part of the film which takes place on Earth looks completely believable. Also, as always with Pixar, the individual shots are beautifully composed - again, it were especially the scenes on Earth that stood out. The Pixar guys really worked hard to make it look as if this flick was actually shot with a real camera.<br/><br/>Still, this time, Pixar didn't blow my socks off. It was daring to make the first half of the movie basically silent, as it is only in the second half when it turns into a talkie. For me, this actually worked pretty well but I don't know how kids with a short attention span would react to that. Still, I was somewhat relieved when humans first came into play and the pace of this film increased. <br/><br/>But that relief didn't last very long as the unfolding story really wasn't very intriguing, but rather a frame for a series of gags. Ultimately, the quality of Wall-E is its technical aspect combined with some scenes of comic relief. It is however not as clever or witty as previous Pixar productions.<br/><br/>Still an above average film: 6.5/10"

","Can I just ask, what's the big deal here? Why are so many people so rhapsodic about WALL-E? I'm a big fan of science fiction in general and a bigger fan of Pixar, and this is the first Pixar movie I've seen where I found myself glancing at my watch, more than a little bored and anxious to get home.<br/><br/>Two big problems for me: #1: the insipid cockroach, which seemed wildly out of place in a movie that was otherwise reasonably intelligent and scientifically sensible.<br/><br/>And #2: the machines' voices, which seemed maximized for mechanized silliness. I can accept that WALL-E and EVA machines might exist, but I can't suspend disbelief and accept that anyone would design machines with such goo-goo da-da infantile voices.<br/><br/>Without these two concessions to kiddie-flick standards, it would've been a lot easier to be drawn into the story. With these faults, every time we saw the roach or heard the machines' voices I felt like I was taken back to Romper Room, being told a kiddie story by someone who thinks I'm four years old.<br/><br/>For all the hype about WALL-E, this wasn't half as good as THE INCREDIBLES, MONSTERS INC, or FINDING NEMO. If it was from somebody else I'd say WALL-E shows promise, but by Pixar standards, sigh ... of their nine feature films so far, I'd put this one in ninth place."

","Pixar broke the mould with Toy Story by creating animated movies that are equally as enjoyable for adults as children. They have a craft for making their films enjoyable on both levels. I can only vouch for WALL-E from and adult perspective, but judging by the kids at the cinema they also thoroughly enjoyed the movie.<br/><br/>WALL-E is somewhat different from many of the other Pixar movies in that it is much larger in scale. Whereas most of the other movies have been very much individual 'character' based movies this has bigger themes. It concerns a world which mankind have left due to pollution. WALL-E is seemingly the only robot that is left which is busily cleaning up the mess we've left behind. The humans have become grossly lazy on their spacecraft and send down robots to check on the state of the earth to see whether it is inhabitable again. They have been away for 700 years and are waiting for the environment to recover. Some of the images are quite thought provoking and portray a rather bleak version of the future.<br/><br/>The main thread of the movie concerns the romance between WALL-E and EVE who has been sent to look whether plant life has returned to earth. As with most of the Pixar movies it's totally engrossing and you really care about the characters by the end of the movie. A very enjoyable movie and as usual with the Pixar movies the short beforehand (Presto) is superb as well. There's nothing to see during the end credits though this time although the end credits are very well done."

","Writer and director of Pixar Animation Studios' popular film Finding Nemo has made an even bigger hit on June 27th, 2008. Andrew Stanton's animated film WALL-E had not only appealed to the obvious crowd of children, but to teens, young adults, and grandparents.<br/><br/>What was most surprising and seemed to affect most of the audience, was that WALL-E managed to provoke an emotional response. No, it wasn't basic emotions like, ""aww"", or ""teehee"", or ""that was so cute""; the animated film pulled out (real) sadness and (true) happiness from the crowd. It had that ability to pull out something you don't normally see in the audiences of children's movies  tears. WALL-E pushed out a constant emotional response throughout the film, and left the viewer with something to think about.<br/><br/>Also, the characters had life. They were not simply machines, but they had energy and excitement to them. The protagonists, WALL-E and Eve, convinced the viewer that they were real, that they were human; even more human than the ones represented in the film.<br/><br/>And it never felt like a kid movie to me. I was never a fan of modern animated movies, as they had little meaning  simply fun adventures for children to marvel over. I was a little reluctant to watch the movie, but WALL-E was able to keep me interested at all times. WALL-E managed to prove that it was a hell of a lot better than just some ordinary children's movie.<br/><br/>Pixar's WALL-E had the entire audience engaged. It didn't just dazzle the crowd with fancy effects. It didn't just throw in cute little scenes that forced every little pubescent girl to squeal. It didn't just toss over to the audience a predictable, yet unrealistic, childish plot. WALL-E was truly able to grab the viewer's attention through the talented use of conveying emotions. It was able to play out a plot that gave the viewer something to think about. It was able to convey a message  something that most children's films aren't able (or interested to) do.<br/><br/>In fear of giving any indication to plot, I will conclude my review here.<br/><br/>Truly, WALL-E surprised and impressed me. I was expecting to walk into some boring movie with outlandish characters, a mundane plot, overly glittery visuals, and no theme or idea to give out. WALL-E proved to be much more. It proved to the audience that it could take that step further in animation and children's movies. WALL-E proved to be one of the best animated movies this world has seen in a long time.<br/><br/>Overall, I rate this film a 9.5 out of 10."

So,that makes that person a not only a critic but a judge of human nature as well? Speak for yourselves. <br/><br/>I'm 42 and I found this movie not only a feast for the eyes but an animated example of emotional and compelling storytelling. Maybe some of you are so used to computer generated animation,you tend to take it for granted or as ""been there-done that"" and the overall effort escapes you.<br/><br/>I'm also very familiar with the film tactic of ""long stretches of silence"" to enhance dramatic effect. Nearly the 1st ten minutes of ""The Good,The Bad & The Ugly"" is void of any dialog. <br/><br/>It did enhance the drama here and I liked that there wasn't a lot of dialog. The actions of WALL-E & EVE said it better than any lines written.<br/><br/>I found it to be a pretty hefty storyline for young viewers to see a lone robot,in a devastated world,not only finding & feeling love but how that love helps in the salvation of the planet by his accidental flight to the space station where the human population now resides.<br/><br/>It was pointed out,in another review that it was all too ""heavy-handed"" and overbearing. Gee,It must be me but I don't believe that the subject matter should be the stuff of comedy & animated slapstick like ""The Emporers New Groove"".<br/><br/>The earth we see Wall-E in,can very much be our future if things don't change in our current society. Not just the ecological disaster area the world became but also,should any survive and we actually go into space,generations later will never know about the kind of world we once lived in. <br/><br/>The people being all overweight and lazy,is a metaphor for how little we seem to care right now about not only our planet but our own lives. That's why the ending is very important also,it may sound like something on a T-Shirt,but it really is up to all of us,to avoid laying the earth to waste. I liked the simpler animation at the end,showing the earth being renewed while Peter Gabriel sings his great song ""Down To Earth"".<br/><br/>Lastly,another person stated that this film should be as forgotten as ""Hello Dolly"" (which is used in the film.) ""Hello,Dolly"" is an Oscar winning classic in musicals,just like the Oscar winning ""Wall-E"" will certainly be a classic in animated films. <br/><br/>Ten Stars : E-asily! (END)"

When the movie settles into somewhat of a plot it does bog down slightly (There are at least one to many scenes of robots we do not care about chasing other robots we do not care about) but in reality it is simply a different magic.<br/><br/>Emotionally satisfying and wonderfully subversive Wall-E is necessary viewing for adults. I am not sure if it necessarily a good film for young people with poor attention spans, but thoughtful kids will get much out of it.<br/><br/>Moreover, kudos to Pixar for making one of the most individualistic anti-commercial films I have ever seen."
"badajoz-1","7","3","6","1 October 2009"," A refreshing surprise
","A refreshing surprise - a film that takes its own path and does not rely too heavily on cliché, references and violence. The start with little dialogue is brave, the animation good, and the story gathers you in. Some cute gags about the last robot left on Earth just carrying on doing his job, until alien probes begin to look around! A touch too sentimental in parts like old time Disney, but the plot whisks along. An excellent touch is that the humans, who finally get a look in some time in, all look alike and are obese, while the robots are generally very distinguishable. The plot is the same as 'Logan's Run' and the thriller denouement is '2001' but it still does not disappoint as familiarity creeps in over the last 15 minutes. good, no very good."
"mrusty5","10","3","6","1 September 2009"," An Incredible Emotional Film
","What can be said about Wall-E? It is a masterpiece. One of Pixar's best films, only beaten by Toy Story and Finding Nemo, and perhaps Monsters Inc. Wall-E doesn't have much talk in it until the second half, but it is very emotional from beginning to end and shows various ways to display emotion and tell a story without having to speak all the way through.<br/><br/>The film features Wall-E, a lonely trash-removing robot and the only thing alive on Earth aside from his pal cockroach, as all of humanity having left to travel the stars - we covered the planet in trash and left, just like that! Anyway, Wall-E has his own weird little world and longs for some company or something along those lines. He gets his wish when EVE, a shiny streamlined robot who is in search of plant life on Earth. She is basically an Apple iPod, Wall-E is a rusty Mac III, so its old meets new. The two share a charming bond which grows throughout the film. EVE eventually finds a plant which ironically Wall-E has and she sort of shuts down until a spaceship picks her up, Wall-E hitching along for the ride.<br/><br/>There's a wonderful scene here where Wall-E floats through space on EVE's ship, it's quite magical and spectacular. The two eventually arrive in the second half of the film on a large space cruiser which comically looks like an actually cruise ship attached to rockets. The film's primary plot kicks in at this point but the relationship between Wall-E and EVE remains a plot point throughout the remainder of the film and the ending is beautiful in its own right.<br/><br/>Great stuff."

","Wall E is one of the best of Pixar's works. Not only that, it's one of the best animations to date. I personally don't like it as much as Ratatouille, but that's just me. Wall E is cute, romantic, and beautiful. It's also sweet. Pixar animation beats Dreamworks in every way imaginable. Most Dreamworks films are good. in 2008, we had the overrated Kung Fu Panda and Wall E.<br/><br/>Wall E takes place in the future. Wall E is the last living thing on earth. Ben Burtt does the voice of Wall E, a lonely robot who needs company. Then another robot arrives on Earth. Wall E falls in love with a robot named Eve. Who at first tries to kill him. Wall E and Eve become inseparable. Wall E is finally happy. When Wall E gives EVE a plant, Eve goes into lockdown mode and doesn't speak or move her arms. Then one day, a spaceship comes and picks her up. Wall E jumps on the ship to save his love. The space ship travels to another large space ship. People live inside the space ship. The people there are fat and absolutely lazy. The thing about them is that they are kind of cute. The weird thing at least. <br/><br/>I'm not going to say anything else about the film or it's plot.Pixar has won yet again. I hope Up will be as good as Ratatouille, Wall E, and Finding Nemo. The relationship between Wall E and EVE is cute. The movie is just plain cute. If you didn't see this, then I advise that you do. I guarantee parents didn't want to watch this. I didn't want to watch this. But I bet the ones who did were pleasantly surprised. I didn't think I was going to like it, but I actually loved it."

","WALL-E as most people have said is an excellent film. It is a work of art, plain and simple. For a mainstream film, a Disney film at that it is unbelievably original. I am a huge fan of many Disney and Pixar films for the sheer good feeling that you get from watching them, but WALL-E is the first to evoke a full range of feelings (Toy Story 1 & 2 are a close 2nd). When watching this movie you'll laugh, cry, think about the world and how it works and so forth. This is one of the recent animated films that actually got me choked up...a lot. For an animated film to not have any speaking for about the first 30 minutes and still captivate the whole world (toddlers to adults) is an amazing thing. This film is an absolute must for any fan of Disney, Pixar or just film in general. Do yourself a favor and go buy or rent this movie immediately you will not regret it, and if you have the means check it out on blu-ray...stunning. No one should miss out on this fantastic movie."

"MaxBorg89","10","3","6","31 December 2008"," Another stunning work of art from Pixar
","That Pixar manages to stay at the top in the animation field no matter what is a well known fact. That it improves on its own standards with each new movie is also common knowledge, as well as a bit of a miracle. Still, after a creativity peak like the magnificent Ratatouille, their best movie to this day, what could they possibly do to top that? They came up with their boldest picture ever, a philosophical ""kids' movie"" that doesn't quite beat Ratatouille, but still stands out as the grand animated achievement of 2008.<br/><br/>With WALL-E, the Pixar guys have made their first science-fiction: the setting is Earth, several centuries from now. The planet has been deemed impossible to live on, and so all of mankind is on an intergalactic cruise where everyone, including the ship's captain (Jeff Garlin) gets to relax all day long. Yeah, okay, but what about good old Earth? Well, an emergency plan was set in motion, with thousands of robots left to clean up our mess. Too bad that after all these years none of those machines actually work anymore. Only one keeps operating: Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-class, aka WALL-E (""voice"" provided by renowned sound designer Ben Burtt), a cute little thing that keeps piling up garbage and organizing it in neat little cubes.<br/><br/>WALL-E isn't just good at his job, he's also incredibly curious, which is why he occasionally keeps ""weird"" objects he finds while on duty (bras, batteries, etc) and stores them in his home, where he spends his days watching Hello, Dolly! and pining after some company. It isn't hard to imagine, then, how happy he gets when another robot, Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator, or EVE (Elissa Knight), lands on the planet. Though initially unresponsive to WALL-E's attentions (she is there on a mission, after all), EVE eventually bonds with the little robot (frankly, what else can you do?) and takes him with her on a journey unlike anything else he's ever experienced.<br/><br/>Why is this Pixar's boldest movie? Well, for starters, the first real line of dialogue isn't spoken until 40 minutes into the film, a fact most children might not be fully prepared to embrace. Fortunately, writer/director Andrew Stanton, who gave us the wonderful Finding Nemo, knows exactly how to win everyone over: for one thing, he's got the best Pixar character ever as the lead; for another, those first 40 minutes, which rely more on sound and sight than actual plot, are easily the most beautiful thing ever done in an American animated feature. Such is the breathtaking seductiveness of the future imagined by Stanton and his creative partners.<br/><br/>Then there's the blatant ecological subtext: it couldn't have a greener message if Al Gore showed up for a cameo (he already did that in Futurama). That too could be too much for a younger viewer, so how do the filmmakers get around it? Why, the Pixar way, of course: smart writing, great humor, heartfelt romance (bit of a paradox, given we're talking about two robots, but who cares?), clever in-jokes (Sigourney Weaver voicing a computer) and the indispensable John Ratzenberger on vocal duties (this time, he plays a character named... John), all together for a ride few people will be able to forget.<br/><br/>WALL-E is part of that rare breed of movie that's unlike anything that's come before it, yet strangely familiar. It's intelligent but not preachy, brave but not extremely so, moving but not schmaltzy. Translation: a must-see sample of cinematic magic, 100% Pixar."
"sashank_kini-1","9","3","6","24 December 2008"," Wall - 'A+'
","Generally, expecting something bad from a Pixar film is close to impossible due to the fact that Pixar always has remained wonderful in its animation and Disney has backed it with a moving story. Wall-e too comes in this category at it succeeds in breaking the boundaries by enchanting us with the few amount of dialogues and more of a silent movie, which is supposed to be the condition of the cutest robot ever, Wall-e-'silent and painfully lonely'.<br/><br/>This movie has unfathomable amount of detail and its animation is path breaking. I did not expect even such good animation from Pixar. Its even better that all their previous ventures and much better than animation of other studios.<br/><br/>The movie's best bits are the moments on the earth which are magical.Its probably one of the best parts ever. Even after they leave the space, the movie doesn't drop its pace. Its funny, witty and loads of fun.<br/><br/>I just wished that they remained for a longer time of Earth and they could have cut some of the space part instead. I also missed the cockroach who was so delightful that even though I find cockroaches very annoying, this one managed to capture my heart. <br/><br/>The characters are just too good. Wall-e is so lonely and in need for company that his character manages to grab one's heart instantly. Eve too is really fine. The fat commander was really likable too. I also found the sweeper robot really funny.<br/><br/>Overall, a great film. It surely should win Best Animated Feature of the Year. Kung Fu Panda is much lower on my ratings compared to this. 9 out of 10."
"Bumdark","9","3","6","23 December 2008"," A magnificent piece of technical wizardry and storytelling prowess
","The film is usually preceded by a customary Pixar short; this one is 'Presto', and it revolves around a slight disagreement between a magician and his rabbit. It's excellent slapstick humor, and it certainly gets you into the right mood to appreciate 'WALL·E' all the more.<br/><br/>The film starts off with breathtaking views of Space: nebulas, endless starry voids, galaxies, etc., all to the tune of the classic (and surprisingly fitting) 'Put On Your Sunday Clothes', from the 1967 musical 'Hello, Dolly!'. However, the visual beauty is short-lived, as soon we descend through a thick hazy cloud cover and arrive at Earth's surface, circa 2815 AD. The land is nothing more than an endless, barren landfill, with literal mountains of garbage everywhere in sight. The city we arrive in has half its skyscrapers actually made of garbage. The only signs of life in this deserted, strikingly forbidding landscape is a little roving trash compactor named WALL·E (synthetic voice by Ben Burtt), and his one companion, an oddly cute little cockroach.<br/><br/>Wall-E is not your typical robot. He's been on this deserted planet doing the same thing for God-knows-how-long, and over time, he's developed a personality: he's very curious and inquisitive, has a sweet and gentle disposition  and is also quite a bit lonely. He lives in an old utility transport truck, which he's filled with random knickknacks of the past Human society (including sporks, a Rubik's cube and bobble-head figurines). Every night before shutting down, he would constantly watch 'Hello, Dolly!' on an old jury-rigged iPod (magnified with a large screen), from which he learned about such things as love, and holding hands (which become patterns throughout the movie).<br/><br/>Eventually, this dull monotony is shattered when a mysterious spacecraft suddenly arrives on Earth, and as it leaves, it leaves behind a sleek white probe-bot: EVE (voiced by Elissa Knight). Wall-E is instantly smitten with Eve, yet she hardly even notices him  except when she nearly blasts him to smithereens now and then. She endlessly scans the land for any signs of plant life, yet when she fails at this, she finally takes an interest in Wall-E.<br/><br/>However, she does soon find a plant (which was previously found by Wall-E himself, and serves as the movie's MacGuffin), yet instantly deactivates, leaving a confused and lonely Wall-E to try and take care of her inactive body. Yet, just when Wall-E believes she has gone away for good, the mysterious spacecraft returns and retrieves her. However, having had his first taste of company in about seven centuries, Wall-E isn't about to let her go that easy.<br/><br/>Already at this point, this story is unfolding and revealing itself as being Pixar's most daring and imaginative tale yet. Not only about the whole 'robots in love' bit, which in itself is quite unique and engaging, but also in the methods used to tell the story. There is very little dialogue through-out the movie, with some sparse lines here and there; the bulk of the movie is conveyed via Chaplin-esquire visual storytelling. This was a critical move on Pixar's part, one that would certainly have spelled certain disaster for so many other companies, yet the masters at Pixar have once again shown that nothing is impossible with the right techniques, skills and talents. The movie doesn't spell it all out for you, and requires a minimum of thought to be understood, yet this never feels imposed or restricting.<br/><br/>The technical side to this film is simply flawless. The animation is, in my honest opinion, the single best piece of CGI work in history. The graphics are so photorealistic, so incredibly detailed, so  lifelike, that it's the most engaging visual feast ever created on a computer. The score, from Thomas Newman ('Shawshank Redemption', 'Finding Nemo'), is an eclectic mix of digital sounds and effects with a traditional orchestra, and the result is rich and intriguing. All sound effects are credited to sound wizard Ben Burtt (who also brought us the sounds in the 'Star Wars' films), and he does a fantastic job in bringing sound and feel to Wall-E and his world.<br/><br/>The main focus in 'WALL·E' is the blossoming love story between Wall-E and Eve. Directed and mostly written by Andrew Stanton (who also brought us 'Finding Nemo'), it's one of the purest and most touching romances we've seen in a long time; it takes its time to develop, we don't have the characters immediately falling into each other's arms like some robotic version of 'Romeo & Juliet'. The characters are relatable and affable, something that can hardly be said for the vast majority of movie characters out there. There are some truly beautiful scenes, such as a Space-dance between Wall-E and Eve, that haven't been matched in the many movies I've seen before or since in its simple visual and emotional beauty.<br/><br/>I completely and utterly lost myself in the experience of 'WALL·E', something that has never happened before or since, and any movie capable of holding my complete and undivided attention for its entire duration has definitely done something right. This film will undoubtedly become a classic in the years to come, and shall make an amazing addition to any real moviegoer's collection.<br/><br/>* * * * * For lighting the screens with its magic and pure beauty, and for moving me in ways I deemed were impossible previously, I award 'WALL·E' with 10 delicate little saplings out of 10."
"vip_ebriega","10","3","6","16 December 2008"," Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton will absolutely love WALL-E.
","My Take: One of the very best films of the year. An instant classic. <br/><br/>The late TV film critic Gene Siskel once said that you can say a lot about a certain character through looking at their eyes. Well, Mr. Siskel would have loved WALL-E, Pixar's latest creation whose head is all binocular-like eyes. Yet they elicit enough emotions to make him almost human. When he's either happy, sad, serious or whatever else, this cute little robot just moves his eyes a bit and leaves the cinematic magic to his creators to give him more emotions than the Tin Man. But enough solely talking about this films lead character, almost everything about WALL-E sums up one of the best films of the year (if only I had seen it on theaters earlier to complete the experience!).<br/><br/>WALL-E didn't just charm me, it moved me in mysterious ways. It's beautifully done, crisply animated, yet it's also charming, topical, breezy and breathtakingly soaring. The storyline is beyond anything I've seen in years (try R2-D2 in a holiday-off from STAR WARS to give you an idea about what WALL-E is about). But beyond that, there's something else really special about WALL-E. Because, sometime throughout the film, I started to see myself in the character. Few films are capable of making you see yourself in the character, and just for the films first hour, WALL-E is already movie magic.<br/><br/>The first hour of the film is definitely the best, which looks and feels like a silent comedy, introducing us to the film's adorable little robot of the title. ""Waste Allocation Load Lifter-Earth-class"" aka Wall-E (voiced with various beeps and hums courtesy of Ben Burtt), the earth's last-functional stuck to his duties to clean up the world's waste while everyone on earth has already evacuated. But after years (better add a few more zeros to a million years) of cleaning up, Wall-E has developed a certain something: curiosity and personality. With no one on earth to keep him company, he takes pleasure in everyday objects like old cassette tapes, a Rubik's cube, a light bulb and a little cockroach who keeps him company. But he's prayers are answered (if robots can pray!) when a ship drops a little probot called EVE, whom he immediately falls in love with... even with those laser weapons at hand. But when EVE is carried away back from her source, the love-struck Wall-E tags along and ends up fighting to resurrect and recolonize earth.<br/><br/>The first half, clearly the best part in this movie is a marvelous display of creativity, while the second half is filled with excitement and startling little revelations, and that moving love story between Wall-E and EVE. But the sum of both parts creates the finest animated adventure in a long time. Now sign yourself and your family up for a cruise with WALL-E and have an intergalactic adventure unlike anything in this or any galaxy!<br/><br/>Rating: ***** out of 5."

","(Warning, the spoilers are seamless within the review so it's best not to read if it spoils for you).<br/><br/>I think this is my first 10. If I ever write a review for Stranger Than Fiction, it would get a 10 as well.<br/><br/>This is saying a lot because I'm a pretty cynical person, and critique things to death even when I like them.<br/><br/>That said, those people at Pixar are not movie-makers, they're artists.<br/><br/>This movie opens up with a complete 30 minutes of what a critic might describe as boring. It's slow, but it's so imaginative and it sets the basis for Wall-E's character almost perfectly. Not only that, it makes you really think. It explains what's going on WITHOUT dialog, to a certain extent. Such as the play-over advertisements kind of add to the silence, but they could have gotten away with it, like they did with the Billboards and the Wall-E units.<br/><br/>It also shows an older movie clip that I'm too young to identify, and shows that Wall-E is more human than some humans, even. His infatuation is further evolved when Eve gets dropped on the planet, who shows a bit of human nature (her)self while she takes a freedom joyride when she's out of visuals with the ship that dropped her off. Almost immediately you can tell the emotions of these robots. You can tell Wall-E is enthralled, and you can tell Eve is a bit mournful of her position as a directive-driven peon. It's brilliant. It's seamless.<br/><br/>I read one review before I watched the movie that the movie falters a little once they actually added the humans and the actual dialog. Let me tell you, it really doesn't. It simply adds more characters of a non-robotic nature and they develop them as well! It's been a bit long so I cannot recall the names of the man and woman that the movie emphasizes on but it evolves the storyline when you discover that these humans don't even know what they're doing anymore. They didn't know they had a pool, they were barely alive and became more robotic than the actual robots.<br/><br/>It's an amazing contract to what we know as humans and robots today.<br/><br/>And the romance was done beautifully. You would think that love between robots is an odd concept, but it's actually evolved more than the standard ""Love at first sight, few hours later, it's mutual."" No, the romance takes the entire movie for it to actually manifest and you find yourself thinking ""Does Eve like him back!?"" And I was really hit in my heart and mind near the end when Wall-E lost his memory and Eve tried coaxing him back. (If I had any complaints, it's the way his memory returned. If a memory unit is replaced, it really -is- replaced. But this is a child's movie and the rest of it was phenomenal so I couldn't slam it for that).<br/><br/>I could go on how the movie perfectly blends dreary emotions with happy ones but I might be going over my word limit here. There's just so much I could comment on.<br/><br/>This is without a doubt on my top movies list, a must own, and must watch. And that list isn't that big. Definitely an honor, no-- it was an honor to have seen this film.<br/><br/>Thank you."

","It took me a while to actually watch Wall-E. People told me it was boring, there wasn't much dialogue, etc., etc.<br/><br/>So when I caught it at the tail end of its showing here in Manila a few months ago, I came in with the lowest of expectations, perhaps expecting at least the quality of animation I'm so used to seeing from Pixar as its only redeeming value.<br/><br/>Turned out, I was wrong. Who would've thought that with little dialogue in the first third of the movie that this would actually turn out to be a richly done animated picture? While it didn't have many laughs like Kung Fu Panda or even Bolt, this picture shows that love and hope can come from anywhere at anytime. Of course, it's balanced, well-paced and it has its share of laughs.<br/><br/>Wall-E the protagonist (he reminds me of that Short Circuit robot from the 80's movies with Steve Guttenburg) is a unique robot. He has feelings, he's sentimental, and he's a collector of old memorabilia and interesting stuff. Plus he still does his business taking out the trash and even using the junk to make replicas of buildings. Cool.<br/><br/>Visually stunning from beginning to end, Wall-E is a masterpiece of animation and directing. In fact, the movie has a rich detail in the portraying of Earth in the distant future as well as providing an imaginative perspective of how Earthlings could have evolved given a certain path taken. That was very interesting as well.<br/><br/>Mostly, the movie portrays a message of hope. It may seem preachy, bringing to mind a similar animated flick in Happy Feet, but it's portrayed in such a way that it's acceptable to hear and you say to yourself, ""yeah... that's right."" It's got a level that can appeal to adults as well, and it's different than many of the things we see and consider as ""entertainment."" There are countless awesome (animated) movies that I've seen through the years, but Wall-E is so different that it's got to be included in my personal collection of worth-collecting DVD's. Truly an extraordinar-E movie made by Pixar. You've got to see it!"
"Tim851","9","3","6","7 December 2008"," Loved it!
","I didn't care much for The Incredibles, Cars or Ratatouille but Wall-E is just precious.<br/><br/>The first half hour or so is near perfect. There is no plot line, there is nothing really happening, it's just Wall-E. And it's just too cute. This movie is connecting emotionally. Some people complain about that and the lack of, let's call it, ""solid stuff"" but hey, this is an animation film, if you expected ""The Deer Hunter"" with robots you are probably just stupid.<br/><br/>Unfortunately (for me) Pixar too felt they needed to squeeze in a real story somewhere and they did. It's not really bad (although a bit too contemporary) and it's rather well executed but it totally contrasts the first half hour and I feel it would've done much better without it.<br/><br/>But nonetheless, it's still a 9/10. It's safe to say that people who thought ""Boo"" was the best thing about Monters Inc. will love Wall-E, everybody who thought that movie had a great and enticing plot probably won't."
"Simon_Says_Movies","10","3","6","28 November 2008"," A tragic, heartwarming animated sci-fi fable. Genius.
","There seems to be little possible direction to take when creating an animated film. Of course the setting can be changed along the situations and characters, but I am hinting more towards the target audience. Firstly, there is the option to skew the demographic strongly towards the fledgling crowd with films like Curious George and The Wild. Close behind are those films targeted at a younger, but not greatly adolescent audience, which are embodied in films like Madagascar and Horton Hears a Who! The detrimental aspect of films like these, are that they are for the most part strictly kid-fare, and may put off the unwilling parents, especially after DVD combusts after overuse. Next there is the more risky segment of animated films, in which the creators strive to link the generational gorge and give pleasure on a surplus level. Films like Shrek, The Incredibles and Finding Nemo have been successful at this, but a greater number like Happy Feat, Igor, Barnyard, Monster House and Open Season have been less so. Finally, there lies the risk at the other end of the spectrum, in creating films that may be too mature for less seasoned patrons to understand or keep interested in, such as Ratatouille and The Iron Giant.<br/><br/>Then along comes a film like WALL∙E. A film that is so breathtaking and above any level of animation ever before conceived, that will likely thrill older audience members as much as any other movie they view this year, so insightful and profound and complex in it's entirety and absorbing in its tenderness and emotional resonance that everything is whole again. And the best part, your child who may have been bewildered by the mature themes at play, will grow to love, if at least not appreciate, WALL∙E more with each passing year.<br/><br/>It would be a lie to claim that WALL∙E is my favourite animated film, or even my favourite conceived through the use of computers, but that is in no way a degrading comment as it is the best animated film in almost five years and still one of the best of all time. If there was ever a year at the Academy Awards to repeat the best picture nomination of The Beauty and the Beast, this would certainly be the one. The cumulative wonder of this feature lies throughout multiple veins of its construction. Setting new lofty standards for animated features to come, the quality of the design achieves a detail and vividness that will astound and consume anyone who gazes upon it. The effects of the terrain, to the details of the robot stars is so impeccable, one is hard pressed to clearly decipher it as animation and not as reality. Yet this is only the icing on the cake, with the foundation spawned from the genius of the story telling itself, without which would demote WALL∙E to eye candy and nothing more. The opening forty-or-so minutes is sans dialog and the ability to keep the level of intrigue at such an engrossing level is a true testament to all those involved, especially veteran Pixar director Andrew Stanton.<br/><br/>Meet WALL∙E. Or for those who dislike acronyms, a solitary Waste Allocation Load Lifter, Earth Class, who spends his days compacting, and neatly stacking towering peaks of garbage on the now barren wasteland that was once Earth. Driven to spend their remaining days on a series of space shuttles by the waste spawned by overconsumption and the greed of a conglomerate, aptly named Buy N Large, mankind has all but forgotten Earth. Not the same can be said for WALL∙E, who was inexplicably skipped after a widespread deactivation of his robot compadres, who, aside from his monotonous task, a loving fascination with the forgotten treasures (or garbage to us) of Earth past, has no greater purpose in life. That is until EVE (Extraterrestial Vegetation Evaluator); a deadly ivory robot sent to search for any signs of life on Earth arrives, and immediately steals the admiration of the little droid. The latter portions of WALL∙E are in the truest sense, a love story, and are comprised of our hero searching for his love after EVE returns to her extraterrestrial home. All acts of this film mesh flawlessly and build upon each other into a sometimes tragic, yet ultimately heart-warming sci-fi fable.<br/><br/>While not in the typical sense, WALL∙E is the perfect family film, with its endearing characters and monumental art direction, it may not win over all ages simultaneously but will capture the hearts and imagination of those who let it."
"fwomp","6","3","6","18 November 2008"," Doesn't Come Close To Other Pixar Flicks...
","It is my understanding that director Andrew Stanton (along with screenwriter Pete Docter) had a couple of ideas that came to fruition prior to WALL-E. Things you may have heard of like, oh, FINDING NEMO and A BUG'S LIFE. Wall-E was the final ""idea"" in the animation pipeline for Disney/Pixar and it is obvious to me why this was so after watching it. Let me explain...<br/><br/>Let's start with the aforementioned Finding Nemo. Here was a story that was 95% focused on the main characters: fish and those around the fish (crabs, seagulls, pelicans, etc.). The dentist  a human  was a side-story; a vehicle for the plot, sure, but he wasn't what the film was about. The audience became enamored with Marlin (Nemo's father) and his adventures to find and save his son. Again, a great character scheme that got the audience attached to the title character and his father (and we can't forget Dori, the forgetful sidekick).<br/><br/>Moving ahead several years we get to Wall-E, a story that isn't so well-formulated as far as characters go but has a decent message at its core: the survival of our planet.<br/><br/>If the story had stuck to Wall-E's adventures and his need to connect with someone (anyone!), the story would've turned out just fine. True, the decent message may have gotten lost but film makers need audiences to feel empathetic toward the characters, and that's where Wall-E short circuits. The humans don't come into play until 20-plus minutes into this 98-minute feature and then we're completely given over to them and lose sight of Wall-E altogether ...for a while. This extreme detachment from the title character made the film feel more like two separate ones than a consistent whole.<br/><br/>There are, however, some profoundly funny moments ...and some just plain profound things, too. Fred Willard (DATE MOVIE) is the first human we see (but only through billboard displays) as the loathsome Shelby Forthright, CEO of the BnL corporation. His last name is a cautionary note to not trust someone just because of their name. John Ratzenberger (RATATOUILLE) is John, an Earthly human in an un-Earthly ship where his every whim is cared for by automatons, turning him and his spaceshipmates into worthless sloths (another cautionary note to not let computers or technology run rampant over us). The spaceship's computer voice is probably one of the funniest of note, because it's narrated by Sigourney Weaver (THE ICE STORM). Anyone who's seen the ALIEN series and GALAXY QUEST knows how Sigourney's previous characters feel about computers.<br/><br/>Better known for his sound work in the more recent INDIANA JONES 4 flick, Ben Burtt lends his electrified voice as the main character, Wall-E. Although not much speaking takes place from Wall-E's standpoint, he does have some human moments of loneliness and tenderness (once another mechanical being arrives). EVE, Wall-E's love interest, is also electrifyingly voiced by voice actress Elissa Knight (she was Tia in the other Pixar hit, CARS). Her arrival on Earth heralds new hope for Wall-E that his life of loneliness might come to an end.<br/><br/>Despite all its character and whiplash faults, Wall-E is a movie of environmental importance. It shows us what we as humans might do to the only planet we can call home, and what might happen if we allow ourselves to go too far in damaging her. That, at the very least, makes this a watchable film."

","It's several hundred years into the future and grubby little Wall.E is the last remaining robot on Earth, programmed to collect garbage around the world. By now the Earth has become such an unliveable mass of scum and debris that the humans had vacated the planet long ago, shirking responsibility for the mess they made to live it large in space.<br/><br/>Wall.E's only company is a little cockroach that follows him about, until one day a spaceship lands in his vicinity, bringing with it Eve, a high-tech, no-nonsense pod robot that has been programmed to search for traces of life on Earth. Wall.E spies on Eve, and he is in turns bewildered and bewitched by her, but the principle emotion he feels toward her is love. So much love, in fact, that when the spaceship comes back to take Eve back, he follows his Goddess onto the 'ship and it takes them to where all the humans have relocated; floated around in Space and with no intention of going home.<br/><br/>Any initial doubts I had about whether Pixar could pull off a futuristic robot movie were immediately quashed when we were introduced to the enigmatic robot himself. Wall.E's existence is a mundane one; forcing rubbish into cube after cube, which he piles together to make towers of rubbish, but he finds pleasures in the household items he encounters  a spoon, a light, a bra. Back in his ""home""  an upturned schoolbus he resides in, he gathers together all the items he collects, and falls asleep Hello, Dolly!, from which he becomes particularly fascinated with the act of holding hands, and wishes he has someone to do it with.<br/><br/>The romance between Wall.E and Eve is believable (yes, believable!) and poignant; I had tears in my eyes when he was tending to her and holding an umbrella to shield her from the rain, even though it resulted in himself getting electrocuted. Though the film is about robots (humans don't feature until the second half, and even then they are just fat rolls operating electrical chairs, a sad reminder of where our society is headed) and the only words exchanged by the two leads are each others' names, this is one of the must ""humane"" movies I have ever seen, with a lot of soul.<br/><br/>Beauty dominates practically every frame. The initial scenes of Wall.E captured the desolate, crumbling state of Earth, but Pixar has found loveliness in the most unexpected of places. This is Pixar's most ambitious movie to date, and the landscapes and details are appropriately cinematic (the planet is captured with such meticulous pans and fade-outs that it feels almost Shawshank Redemptionly, no real surprise when we consider that Roger Deakins worked as a visual consultant on the movie). Another filmmaker who helped make The Shawshank Redemption the masterpiece that it was, Thomas Newman, also contributed to Wall.E, and his score, whilst not matching his personal best of the other Pixar movie he wrote for, Finding Nemo, still ranks as one of his best, particularly in his usage of the harp, which lends an otherworldly feel to the film throughout.<br/><br/>(Ahem. Sorry for all the references to The Shawshank Redemption here.) My only qualm with Wall.E is that there isn't enough humour in the movie. In a way, this is Pixar's darkest movie to date; with its messages about society's need to wake up to the problem of global pollution, commercialism, mass obesity and whatnot. The cheeky filmmakers even managed to slip in their own message to Disney; when the president in the old clip says ""stay in the course."" But all this means that, whilst there's the odd visual gag or two, Wall.E is not really all that funny, with no definite belly laughs. With last year's Ratatouille also failing to tickle my funny bones, I worry that Pixar are becoming darker and darker these days, and leaving the comedic roots that served them so well in the past.<br/><br/>However, despite the fact that I cried more than I laughed, Wall.E still gets a resouding thumbs up from me. The animation is flawless, the entertainment is countless and for once, I became interested in sci-fi. And the denouement shows that it's not too late; redemption is still available and we can still save the world if we really want to."
"tnrcooper","10","3","6","2 August 2008"," Pixar at its best
","This is a great, great movie. This should be a lesson to the studios and their pre-packaged bilge that verbose and/or run-of-the-mill films should not be made. Put more resources into doing something well, like ""Wall-E"" and you will be rewarded.....to paraphrase from ""Field of Dreams"" - ""if you make it, they will come."" Be willing to take a chance and you might well come up with a gem of a film like this. <br/><br/>This is the story of computer Wall-E, set many years in the future, perhaps the last functioning being in the United States after Earthlings have been forced to take refuge in a spaceship run by mega-company Big 'n' Large (think Wal-mart). It would appear that at the time that the ship left Earth, apparently having extracted all value from anything in New York, Big 'n' Large (BNL) was running (at least) New York City. As the film progresses we see messages filmed by the BNL CEO (played wistfully by Fred Willard) around the time New York City became uninhabitable, informing the residents of New York that the BNL ship would be taking off and that it was the best way for them to survive. This provides us with the backstory as to why the residents of the BNL ship are where they are. The film takes place in the 29th century as the last residents of Earth cross the universe in this ship, their lives on-board the ship exceedingly mundane and boring. They criss-cross the massive ship in orderly lines in little pods taking them from one dull thing to another. It seems they spend a lot of time lounging in huge open plazas, choosing and consuming items that can be purchased via individualized interactive headsets. People seem de-sensitized and bored, which is not surprising given they seem to be touring space seemingly without purpose or point. All of this is beautifully rendered by the Pixar artists. The images of the people and machines roaming the ship are gorgeous and imaginative. One of the surest signs that the Pixar artists are at the top of their game is that they render huge assemblies in the finest detail, depicting thousands of little beings in the most realistic manner, with no diminution of quality in spite of the large number of beings they have to depict. These huge meetings are awe-inspiring and remind me of some of the best animation depicting massive assemblies in ""Antz"".<br/><br/>Meantime, back on Earth, Wall-E, apparently the last functioning creature in NYC, fulfills his purpose by organizing all of the discarded junk into massive piles. One of the most enjoyable elements of the film to me, was the manner in which Wall-E employed various items of our modern life in his existence. For instance, a videotape of a modern film was operated by an iPod. Also, Wall-E taped things he found interesting, using a cassette player. When his battery got low, the signal that it was re-charged was the ubiquitous Apple chime which one hears when an Apple computer is turned on. Wall-E methodically and systematically organizes piles and piles of junk, making instantly recognizable junk into large columns by which to impose some semblance of order on his environment. His life is quite dull and mundane. However, this changes one day when a robot named Eve from another ship lands on earth, seeking signs of life. Wall-E falls in love with her and when she is ordered back to her ship, he wants to return with her.<br/><br/>From this simple premise comes the whole film. There is not much a lot of dialogue in the film, particularly during the first half, and very few actors involved-among them Jeff Garlin of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" as the bored but intrigued captain of the BNL ship, Sigourney Weaver as the Hal-like robot on the BNL, and a few others. In spite of the paucity of dialogue, Wall- E's affection for Eve is communicated very clearly, their determination to communicate convincingly with the Hal-like robot is communicated with ease, and the malaise which seems to afflict the occupants of the BNL is also expressed without much verbal communication. Perhaps most impressively, we get an appreciation of how much Wall-E enjoys and is interested in finding things which we the audience recognize. He makes only perfunctory, mechanical sounds, but the talented people at Pixar, under the direction of Andrew Stanton who also helped write the scripts to ""Toy Story II"", ""Finding Nemo"", and ""Monsters Inc"", are able to convey the full range of emotions which humans-and in the 29th century, apparently robots-feel. This is a joyous, special film in which one is reminded of the reasons why life and all our opportunities should be cherished. The fact that it captures the breadth of expression and feeling which we as humans experience, as well as the pioneering, creative animation, makes it an acceptable film selection for kids and for adults."
"Mightyzebra","10","3","6","2 August 2008"," A beautiful, beautiful film, 10/10 all the way!! + it is very (X 200) cute!!
","I was sure this film would be good, but there were a few surprises...<br/><br/>1. I did not realize that the love between Wall.E and Eve would be so strong.<br/><br/>2. I did not realize how much the humans in this film have changed from the ones now.<br/><br/>3. I did not realize that there would be some sudden points in this film and some scary points in the film.<br/><br/>4. I did not realize there would be a baddie.<br/><br/>These surprises did not totally distract me from the best parts of the film, which are the very beginning and when Wall.E and Eve are in love. They are two robots, Wall.E has been on earth for 700 years, cleaning up earth which is covered in rubbish. Every day Wall.E puts the rubbish into bricks and builds towers of it. Anything that he finds interesting, he takes it back to his little ""house"". In the first fifteen minutes or so of the film, Wall.E meets a little cockroach, one of the first living creatures he has seen, then he finds a plant, which he has never seen before. He takes this into his house. <br/><br/>Later, a robot named Eve, from space, where every human now lives, comes down to earth to search for signs of life. Wall.E falls in love with her and after some misunderstanding between them, Wall.E manages to show Eve his little house, some of his things and the plant. Eve is programmed to now be taken back to space, to show this plant to the humans, so that they can return to earth. Wall.E is so lonely on earth, that he decides to come with her...<br/><br/>I love this film because of the beautiful Pixar graphics, Wall.E, Eve and the way they love each other. The environmental message shown in this film is very good and if everyone who watches this film pays attention to that message, the world could start becoming a better place. Unfortunately, I have a feeling people are not understanding this message and so, are still not taking action.<br/><br/>I recommend this film to anyone who likes Pixar graphics, who do not mind films that are a little bit slow and like Wall.E! Enjoy ""Wall.E""!! :-) :-)"
"stefanbe","10","3","6","29 July 2008"," Quite possibly one of the most beautiful love stories and most visually animated film ever.
","The average person's appreciation for animated features have grown immensely in the past seventy years since the release of Walt Disney's groundbreaking Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. However, they still retain the unfortunate tendency of being referred to as a ""children's film."" Even the most mature works from directors like Brad Bird and Hayao Miyasaki have falling into this degrading trapping. Hopefully, Andrew Stanton's follow-up to the magical Finding Nemo will dispel any idea that animation is simply made for a young audience. Wall-E is a masterpiece of epic proportion combining the talents of Andrew Stanton, the skill of Pixar's animation team and a story that feels like a collaboration between master filmmakers Charles Chaplin, Woody Allen and Stanley Kubrick. What Stanton has created with Wall-E is not simply a motion picture, it's an experience and a story that will live as long as Homer's The Odyssey, William Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet and J.M. Barrie's Peter Pan. Wall-E will transcend generations and become beloved for its love story, its cautionary tale of the future and incredibly charming and relatable characters.<br/><br/>At the start of Wall-E, The Planet Earth has been abandoned for seven hundred years as the humans await for it to be cleaned up and livable again. However, one robot is left to clean up the rubble and left-behind rubbish, a unit called Wall-E. For some many years, he has been doing the same task over and over again, accompanied only by a little cockroach. In those seven-hundred years, he has developed a personality and a curiosity for collecting various old objects. The one thing he longs for, though, is another robot to hold hands with. One day, a giant space craft lands and out of it comes a shiny new robot named Eve. Wall-E is immediately smitten with Eve and as she starts to get know him, Eve starts to grow fond of the little trash compactor. After Eve takes off again into space, Wall-E follows his dream girl-bot into space and truth about the human race is revealed.<br/><br/>That is what happens in the first thirty minutes of the film, which is completely devoid of any human dialogue whatsoever. Wall-E and Eve communicate only in speaks and whistles, created by renowned sound designer Ben Burtt, most notably known for doing the beeps on R2-D2 from Star Wars. However, while George Lucas's creation may simply be a tin can on wheels, Stanton and Burtt have created two likable personalities with Wall-E and Eve, whose love story is the main reason for the film's success. I can say, without a doubt, that Wall-E is quite possibly the most touching and beautiful love story ever told. We feel for these characters and care for them, so whenever they're in mortal danger, we're always worried whether they will survive. I will even admit I was almost teary-eyed while watching this film. That is how powerful Wall-E is as a motion picture. The film is also very funny and touching at the same time, giving off a very Chaplin-esquire quality. The whole film definitely gives off a very City Lights vibe and I would not be surprised if Stanton was heavily influenced by that masterpiece. The most beautiful scene of the film in which Wall-E and Eve ""dance"" in space together is one that will be hard to top in any lifetime by any film released after now. The score by Thomas Newman is so incredibly superb that it almost feels like a separate character in the film and adds to how powerful the whole piece is.<br/><br/>The social commentary is also effective and definitely makes you think more than any so-called ""intellectual Sundance release."" I would not be surprised if (at the rate people are going) Earth does end up looking the way it does in the film. China itself is already slowly heading in that direction. The humans in the film are made to look like large and cartoon-like, so as to resemble babies. What the film is saying is that humans are evolving backwards, rather than forwards. Everything needs to be done for us, much like a mother caring for her newborn and in this case, the robots are the mothers (as shown by the robot teacher in the baby school). There already are robotic vacuum cleaners where you just need to press the button and that is it. The Pixar animators and storytellers have not gone on auto-drive for Wall-E, but are putting themselves in control in where the story leads and thus why the film succeeds more than hypocritical schlock like Pokemon: The First Movie and Alvin and the Chipmunks posing as family entertainment these days. When the humans realise they must do something, they start to wake up from their bedtime naps and walk much like how babies take their first steps. I wouldn't say Wall-E is being manipulative or offensive as the film is putting a mirror up to the people, so that they understand that they do need to change their habits quickly. This film is teaching people a lesson and giving people something that your average toy advertisement will not.<br/><br/>The Pixar team has pulled out all the stops and in effect have created their greatest achievement yet. Stanton succeeds because he puts story and characters before all else, while still providing some breathtaking animation and terrific entertainment in the process. And it is films like Wall-E that prove even more that animation is capable of anything: any genre, any emotion, any laugh."
"AdderCowley","10","3","6","20 July 2008"," Amazingly endearing and entertaining
","Wall-E is a film which will surpass the highest expectations, entertain the most critical of critics and most importantly stir the stoniest of hearts with its subtle emotion and superb animation. It is a film which is a benchmark for all animated films and kids films for years to come...<br/><br/>Wall-E contains possibly one of the most endearing characters in cinema history, ironically a small waste-disposal robot left on earth for 700 years. What this immediately brings is sympathy to a character which would not usually endear audiences. However the subtle use of animation in the eyes and movements of Wall-E an incredibly lovable character. His appreciation of nature only further highlights this.<br/><br/>Indeed the impact of Wall-E is so profound that the film needs little dialogue to win the hearts of the audience. In the first 30 minutes, in a similar vein to other animation benchmarks such as Wallace and Gromit, there is little dialogue whatsoever between any of the characters. This again highlights the mastery of pixar which is able to create a character not from words but from actions. This of course leads to the importance of the animation.<br/><br/>Wall-E is one of the most visually spectacular animated films presently. With the dusty, rust covered Wall-E, the beautiful sequence of Wall-E in space skimming his hand in the ice rings of a planet and the clinical appearance of the axion human ship, Wall-E is a sensational film, and one could be tricked into thinking that the animation is the centre piece of the film, similar to Finding Nemo.<br/><br/>However the focus is not on the animation, Pixar have already proved they can pull off realism but what the film is all about is a love relationship between two completely different characters. WALL-E, a sentimental outdated rubbish collector, and EVE a futuristic vegetation scanner. This awkward relationship is especially interesting because put simply both characters are robots and supposedly emotionless. However Pixar pulls off an emotional story line with Wall-E winning over the heart of his love interest, EVE, as well as inspiring the human race to return to Earth. Is there a more poignant and successful technique to show the power of compassion in cinema today? Indeed Wall-E is a film which ranks up with some of the best Pixar films to date. That is saying something when claiming a film is better than Toy Story or Finding Nemo. However Wall-E very much takes a different angle than these animation giants. While TS and FN were trying to prove that computer animation could be pulled off in varying degrees of complexity, one could argue that Wall-E is the first time Pixar has looked to focus on the characters of the plot rather than the animation. I believe for the first time Pixar has been able to focus on the story rather than the animation. Not to say that the animation is poor, obviously it is brilliant, but Pixar has gone for a new angle in Wall-E, and it has very much worked.<br/><br/>Thus Wall-E is about the entertainment of the audience rather than trying to impress us with animation. Indeed the animation is spectacular but if anything the character of Wall-E is more so."
"bubbben","10","3","6","20 July 2008"," Amazing
","This was absolutely amazing. The good old Disney style movie not like others like Cars. Although there is not a lot of talking in this film you never get bored. And you get emotionally attached to the character as they have such funny and quirky personalities. I would recommend this to all families and even adults as i enjoyed it. The film is very funny, interesting to look at and watch and it constantly draws you in guessing what will happen next! The CGI animation is very good indeed and at some points it even looks real. The development of the character of Wall-e is brilliant because as soon as you hear his little voice you instantly fall in love with him, the love story between Eve and Wall-e is very good because all the way through we see Wall-e wanting a partner or someone to just hold his hand. Thats why i gave it a 10/10 hope this helps and go see it everyone you will not be disappointed!"
"spuffieschilde","10","3","6","19 July 2008"," Magical
","Usually if I came into a movie with high expectations, I'd leave the theatre feeling slightly disappointed. Wall-e was NOT one of those times. Actually, at first, I didn't even want to see yet another Disney/Pixar film for quite some time. And I blame this all upon watching the trailer on TV. The trailer was quite short, and in my opinion, kind of ""blah."" Suffice to say it did not capture my interest whatsoever. Thinking back on it now, I'm actually glad the trailers revealed nothing because from the moment I sat down and the film appeared on screen I was enthralled, surprised, and overall very satisfied. Finding Nemo was the latest animated feature that was able to make me feel emotions on a deep level rather than just the usual entertaining factor while watching these types of movies. And while watching Wall-e, his sense of loneliness was so powerful it made my heart ache for him. But what made me enjoy it more was the fact that the writers didn't just throw it in our faces, but the feeling was constantly there, even during the comedic moments.<br/><br/>I could gush about this film for another hour... but I won't. Simply one of the best films of 2008."

It is a shame that dialogue could not have been introduced properly between all the main characters. There is too much dependence on visual effects, insider jokes and references to fulfil the needs of multi-aged entertainment audience. A bit like going to the ballet - if only there was a little bit of drama and speech... This is not to say the film is without merit - it deserves awards for the animation and ideas alone.

Poor people, they have not noticed, how have lost last human qualities, becoming completely not independent consumers of pies and juices.

"tranquilbuddha","Null","3","6","13 July 2008"," A film filled with wonder
","I cannot say enough about how beautiful and surprising Wall-E is in both its conception as, essentially, a love story between a trash compacter and a robot, and its execution as one of the most moving, wondrous films about mankind and space since 2001: A Space Odyssey, to which it is clearly a loving homage.<br/><br/>Our almost-four-year-old son rarely sees films because we follow the Waldorf/Steiner approach to life for young children, which excludes TV and computers (which hasn't stopped him from becoming extremely proficient in the latter simply, it seems, by instinct), but in the past week he has watched Cars two or three times, because he had a summer cold, and then Wall-E in the movie theater.<br/><br/>Seeing Cars again reminded me of how warm and rich Pixar's films are: the debt they owe to the best of classic Disney animation (and the classic Disney animators who worked with them to teach them what they knew) is apparent, but more than that, the Pixar storytellers and animators use computer technology not simply as a tool, but to create a rich palette of both stunning visuals and emotional warmth and honesty.<br/><br/>Wall-E goes farther than even the beauty of Finding Nemo in taking three-dimensional animation to new spheres...quite literally when Wall-E and Eva, his robot companion, dance through space. I won't say too much about Wall-E's retro taste in movies (on videocassette, no less, which is a technology that intrigues our son because he has only ever seen a VHS tape in its case, never an actual player) because it is such a touching surprise, but the fact that the yearning between two supposedly inanimate (in the original sense) objects can move you to tears is a testament to director Andrew Stanton and his story team and animation team's mastery and originality.<br/><br/>This is a film that gently arouses your thoughts and emotions about humankind and is never clumsy in doing so. It is funny, incredibly dark and gritty for a mainstream ""family"" movie, and yet also soars to amazing heights of wonder and beauty.<br/><br/>When Wall-E, the movie and the trash compacter, take their audience through space with all the excitement and grace, but way more humor, that Stanley Kubrick did roughly forty years ago, the most appropriate word is the grossly overused but for once totally accurate: AWESOME!!!!"
"MartianOctocretr5","10","3","6","13 July 2008"," Everything an animated film should be
","Imaginative settings, lovable and memorable characters, well utilized animation, impressive visuals, clever gags (never over-done), and one of the sweetest screen romances in the history of movies: Wall-E has a lot to offer. <br/><br/>You can't help pulling for this sympathetic, lonely little guy, a rusty old robot who continues his programming of cleaning up trash in a deteriorating world mysteriously devoid of humans. His curiosity, fascination, and wonder about the odd artifacts he excavates during his job make him the most endearingly innocent and lovable droid since C-3PO and R2-D2. His lone buddy is a cockroach of all things, and even this unique friendship is depicted in a touching way that makes Wall-E's goodness shine through. <br/><br/>Rarely is an animated film this intelligent and touching. Other films of its ilk are humorous, often with cultural references, and Wall-E's adventure is too. However, the cultural references aren't just dumped in for a one-note sight gag as in other flicks: they are integral elements of building the story. For example, the jabs at cell phones, TV, credit cards, autos, computer overuse, internet shopping are hilarious, while also painting the woeful future that the movie envisions. I love the Capt. Stubing and Hal 9000 satires (they too are principals in what happens, not just walk-on gags). The character of Eve (right down to her mysterious mission) was wonderfully done. <br/><br/>Bravo on this one. A very entertaining film with a lot of heart. Brilliantly done."
"Crentapa","10","3","6","13 July 2008"," Wall-E
","I truly don't understand why people insist on bringing down movie ratings instead of voting their true opinion (fortunately, most are too... ignorant... to understand how IMDb works: unfortunately, these same... ignoramus'... don't understand the top 250 is a dynamic list).<br/><br/>Wall-E is a great movie, if you're willing to be a kid. If you want to be that hypercritical grouch that nobody likes you'll probably hate Wall-E. I read about people complaining about how unrealistic x y and z is... but if they were actually paying attention they would realize that there is NOTHING realistic about Wall-E.<br/><br/>Stop complaining about how we could never actually bury ourselves in trash... or that humanity would never become fat-lazy-slobs... or even the whole Corporate Nation that Pixar envisioned.<br/><br/>Complain about the simple things, such as why a probe would be equip with a military grade plasma weapon... or how a Twinkie is perfectly preserved for 700 years... why tilting a ship that is equip with artificial gravity would change the direction of the gravitational force. Or even WHY every robot has it's own personality, instead of acting... like a robot.<br/><br/>There seriously is nothing factual in Wall-E, so why are people rating it like there SHOULD be? It's a G Movie, EXPECT it to be aimed towards the younger generation. And since the current generation is filled with immature child beating sloths, Pixar's decision to teach the little kiddies a few moral lessons really isn't that bad. Those parents who complain about how they took their child out of the movie because they didn't agree with the message only proves the point. Why would you take your child to a movie that you knew nothing about? If you, as a parent, are unwilling to even read up on something as simple as that... then it only lends to the possibility that your methods of 'parenting' include little more than the TV.<br/><br/>Sigh, Wall-E is a great movie... it tells it's story in a completely different manner than most movies (cue haters who are use to falling asleep and still knowing what's going on) using an artistic direction rather than audio. But, none the less, is quite well planned and executed... there are just the usual grouches who insist on making everyone else miserable raising hell about nothing at all."
"rbsjrx","10","3","6","13 July 2008"," With the right mindset, this is a must see
","I came here intending to write a glowing review of the best movie I've seen this year. However, as is my custom, I first read what others had to say. Since the movie was so good, I started reading the most negative comments first to gain perspective. I shouldn't have been surprised at what I saw, but it did take me back a bit. The majority of the negative comments turned out to be a referendum on environmental politics.<br/><br/>That being the case, I suppose I should declare my views going in so others can fairly evaluate what I say in light of their own perceptions. I'm not ashamed to admit I try to live a very green life. I recycle, buy wind power, etc. I've been this way since long before environmentalism became a word or even fashionable (back then, I was simply considered a ""conservationist""). I am not, however, political. I promote environmental responsibility by actions rather than voting green (actually, I don't vote at all).<br/><br/>If everything you see is filtered through right wing glasses, then you will not like this film. I'm sure Rush Limbaugh and the staff at Fox News aren't going to be fans. Like ""The Day After Tomorrow"", it exaggerates (how much is debatable) to make its point. If, on the other hand, you're a certified tree hugger or you see the world through left wing glasses, then you'll love it. If you fall in the middle, you'll find a sweet, charming, unabashedly sentimental story wrapped around a cautionary tale.<br/><br/>When dealing with the non-human characters, ""Wall-E"" isn't a movie, it's a work of art - as good as any film ever made. It's incredible that Pixar has invested robots (and an insect) with such heart. The humans, by contrast are caricatures, but deliberately so. The only way I might recommend improving the movie would be to make the humans as realistic as the robots, but then that would rob the film of much of its humor. As you watch it, be on the lookout for references to other films. Some are obvious and some are more subtle, but they're all enjoyable.<br/><br/>If you have, or can muster up, the innocence, this is a film you shouldn't miss. I haven't seen the films for the second half of the year, but for right now, I have to wonder whether a film can be nominated for both best picture and best animated feature in the same year? From today's perspective, I believe ""Wall-E"" deserves both."

Bringing robots in all nature to act with character is a challenge and they have done it expertly. with good rendering..an excellent soundtrack you can rest assured this film is good for everyone whether your a young one or an old one. This film will make you giggle at least once.If you are an old Disney Buff loving the films of old then you will definitely loves this feature.

","As an example of the broad diversity of people this film can appeal to, the audience I watched this movie with consisted of elderly couples, rebellious ""emo"" teenagers, small children--essentially people who were different in every conceivable way, but similar in that they were all grinning broadly when the movie ended.<br/><br/>The wide range of people in the audience can be related to the broadness of the film's appeal. It has a cute robot that kids love, a simplistic love story, but also a surprisingly biting satirical element for adults. It doesn't feel like a kids' movie at all, and that's because it isn't."

","Wall·e fools with its tailer, tells a way greater story than expected: Going to watch this movie I was expecting not much more than another cute Pixar animated film like Ratatouille or Cars. Those expectations were overshot after about 15 minutes in when the story started to develop and sending a deep message; a hint to open peoples eyes to reality (I don't know how to describe/paraphrase it, since I don't want to give anything away).<br/><br/>The animation and the cgi execution is just gorgeous, I mean we all know Pixar creates worlds best computer animated films yet again they surpassed themselves by far this time.<br/><br/>My message here is: Just go watch this movie - definitely one of the best 2008 has to offer!

"on_the_can","8","3","6","6 July 2008"," Whoa
","It's pretty damn impressive when a film can keep you engrossed for 90 minutes plus with virtually no dialog in it at all.<br/><br/>In the distant future Earth is abandoned by everyone for reasons I won't spoil here. Before they leave, everything is turned off, scrapped, or taken with them...except Wall E, a robot who was accidentally left on. Wall E spends his days collecting junk, building amazing towers of cubed garbage, watching old movies, paling around with his cockroach friend(the only other living thing left on Earth) and day dreaming about one day falling in love. His dreams are answered when a girl probe robot gets dropped on Earth in search of organic life. Wall E falls head over heels and follows her home when her ship comes back for her. taking him on the adventure Pixar always promises.<br/><br/>Like I said, the two leads barely speak, the only real dialog comes later by other characters after most of the plot has already been well established. But this doesn't encumber the story at all. Wall E tells us everything we need to know with his hands and eyes. The movie's not as laugh out loud hilarious as some of Pixar's other ventures but it's very entertaining and a high accomplishment in film making. It also has a lot of amazing imagination and imagery...the guys a Pixar should be proud."
"silalus","10","3","6","3 July 2008"," The pinnacle of both animation and science fiction... with a soul.
","WALL·E stands alone atop the twin peaks of both animation as a medium and science fiction as a genre. As a fusion of art and technology it is an achievement that is almost impossible to overstate. And even forgetting that context and watching it simply as a film, WALL·E may be one of the finest movies you will ever see.<br/><br/>During my lifetime animation has come into its own as an unparalleled medium of expression. From ""Beauty and the Beast"" to ""Shrek"", ""Lilo and Stitch"" to ""Happy Feet"", and countless others less well known, animated movies have taken us to worlds that conventional films could never touch while exploring love and life with a purity that traditional characters could never match. So, with that in mind, it would be unfair to say that WALL·E puts every other animated movie that you have ever seen to shame...<br/><br/>So instead I will say this: it fulfills their promise.<br/><br/>So too during my lifetime has popular science fiction come into its own. Movies like ""Star Wars"", ""Silent Running"", ""The Matrix"", and ""Blade Runner"" have immersed us all in strange, extraordinary new worlds while teaching us about our own. They've offered us warnings and wisdom that stories too deeply grounded in the ""real world"", in the here and now, can't match.<br/><br/>And WALL·E fulfills the promise of sci-fi too, just as it does animation. It is almost as meaningful as it is beautiful.<br/><br/>When you watch WALL·E you will find yourself immersed in a story of loneliness and of perseverance. You will see, perhaps for the first time, pure childlike wonder and almost angelic, unconditional love. You'll receive a stark warning about our possible future as a species, but above all else you'll accept a deeply gratifying testimony about what it means to be human.<br/><br/>You'll experience the story through an indescribable variety of endearing robot characters- each one totally unique and perfectly sculpted by Pixar in the sweet spot just this side of the ""uncanny valley"". They are inhuman enough to do the most hilarious, wonderful, bizarre things without us questioning them, and yet human enough that you will love them all. And leading the pack, the title character himself is possibly the most sympathetic protagonist that any movie has ever presented.<br/><br/>WALL·E the character seems to display every quality that can melt our human hearts: curiosity, cleverness, selflessness, innocence, humor, loyalty, and love. And he has all those qualities bound together in an adorable physical form that is simply perfect. You will fall in love with him.<br/><br/>And that, in the end, is the thing that really makes this movie something that begs to be experienced. The visuals are incredible, the humor is wonderful, the futurist wisdom is powerful, and the themes are moving. The artfulness and daring of long stretches with no dialogue at all is utterly amazing. But ultimately the best quality of this film is how we are made to fall in love with WALL·E himself as we watch him live his life.<br/><br/>I went to WALL·E expecting to see more Pixar brilliance and a funny story about a clunky old PC falling in love with a Mac. I didn't go expecting to fall head-over-heels in love with a robot and a film that both have a soul.<br/><br/>But I did. And so will you."
"YouFightLikeACow","10","3","6","3 July 2008"," The Date Movie of the Year, Not to Mention the Best Movie
","There were so many ""aw"" moments that I couldn't actually believe Pixar made it possible to ""aw"" at a robot. But it did. Wall-E is the cutest robot I've seen. And he has so much personality. The romantic antics in the beginning with Eve, his robot friend, were so unbelievably human-like. And Eve is sort of like a hard-to-get woman in the beginning, which made me chuckle. This is definitely the movie that you want to see with your girlfriend / boyfriend, as you see the relationship build between Eve and Wall-E. It's a perfect movie to hold hands in (none of the yawning...). There are such beautifully put together ""romantic"" scenes, like that which you would see with real humans. And the end . . . well, I won't go there, but it was . . . amazing.<br/><br/>And of course there are other levels of Pixar's genius that make this movie fantastic, as well. The basic idea of human nature, as humans naturally trend towards sedentary ways and reliance on robots. We see the garbage-trodden Earth beyond repair, we see the paradise of Axiom, we see the loss of hope, and we see the eternal nature of hope. There's always hope. That's what Wall-E says to me.<br/><br/>But I'd just see this for Wall-E and Eve's romance. That's enough for me, to make me ""aw"" and laugh enough, to make this movie one of the most enjoyable movie experiences I've had in a long time."
"hluebke","10","3","6","2 July 2008"," An amazing cinematic achievement.
","I felt for certain that ""Wall-E"" would be the beginning of the end of Pixar's magic. After viewing ""Wall-E"", I should never have doubted Pixar's talents. Movies should not require A-list actors, senseless dialogue, or overly flashy and/or tacky CGI effects to be considered entertainment. A movie's value should be based on its story and presentation. In that, ""Wall-E"" succeeds - lightyears ahead of most of today's motion pictures.<br/><br/>An animated film is not for everyone. There will be naysayers. But, ""Wall-E's"" storyline is so broad that it is truly an umbrella film, so to speak - science-fiction, romance, comedy, drama - genres to entertain most moviegoers. Most children will be able to understand and appreciate the characters' adventures; most adults will be able to take in the movie for its grandeur and for its message. The irony of the human/robot role reversal likely will not go lost on audiences, but ""Wall-E"" avoids becoming preachy in favor of developing ethos for the main characters. ""Wall-E"" does not necessarily tell a new story - sentient robots; we've all heard of or seen Kubrick's 2001 - but it brings something fresh to a story we've all heard before. (I still believe this to be Pixar's secret - finding new and amazing ways to tell old stories.) There are quite a few science-fiction references (including a humorous little homage to 2001 in the score) but they do not detract - a viewer really does not need to be a science-fiction fan to understand ""Wall-E"", but a science-fiction fan will appreciate the references. In addition to sci-fi references, there are many references to ""Hello, Dolly"", including the first ever live-action film in a Pixar film.<br/><br/>The animation is absolutely lovely. It is at times difficult to remember that Wall-E is indeed an animated film. In keeping with the theme of the story, more realistic detail is given to the robots and their primary settings; in the humans' primary settings, the animation becomes almost cartoonish. The images of Earth are both stunning and horrifying - horrifying mostly because a world as such is not that difficult to imagine. ""Wall-E"" is full of minute detail that serves to enhance the reality of the experience.<br/><br/>Yes, the dialogue is sparse. Robot-speak is, at times, difficult to understand. Thankfully, it is not excessive. The lack of dialogue adds weight to the film, as viewers won't need to struggle to keep up with an endless stream of words. This also means a viewer rarely has to worry about missing a line, or whispering to his or her companion ""what did he just say?"" ""Wall-E"" could still make its point with no dialogue whatsoever.<br/><br/>Animated films are not everyone's cup of tea, but I urge everyone to give ""Wall-E"" a shot. It is a masterpiece of cinematography - Pixar's greatest achievement yet."
"nirmal_vijay","9","3","6","2 July 2008"," Wall-E::Toy Story || Ratatouille::Finding Nemo
","This comment is for my fellow fans of Pixar Movies. So I am keeping it precise.<br/><br/>Wall-E is logical, intelligent, smart but straight forward. People who 'like' sci-fi will 'love' Wall-E. Wall-E is for fans who love collectibles, organized/structured living, logical sequences, assumed similarities between earth and space. Wall-E is similar in giving life and emotion to non-living things within living environment as Toy Story.<br/><br/>But Wall-E is no Ratatouille when it comes to story, culture, emotions and drama.<br/><br/>My title is based on similar differences. Rataouille is like Finding Nemo on different levels. Wall-E is like Toy Story in different levels.<br/><br/>Pixar is its own world. For non-fans, welcome to Pixar to see and believe."
"victor7754","9","3","6","2 July 2008"," An Early 21st Century Animated Feature
","WALL-E captivates the senses during the first 20 minutes as computer generated images of our future look and feel life like. A loneliness creeps in and engulfs the mind as WALL-E wheels his way around a decaying metropolis, in silence doing his job as a scrap recycler constructor. Many films in recent times have applied the spirit and machine together such as A.I., I Robot, 2001, and Aaron Lipstadt's obscure 1982 film Android. There may be a future in robotics as the Human population rises and our needs change. Investors look out.<br/><br/>This Pixar/ Disney production is a wonder to view as we watch WALL-E pursue companionship in a space visitor, a Droid Robot named EVA sent to the barren earth to find plant life. The arrival of the spaceship as it descends upon the desolate city is beautiful and enjoyably felt. There is a Genesis feel to EVA's arrival as she represents Eve in the Garden and WALL-E is Adam. God even saw in a robot, loneliness. The discovered plant represents the fig leaf and the space ship is the Ark. Disney and Christianity have always been hand in hand.<br/><br/>The second half of the film becomes more Disney as we meet the Inhabitants on the Spaceship. A sadness may come upon the mind as the inhabitants are a future generation of WALL-Mart consumers continuing the game deep in Space. The Earth was gobbled up and left a wasteland by corporate consumers apathetic to the world around them. Who will lead them without ego back to earth. WALL-E? No. Love. Just as Christ represents love. Disney takes the same old story and paints another unique and original piece of art.<br/><br/>WALL-E seems to be telling us that the human race needs to come together and hold hands and save this planet. It aims at the next generation, today's 5 to 10 year olds who will always have the future of our planet on their minds.<br/><br/>WALL-E is fun, entertaining, unusual, alarming and contains some amazing images of a computer generated reality. That right there is frightening as the same generation may be deceived in the future when they think they are looking at something real when its just Pixar tricking the consumer into consumption."
"paulmg","10","3","6","1 July 2008"," Not just the best animated film of the year, but the best film of the year
","Minor spoilers ahead. Beware.<br/><br/>Wall*e begins unlike any other Disney film I've ever seen. From the beginning the filmmakers are telling you this one is going to be different. From space we see the Earth. A song from ""Hello, Dolly!"", of all things, makes its arrival. The happy-go-lucky tune about a better world out there somewhere is contrasted with the Earth the camera pulls in on: a world consumed by trash. The song drifts away like you're falling underwater and a slightly eerie cue from composer Thomas Newman, in one of his best works, takes over.<br/><br/>We then begin to follow Wall*e thru his day-to-day ritual of compacting trash and building towers of the little boxes, some as high as skyscrapers. He's been alone for hundreds of years, and his only real company are a cockroach pet and a video of ""Hello, Dolly!"" from which he learns about holding hands.<br/><br/>Much has been said about ""propanga"" in this film, to which I call foul. The story premise is that a lonely robot has been left behind on Earth. He's the only thing left. Everything else in the story comes out of that premise naturally. Why people were forced to flee Earth, what happened to them once they left, their dependence on machines and consumerism: it's all a natural product of the one basic story premise: What happens if humans leave Earth and one robot is left alone to clean it up? Anti-consumerism and environmental concerns, while present in the context of telling the story, are not a sermon to the audience. That's not even the message of the film.<br/><br/>The real message of the film is connecting with others. Wall*e, the little robot time forgot, desperately wants someone, something to connect with. Meanwhile, the humans on the ship have become completely disconnected from one another. They've forgotten that the most important thing in the world is each other. It takes a little robot who's never had anyone to remind people of the importance of the person next to them.<br/><br/>This isn't simply a great animated film, it's a great film. Period. It would be a shame if this got only Best Animated Film Oscar consideration, because it really does deserve nominations for Best Picture, Andrew Stanton for both Director and Writer (yes, I believe he should get a director nomination, which would be the first for an animated film), Sound and Sound Editing, Original Score and Original Song for Peter Gabriel's wonderful credits tune.<br/><br/>It's difficult to put into words how extremely well made this film is. A good portion of the film is, essentially, a silent film, in that there is very little dialog. Most of the character depth is developed in looks, sounds, and minor voice inflections using the few words the robots possess. Walking out of the theater, I was reminded of Chaplin's powerful ""City Lights,"" the beautiful love story of the blind girl and the homeless man who falls in love with her. Like Chaplin, Stanton and Pixar have managed to tell an engaging and powerful love story about two unlikely characters who happen to find each other, using few if any words. Wall*e so unabashedly loves Eve and is willing to go to any lengths to be with her, and you understand exactly what is going on in his head and in his heart at all times, even though he hardly speaks.<br/><br/>As for kids, at first my thought was that it might not be the best for kids, that it might be aimed more at adults. But I must admit that at the end of the film, which I saw on a Saturday afternoon showing that was packed with kids, all that had been restless or talking to mom and dad early in the film were complete still like all the adults in the audience, staring at the screen, completely gripped in the final moments. In fact, more than 3/4 of the audience stayed through the credits. They simply didn't want the movie to end."

","Mesmerizing.<br/><br/>This little film about a little robot has one of the biggest hearts I've ever seen in a movie, and its message, about the responsibility humans must accept in changing their own lives and the life of their planet for the better, is perhaps the single most important message film as an art form can be communicating right now.<br/><br/>""Wall-E"" did for me what so few films are able to do: it transported me to a place where, for the hour and a half that I was watching it, nothing existed for me but this movie. It made me feel like a kid again, and recreated the feelings I had watching ""Star Wars"" or ""E.T."" for the very first time, which would account for the countless scenes that made me tear up for vaguely nostalgic reasons.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that we spend most of our time with mechanical robots, a love of humanity and of the earth pulses from every frame of ""Wall-E"". Movies, television and the news media spend so much time trying to convince us that the world is a terrible place to live, that one rickety little robot with big eyes telling us otherwise comes as a revelation.<br/><br/>Grade: A+"
"sirrusblack45","10","3","6","1 July 2008"," A Masterpiece of Satire, Wonder, and Love
","About a year ago I went to see Ratatouille at theaters with some of my friends. after the film I was reeling over how great it was and I was having to argue with myself on whether or not it was better than Toy Story...which I felt was the best animated film ever. That night I came to the conclusion that Ratatouille was better. Now I sit in a theater after seeing Wall-e and I'm having to figure out if this film is better than The Shawshank Redemption or Lawrence of Arabia. In short I was conflicted on whether or not Wall-e was the best film I'd ever seen...a question I'm still mulling over at this moment. Wall-e was a phenomenal film about the sense of wonder that comes with the great unknown, human kind in the future based on our life styles now and of course unlikely love. Wall-e had the ability to melt your heart within the first minute of the film and when EvE came in to the picture I was gone...I think I sat on the verge of tears throughout the entire film before shedding during the one particularly beautiful scene in the middle and sobbing by the films climactic end. Not only was it beautiful artistically driven film it was very VERY important. Its satire on Humans laziness and easy manipulation is the best I've seen since Brazil. This film belongs on the shelf next to other important films like Schindler's List and United 93...it is that important. But finally this film touched in me something I've not felt in such a long time...a sense of wonder. Wall-e is a dreamer and a hopeless romantic. He brings out the child in us all and that feeling that there is more than just this feeble existence, there is something more than just living out life...You need to look at the stars and delight in the company of the ones you love.<br/><br/>Go see this film! It might be the most meaningful film to come out of Hollywood. Or you'll be like me and fall in love with these Wall-e and strive to dream of a brighter world beyond this one.<br/><br/>I unashamedly give this film a 10...I've never done that before...this film is perfect.<br/><br/>Also keep up the great work Pixar...you are pulling out films that others are afraid to create."
"pippin_evil_genius","10","3","6","30 June 2008"," The best Sci-Fi movie I have ever seen. Easily.
","In 2003 I was amazed by Andrew Stanton and his motion picture, Finding Nemo. Since then, Finding Nemo has been hailed by some as the greatest animated movie ever created. And with good reason. Finding Nemo is a film of pure genius. However, the film may have some serious competition. Andrew Stanton's new movie, Wall-E is a movie unlike anything you've ever seen before.<br/><br/>I was able to go to see Wall-E at it's midnight showing last Thursday, and the movie left me completely blown away. This film is very different from any other movie you will ever see. It's also very different from any Pixar movie you've seen. The strange thing is, it may be Pixar's greatest movie. Wall-E is simple, touching, and very well done.<br/><br/>As you might already know, Wall-E takes place over 700 years in the future. To be exact, the year is 2815 A.D. According to Pixar, Earth will be abandoned due to too much pollution and garbage. Leaving all of the earths clean up in the hands of the machine named: Wall-E. However, Wall-E is lonely. After all, he's been alone for years and years. It seems his only friend is a small cockroach that follows him around. Life for Wall-E is slow, and boring... However, it is very funny and entertaining for the audience. One day the humans send another robot named EVE into Wall-E's life. When Wall-E sees EVE he instantly falls in love with her, and begins to kind of stalk her.<br/><br/>After certain events, Eve is taken away from earth by the humans, and Wall-E embarks on a truly unforgettable adventure. Where he meets dozens of robots, humans, and truly finds happiness. Wall-E is taken to the Axiom, the ship where the humans spend their lives, instead of living on Earth, they live on the Axiom.<br/><br/>I would write more on the story, but I really wouldn't want to spoil it for anyone who reads this. Just know this, the actual film of Wall-E is nothing like the trailers and TV Spots. I walked in expecting a happy movie, with no despair, or sorrow. But in reality Wall-E is one of the most touching movies I have ever seen. There were at least three times in the movie where I almost cried. Which for me is INCREDIBLY difficult to do.<br/><br/>For the concerned parents, (I don't know why you'd be concerned about a Pixar movie that's rated G)Wall-E maybe boring for younger children. My three year old almost fell asleep. The movie might be harder to understand for some, and the movie can be pretty dramatic at some parts. A child began to cry at one point in the movie. It's truly Pixar's most dramatic film yet.<br/><br/>I don't know why, but I seem to be having trouble writing this review for Wall-E. It might be because I was so emotionally drained after every time I saw this movie.<br/><br/>I've already seen it three times, and plan to go again this Wednesday. Trust me on this one. Wall-E is definitely worth paying to see on the big screen. The animation is superb, the characters are lovable and some you hate. The movie will suck you into a different dimension, and you'll probably end up staying after the credits.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Wall-E is a superb movie. It's full of amazing characters, including Wall-E. Who is one of the most lovable and adorable characters created. This movie is truly Oscar worthy. It's easily the best Sci-Fi I have ever seen. (I've seen A LOT of Science Fiction movies.) And I recommend it for anyone.<br/><br/>An easy 10/10"

I thought that was the best part of the movie, it wasn't incredibly dumbed down dialog, it was, intelligent! Maybe some of the kids who go to see this movie will benefit from having to use their brains and eyes and really think about something for a change.

Not only is the animation and sound effects perfect, but the story is excellent and it delivers a simple, yet epic message that both adults and kids can relate to and benefit from. And for a movie that has very little human dialog, it definitely keeps your attention and takes you on an adventure filled with laughter, joy, inspiration, and encouragement that, in the end, is a simple love story.<br/><br/>Overall, Pixar's new film, WALL-E, is an instant classic and a brilliant piece of American cinema."
"ramius84","10","3","6","30 June 2008"," Not a ""Kids' Movie"" (but in a good way)
","This is the best original screenplay I've seen in a movie in quite a while.<br/><br/>I am very discriminating when it comes to movie choices. This stems from an awareness of the power of film to shape our lives and a desire not to spend more time watching movies than I do processing and applying what I learn from them. All that to say, you need to see WALL-E.<br/><br/>While Pixar has defined the summer family movie since Toy Story, WALL-E is their first film that eschews the need to be a ""kids movie"". As director Andrew Stanton put it, ""Animation is a medium, not a genre."" This is not to say that kids won't love the movie (it has plenty of visual excitement and hijinks to keep them entertained), but that for the first time, the story, characters, and themes of the film are designed primarily to appeal to an intelligent adult audience.<br/><br/>From the opening credits, WALL-E proceeds to treat themes of apathy, isolation, consumerism, automation, stewardship, and love with more seriousness than most ""issue movies"" can muster, all the while wrapping the audience into the characters with genuine humor and creativity. It's too good at telling its story to be obsessed with its message.<br/><br/>Stylistically, the film is a delight to anyone who loves the art of movie-making. While dazzling innovative, it draws on a variety of influences - science-fiction standards like 2001: A Space Odyssey, Star Wars, and various dystopian films but also pulls from the insightful slapstic of Chaplin (notably Modern Times) and the bygone ideals of Hello Dolly! (The film relies heavily on the classic musical to humanize an otherwise bleak landscape). WALL-E further solidifies Pixar's well-deserved reputation as the benchmark for poignant, watchable American cinema."

","i had high expectations with this film, as it is written and directed by Andrew Stanton, who helmed ""Finding Nemo,"" my personal favorite Pixar film. i was not disappointed.<br/><br/>who knew an animated film with so little dialogue could keep you so engrossed in the story? you have to hand it to the guys at Pixar, they know what they're doing and they do it well. as always, they are able to imbue the least human of characters with humanity, infusing them with personality, warmth, humor, and empathy. in fact, the robots of this film may be more human than the humans.<br/><br/>the animation has never been better, so startling are the visuals, and Thomas Newman delivers yet another incredible score. what makes this film different than the other Pixar movies is that it doesn't only carry the usual life-lesson moral with it, but also proclaims a social message to where we are now as humans and our reliance on technology and material possessions, and our apathy towards what we are doing to the precious planet we live on.<br/><br/>the film only misfires a tad when the humans begin to have a bigger part of the plot, but the rest of the film is so great, it mostly makes up for this. this should easily be one of the best films of the year."

","I loved this movie. There was nearly no dialog for the first half of the movie, yet I was constantly entertained (not to mention wowed by the GCI which blew every other Pixar film I've seen out of the water). There were hilarious and touching moments around every turn. Every aspect of this movie, from the adult-oriented social commentary to the cute interactions between the robots, was flawless. Editing, timing, lighting, plot, all the way down to how the different robots portrayed their personalities was spot on.<br/><br/>I will recommend this movie to all of my friends and family members. Pixar never fails to move the bar up a notch.<br/><br/>This is worth the $7 ticket to see on the big screen!"

","This movie was absolutely fantastic. The simplicity of it (a movie with relatively no dialogue to advance the story) is simply mind-bending. The movie progresses at a wonderful, delightful, enjoyable, and entertaining pace.<br/><br/>The characters are downright adorable and lovable. Story is fantastic. <br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie so much. By far the best full-length feature that Pixar has made to date. ""Wall-E"" is simply delightful. Enjoyable for all ages. Wonderful kids entertainment, but a beautiful, heart-wrenching, apocalyptic undertone that the adults can sink their teeth into.<br/><br/>The whimsy of the trash-compacting robot is downright astonishing and enjoyable.<br/><br/>I heartily recommend this movie to anyone!"
"captelephant","8","18","64","11 July 2008"," Beautiful and Endearing / Unfocused and Wasteful
","Wall-E is an achievement for many reasons. But Wall-E is not perfect. And honestly, I think Wall-E is quite overrated.<br/><br/>I'll start with the good: The CG is revolutionary. Our two mostly-speechless heroes (essentially a rolling square and a floating circle) are the most likable on-screen duo in recent memory. Their romance is believable and endearing, and any time they're interacting with each other the movie is a 10. The film's first 45 minutes are positively enchanting.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, as soon as the pair leaves Earth everything stops clicking.<br/><br/>In the second 2/3rds of the movie, the storyline stops focusing on the romance and starts zig-zagging between what seems like 5 or 6 barely-related sub-plots. During all this unfocused side-story hopping the writers somehow forget to include a MAIN story of any consequence. This is a serious problem.<br/><br/>Secondary characters are introduced, then dropped, then reappear an hour later to overcome some obstacle that clearly only existed to give them something to do. So why introduce them? A villain appears about half-way through the movie, paired with a human hero who will be inevitably tasked to defeat him. But the villain is non-threatening and the hero is under-developed and unbelievable, and when his triumph finally comes it feels anti-climactic and forced.<br/><br/>The various ""sub-plots"" should really be described as ""sub-points,"" since they're all transparent vehicles for social/political messages. Upwards of 4 different morals are bandied about, but the writers don't seem particularly passionate about any of them and don't devote more than 5 minutes to any single topic. The Incredibles, Ratatouille and even Happy Feet are all examples of how to marry a moral to a plot without diminishing either. Wall-E is an example of how not to.<br/><br/>In the end, I can't shake the feeling that Pixar took a simple, beautiful movie about robot romance and environmental caution, and crammed in two metric-tons of unnecessary, half-baked fluff. As a huge Pixar fan I have to say: they're better than that.<br/><br/>Sorry Pixar. I still love you."

","I find it extremely hard to digest all the over hyped praise this movie has received. Except the high quality animation, this movie has absolutely nothing to offer. The concept is very cliché.<br/><br/>If you have seen Idiocracy, you will find Wall E to be a cheap rip off of the same concept. Wall-E completely flat on humor lacks drama and excruciating screenplay. Usually I enjoy animated movies but this time I was thoroughly disappointed. This the first time I am amazed to see that I am in such disagreement with most of the IMDb users. I think those who liked this movie have not seen Idiocracy and therefore think that this is a brand new concept, but its not."

Why? if the future of robotics is like wall-e then i see toasters falling in love. Doing something they're not designed to do. Wall-E should have just cleaned junk, that's it.That's what he was designed to do.

"Mendelovich","1","14","48","6 June 2009"," Awful movie- nothing more
","I sensed I was cheated by the makers of Wall-e. I should have been warned that this movie is intended for the hearing impaired, or the illiterates. For the first 5 minutes no spoken words!!! Aferwards we are granted some blurbs about mundane things on Earth interpreted for the ignorants of the 28th century. Boring is the motto of this movie, and although the animation is superb as usual with the Pixar company, no amount of it can compensate on the lack of intelligent script composing. Bolt and Finding Nemo are masterpieces. Wall-e lags miles behind. I was sure that the Pixar fellows cannot fail, but they can and they did with Wall-e."

","Wall-e is a great character, really cute and all. Same with Eve and M-O. But give me a break.<br/><br/>From the very beginning there were piles of trash all on the earth. The premise to the movie is that all humankind had to leave the planet forever because they destroyed it with their trash.<br/><br/>The environmentalists will love this movie. It tells kids that humans are ruining the planet and don't even care. It tells them to stop living ""big and large"", stop trying to succeed in business.

I don't litter and I do my best to keep stuff clean.

","This will go down as the most boring movie I have seen this year. It is predictable, shallow, and paceless.<br/><br/>Sorry guys, but I walked out of it.<br/><br/>My 9-year old nephew had warned me: ""everyone says it's boring, I don't want to watch wall-e, I want to watch Kung Fu panda (a third time)!"" I thought I knew better, having read some IMDb reviews and an impressive 9.0/10 voters' grade (now down to 8.8 and no doubt soon to fall below 8 where it belongs). So I dragged everyone to the theatre, promising them something somewhat deeper and more thought-provoking than Kung-Fu panda. Duh!? yeah,sure, endless piles of rubbish make you think: for instance, why pile it up near the buildings when there are entire areas free of construction...<br/><br/>The robots are cute, but no cuter than the robots in Star Wars (whatever their names are), and certainly no smarter. For one, they don't speak, except some kind of gibberish: it does make you wonder, doesn't it? I nearly lost all credibility with the family. I walked out early and booked us some seats for Hellboy2. My nephew loved it and forgave me my earlier mishap. Close one though.<br/><br/>I noticed this is Disney production: well that's my explanation right there: Disney paid a bunch of unemployed losers a dollar apiece to vote tirelessly for their boring, boring, boring silly animated skit."

","Firstly, let me just say that in no way do I dislike Pixar animated films - i've enjoyed films such as Finding Nemo and the Toy Story installments as well as Monsters INC and Ratatouille, to name a few. These films combined great story telling with endearing characters as well as some great animation and I would gladly rate any of these films highly. <br/><br/>Unfortunately it seems that quality films such as these have conferred a sort of 'herd immunity' upon other emotionally manipulative, drawn out, predictable Pixar titles - and WALL-E is one of the stellar examples of this. <br/><br/>Yes - the animation is good, as it is generally with the other Pixar titles. (Note that the budget was $180 million, and there are no pricey A-listers involved with voicing of the characters). Stanton describes the theme of the film as ""irrational love defeats life's programming"". So what? I could name a dozen films that explore this theme over the last decade! Ever heard of I AM SAM? How about i-Robot? What about Artificial Intelligence aka ""A.I"". The list goes on...<br/><br/>I know people would say that WALL-E the robot may be described as 'cute' and 'adorable', but to be honest I found him/her really annoying. What's with the arms? if you want a robot to pack rubbish into squares then why are it's arms so tiny? Look closely and you will find that obviously the robot (and most elements in the movie) has been designed for maximal sympathy - and i'm not even talking about the rotating droopy eyes or the annoying high pitched monosyllabic 'voice' it generates. It's obvious the studio wants you to think desperately 'hey if a robot could really care - this would be it'! Please.<br/><br/>OK so what about the storyline? Look I don't mind fantasy movies at all - as long as they make sense in their own right. But can someone explain to me how finding 1 sapling on earth means that earth is now inhabitable again? Surely there MUST be other parameters to test, hmmmm let's say Carbon dioxide? Maybe Oxygen could be one I don't know.<br/><br/>Look I better leave it there or people will think that i'm heartless for not falling for this contrived animated work. I think one annoying word sums up this movie: ""Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaallllllleeeeeeeeee""!!"

","I went to this movie with mixed feelings since I went with a friend on opening day. I have really enjoyed all of the other Pixar movies, but this movie had a dark political message behind it that doesn't need to be in what should be a light-hearted kids movie.<br/><br/>It was funny in the beginning, but then turned into this movie with political messages all over. I was actually shocked on what Pixar was trying to covey to us. I wanted an enjoyable movie, but instead got just some laughs in the beginning and politics and what I thought was an unnecessary message in a kids film during the second half. Yes, I know what our problems are, but they don't belong in the film.<br/><br/>If you spent $9.25 like I did at our brand new theater, wait until DVD or just skip it all together. HOWEVER...Pixar's short cartoon before the movie ALMOST made it worth going. You will laugh so hard at the short cartoon!!!!"
"esammann","4","5","13","29 August 2008"," I was a little disappointed
","Wall-E is about a garbage disposal who falls in love with a sleek and refined Macintosh. Humans completely destroyed the earth and space that surrounds earth so humans had to leave over 700 years ago. Now Wall-E has found a weed and that means that life can be sustained on earth again. Wall-E catches a ride to deep space where the humans are living on a spaceship since space close to earth, as mentioned before, was also an extreme mess. Once on board we see that humans have gotten so lazy that they are all fat and cannot even turn their head to talk to their neighbor. Instead they use video conferencing to talk to people one foot to the right or left of them.<br/><br/>I think seeing the way humans were portrayed is what irritated me the most. I did not like the story line because of this and it basically ruined the whole movie for me.<br/><br/>I will say that my kids both stayed very interested in the movie. The animation from Pixar was top notch, as many others have said. My wife also like the move and thought it was cute. Obviously from the ratings most people have really enjoyed the movie.<br/><br/>I simply do not feel the same as most others about this movie and it is one of the few times that I have disagreed with the masses. I actually feel like I was being generous by giving it 4 stars, but I feel that the quality of the animation should allow it to get that much.<br/><br/>Yes we need to take care of our planet but we are also making changes for the better (ethanol, hydrogen fuel cell, electric wind energy, e-statements instead of paper). I certainly hope things don't get so bad that we have to leave for 700 years."

","In the distant future, planet Earth has been reduced to an uninhabitable cesspool of garbage and humans have been forced to adapt to life in outer space. All that remains is WALL-E, a lonely but durable and industrious robot who's only companion is a cockroach. One seemingly uneventful day, WALL-E encounters a highly advanced robot named EVE whose mission is to locate any remaining plant life, and together they go on the adventure of a lifetime to try and return the human population to their proper home. The latest concoction from the one and only Pixar Studios has some spectacular animation, a lovable lead character, and plenty of chuckles throughout, but the unintelligible dialogue keeps it distant, and the pace lags heavily early on. Story is too complex for younger audiences, the gags—surprisingly—aren't sophisticated enough for adults, but it's made watchable by a very appealing WALL-E. Some good ideas, but nothing as awe-inspiring as previous studio efforts. **½"

","Pixar's skill at creating amazing visuals is undeniable. This movie is another showcase of their talent in that field. However, after sitting in the theater for the first hour, (Which felt like at least a week), I couldn't decide if I would rather have the movie end immediately or have something actually happen in the movie. Neither wish came to fruition. The movie dragged out for what seemed an eternity, with nothing happening. It became clear during the second half of the movie that this was really a ""Save the Planet"" commercial, and I'm all for it, but couldn't they have made it entertaining? Or perhaps made a good movie and then just passed out ""Save the Earth"" pamphlets at the end. I was painfully aware throughout the entire movie that neither my son or I had even chuckled during this film. Watching garbage fall on a little robot, or seeing him roll down a hill of trash just isn't that funny. Especially the tenth or eleventh time. Wall.e reminds me of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", critically acclaimed, but absolutely unwatchable. In all fairness, I've never actually made it to the end of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", and I wish that I had walked out on Wall.e as well. If you have to take your kids to this movie, make sure that they are not expecting any kind of action, and bring a book to read."

","As I came home from watching Wall-E, many thoughts raced through my mind, but one stuck out above the rest: I felt like I had just sat through nearly two hours of nothing. Mindlessly boring in some parts, while in others nothing more than yet another blaring environmental message hidden beneath child-friendly wrapping, I honestly cannot see how a child could sit through Wall-E without being confused or bored, or how some critics proclaimed this 'the movie of the decade.' Not to say that Wall-E is garbage; it has a few touching moments, such as Wall-E and Eve's beautiful dance through the star-strewn fathoms of the galaxy, the adorable gang of misfit robots running after Walle and Eve, or Wall-E's curiosity regarding Earth's scattered refuse. However, the emotional scenes are few and far apart, while the plot between them is either far over the children's heads, or so ultimately heartless and pointless that one often wishes they could fall asleep.<br/><br/>Here we have the same basic environmental doomsday message that has been constantly thrown at us over the past several years: in a couple hundred years, the human race's greed and consumerism will destroy/over pollute the entire world, turning earth into a gigantic garbage dump and forcing the population into outer space where they grow morbidly obese relying on robots for all their needs. Do children really need to be force-fed this fateful message? I sighed during the scene where the overweight captain learns to stand on his own two feet while Space Odessy music plays, and wondered how on earth Pixar has sunk so low that they have to rely on parodies and fat jokes to make their movies amusing. On top of this, the villain had no real motive, hardly anyone in the theatre laughed, and the end credits were pitiful compared to some of Pixar's previous performances.<br/><br/>I'll give them this: the characters of Wall-E, the cockroach, and a few of the assorted robots were cute, there were a few touching scenes, and the viewers managed a few chuckles then and now, but all in all the hilarious short film preceding the actual movie was more entertaining. Go to this movie if you want to see an unusual but interesting take on our world's future, plus a few cute moments with the robots. Don't go expecting great emotion, morals or comedy. Overall Kung Fu Panda was a much, much better film and I will be disappointed (but not surprised, seeing as how so many have been enchanted by Wall-E) if Dreamworks' finest does not beat Pixar's lowest at the Oscars this year."

If they are going to go ""dark"" with a movie you need more story, and more character development.<br/><br/>When WALL-E crunched that roach, his friend, it was probably the most funny part of the movie.

This is the heart of the matter - YOU are all okay with your cars, just be sure to recycle those cans, right, and make sure you drive back home in time to turn of the hall light bulb for ""Earth Day"" A cynical and banal film that gets it's philosophy from current thinking such as ""smaller paper towels = saving the planet.""

It is easily the worst PIXAR movie I have ever seen and I am disappointed with the studio in general. I thought the plot between Wall-E and Eva (Eve?) was incredibly boring and nothing special at all. The only saving grace of the movie was that Fred Willard was a part of it.

The story is kind of interesting but the humor is not up to par with Pixar's previous. The good thing about the humor in a Pixar movie is that they relate to children and Adults humor but not with this one.<br/><br/>The up side is that children as in 10 and younger will probably like it, visually the movie was great but as a teen that has liked all the previous Pixar films this one was a disappointment.And the last thing, what is with movies and the end of the world theme.

","At what point do homage and tribute pass into the realm of reprehensible theft and unoriginality? Director Andrew Stanton answers this question with ham-handed blows to the mind and body with his critical darling, ""Wall-E,"" which might as well have been called ""Short Circuit meets *Apple"" if not for the pack of other Sci-Fi films from which this one has swiped plot points, characters, vehicles, shots, and so forth.<br/><br/>As the film opens, we are greeted by a sweeping shot of Earth in ruins as a sweeping showtune sweeps us away. Yet, despite all this sweeping, enormous clouds of dust manage to dominate every frame, diminishing the grandness of the vision for the sake of reality. This nonetheless jolly first moment leads into a similarly jolly first half for the film, laced with a lovely affair between WallE, who recalls a Windows 95PC, and the stunning Eve, a walking, or rather hovering, advertisement that must have made Steve Jobs proud. While Thomas Newman's score manages nothing more than to sound like every other Thomas Newman score, it's easy to get wrapped up in the Chaplin-esquire love story. Undoubtedly, ""Wall-E"" has a first half to die for, or at least to fork up $10. Unfortunately, things go downhill.<br/><br/>The second half, rather than making the first seem good by comparison, is in fact so unbearable as to cancel out much of the power of the opening. Attempting to tackle hefty environmental issues and to inspire change in humanity's current behavior, Stanton and company utilize poorly rendered animated humans, voiced badly and put through a hideous subplot in which a blander version of 2001's HAL opposes the changes desired by the unbelievably earnest ""Captain"" of a spacecraft taken right off the shelves of the ""Dune"" series. Rather than simply hinting at the film's weighty moral, the film-makers actually introduce lines of dialogue that spell it out, later illustrating the implications thereof with an animated vision of Earth's future when better care is applied.<br/><br/>Fortunately, ""Wall-E"" saves itself from the dreaded 1/5 rating by virtue of the fact that the love story is given at least some screen time during the dregs of the film's finale."

","Let me get the ratings over with first. If you are one of those people who are very concerned about our planet, and you happen to be under the age of 7, then you will probably like this movie and rate it very high. If, on the other hand, even if you are concerned about our planet and are not a little kid, you most likely will hate this movie. Not because of the message it is trying to convey, which is an important one, but because overall this is one of the most boring movies ever, even though visually this is one of Pixar's better achievements. If I had not had to watch it I would have turned it off after 9 minutes, and I usually give movies at least 20 minutes to get going. It took a good 35 minutes before anything of interest happened. So a good 1/3 of the movie is just WALL-E going about his business, compacting trash, and keeping items that he found interesting, making himself a little life and home with the trash humans left behind. He even had an old VHS musical that seemed to keep playing the same 2 scenes. His only interaction is with a cockroach (well acted I might add). Then one day a ship drops off a robot that is in search of plant life. This robot, which happens to be a girl (I had no idea there were girl and boy robots, but hey, this is 700 years in the future, so why not?) gets the interest of WALL-E, and he falls in love with her. When she leaves the planet he hitches a ride on the space craft. From there it got a tad more interesting, but only because we now had more characters, robotic and human, and some actual action (with good and bad robots of course), but the interaction between WALL-E and EVE was still dull (shades of Short Circuit and Electric Dreams...kind of). And we are also shown what will happen to humans when they have robots do everything for them and they spend all their time sucking down some drink and sitting/sleeping in chairs only watching ""TV."" Wait, aren't some of us already there? The plot was predictable, even down to the ET-like ""Don't leave me"" scene. And in the end the Earth comes back (of course, since those that ruined it left). The audience is then left with a ray of hope that the humans have learned a lesson. Yea, right. I will always wonder if the writers kept going and showed that the fat humans who did not know how to do anything would say ENOUGH! and shuffle back to the comfy life they once knew."

But after that, it went downhill to become just okay, the ""supporting"" characters in Wall-E are just so boring and don't have any personality at all, they aren't likable at all really. And the idea of having the main characters only, communicating with each other by their names and body language didn't make my day at least. No, this certainly wasn't as great as the IMDb users wanted it to be. It's definitely not worth an imdbtop250 place, that's for sure.

","Let me start off by saying Wall-E is not a bad movie, in fact its a very cute movie with a handful of laughs at Wall-E's curiosity and awkwardness. Kids will eat it up. The sound was excellent since there is hardly any dialogue at all until halfway through the movie. There is a good message behind the film and all, but to be honest I got bored. Sure the animation was top notch and visually may be one of the best pixar movies to date, but the story lacked in my opinion and failed to keep me interested. The best part of this film was the short film before the movie started. ""Presto"" is by far the best pixar short I've ever seen, it was worth my $7.50 just to see it. In conclusion, it's not a bad movie to go see on a rainy day or if your kids are dying to go to the pictures, but if I were you I'd wait and rent it when it comes out on DVD."
"Cjrod3","Null","4","10","1 July 2008"," Hello Dolly? It Was Nice While You Were Gone
","First of all, what was with the constant replaying of that horrible song from one of the greatest stinkers of all time? I'm talking about ""Hello Dolly"". This movie was a total bore, and while the animation is superb, it's mostly a lot of whirring machinery, cold and sterile. The plot seemed lifted from elements of William Gibson's novel ""Neuromancer."" The amorphic human blobs are poorly rendered, by the way. My 5 year old granddaughter was bored stiff. This doesn't compare in any way to ""Toy Story"" or ""Finding Nemo."" Wait for the DVD and load up on plenty of coffee beforehand. Probably Pixar's worst yet. But seriously, does anyone have a take on the ""Hello Dolly"" obsession? Is it some sly, gay inside joke or what?"
"serge-33","8","4","10","27 June 2008"," Wonderful Wall-E's main lesson ignored
","Great movie, visuals, story & characters. Watched it today in a sold-out theater at Universal City, full of families armed with extra-large popcorn baskets and coke bottles. <br/><br/>Probably the film's most important thread is that we're polluting our earth to such extent that it's becoming inhabitable. In the film, when the overweight humans return to earth, it's still the same unlivable place. Still, they're excited to be back. <br/><br/>In theater, when the lights went on, and everyone had left I couldn't believe garbage battleground in the theater. Rubbish everywhere, left by people who just watched this lovable, yet bleak view of the future for 97 minutes. The incredibly important message was lost entirely on the audience. I didn't leave as upbeat as the other reviewers, maybe because I was confronted with the ugly truth about how we pollute this marvellous place, even inside the theater. Will we never learn?"
"ktubes15","1","22","91","3 July 2008"," Wall-E was Horribl-E
","This movie had no plot, pretty much no talking, and when the robots did utter sounds, you couldn't even understand what they were saying. All and all this was the worst Pixar movies I have ever been to. I had very high expectations after seeing classics like Toy Story and Finding Nemo, and this movie left me very disappointed. The whole idea of the theme was twisted and sick. I thought Pixar made happy, heart warming films, not ones that show the earth dying and the dark side of humanity. Do not waste your time and money going to see this awful film. Instead use your time and money going out to rent or buy one of Pixars better movies that you can enjoy and be happy watching time and time again."
"MartinHafer","7","8","26","7 March 2009"," Wow, do I feel out of step!
","WALL-E is a very popular Oscar-winning film, so my giving it a 6 must seem like sacrilege. However, I don't do this just to buck convention or be a jerk---I just thought it didn't have a particularly good plot. As for the animation, not surprisingly, it's absolutely beautiful--probably the prettiest CGI film to date.<br/><br/>The story begins on a desolate Earth. Everywhere is garbage and the crumbling bits of a long-dead city are the home of WALL-E the robot. Apparently, his job is to help clean up the mess and it's obvious he has been doing it for centuries. You see no other robots, so you assume that they have long since ceased functioning. This portion of the movie lasts quite a while--with no dialog and not much story.<br/><br/>A bit later, a probe lands on the Earth and WALL-E is thrilled because he apparently is lonely. The other robot seemed rather reticent to engage with WALL-E, but WALL-E follows 'Eve' like a stalker. Eventually, Eve finds a lone plant and pulls it inside its shell. Then she seems to shut down. However, a ship soon arrives and brings her back to a huge space cruiser filled with weeble-like humans. It seems that Eve's purpose was to seek out evidence of life on Earth so that the humans can return after a 700 year absence. It seems that they made the planet pretty uninhabitable in the 2100s and now, perhaps, it's time to go home. However, there is an unexpected glitch that may prevent the ship from returning.<br/><br/>My problems with the story have to do with anthropomorphizing the robots. They are NOT human and they cannot possess feelings--yet in this Disney world they do. Well, this is hard to believe, but even if this is so, the robots only have a bit of a personality. They are not so lovable and they have very limited vocabularies. Because of that, the first 39 minutes are pretty dull, as there isn't much to do other than watch WALL-E (for the first 15 or so minutes) or Eve and WALL-E for the next 24 minutes. Once the humans are involved, it gets a bit better--but only just a bit. Most of this final segment of the film seems to be chase scenes and the humans are given practically no personality as well. I don't see how kids sat still during the movie and I assume this is a film that critics loved but I can't imagine younger kids loving with the same fervor as TOY STORY or MONSTERS, INC..<br/><br/>Overall, a lovely film to look at so I give it a 7 just for the amazing artistry, but a rather unexpectedly dull story keeps it from a higher score. I know that puts me in a small minority, but this seems like Pixar's most overrated film. Heck, the short film that preceded WALL-E (PRESTO) was much better than the film that followed."
"eidsoj42","1","19","77","6 July 2008"," Preachy and unappealing to its target audience...
","My five year old hated this film, and I have to say that I to believe it to be this summers greatest waste of silicon. About forty minutes in he was begging to leave the theater. This might be normal for some kids that age, but my son has never asked to leave a movie early. My wife and I had much the same sentiment, but having dropped 22 dollars to go see it I was determined to stay until the end. Guess I should have trusted my son on this one, because it just turned out to be more of the same ""save the planet"" tripe that keeps getting pushed on us more and more these days. Most of Pixars movies have focused on the main characters struggle to overcome their own short-comings in a way that a child can relate to, and in the end the protagonists are always the better for it. Slapstick and a little adult humor are mixed in and presto, everyone has a good movie going experience. However, this movie just seemed to focus on mankind's general abuse of the planet and overall slothfulness (is that a word?). People weren't redeemed at the end of the movie they were just made to revisit the polluted cesspool of a planet that their predecessors had created. How the group of fat, slovenly, fools that was supposed to be what was left of mankind at the end of that movie would do anything more than get back on their spaceship and sail away I'll never know. Furthermore, is it just me or has the quality of Pixar's films steadily declined since Disney took them over?"
"shawnkenessey","4","7","22","20 July 2008"," Good movie, not great
","Pixar wants you to know the obvious today, and they really, really want to make sure you ""get it"", so they're going to take their message and put it on the end of a baseball bat and beat you over the head with it till you bleed from your eyeballs... <br/><br/>The big message here is stop being wasteful and stop sucking down sodas because you're going to get fat... OH, and corporations just want to take your money!!! (Kind of like the $9 I spent to stare at the big screen only to be fed this patronizing schlock.) <br/><br/>Yeah, well, its the same message I hear from every corner of the earth these days so whats the big deal?? GET FIT, DON'T POLLUTE, THE ROBOTS CAN LOVE TOO YOU KNOW!!! BIG FAT DEAL. I put the previous in all caps because I assure you the movie is screaming those themes louder than I am. And oh please everyone, PLEASE LISTEN CLOSELY, did you know that robots can fall in love??? They CAN love, and this matters SO much that we're putting it right next to the themes of destroying the world, because god, the robots CAN LOVE!!! (AMAZEMENT) (There are no robots that can love in reality, but there really is a lot trash in the landfills.) They're so lovely in their lovey loveness though, those two robots, its actually like interracial marriage. Wall-e is basically a black janitor, and Eve is a white secret agent with a special mission to fill her womb with the seed of life!!! <br/><br/>Personally I'd rather watch spiders mate on the Discovery channel rather than two robots holding hands.<br/><br/>Truly, this movie is not all that challenging, or groundbreaking, or thought provoking for anyone past high school. Its a kids movie that is extremely well done as a kids movie, and the themes stay neatly within that kid friendly realm.<br/><br/>The bottom line is I don't have a desire to see it again. I can recall every significant plot moment of this film from beginning to end because basically not a whole lot happens in it. <br/><br/>I don't need a 180 million dollar animated movie to tell me to exercise! (I've been exercising for years) <br/><br/>I encourage Pixar to take on a serious theme in the future."

","As soon as I left the theater I said to my friends and family......eh it was pretty good. WALL-E had its moments of comedy and drama, yet I felt very......bored throughout the middle and parts of the end of the movie. <br/><br/>WALL-E as in every Disney movie since the late 90s has an underlying theme. Recently, all their themes have been the same.....SAVE THE ENVIRONMENT!!!! Frankly I get enough of that crap on television and I hear peers talking about it that I really don't want to hear it in movies I see. <br/><br/>So overall...all I can say about WALL-E is that it's OK. It's definitely not a Beauty and the Beast or a Mulan....but it's OK for a Disney movie.<br/><br/>My rating:<br/><br/>B-"

"soulless_nin","1","20","83","13 July 2008"," People please... get real
","This movie was so horrible, I can't even believe all the fuzz this  movie is causing... If I have to say something good about this, is the  first 45 min. After Wall-E and Eve get to the space ship, everything  crashes down miserably.  **SPOILERS** It's hard for me to believe that this persons, who have  been lazy and fat for like, hundreds of YEARS, and so unaware of their  own surroundings (not even knowing what earth, sea or dance is), are so  willing to just go back to the Earth and start a new era... come on!  imaging throwing all your cellphones, computers, robots that do  everything for you, and go back to stone age... I'm not saying  consumerism is the answer, the message is good, I'm just saying that  having humans NOT so happy about finding a plant on earth and having to  give up all this confort would've been a much smarter plot, since  wall-e and Eve (robots) seems to care much more for that plant than all  those humans (again, unaware of their surroundings, being cold and  selfish, not caring about the environment, issues that are ACTUALLY  affecting our society this days)... THAT would have been better, but  no. Instead, we got a movie which climax is a fight between a robot and  the NAMELESS Captain of the space ship, tossing Wall-E and Eve totally  aside.  This movie is not entirely bad, but i can't believe it has a 8.9 rate."
"landres209","1","19","79","8 July 2008"," One of the worst cartoon features ever!
","The movie depicts the future planet earth as a planet that had to be evacuated because of some environmental catastrophe. Earth's remaining survivors are a robot (Wall-e) and a cockroach. The surface of the earth is shown to be nothing but massive skyscraper buildings and garbage heaps. Plant life can not be sustained on the earth envisioned by this movie maker and there are more garbage heaps than buildings. The movie is designed to make you feel guilty about over-development, breathing, producing garbage and using gasoline and other fossil fuels. The people who managed to escape this dreary scene are orbiting earth in some sort of spaceship, but they are all too fat and too weak to walk or even stand up. The attempt at a happy ending is the discovery of a single plant actually growing on earth again. So naturally all of the remaining people fly back to earth to start over amidst the rubble and skyscrapers. No matter that they can't walk.<br/><br/>I suppose if you are an environmental wacko you'll like and support this movie. I found it to be really awful and would recommend sparing your kids from this attempted indoctrination by Hollywood's big thinkers."
"iluvcallalilys","3","8","27","7 July 2008"," Mixed Feelings
","We just watched Wall-E this evening. My husband and I were looking forward to it. I LOVED Ratatouille! I enjoyed other Pixar movies... Cars, Toy Story, Nemo, Monsters Inc.<br/><br/>This one... well... my husband gave it a 3/10 and that's probably about my feeling too.<br/><br/>The animation was fantastic. I can't deny that it was absolutely impressive. It wasn't ""fun"" though... not bright and colorful like Nemo, or artistic like Ratatouille - rather it was sci-fi which fit perfectly.<br/><br/>The story, however, didn't grab us. I think the major reason is that you didn't know the goal/purpose of the plant, etc., until the near end... so there was ""nothing to root for."" Also, the characters produced VERY little dialogue and, consequently, VERY little character development. None of them were particularly funny or engaging to me. There was no ""sidekick"" or ""quirky"" one like Dory from Nemo, Dopey from Snow White, etc.<br/><br/>I understood the point and statement, but the fat, lazy slobs and disastrous planet weren't ""fun"" at all. The story had a good lesson, but it wasn't particularly fun or entertaining and that is just what I hope for when I go to a Pixar movie. The whole point of Pixar, to me, is to see something fun, whimsical, unique, more light-hearted.<br/><br/>Artistically, I was impressed. As for the story... it just didn't grab me at all. I don't care to see this one again."
"fuzzypatters","7","3","7","5 August 2009"," Difficult to review
","I am torn about how I felt about this movie. On the one hand, I really liked how the filmmakers were able to get you to sympathize with an animated robot and really root for him. This was very well done, and much of the animation was stunning. In many ways, this was a very impressive effort.<br/><br/>However, I also found the film to be excruciatingly slow at certain points. It seemed as if the filmmaker felt that the audience was too stupid to make inferences about the characters unless he drew scenes out for a very long time and beat them over the head with it. I found myself becoming increasingly bored as the movie wore on. If it had been edited down 30 minutes, it would have been a much better movie."
"Medacakathareal","6","3","7","2 January 2009"," The Critics Must be Nuts
","The hype surrounding WALL-E as the best Pixar movie yet left me relatively unmoved, particularly after Ratatouille turned out to be the worst Pixar movie and not the best (in my opinion of course). So with the DVD release I begrudgingly sat down to watch WALL-E thinking that a Johnny 5 looking CGI robot might be cool and that some of the winning humor from previous Disney-Pixar ventures might shine through...<br/><br/>Boy was I wrong... But what's more surprising is that the critics were wrong too, and IMDb's viewers are either all in the film's main demographic (kids) or are wrong. This is certainly not the best Pixar film and isn't really all that good...<br/><br/>Let's start with the positives, Animation- Once again the Pixar team shows their incredible talent for beautiful animation. The animation looks great, it isn't going to set any industry standards, but its cutting edge nonetheless...<br/><br/>WALL-E and Eve- the love story with WALL-E and Eve was pretty well done. I like that Eve, a probe sent to find LIFE is shaped like an EGG, the feminine-life giver symbolism is pretty neat, and WALL-E is a sort of robo-Adam.<br/><br/>Other than that there isn't much substance to the film, the plot is sparse, there is VERY LITTLE DIALOGUE as the bots can hardly talk. The movie felt so short, when the ending came I found myself wondering if the runtime was even over 60 Minutes. The first part of the story is about WALL-E, the second part about him and EVE, and the last part a Man Vs. Machine conflict to decide the fate of the Earth...<br/><br/>The environmental message didn't really work, because I find it hard to believe the human race is dumb enough to let our trash pile up that high. Is this how silly Environmental Crisis people see the rest of us, as fat and apathetic as the humans in this movie? It felt like I'd watched two-thirds of a movie and then it abruptly ended, what happens after the humans return to EARTH, will they just screw up the Earth again? Don't get me wrong, it was OKAY, but compared to Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, or Monster's Inc, it doesn't stand up...<br/><br/>6 out of 10"
"FantasyDealer","10","3","7","13 December 2008"," A phenomenal achievement
","What draws us to a magical creature such as wall-e is anyone's guess. It could be his natural, care-free yet innocent nature that he displays unwittingly.<br/><br/>I originally saw this film in the cinema as I was told by countless people to go and watch this particular masterpiece. I would nod and go 'alright', being a little unsure, particularly as this came out around the same time as The Dark Knight, much to its bad luck. However, I eventually dragged myself to watch the film and came out feeling somewhat overwhelmed.<br/><br/>Whilst not complicated in it's plot, the film delivers something not many films achieve. Sincerity. Everything that was displayed on screen was there for a reason and pure and simple made it to be 'Art'.<br/><br/>Pixar have once again created a creature that can relate and every single age can sympathise with. A beautiful display of love that seemed real and I believed every moment and every emotion they showed him to display. Even with Wall-E searching the rubbish near the start, it hints and makes you realise how lonely one would be in this environment and yet shows what everyone takes for granted somewhat. He is happy with his place which is all disrupted later in the film.<br/><br/>A true masterpiece which will be sadly overlooked furthering the point of a wonderful year for film. Congratulations Pixar, you get my props fully."

","Earth. 700 years in the desolate future. A small robot that looks like E.T. blissfully rolls along on little tank treads, compacting trash into cubes that he builds into towering trash skyscrapers. He is a Waste Allocation Load Lifter, Earth class  WALL-E.<br/><br/>Humankind has abandoned the ravaged Earth, leaving only their refuse behind, which stretches into orbit like filthy facsimiles of Saturn's rings; a dystopian, disturbing, Terry Gilliam-like vision, tempered by a smarmy CEO (Fred Willard, the first live human integrated into Pixar animation) entreating us with space as the final frontier, in holograms re-playing to dead cityscapes.<br/><br/>WALL-E is the last of his kind - broken-down WALL-E's litter the blighted garbage-land. Unmindful of the dead planet, he plies his trade in simple joy. On his time off, he fills a cooler with artifacts, retiring to a derelict trailer each night (with a free-roaming pet cockroach) where he files everything, while watching HELLO DOLLY on VHS and yearning for tactile contact.<br/><br/>Pixar Studios have slammed another one right outa the park! Written and directed by Andrew Stanton (FINDING NEMO, 2003), WALL-E is one of the few *original* movies this season (not a sequel or remake or derived from a TV show). How does Pixar craft these ingenious, inventive nuggets (where each viewing reveals new discoveries)? Their movies and characters are imbued with so much energy and verve, authenticity hits our nerves in all the right g-spots. A combination of effective storyline, unbridled 3D animation and cuteness so contagious it'll burn your breakfast.<br/><br/>One day a thunderous spaceship leaves behind a sleek, pill-shaped ""female"" robot named EVE (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator), with a lethal power-blast right hook. Her mission: to find Life on Earth. (Waiter, there's a little iron in my irony.) WALL-E immediately falls in love.<br/><br/>So begins a wondrous, accidental journey for WALL-E and EVE, back to the AXIOM, the spaceship housing all Humankind. By bringing back a lone plant, EVE signals Humankind may safely walk the Earth again. But there is a slight problem: over seven centuries, Humankind have become hover-chair blobs, insensate slaves to Big Brother holo-screens in front of their triple-chinned faces  Humankind can't think anymore, let alone WALK, their bones having deteriorated.<br/><br/>Again, the horror of this totalitarian society might have slapped us in the BRAZIL bone was it not for the Pixar team injecting robot buffoonery at every pixel.<br/><br/>EVE's plant becomes the symbol for freedom and sparks a power struggle between the ship's evil computer (voiced by Sigourney Weaver), who wants to destroy the green and continue cruising amongst the black, and the AXIOM Captain (a more cognizant blob than the passengers, voiced by Jeff Garlin), who is aided by WALL-E and EVE in potting the plant to drive the ship Earthward.<br/><br/>And this is why Republicans are outraged! As juvenile and unbelievable as it sounds, the duplicitous, traitorous, treasonous swine of the Republican Klan of George W. Bush's Amerika vilify WALL-E for its ""message."" And what ""message"" are they protesting?...<br/><br/>The ship's Manual instructs a return to Earth when organic life is found, yet the ship's evil computer has been instructed by Fred Willard to ""Stay the Course"" (Willard's exact words!) instead of ever returning to Earth if ""conditions on the ground change."" Sound familiar? Exactly! Though there is *no intent* to analogize Iraq and George W. McCain, the plot line accidentally highlights how unutterably asinine the McBush-Cheney administration's foreign policies are.<br/><br/>Only the insane are offended by the insanity of the ship's computer, who *Stays The Course* supposedly for the good of Humankind, while keeping Humankind blind to the actual good it can bring upon itself.<br/><br/>Trust the Repubs to focus on this paradox of their own laughable design, while the movie gets away with so many other anomalies: from anthropomorphism, to the ship's ""gravity"" which causes it to ""tilt"" when the computer twists the steering wheel; and the decision to go deep space, when two stable Lagrange Points exist on Earth's orbit where a ship could perch without any fuel expenditure at all, and could make the short trip back to Earth without having to traverse billions of miles through theoretical hyperspace and wormholes.<br/><br/>Of course, I only mention these anomalies because I am a stickler for educative fiction. If WALL-E caused even one Republican's refried brain to reconsider their satanic party's non-ethics, I say: <br/><br/>""Thank you very much, Mr. Robot!"""
"doctorsmoothlove","10","3","7","13 July 2008"," Silent Masterpiece
","What would it be like to be the last person on Earth? Fortunately, no one knows, but many filmmakers have attempted to answer this ephemeral question. As recently as last year, another film with this premise I am Legend was released, but the film played as a traditional save-the-world video game-style movie with minuscule intellectual appeal. It didn't answer any questions about what living in solitude is like, despite its more mature content. Pixar, however, has created Wall-E to satiate our boundless post-apocalyptic questions while still containing the action sequences of I am Legend. It's an adventurous work for Pixar, as the studio has not released a science fiction film or a film with mute (or mostly mute) protagonists. Fortunately for Pixar, their effort has created a beautiful film that is more adult-oriented than their previous eight works.<br/><br/>The film opens with bird's eye low-angle shots of a dystopian Earth. Everything is abandoned and no humans are visible. As the camera moves closer to the surface, the remnants of urban life are shown. Skyscrapers abound, but are they really skyscrapers? Upon closer inspection, we see that they are just cubes of garbage stacked on top of each other. Then we see WALL-E, the engineer of the garbage towers. It (or rather he) is a trash-compacting robot and is the only sentient creature on the planet. He spends his days processing trash and returns to a makeshift home each night with trinkets he finds. He is particularly fond of a cassette tape of Hello Dolly! that he watches every night. One day another robot comes to Earth via a huge spacecraft and Wall-E tries to bond with her (the gender identity of the robot is obvious). He brings her to his home and learns that her name is EVE (no points for deciphering that reference). WALL-E shows her a plant which he has found and she deactivates. Wall-E humorously tries to impress his now deactivated charge in Hello Dolly! style but doesn't have much luck.<br/><br/>Wall-E's new companion is kidnapped by her old spacecraft and he follows her. What he discovers is a floating ""cruise ship"" of human life. Overweight and pampered creations devoid of any human qualities fill the spaceship which floats endlessly through space. These people sit all day in a mobile armchair and are fed by robots. Even the children enjoy this lifestyle (which makes me wonder how they even exist). None of the people are even bothered to learn the names of those around them. However, one person does resemble what we would call a human being. He is Captain B. McCrea (please draw no illusions of grandeur). The captain receives EVE and is flabbergasted to discover that she has returned with vegetation. This means that the Earth is now habitable for humanity (and apparently WALL-E's pet cockroach isn't indicative but who wants to live like a roach).<br/><br/>But The autopilot feature of the spacecraft doesn't think that humans should ever return to Earth and retaliates against the Captain, EVE, and a clueless but infatuated WALL-E but its efforts are thwarted. WALL-E and EVE settle with the humans on the Earth and Disney's formulaic ending follows.<br/><br/>Now, I've lead you to think that I won't recommend the film. This is homage to my cynicism rather than a deliberate attempt to fool you (I promise). My actual opinion is the opposite this sarcasm. WALL-E is a wonderful film. Not only is it a touching romance but also a good science fiction film. Ironically, for a Pixar film WALL-E is surprising dark but not just in its story but also its visuals. On Earth the colors are muted and different variations of brown. Where are the vibrant colors of Cars, Toy Story, or Monster's Inc.? They never appear. They provide an implicit sadness. While the people may return, the movie doesn't insure that this means their past won't reoccur which is presented in the endless drab colors.<br/><br/>While the colors are unusual from Pixar, the tone is strange as well. WALL-E is the most cynical of all of Pixar's full-length works. Humanity has fled the Earth because it has devastated the landscape to the point where vegetation cannot grow. The film also offers a strong critique of consumerism. A single company (Buy n Large) is prominently displayed everywhere that WALL-E collects trash. The same company also designed the spacecraft where humanity currently resides. Additionally the people aboard the spacecraft (Axiom) make no efforts to improve their waste-elimination tactics. They just drop off trash into space. So what happens when they return to an already-decimated Earth? The film doesn't present an ending beyond the return to Earth but I challenge you to write the screenplay for the movie's sequel (which I hope is currently located in one of the trash cubes our protagonist has manufactured).<br/><br/>Humanity itself is subject to intense critique not just in the ways I have described. The CGI people appear poorly rendered compared to WALL-E and EVE. They have a synthetic look, as if director Andrew Stanton wanted them to appear artificial. WALL-E, EVE, and the other robots look strikingly realistic. Furthermore, the humans not only lack polished appearance, but their emotions lack distinguishing qualities. No passion compels them to do anything. People do not speak to each other directly but via on screen video displays. This contrasts with WALL-E and EVE quite nicely. WALL-E is attached to EVE, maybe he loves her or maybe he seeks conscious companionship, it doesn't matter really. He innocently follows her wherever she goes as a child would his crush and his inability to speak further validates his commitment to her. EVE responds nonchalantly to his interest but warms up to him in the end. In WALL-E, the robots are more ""alive"" than the human beings to the point where we see the humans as the automatons and the robots as the characters worthy of our sympathy.<br/><br/>Final Consensus: **** out of ****"

It does so on a level that impacts both the adults and the children in the audience. It's an admirable and responsible effort to steer young and impressionable minds onto a decent track. Bravo Pixar.

"ptb4life","10","3","7","5 July 2008"," Pixar made an amazing movie? Shocker!
","Wall E<br/><br/>No movie of 2008 has had me more excited than Wall E. In my experience, that's usually not a good thing. My favorite movie of all time (ROTK) also had me more excited than anything else ever....and I left the theater the first time kind of bummed out. That's the problem when you obsess about something...you build it up in your head to the point that no matter how great the real thing is, it's just not going to match your expectations. So after seeing Wall E once, I decided not to review until I could see it again. I am quite pleased to say that like ROTK, Wall E is far better the second time and is certainly in the running for Best Movie of 2008 (which as of now includes The Orphanage and Iron Man). Let's go over my main problems with the movie the first time I saw it: 1) I felt like I had already seen the first 25 minutes or so from the trailers. 2) I felt it was a little jarring to have real humans in the movie and then for them to show the cartoony baby-like humans of 2800 (estimate). 3) I thought the actual ending could have packed a bigger emotional punch.<br/><br/>Now let's go over why I no longer feel (or feel less) this way. 1) It doesn't matter, from the opening shot, til Wall-E reaches the ship is 100% classic. So what if it's in the trailers...it's also in the movie and I will be watching it again and again for years to come. 2) I still wish they hadn't gone this route. Since I expected it the second time, it wasn't as bad...but I still feel it's slightly out of place. 3) I loved the ending the second time. It turned me into jell-o. (also, this time I didn't have a ready to explode bladder).<br/><br/>At its core, Wall-E is the story of a lonely robot who becomes obsessed with something he has never experienced. When Eve lands on Earth, he realizes what that is....and he refuses to give up on it. If you can understand that, I think you'll love the movie. Of course it helps that Wall-E is one of the most likable characters in recent memory (and Eve's no slouch either). When the 2 of them are together, I don't know, it's just magical. One of my favorite parts of the movie (or any movie this year for that matter) is the outerspace scene with them dancing/flying. It's just beautifully realized. For those of you who haven't seen the movie yet, I won't go into any more details, but I hope that like me, you'll love them. Then there's the human's side story. Yeah, it's a little ""An Inconvenient Truth"" in its message, but it's still a good message. I like that the humans decide to finally take responsibility for their actions. There's a scene with the captain that I missed the first time...but it's when he realizes what he needs to do...I really liked it and it felt right. I also like how it's all because of Wall E, and how this little robot in love unknowingly affects the entire human race. The human plot is good, but it's not great or amazing. Wall-E and Eve...they are perfect. Every time they switched to the humans, I wasn't bored...but I was hoping to see more of my robots! As of now, I think The Incredibles is still my #1 Pixar movie ever....Wall-E is a close 2nd or 3rd (which is saying A LOT). Of course, that ranking could change with time.<br/><br/>A+/A"
"russelsstfan","8","3","7","30 June 2008"," Beautiful and fun love story
","This was a great movie, in short. It's the story of the struggle for life on Earth and one lonely robot. The animation was wonderful. I felt more for Wall-E than I've felt for a lot of the human characters I've seen in movies recently. I love how this movie speaks to the necessity for every entity to get off auto-pilot and really interact with others. The way that Wall-E simply wanted to hold Eve's hand was incredibly touching (and made me and my bf all mushy through the whole movie:). I've read a few reviews stating it's liberal propaganda, which I disagree with. It's not really propaganda if it's true: we are destroying our environment, we are becoming lazy fat-so's, and we do rely far to heavily on computers. One negative is it really is a bit too long, and thus I wouldn't recommend this movie to small children. Better to wait until it comes out on DVD and you can pause it for the kiddies."

","Maybe just maybe other Major Motion Picture Studios should take a look at the Pixar format of Movie Making. They take their time, develop a story with meaning, humor and create a captive audience.<br/><br/>I have noticed that a Huge majority of the IMDb users are providing very positive feedback. Critics, believe it or not, are also giving it high marks. Finally! Now, granted it isn't a heavy dialog movie...come on it's about robots. Thank you Pixar for making the robots with realistic programing. What is lacked in dialog is made up for in expressions, sounds and character interactions.<br/><br/>As an adult, I really enjoyed the film. There were several scenes that made me smile and laugh. The slightly extreme idea of what could potentially happen to Earth, how lazy, pampered and materialistic people can be is exaggerated in a way that kids can totally see that these traits are favorable. I think they get it, in their own way. The 6 or 7 kids that were sitting in front of me were completely sucked into the film.<br/><br/>I can't wait to see what Pixar comes up with next!!"
"tim-2342","10","3","7","27 June 2008"," What a movie should be...
","I've rarely been impacted by a movie as much as Wall-E -- and considering that there's much less dialog in it than other movies I think it's a great credit to the people at Pixar. I felt a lot more for the little robotic guy than I ever have for Nicholas Cage or Liv Tyler, both of whom are supposedly human.<br/><br/>Seriously this is an excellent movie -- it has all the elements that make good movies so enjoyable, and it also causes us to stop and think about what we're doing to our planet. With the constant pointless drivel that Hollywood keeps pumping out these days it's nice to see something that's not only halfway decent, but really top notch.<br/><br/>I saw this one in the theater, on opening night, and it was one of the few times I've seen the majority of the audience applaud the film and then proceed to stay until the very end of the credits.<br/><br/>Worth paying for."

","This movie blew me away. It is the best film made in the 21st century, and should be required viewing for earthlings of all ages. As an environmental film, it far surpasses ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" and the homage to ""2001 Space Odyssey"" is subtle and moving. And the music, glorious music! I will never look at ""Hello, Dolly"" in quite the same way again. I will never look at a plant quite the same way again. I will never look at material possessions and junk food quite the same way again, as well. WALL-E is a parable disguised as a children's film. But its message is literally universal and earth-shaking. I just saw it this afternoon, but already it has changed my life."

","I had high expectations for this movie when I walked into the theater, and all expectations were met beautifully. I am not exaggerating when I say that, in my opinion, Wall-E is the greatest movie John Lasseter & Co. have made, and this is coming from a guy who grew up on Pixar movies (The first movie saw was A Bug's Life) and has seen every movie Pixar has made yet. The graphics were breathtaking, the plot brilliant & original & the characters very well thought out. The movie kept me fixed at the edge of my seat & all of my emotions expressed (not loudly, though). The film gets a bonus star for the homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey (Autopilot)."
"b1lskirnir","9","3","7","26 June 2008"," One of the best animated films in recent years
","For adults and children alike, WALL-E is an absolute necessity. This is proof that Pixar is not losing their touch and still has the ability to make a beautifully animated, sweet, fun, socially relevant, and laugh-out-loud funny piece of visual storytelling.<br/><br/>The story revolves around a small robot, a showtunes-obsessed and sentimental WALL-E unit, designed to clean up and organize the trash on the completely lifeless planet Earth hundreds of years in the future. His curiosity for life in the past leads him to discovering a lone plant specimen under a pile of trash. Soon enough, a robot unit from the stars falls to Earth to research and retrieve it and WALL-E finds himself partaking in a strange, intergalactic adventure that determines the future of planet Earth and mankind.<br/><br/>All of the digital characters are immediately lovable, actually the robots more than their human counterparts (adding to the insightful but not condescending social commentary about a possible future for the human race) and there isn't a moment wasted on any of their screen time. The Pixar team has an unmistakably spot-on eye for great detail, humor, and just downright cuteness in virtually every scene. There's something for everyone: comedy, drama, action, science fiction, even romance. I'm a big fan of animation and cinema from all over the world and I sincerely think WALL-E stands out as possibly the best film of the year thus far. It's definitely a must-see."

","Storytelling matters. This movie sets up a great tale (the first half hour is good), then seriously fails to deliver. The animation and the story get very, very boring once the movie leaves earth.<br/><br/>The large sections with no dialogue were a nice change of pace. But when the dialogue did come, a lot of it was WALL-E and EVE whining each others names over and over...and over...and over...as a way to move the plot along, I almost went out of my mind. EVE was especially annoying to listen to.<br/><br/>The endless shots of robots holding hands, robots figuring out how to hold hands, robots yearning to hold hands and robots thinking about the next time they could think about holding hands were EXCRUCIATING. Some people think this is a movie about the perils of gluttony and mega-corporations. I think it might be a movie about how it's nice to hold hands.<br/><br/>And I've got to say, having WALL*E find the green, healthy plant seedling growing inside a closed abandoned refrigerator is just stupid. Because you know, there's, like, no light in there. And don't give me ""suspension of disbelief."" That's for when a hard-to-believe plot point actually serves to advance the story. He has an entire abandoned city in which to find a single plant growing, 700 years in the future, and they have him find it inside an old dark refrigerator. There was no reason for it.<br/><br/>I'm puzzled by the raves saying this is Pixar's best film. Pixar's best-looking? Probably. Pixar's best? Not by a long shot."

So parents, beware - foul language alert.<br/><br/>Apart from that, I found the movie boring, even the kid next to us developed ADD while watching it, and kept asking his parents if it was over yet. Typical amazing Pixar CGI animation, but lack of a real story or plot, and no real affection for an emotionless main character, and repetitive gags didn't help either.

"ryanlammi","7","9","32","1 July 2008"," Am I the only one who didn't like this movie?
","So as I am skimming through the comments, I notice that there is not a single person who voted for the movie and gave it less than an eight on the first four pages. Does Disney really have people that hooked? I cannot see how this movie was appealing to anyone. I saw the movie the day before it came out and was very excited because I have always been a fan of Pixar movies and I went into this one with optimism...but I was terribly disappointed.<br/><br/>The first thirty minutes of the movie contain three words...""WALL-E"", ""EVE"", and ""Directive"". First of all, a little kid is not going to know the meaning of directive. And after about twenty minutes of nothing but the noise of WALL-E moving, the kids are going to fall asleep... Four of the eight adults in my theater fell asleep before they even left Earth.<br/><br/>I appreciate what the people at Pixar were trying to do (which is why I gave the movie a 2 out of 10 instead of a 1) with the lack of dialogue and everything, but the voices of the robots were excruciating to listen to for over 90 minutes. This is definitely not a movie to keep the kids entertained. It seems as though Pixar was simply trying to test the limits and see how far they could go and still receive immaculate reviews. This movie is the reason Pixar is the leader in children's movies, because no matter how bad of a movie they make, people find a way to forgive them and convince themselves the movie was good.<br/><br/>Some of the social commentary in the movie was decent, but it was nothing new and exciting. The world is getting lazy and everyone knows it; the social commentary was nothing groundbreaking so I don't believe that that can be a reason for liking the movie either. In my opinion this movie does not deserve to make the millions of dollars it is going to. Put Pixar on a poster and people with worship the movie regardless... If you don't agree with me, fine, but I thought there needed to be some voice for the people who do not kiss the ground Pixar walks on."

","There is no doubt about the fact that all these movies are absolutely right. All these movies about machine intelligence and how they'll rule the world. Though, its not like machines will become more human. Instead, each and every day, I can see more and more people losing intelligence and becoming more and more like bots. From the rating of this movie on IMDb, it's clear that we, pure Humans, are already in minority.<br/><br/>I, in fact, don't watch television. So unlike other folks, I had no idea, anticipation or excitement for this movie. I'm thankful for that because I would have been even more disappointed. I went to a corporate screening as my friend had an extra pass. I just knew that it was a Pixar movie and that was all I needed to know. Not anymore.<br/><br/>The movie starts and it definitely generates curiosity. I like environmental and political sarcasms as long as they are funny. All that premise about the huge junkyard and skySCRAPers was good. Then I see a robot crushing garbage. I was still holding up. Then I realize that this robot has a pet cockroach.<br/><br/>I could not believe it! Poof! All my hopes for a good movie went for a toss. We are not in 60s anymore! Don't give me a robot with emotions. Not in the first scene. Maybe a tear drop from an android's eye in the end. But not in the first scene.<br/><br/>For the rest of the movie, I was barely awake and looked at my watch more than the screen. In the intermission, I could hear orgasmic voices of all the software engineers around me, praising the animation and you know...stuff. My friend gave me that smile which says - ""Awww, Its OK. Don't embarrass me with your thanks. But I just gave you the best ever movie experience, didn't I?"" With wide-open eyes, I kept looking at all the happy faces around me, gleaming about the animation and you know....stuff.<br/><br/>The movie is good for playing it on HD plasma screens, without sound, at a store. But who the gives a flying rat's whatever about the animation, if the movie is boring, slow, devoid of human emotions and full of machine emotions? I hate robot voices and I'm being very honest here - I couldn't get the name of the other robot correctly. So I had no clue which robot is supposed to be the...ahem...you know...male.

"gspencley","3","6","19","14 November 2008"," Extremely Disappointing Coming From Pixar
","I have absolutely adored every single Pixar movie to date. The Incredibles and Cars were extraordinarily entertaining to me and perhaps two of my favourite movies of all time. Consequently I was really looking forward to seeing this film. Unfortunately I was also extremely disappointed.<br/><br/>The movie left me curious as to IMDBs rating and I'm even more disappointed that I'm such as odds with IMDb. Usually my opinion of films are pretty consistent with the IMDb crowd.<br/><br/>So why didn't I like this film ? For starters, virtually every single scene had something extremely hard to swallow. First there's the plot. Humans fill the planet so full of garbage that we not only relocate to giant space ships but we send them way outside of our solar system. Not only that but we become so fat that we literally can't do anything, including stand up and walk. Yet for 700 years we somehow manage to reproduce and maintain the technology that keeps us alive. <br/><br/>The main character is, obviously, Wall-E. A trash compactor that somehow has the full range of human emotion (fear, embarrassment, physical attachment etc.) yet he can't speak coherent English. Wall-E falls in love with EVA. EVA also develops feelings for Wall-E yet also can't say anything but ""Wall-E"" and ""Directive"". <br/><br/>The two characters communicate only by reciting each other's names over and over again (which becomes very annoying after a while) and the movie is very light on dialogue. I didn't have a problem with the lack of dialogue (in fact I consider mime to be one of the most challenging forms of acting since we communicate via body language far more than verbally. If executed properly a character that never speaks can be far more powerful than one that does) but I did feel that the movie was extremely slow to develop and actually felt longer than it really was.<br/><br/>There were a few ""cute"" scenes where the various robot characters would get into trouble and I did let out the occasional chuckle but after a while I was dying to see some kind of story develop. I will admit that the last 1/3 delivered a bit of relief in the story section but it was too little too late (I won't spoil the ending).<br/><br/>Animation-wise the movie is a hit. Technically-speaking it is a visually-stunning piece. However, in my opinion story always comes first.<br/><br/>I gave the movie a 3/10 for the animation. The story was extremely weak and was basically a love story with an environmental message. I have a feeling that most people loved this movie because love stories and ""cute things"" are always a hit (Wall-E was very cute and the movie was definitely a love story). The movie also came across as an attempt at an artistic piece and I think that hit home with some people. I can get into art films but if I judge Wall-E as an art piece it fails on every level except the aesthetics. It didn't challenge conventional thinking. It didn't offer an original story. It took the environmental message to the farthest extremes possible and the main characters were very hard to like."

Waste of my time and money. I left after the 1st 1/2 of the movie so I have no idea what happens during the 2nd 1/2. Others may enjoy this, but I could not take the boredom. There were some good previews (Madagascar 2, Journey to the center of the earth).

KFP has better humor, storyline, acting (better actors gave more feeling in citing their lines). Better graphics by Pixar but that doesn't make rating the film a ten. There are some awe inspiring space scenes for about five minutes of the film.

","""Wall-E"" is a movie about a kooky little robot. Due to problems on earth related to waste, all the humans are evacuated and put onto ships to escape until life on earth is safe (I actually missed the first five minutes as I was making popcorn but this is what I was told). Wall-E's job is to compile and clean up all the waste and ends up becoming the last thing left on earth (besides a cockroach).<br/><br/>One day a weird robot is dropped onto Earth and seems very hostile towards Wall-E. We soon learn this robot called EVE is on a mission to find life forms. After 700 years of these robots being sent to earth without success, EVE eventually finds a plant situated in Wall-E's little container. She grabs it and is collected to return to the mother ship. The leader on the ship is stunned at EVE's success as this means a return to earth is possible- but not all seem to want to go home. Will the crew onboard, who have all got fat and lazy return to earth or will they live as they have been happily? Totally not what i expected from the movie. Not really a kids movie I would have thought as the message is too complex and it's excruciatingly slow at times. Strangely it ranked at No. #37 on IMDb's Top 250 movies of all time. I read the most rated review and came across this, which troubled me.....<br/><br/>WALL-E is such a lovable character. I've never felt so much emotion for one character. He will definitely go down in history as iconic as Darth Vader, or Indiana Jones. I was so close to crying at pivotal parts in the film, and although I didn't fully break out and cry, I have never felt so much emotion in my heart with any other film as I did with this one.<br/><br/>Ah, that person needs to get out to better movies. The animation is great, but the film was hard work for the viewer."
"Deveousdevil","5","4","11","10 January 2009"," Pretty insignificant
","I don't know why everyone says this movie is ""magical"" or a ""new plateau in animation"". It's not true. The movie is about an hour and 40 minutes long and doesn't get to the actual story until about the first 40 minutes. The story isn't anything incredible. The movie isn't very funny and overall I was bored after the first 10 minutes. I'm sixteen and love most animations such as The Incredibles, Over the Hedge, Shrek etc. Any of those movies deserve to be in IMDb's top way more than Wall-E. Sure the graphics in the movies are nice and highly textured and all, but there's more to animation than just looks, and Wall-E doesn't deliver. I've watched the other movies I've listed many times and always enjoy them, Wall-E was hard to enjoy the first time.<br/><br/>It is very boring and not very entertaining. Wall-E may be cute but the overall movie is pretty bad. If you can watch it for free sure, give it a shot. Otherwise it's a waste of time and money."
"supertimm","6","2","4","9 November 2014"," inconsistent animation vision
","This is a different type of review. For those of us who enjoy the art, itself, as much as the overall movie. When WallE starts out, there is a certain type of animation - you know you're in an animation, but there is a lot of work that went into it - there is lots of detail, it is truly a pleasure to watch. But the other part of the movie, that takes place on the spaceship, is as if it was done by a completely different animation team, as if you were suddenly catapulted into The Incredibles in terms of picture style. They are two very different, very incompatible styles of cartoon. One for those who care for the aesthetics, another for children's animations. From a visual standpoint, it is a major fail. Whoever oversaw this, shame on you."
"Prismark10","6","2","4","12 August 2014"," Eve of love
","Wall-E starts off unusually enough with little dialogue but show tunes from a Barbara Streisand film. A lone garbage compacting robot in a desolate, waste ridden earth of the future until one day a ship lands and unleashes a female robot, Eve who leaves him smitten. In fact the film makes it plain repeatedly that Wall-E is in love.<br/><br/>There is another story of a ship on a centuries old journey where the humans have evolved to be obese and rather lazy. These are the descendants of the people who escaped from the rubbish strewn planet, the ship has a nominal captain but most of the real work is done by a computer.<br/><br/>The film although coming in from another angle of a robot wanting, even needing affection and finding it which leads him to a journey in space then falls for some dependable Disney/Pixar plot points. There has to be a villain with a hidden agenda, there will be some pulsating but humorous chase scenes.<br/><br/>Also if the humans spend all their time on those hover chairs drinking fizzy drink all day, who was the person having the time to have babies because we get the impression that these people were too busy or empty to have personal relationships.<br/><br/>The animation is of a very high standard but the start might be deemed to be slow and the film looks flawed if you examine it too carefully. Also the film ends up paying a homage to 2001:A space odyssey."

"kylehodgdon","8","2","4","11 November 2009"," Wonderfully Simple
","Thinking back on all the Pixar movies I've seen I don't think there is one I enjoyed more than WALL-E. I think that it is a great triumph in this day in age to create an animated (not just) kids movie where the two main characters do not speak. A large majority of this film is more like a symphony that a modern film. <br/><br/>The creators of WALL-E and EVE did a fantastic job of giving each character a face and a personality with what they had to work with. It really shows how actions speak louder than words. Sure WALL-E could say ""I love you"" to EVE, but instead he tries to show her his plant, the thing that he finds to be the most fascinating and beautiful in all the world. <br/><br/>Another nifty thing about this film is that it really tries to send a message. Beyond the messages of ""love is good"" and ""be kind"" which most every Disney movie conveys, WALL-E also sends the message that you should not trash the planet and turn into fat slobs. And I commend the way that it pulls no punches in doing so. It comes right out, slaps you in the face and says ""stop being lazy and take care of your planet."" <br/><br/>This movie is the best Pixar has to offer and one everyone should watch."
"AishFan","8","2","4","23 October 2009"," Beautiful film
","Wall-e is a magnificent film that, through a comical, playful, and non-preaching tone, well communicates and illustrates how we humans are making the earth uninhabitable. Global warming, pollution, and high toxicity levels have forced all of mankind to exode to a space-station to continue civilization and our species. Ironically, it is through the people's desire/curiosity to return our home planet that the audience begins to learn and appreciate the value of our Mother Earth. Centuries may have passed, but the ever-present human qualities of sloth, greed, and corruption are just as evident on the space-station. It is very interesting to see how the soulless robots Wall-e and Eva rekindle the spirit of life."
"jhunt709","10","2","4","16 September 2009"," Wall-E(pic)
","Over the years, Pixar have brought us some truly amazing films, all of high quality in terms of technology and entertainment. Wall-E, their 2008 feature, is arguably the first of those to undoubtedly certify their ability to create a movie to provide for adults as equally as, if not more than, for children. Youngsters will love the flashy robotic sequences and aesthetics, but Wall-E is wonderfully complex enough to give it the most intriguing plot Pixar have ever shared with us.<br/><br/>In a futuristic setting, Wall-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class) is the last robot of his kind to still be performing his duty, that is to clean up the widespread waste left behind by a human race who made an exodus from the planet some time ago. On board enormous spaceships, humans take up temporary residence under the care of purpose-specific robots catering to their every need until the world becomes inhabitable again. One of these spaceships, the Axiom, has the task of sending electronic probes to Earth to search for signs of vegetation. It is when one of these probes, EVE (Extra-Terrestrial Vegetation Evaluator) finds a small plant recovered by the still active Wall-E that the two robots become involved in events that will shape the future of humanity.<br/><br/>The picture's primary strength, in my opinion, is the presence of political themes such as the environment and obesity that are apparent throughout the film only to the point of being suggestive rather than blatant; the viewer can choose to acknowledge or ignore these themes without their decision having a detrimental effect on their viewing experience, and if the audience were to not even notice these plot points, that wouldn't mean the film would be lost on them either. The depiction of Earth, for example, as a wasteland which still closely resembles our own world as it is now, keeps the story relevant without commanding the viewer to make sure they recycle everything they ever throw away. Also notable is the distinct lack of dialogue in Wall-E; the first act in particular sees the title character and EVE communicate through body language and a limited vocabulary, a bold step for the studio, though well executed despite the inevitable risks that come with making art decisions such as these in films hoping to draw a family audience. Children will have plenty to enjoy despite the scarcity of speech - Wall-E himself is a humorous show stealer sure to make them (and you) laugh.<br/><br/>Pixar chose two main settings for this film; a piece of land on Earth strewn with the leftovers of human civilization where Wall-E resides and the spaceship where EVE is taken after her mission is completed. Here, Wall-E must unite with EVE and the captain to ensure a return to Earth isn't prevented by the scheming auto-pilot system. The difference between the two settings invites comparison between the first and second act, though thankfully Pixar didn't get carried away with robots and technology and made both parts equally interesting and entertaining, something I wouldn't consider easy when the contrast is so clear between the two.<br/><br/>Touching again on the plot, not only have Pixar presented us with an epic story that spans Earth and beyond, but they have also somehow managed to weave in a love story to rival that of any other romance or drama you may have seen. This story arc plays well into the main plot and also conveys itself like a human relationship, which is a true credit to Pixar's characterisation of Wall-E and EVE. Wall-E is that unlucky in love hopeless romantic chasing the girl who's out of his league, except in robot form the clichés are negated and the conclusion is unpredictable. Wall-E has developed a personality during his time alone on Earth, leaving him with an interest in collecting trinkets he finds in his day-to-day rubbish sweep. In a similar manner, EVE makes a steady transition from a directive-driven device to a robot with a soul of her own. It is this character development that makes this love story very touching; weepers beware.<br/><br/>From a technological viewpoint the film is visually breathtaking, but surely you expected no less of Pixar by now? Whether you believe them to be the leading animators in cinema or not, they are still deservedly retaining that title with each new release.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Wall-E is a beautifully animated film with an epic story of romance, adventure and action - don't let its target audience fool you into thinking that it's not a true piece of cinematic art.<br/><br/>10/10"
"tburke85","9","2","4","20 June 2009"," Wall E A Much Better Than Expected Pixar Movie
","Wall E was a much better than expected pixar movie writer/director Andrew Stanton who has done a great job in making this movie about a lonely robot left on Earth to clean up the waste left by humans in the distant future. The cast of relatively unknowns proving their voices for the character except for Sigourney Weaver are excellent. At the heart of this film is a love story between Wall-E and a more advanced robot named Eve. The writers did a great job of fleshing out the character of Wall-E whose in it for the majority of the movie. You care about the lonely robot because all he wants more than anything is a friend. This movie has a little something in it for everyone humor, some action, drama, character development, and a touching love story. I was very impressed with this film and I can see why after seeing Wall-E why may critics and audiences mostly kids really liked this one. The film was a little slow in the beginning but the rest made up for it's one flaw. Overall Wall-E has humor, some action, great special effects, romance, and well developed characters you come to care about. So if you're looking for a good movie to watch with your kids. You can go wrong with this one. Much better than expected."

"tolgurudosgrey","9","2","4","13 March 2009"," EXCELLENT! To the full meaning of the word!
","This is one of the most incredible films i saw in the last decade. Art and animation is top level, characters and casting is extraordinary. Beautiful architecture, design, landscape design and exceptional music and sound. Voices and dialogs were a wise choice. This is one of the creations that deserves to be seen in a HD format and i envy those who can see it using HD technology. The story is, for me at least, is not much original, but topic itself had an amazing interpretation. Influence of other films and literature can be seen, which is somewhat expected, but as other influenced, so this film will have a great impact and influence on many future projects, animation or otherwise. Inspiration for the authors probably came from this time and our present and not so impossible or unrealistic future. Which is also one of the disturbing things about this film. At least when Earth is concerned, but space technology as realistic future, not likely. In some ways i am not scared but no one can deny possibilities.<br/><br/>I expect other to follow an examples given in this film, we can learn a lot from this. Not just in a field of film-making but also new ways of interpretation of technology and future world. I can see some projects made from this and used correctly we could have ""something wonderful"". This also can serve as a warning, saying ""watch what you doing"". That is why i say ""used correctly"" when mentioning technology and new concepts.<br/><br/>The new concept of imagination is kicking in. All fresh screenwriters will have inspiration in this for a long time. Animation will rise and i hope to see a lot animation in the future and when animation studios realize what needs to be done, i see a very good future of film entertainment.<br/><br/>It is very difficult, after all, to sum a total experience of this film in one or few words. But, to try, i can. A film that opens a gateway into a new field of dreams and possibilities which can allow us to have really something beautiful or quite a grim image. It is up to us all to draw the best we can from this."
"deadpat92","10","2","4","12 March 2009"," Vastly Important.
","WALL.E at first glance is a simple piece but upon further inspection the depth of its character, quality, and integrity are astounding.<br/><br/>Animaton has always been one the most under recognized genres. And this can be understandable in a time where quality and quantity are lacking in the genre. Besides Pixar and Hatao Miyazaki, there is not much offerings.<br/><br/>WALL.E gets beyond such a problem. It contains quality and quantity of the utmost stature. Not just a children's film but an epic. Spanning galaxies to tell a simple love story. As well as a cautionary tale of the current state of human affairs on our planet.<br/><br/>Earth has become a wasteland. Seemingly, a mild-mannered robot WALL.E is the only remaining creature on the planet besides a companion cockroach. WALL.E goes about doing what he was created to do. What he's been doing for over 200 years. Compacting the massive amounts of garbage which are the apparent cause of the disappearance of life. Humans have fled the planet to live in outer space until earth is suitable for life once again. When a scouting robot named EVE shows up WALL.E falls for her. The story tells how he follows her out of the Earth stratosphere to ends of the universe to get her to notice him.<br/><br/>There has been few films in recent memory of such caliber. WALL.E should be put up against the most memorable powerhouses of cinema for the past decade. Perhaps the best film of 2008 with out question. A must watch not just as a recent film of such a breath taking scope but also as a bench mark in cinema."

","Just days after the 2008 Academy Awards announced the winners, I had to see the best animation feature winner ""Wall-E"" in which all of my young cousins and nieces and their parents have seen this film and commented on it being wonderful making me the outcast of the bunch.<br/><br/>""Wall-E"" takes place in the distant future where Earth has been destroyed due to the lack of care the people never gave into cleaning the trash making it a pile of ruins. All is left on Earth besides empty stores is a pile of junk rubble made into cubicles and set into buildings while a robot named Wall-E tries to make his ""Earth"" the way it was before the human population became extinct. There are no other creatures or animals with the exception of a cockroach that Wall-E considers a companion where the robot uses an abandon ship as his home filled with various toys and devices; the small robot uses an I-pod to watch a musical in which Wall-E tries to emulate the scene.<br/><br/>Later in the film, another robot named EVE enters the absent Earth where Wall-E finds contact of his kind for the first time after years of being isolated that he tries his best to win her heart. Even though their only way of communication is by saying their names to one another along with certain one words, the two robots share a relationship where I had tears and a smile on my face. But what Wall-E doesn't know is that EVE was sent to look for a living organism (a plant) and sent it back to space to show that there is life on Earth. So Wall-E follows EVE to space with their adventure just beginning.<br/><br/>""Wall-E"" is something for everybody. It may be a Pixar movie for kids and Disney fans to watch, but there's more to this film than just a kids movie or a Disney film. The film is everything for sci-fi fans to talk about, those who care for the environment (a later subplot in the film), or yet, those who love watching romantic movies where Wall-E and EVE are the first screen couple that aren't human and yet, I really felt an attraction to them as I cried during their scenes.<br/><br/>It's that good and so wonderful that it should have deserved the best picture nomination."

It is likely that most of the content in this film went far over children's' heads. I know I would have been bored. Not only is there warning and comment made on the well-being of our natural planet, but that of our consumeristic habits, the invasion and dehumanization technology has had on humanity, and the ongoing struggle against ""Big Brother.""

WALL-E is proof yet again, that there is only one true animation champ! <br/><br/>Yes there are other good, funny animated movies, from other studios, but only Pixar has a strong enough story to mix with all the little jokes. Only they can appeal to a young audience and a mature one. Wall-E seems like a strange idea. Something that might not get you emotional involved (the main characters are derived of many facial expressions, due to the fact, that they are robots and are lacking some facial similarity to a human being. Yes there are the eyes, but many other things are absent. Not that you would want to have it any other way. The movie is pretty silent (especially in the first part of the movie), but you still get attached to this robot being.<br/><br/>There are many in-jokes for the mature audience, a message delivered with the right notes and many other funny things, that makes WALL-E one of the best movies.

I used to think that these films can't capture human behavior & emotions simply because there are no blood & flesh characters. But after watching this flick, I am convinced that you can portray universal emotions as elegantly with gestures as with dialogs. At the core of Wall E is this sweet love story between two robots that captivates you right from the word go. Wall E's desperate attempts to impress Eve are hilarious enough. The climax is marked by a heart wrenching battle by Eva to save Wall E. The background score works wonders for the movie & beautifully captures the essence of the scenes. On the whole, its a film that would bring a big smile on your face. I am not sure if it stays with you for a long time but nevertheless a very enjoyable watch.

"y_u_g_0","Null","2","4","23 January 2009"," One of the sweetest pleasures in cinema
","Wall-E<br/><br/>I have mixed feelings about the Pixar-Disney films, on the plus side they can be very creative on some aspects, on the negative they can be terribly bland. Devotees of 'The Lion King' will surely know what I mean. I will confess of having avoided these kiddie flicks on recent years, mostly due to the fact they are, well, kiddie stuff. The film Robots is a clear testament to film-making that centers on laughs, famous names, and drenches itself in morals to try and justify it all. The Incredibles was a success for me, but even Matt Goering needed the help of some 007-style action scenes and Samuel L. Jackson. Wall-E is a winner, and he did it by himself. This feature includes a clever element omitted from most animated films; borrowing themes familiar to those fans of sci-fi literature, such as myself. Reading between the junk-collecting title character's daily routine, and frequently amusing anecdotes; his exploration through space and encounter with a distant human colony - there is satire, and a message about taking care of the world, and of ourselves. However, the film avoids being moral, something that would otherwise have made me cringe. They are instead presented subtly, allowing the focus to be on what Disney movies should be about - adventure. The story begins hundreds of years into the future, where earth has been polluted beyond repair, and the humans have fled into an outer-space, seemly utopian civilization on board a space-craft. But as the humans fled, they had forgotten to switch the off button on one poor robot, WALL-E (It's not really worth mentioning that Wall-E is not a given name, but is a type of robot). And throughout the centuries, where he continues the job he's been programmed to do - squashing rubbish into cubes, and stacking them - the Artificial Intelligent piece of metal had learned to develop feelings, namely, loneliness. Then comes along Eve, a reconnaissance robot sent by the humans - a robot who also develops emotions - and chemistry develops. The main drive for the remainder of the story, is driven by the curiously believable romance between these two machines. Perhaps it is the pet-like traits of these robots, or maybe its just they are so cute. The romantic relationship takes the limelight of the film, whilst it is side-lined in just about every other similar movie. There is a sweetness about these characters who barely shares any dialogue. As an audience, we witness the birth of love, without it having to be explained to us. The journey itself is, also, a cut above most of the recent animations. I was worried that the slow-paced, dialogue-less opening could lose the attention of children, but I for one loved it. Few characters in have won over audiences without dialogue. Eve was then an appropriate counter-part: she is white, new and shiny, whilst he is rusty and breaking apart. He likes to build things out of his junk collection, whilst she does not hesitate to destroy things with a plasma gun. A girl that's way out of your league - ha-ha. But what is touching was that he doesn't give into the fear of being obliterated, and one moment when he tries to approach her whilst shaking all over, was by far our hero's greatest act of courage. The later scenes where he fights evil robots are nothing in comparison. Yes, there was the essential slapstick battle sequence demanded by the little audience members, yet it was not milked - in fact, it was cut short. Perhaps the director was conscious of the dumbing-down consequence that non-serious fight scenes can produce. Nonetheless, the second half is a lot less interesting - partly Hollywood demanding action, and partly Pixar following its usual guidelines. I forgot to mention one thing - Wall-E has a pet cockroach. An interesting touch, isn't it? Even a disease-infested bug can be cute in the Disney-Pixar world. Not the best animated movie ever made, but a noble effort. Its part sci-fi, part family fair, but I received it best as a romance, and so my advice is take your girlfriend. So that's enough hugger-mugger from me, so I'll conclude this with some inspired sentimentality: with everything going on, the future looks to be grim. However, there is only one real thing we really need, love. Love is something that humans can often be too clever, or too sophisticated, or too lazy to remember. But if in this great big universe, one tiny little machine can learn love, perhaps it could teach us, or at least remind us. So, remember love one another - it's not rocket science."

This animation movie runs for a good 100 minutes with the most minimal dialogues and at the end of it keeps you gasping for more.<br/><br/>The movie is about WALL E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class) a robot for waste disposal management and how he is instrumental in the restoration of a derelict earth in the year 2815. The earthlings have long abandoned earth however they forgot to switch off one robot. So our WALL E is the only, lets say, living robot on earth. He goes about doing it mundane activity of waste management, while doing so; he identifies unique objects and collects them. WALL  E powers himself with the solar energy. He knows how to mend himself and has spares available. Meanwhile a robot (EVE) is sent to earth for the search of plant life. WALL  E and EVE meet and for WALL  E its love at first sight. From then on, it's his pursuance for love along with the safekeeping of the plant for humans to come back to mother earth which goes through an engrossing inter galactic journey space fights and robotic clashes.<br/><br/>It's a silent film of sorts with maximum communication done through non speech sounds and visuals. One does not need speech, or the entire face for a personality, only the eyes are enough and this idea is established in the most amazing manner in the movie. WALL  E exhibits a wide gamut of emotions from loneliness, fear, happiness, shy, love, resolve, pain, despair, blush and ecstasy to many more feelings, with only his eyes. The eyes convey a message in every frame that WALL  E is present. Its one robot you will fall in love at first sight.<br/><br/>The movie is commendable for its concept, creativity and execution. There is attention to detail. The animation is very good. The screenplay is awesome. Right from the outset the viewers will relate to what WALL E experiences which are all emoted through his eyes and body language and robotic sound. There is a very intelligent use of the background score and for the space bit; the star trek theme is used. The humour is used subtly in evolving a feeling of hope for earth, even though the concept s apocalyptic in nature. The editing is slick and the pace is well set. All though in some parts one would be reminded of Monsters Inc.<br/><br/>It's a must watch and will be long remembered as one of the best animation movies of all time. It is one of the few instances where, an animation movie is visibly forthright in pushing humane issues. The movie has the spirit of a love story and the panache of a science fiction and is not to be missed. Please book your tickets today.<br/><br/>And BTW  4.5 on 5"

Unfortunately all of us, who migrated into space aboard the spaceship, have become fat and lazy. I like Eve and I think that she is sleek and very modern looking, I cannot blame Wall-e for becoming smitten with her! I also think that it was a good idea to reestablish B'N'L at the spaceship, I also do not mind having my meals brought to my chair. If I where on that spaceship, I would help the captain with the controls, instead of that George the auto pilot. I have got the music CD and the tunes are brilliant. I hope that when they release the DVD, they include the sketch with the magician and the hungry rabbit and the trouble he went through to get his carrot. Yes Pepole, this is how the earth will become in 700 years from now, if we do not do anything to keep our rubbish under control.Even the supermarket where I work will become like the BNL on earth seen at the beginning of this film, if we are not care full enough"

","An absolute masterpiece. It is that simple. Here's a story about a country boy who falls for a city girl, and follows her back to the city. Oh but they're robots. And it's also about sustainable living. It's Chaplin's City Lights, 2001, Early Disney, Silent Running, anything, everything, something completely new. And that is just it. The people at Pixar love stories so much, love cinema so much, you can see they eat and breath it to no end. Andrew Stanton directs a near countless dedicated, passionate crew of artists and crafts people. Every fiber of their beings went into this, you can see it clear as day up on screen. A film so equally sad, thrilling, joyous as this. It's one of the best love stories ever, one of the best adventure stories ever, one of the best cautionary sci-fi stories ever (you get my drift). Like I said of their Ratatouille last year, WALL * E too is the perfect marriage between art and technology. We talk about symbolism and metaphor in a film, but rarely does it live so effortlessly in the very core of the story and the characters, in every ship design, every robot, apparatus, junk item, action, re-action, no action. Not only did I get teary eyed on an emotional level, but as a storyteller myself, I teared up at the sheer ingenious tapestry the film weaved. Like being there first hand, marveling at the technique, the instinct, the gusto, as Da Vinci painted the last supper or Michaelangelo sculpted David. I know that might sound ridiculous to say, but I don't care. It's no use saying anything more, because I'd have to say everything. I'm just ready to rush out and see it again."

","This movie was just so.....I can't even describe it!! I took my little brothers to see it and me being a 14 year old boy thought it would be dumb, but i thought it was just so adorable! the animation was FANTASTIC!! THey had a whole plethora of well thought out characters and i thought the story between Wall-e and EVE was just so beautifully, wonderful! The message about the trash and our impact on the Earth and how dependent we are on technology was so beautifully done, and I actually cried at the end when EVE rebuilt WALL-E and he was all normal and un lifelike. The fact that EVE and Wall-E two ROBOTs were able to feel such emotion for each other and that WALL-E actually and literally went to the edges of the universe just so that he could find and save EVE it just tore me apart on the inside when it looked like wall-e might not make it!If more animated movies were like this i would definitely go see them more often. My little 4 year old brother giggled when he saw WALL-E fly through space with the fire extinguisher, i cried when i saw Wall-E shut down, and we cheered when we saw him reboot!! I really would like to rate this move 1,000,000 out of 10!!! Because i feel that a 10 doesn't do justice to this adorable, mechanical piece of art!"
"imdb-5032","9","2","4","3 August 2008"," Thoroughly enjoyable
","Despite having lead characters made out of metal and shiny plastic, this film has got heart & guts & balls. The visual detail is breathtaking and the animation damn near flawless. Just five minutes into the movie you already feel for WALL-E. No small feat, given that there are no supporting characters, except for a cockroach, and there is no dialogue, no voice-over. Then you realize that not only are you sympathizing with a robot - you are sympathizing with a robot that exists only as bits in a rendering farm. The level of craftsmanship here is amazing.<br/><br/>Trigger happy EVE is one of the strongest female characters in film since Ripley in Alien. Note to film makers: strength is about being being independent. It is not about striking awkward martial arts poses in spandex or form-fitting leather outfits.<br/><br/>It would have been so easy for the movie to portray humans as dumb and callous. But Pixar pulls it off with warmth and feeling. After 700 years on a never-ending cruise to nowhere, humans have grown fat and complacent, but they haven't lost their humanity.<br/><br/>Certainly not for everyone and a bit sappy at times, this is a gorgeous film that shows even robots, nay, render farms can churn out compelling cinema with an emotional core (here's looking at you, George Lucas)."

","WALL-E (2008) <br/><br/>Top 10 - 2008<br/><br/>Top 20 - Animated Films of All Time<br/><br/>Pixar has done it again. After the sensational 'Ratatouille' the newest animation 'WALL-E' is nothing short of a masterpiece.<br/><br/>What I must put forward first is that this is no simple kid's film. It is also an intelligent comedy/drama, an artistically successful cinematic achievement and most importantly a poignant message about our future and the unsustainability of our lives. The opening sequence of the film scans over a desolate, evacuated earth where all human life is absent due to the unsuitability of the Earth's atmosphere to sustain life (in 2700).<br/><br/>I will not go into detail about the storyline, however I must note a few things; WALL-E is probably the cutest and most lovable character that Pixar has created to date. The animation in the film is earth-shattering; in many scenes the difference between animation and reality is minute. The film does pay a small tribute to Stanley Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' another masterpiece ahead of its time that questions the existence and evolution of man.<br/><br/>Nothing more to say except that 'WALL-E' is a masterpiece of modern cinema and a possible candidate for a Best Picture nomination at next year's Oscars.<br/><br/>Superb.<br/><br/>9/10"
"shadowotaga","10","2","4","18 July 2008"," My Favorite Love Story
","Pixar can do no wrong.<br/><br/>It's been more than two weeks since I first saw Wall-E and in that time there is not a day goes by that my mind turns to this brilliant film. There are sequences that are so well done they approach the sublime, especially between the two main robots. Wall-E's journey to hold EVE's hand is one of the most romantic portrayals that I have ever seen.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is a wonderful work of texture by Thomas Newman.<br/><br/>Is there flaws? Yes, every film has them. The humans occasionally feel out of place, both the live actors and CG versions. John Ratzenberger's character had an unnecessary amount of dialog. Though to be honest I think they only look bad because in contrast the robot animation is so spectacular.<br/><br/>The best Pixar film yet, and a Romance that will last to the end of time."
"dtothehammy93","9","2","4","18 July 2008"," Pixar..you've done it again!
","First let me say that I'm not really a person who wants to go to Disney movies when I can see movies like Hancock or Wanted. So...I was really not a fan of going to see WALL*E after my parents forced me to go with them. However, within the first 5 minutes of the movie when WALL*E the robot first appeared on screen, all of my attention was completely focused on him. It was so hard not to feel bad for WALL*E, he had the look of total depression and he was all alone, it was kind of like a dog whimpering. But that all changed after EVE, an alien robot, comes to Earth, and they fall in love.<br/><br/>A thing that I like about some movies is when the plot is complexing and confusing and you need to look for evidence in the beginning of the movie in order for the plot to make sense. This is certainly the case in this movie, with the whole plant plot etc. Another thing that I like about this movie is that the characters are real characters and they all show real feelings. I was crying when WALL*E ""died"" because the audience just took a whole big adventure with him. This is definitely the best family film of the year!!!"

","I wanted to see a cute robot movie by pixar; I'll admit it. I found out that Walle wasn't on an off-world planet like I'd presumed; He was on Earth. By the time He was on the space ship, traveling to outer space, I was already impressed with how advanced the story telling was. With Walle a robot, they didn't have any of the usual animated character - smiling when happy, head down when sad, etc. It worked very well. I loved the movie; I thought it was a little Zen like. Also, the people in the theater with me seemed to like it also; one kid was pumping his fists in the air (probably reenacting something in the movie)<br/><br/>I don't think its right that people have been giving Walle 1 or 2 stars to offset the honest reviewers; the 1 and 2 star reviewers are crazy; they all seem to complain about the contrast between a happy world and world suppressed by garbage.; The 1 and 2 star reviewers seem to think that there's a message there, sent by a liberal person and which was intended for them personally.

","Wall-E is AWESOME!

Wall-E shows her a plant and...well, I'd rather not go any further, so I'll just tell you about random bits.<br/><br/>When Wall-E goes to see the humans on the space station, they are all lazy, fat hedonists, and each generation gets fatter. Robots do all the work, and they all like it till the Captain of the station sees that Earth is a great place, or at least was.<br/><br/>So, sorry I'm not going into detail, but I think you should see it yourself, because it kicks your ass till diarrhea comes out of your private part, in a good way! I guess I'll tell you what I think the moral is: Hedonism is bad. If you don't know what hedonism is, it's thinking that pleasure is the most important thing in life.

"Mik_Cal","9","2","4","13 July 2008"," Wall-E is a very thoughtful animated movie/ Excellent!
","The critical acclaim this movie has received is well-deserved. By now, most of you will be familiar with the story or at least the premise of this animated movie. The movie examines issues of environmental degradation in a way that is seamless with the plot of the movie and entertains some very interesting premises about humanity's future as well as our use of and dependence upon machines. It has many beautiful moments in it both from a visual perspective as well as a dramatic one. <br/><br/>As the quality of craft of this movie is now well known, I think the more interesting question is whether this movie is Pixar's best movie or just one of the best alongside my other favorites, the Incredibles or Ratatouille. Finding Nemo, the director Andrew Stanton's previous effort, was also delightful but more of a kid's movie so did not probe some of the deeper themes. The Toy Story movies were ingenious but also movies for kids. So therefore of the animated movies with somewhat more profound themes or at least with more adult-focused material in them (or whole family material), Wall-E can then be grouped with Ratatouille and Incredibles as thematically ambitious animated features. <br/><br/>Wall-E explores and seamlessly mixes original takes on very serious political and existential questions with its plot. The themes in the Incredibles and in Ratatouille were more idiosyncratic ""what ifs"" that were interesting in their own rights but not burning issues of our time. So Wall-E, in my mind, is probably a superior film because of integration of weighty themes with light storytelling in a very compelling package. I gave it 9 out of 10 stars because I don't want to be ""easy"" but it may well warrant the full 10 stars...I will have to think about it."
"Monotreme02","9","2","4","13 July 2008"," A crowning cinematic achievement
","First off, the animation itself is absolutely stunning. Pixar have perfected the craft of recreating realistic live-action photography in animation. Depth of field, out of focus objects, zooms  the look is spot-on. The animators also employ a wonderful colour palette, with enough variety and richness to keep things colourful and lively but also remaining very much rooted in reality. But really, the animators won me over right off the bat when, looking closely, I noticed tiny specs of dust floating around in the air during the opening scenes set around the garbage skyscrapers. With such a devoted attention to detail to make everything as realistic as possible, it's no surprise that Pixar are the leading studio for computer-animated films.<br/><br/>But the truly incredible feat the film achieves in its animation is character design and animation. Going back to the traditions of Disney, the animators faced a tough challenge, which was giving characters emotion using as little gestures as possible. In this case, our protagonist is a box-shaped robot with treads and binoculars for eyes. But the amount of emotion and character this little box emanates is an astonishing testament to the animators: he's not just a cute-looking little robot, but a cute-looking little robot with a personality. Right from the opening shots of the film we are won over by WALL·E's cuteness and irresistible charm. He brings a little lunchbox with him to work in which he collects all sorts of trinkets and treasures from the endless sea of garbage covering our planet. He treads indifferently past a graveyard of hundreds of long-deactivated WALL·E units  the last of his kind. At home, it's his little pastimes that keep him happy: adding today's lunchbox content to the revolving shelves containing all his treasures, spending time with his little cockroach friend, watching his favourite movie, ""Hello, Dolly!"", on his iPod  after 700 years, imagine how many times he must have seen it.<br/><br/>The film's true emotional punch, though, arrives along with its second main character, the heavenly robot EVE, who looks pretty much like something Apple would design 700 years in the future. On paper, two robots falling in love is a concept that shouldn't possibly work. It's quite mind-boggling then, and an incredible testament to director Andrew Stanton and the entire creative team really, that it works so exceptionally well in the film. It is difficult to use terms like this when it comes to robot characters, but the amount of human emotion displayed in this film is astonishing. If WALL·E wasn't cute enough based solely on his trinket-collecting antics, his robotic perfectionism and his film appreciation, then his shaky, nervous falling-in-love with EVE is absolutely heart melting. He's neurotic and shy and at first EVE doesn't seem to notice him, but eventually he wins her over and magic begins. I was nearing tears in the scene where WALL·E takes EVE home and excitedly shows her all of the things he's collected, climaxing with his rendition of a musical dance scene from ""Hello, Dolly!"" using a garbage can lid as a top hat  I just couldn't handle it, it was beguilingly adorable. Indeed, the risks and sacrifices these characters are willing to make for one another in the name of love are on such an epic scale, this film may go down in history as one of the great Romantic films.<br/><br/>Then, there is the film's sci-fi aspect, underneath which hides a very strong cautionary message. The sci-fi concept of the formation of one giant corporation, which tailors to all of mankind's needs and services, eventually getting all of mankind on a perpetual vacation in a massive interstellar cruise ship while at the same time continuing the environmental destruction of our planet to the point where return to Earth is impossible, is very original and quite fascinating on its own. It certainly serves as an interesting contrast and a fresh approach to the usual dystopian, post-apocalyptic depiction of Earth we've been used to seeing lately. I loved how the movie didn't shove its environmental message down the audience's throats, but rather simply displayed a possible outcome of this path we are slowly going down without directly portraying that our current environmental conduct is what led to it.<br/><br/>For many reasons, WALL·E is a crowning cinematic achievement and the peak of Pixar's output so far. It's entertaining, thrilling, tense and of course absolutely hilarious. It is a technological wonder and a landmark achievement in animation. It provides us with both food for the mind, with its powerful environmental, future of mankind message; and food for the heart, with its touching, charming, wondrous, beautiful story of two very different robots falling in love. The emotion, the characters, the drama, the humour, the technical execution  WALL·E excels in every possible field. And that it is animated, a genre in which producing shallow, simple material is extremely easy, makes it all the more special."

","I've been a loyal Pixar fan since the Toy Story I days. WallE was the first Pixar movie I wasn't excited to see. For some reasons the trailer just didn't have ""it"". Nonetheless for my bombarded-by-TV-commercials sons this movie was a summer must see. So out we went tonight.<br/><br/>My expectations were low. By the end of the night, I had to say this was so far the most brilliant Pixar work. The film starts with a little lonely rusty robot named WallE in a world hardly recognizable. Unlike the other Pixar movies with breathtakingly beautiful sceneries of the ocean, Paris or the Arizona canyons, the first half of ""WallE"" plays out in a brown, desolate, lifeless city (seems rather LA like). Other than a little grasshopper WallE is the only being on the planet. He continues his old job of cleaning trash, with which the earth is covered, while finding objects to amuse himself such as an old video cassette, a magic cube or an IPod (cute tribute to Pixar founder Steve Jobs). One day, a beautiful robot girl named Eve blasts in from outer space. She's the opposite of WallE - clean, sleek and all powerful. WallE falls instantly in love with her.<br/><br/>To win Eve's love, WallE tries all kinds of tricks to please her. One day he finds a tiny plant, a ray of magnificent green in the sea of dirt and metals. Eve's reaction is anything but predictable. The story takes a new turn from here. To follow his heart, WallE ventures into Eve's world - a giant space ship with some human descended from people on a space cruise 700 years ago.<br/><br/>This movie is charming, witty and heartwarming. It is undeniably political though, even by the usually left leaning Hollywood standards. If the well served ever obese human crew is a subtle reference to the all consuming indulgent modern Americans, the evil B&L CEO's speech is directly quoted from the famous Bush ""stay the course"" ones. While children are enjoying the stories and actions, their parents undoubtedly feel chills down their spines. The most recent space pictures show mother earth is turning rapidly brown. If we keep hiding our heads like ostriches, the scenes in the movie aren't all that far fetched.<br/><br/>Still, this is a Disney movie for children. The ending gives us tremendous hope and satisfaction. The movie credits are meshed with pictures mimicking ancient Egypt, Rome and Van Gough paintings, reminding us that we've come a long way to build our civilization. Let's save it for our children.<br/><br/>As I walked out of the movie theater, I noticed much of the audience was adults without companies of children. This by itself was a very hopeful scene."

From start to finish it is a joy to watch and can honestly be called a masterpiece! The music for the film is phenomenal. It sets the tone of the movie flawlessly, making the movie (which has very little dialogue for the first 30-40 minutes) speak for itself.<br/><br/>The computer animation is flawless. Though many have commented on the ""cartoony"" look of the humans in the movie, this is obviously done for artistic purposes and doesn't take away from the film at all. Everything from the skyscrapers built of trash to the earth-shattering explosions, to WALL-E's rusted exterior is absolutely amazing to see.<br/><br/>The story itself is phenomenal!

","Last week, my friends and I when to the movies and we thought of seeing what WALL-E was really like. Everyone I spoke to said it was brilliant, so I wanted to see for myself. After the film, I had established one conclusion; you can't go wrong with PIXAR films. Especially this one. Everything about this movie is amazing. The animation, the score, the comedy, and even the idea was great. During the majority of this movie, my friend and I kept cheering for WALL-E and laughing so hard our sides were hurting.<br/><br/>The first 45 minutes were incredibly heart-warming, especially between WALL-E and EVE. After that, it just kept getting better as the two travel on an adventure across the universe to discover the last remaining humans alive aboard a colossal space cruiser. There were so many memorable characters with a distinct personality they each had to offer. The animation was the best PIXAR has ever done, making the animation seem almost like reality. And the score, the musical score couldn't have been better, especially ending the film with Peter Gabriel in the background. Absolutely amazing. I wish I could say more about how great this movie is, but this is all I have to say about WALL-E. It is perfect for any age. I'm 21 and I'm still talking about it. In my opinion, I would go see this on the big screen while it's still out. If you haven't seen it yet, make an appointment to watch it."
"ayebeapirate","10","2","4","9 July 2008"," Pixar has Struck Gold Again; Don't miss this movie!
","Pixar evidently is a gold factory. It seems that everything they have touched has not only been a huge commercial success, but also have been consistently high-quality films, both in animation quality as well as the movie itself. Sure, some aren't as good as others - but for every Cars, there's a Finding Nemo. Don't like Monsters, Inc? Watch The Incredibles. Ratatouille should have received a nod for Best Picture, in my opinion... Instead Pixar seems to just own the Best Animated Feature category at the Academy Awards, which arguably means that it's productions (despite being some of the best-received and highest grossing films of the year) might not get proper attention for best picture. After all, Ratatouille was the best reviewed movie of 2007 and the 7th best reviewed movie of all time.<br/><br/>But there's increasing competition for animated films; Dreamworks seems to be the primary competitor, with Blue Sky Studios also throwing in Ice Age. With the release of WALLE, Pixar evidently just wants to show up these competitors.<br/><br/>So Pixar goes oldschool. Not only do they throw their trademark level of detail into everything, but they start removing everything but the kitchen sink. Dialogue? Who uses that as a crutch in a movie? Of the only 8 credited voices in the film, one of them is a text-to- speech program for Macs and the title character's voice was manufactured.<br/><br/>Yeah, that's right: Pixar only used 6 human voices for their film, and kept the first half almost entirely silent.<br/><br/>What else do those horrible competitors use in animation? Oh yeah, faces. What sort of amateur actually uses facial animation just to get over the computerized medium? So gone are noses, mouths, cheeks, dimples, smiles. WALLE gets eyes.<br/><br/>And by the end of the movie you are emotionally attached to WALLE, so they did it. No other company in the world could have done this. Pixar is the best, bar none, and nobody is even close.<br/><br/>So Pixar bragging aside, how is the actual movie?<br/><br/>The first half is physical comedy that would fit in to the era of silent films. WALLE is the last working robot on an Earth abandoned to trash; all humans have long ago left, having reduced the planet to uninhabitability. Not that all is lost; they've left a fleet of robots to clean it up, taking only a scheduled 5 years.<br/><br/>Unfortunately they've all broken, save for one, and have only added to the trash-metropolis. Humans evidently haven't bothered to return to try to fix anything in over 700 years.<br/><br/>So you have one trash-compactor of a robot, and a cockroach. A good 15 minutes of this, and it's hilarious. Then another robot arrives, and instantly there is a 50% increase in the number of characters.<br/><br/>Without ruining the story, WALLE is lonely and falls in love with the new robot, EVE. The actual plot doesn't start to take shape until around 40 minutes in, and it's arguably fairly weak. The events are connected, but there's no strong unifying happening that drives a thesis of the movie.<br/><br/>Some people won't like this, but really, most people will enjoy it. In a movie with so many environmental overtones, it serves to save the film from preachy-ness, and instead focus it on a confused, lonely, lovestruck robot named WALLE. In many ways this is good; the story is first and foremost a love story about the last robot. The producer has stated that it is not intended to really be a political message, but if you want to have the last robot on earth you kind of have to reason the humans off it first.<br/><br/>Of course, there is something at least a little bit ironic within: A movie that shows the dangers of over-commercialism, branded by Disney, with a character designed by Jonathan I've, head of Apple Design, and where they gave midnight viewers plastic WALLE watches as a promo.<br/><br/>And beyond that, it depicts humans have become so lazy, they don't actually walk or interact with each other face-to-face. Remember you'll be in a movie theater, sitting in a chair for two hours, not talking to people next to you.<br/><br/>Some may find the setting to be a little stingingly-sarcastic. The first part of the movie is brilliant, and when the humans enter it it loses some of its charm. But the movie is brilliant, funny, entertaining, and endearing.<br/><br/>Others have loved it as well: It is currently (according to Metacritic) the 15th best reviewed movie of all time, 2nd best this year, and the 3rd best movie this year isn't even in the top 100. WALLE is also the highest user-reviewed movie of the year, taking 20th place here on IMDb (With Iron Man taking 2008's second place at 162).<br/><br/>It is easy for me to say: This is one of the best movies of the year this far (if not the best) and people overwhelmingly agree. There will be zero contest for animated picture and (while I doubt it will happen due to WALLE's unconventional nature) it probably will deserve a nod for best picture nominee.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Don't let its G rating fool you: This movie is great for everyone. It's worth seeing in the theaters and worth your time and money. Pixar has done it again, and you won't see a movie this unique all year long. Don't miss this movie!"
"stuartpiles","9","2","4","9 July 2008"," Something you gotta see.
","No animated film is like WALL-E. I have seen most full length animated films, and few even approach it. Yet none that have had this wide distribution or universal appeal have ever been released in the U.S. Yes, the French film Les Triplets had a dark view of modern society, yet it had limited distribution. <br/><br/>Other art animated films have also been very bleak, but not as multi layered as this one. Also, Wall-e's view is from that of the two robots, not the ego centric view of humans. That too gives it a very special presence on the screen. ..I would urge everyone to see this film. Decide for yourself."

I can honestly say that WALL-E is the best movie I've seen in a very long time.<br/><br/>It was funny, sweet, touching, dramatic, etc. The animation is stunning and I noticed that even the musical score was beautiful.

","Yet another! Viola! <br/><br/>I was skeptical that this movie would be better than the Cars or the Ratatouille movies, but this is yet another jewel. I thought this movie was most similar to The Cars movie since it involved machines that had personalities and fell in love with in another. This is considered an emerging science fiction or artificial intelligence concept since research is being done today to develop the intelligence that attribute emotions to machines. How unique that Pixar attacked a science fiction theme once!<br/><br/>This movie was unique compared to other Pixar films since you truly forget this is animation and not real. After watching the movie, I remarked that it never occurred to me that is was all animation and not real robots! I guess that goes to show you how good animation is today.<br/><br/>What a lot of delightful creativity in choreographed dialog, music, and visuals!

Pixar and writer/director Andrew Stanton have the gift of displaying humanity in its flaws and its glories while chastising its destructive side, in this case the neglected environment. <br/><br/>While the love story, hand holding and all, is worth the admission, the satire of an indolent, wasteful population accurately disturbs as our population continues to get fatter and more environmentally careless, to the point where we vacate the premises.<br/><br/>The animators have drawn heavily and artfully from Star Wars, 2001, Hello Dolly, Seurat, and E.T., among others, but most of all the wizards have revived the simple love storyit shouldn't take animation, science fiction, and post- apocalyptic stories to do so, but heck, I've been looking for love since my second failed marriage a long time ago. <br/><br/>Who would have thought? Handholding! Now that's simple and provocative, environmentally safe, and my 3rd grade nun's criticism of me (holding a little girl's hand: ""You dirty thing""). You can imagine how I loved tormenting her and being in love at the same time. And we were the promise of the future (to which I complied with six childrensuch a good boy). <br/><br/>Wall*E is the most satisfying love story of the year."

","From time to time, there's a movie to be destined to become a masterpiece or a classic. This is the example of WALL-E. This is a movie that has everything for people to enjoy it to the fullest. A film visually extraordinary, a genuine love story, some exciting moments of adventure and with amazing comical parts that you won't stop laughing. But also has a very important message about making conscience of how we are taking care of the planet Earth. The story is very original, interesting, funny and even touching. With the least of dialogues, the movie carry you away with a very good rhythm and it never make it tiresome. The animation is fabulous, Pixar is always on a constant evolution. The music is great, every song fits perfectly and making a small reference to Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and other movies. In conclusion, this movie definitely is one of the best of the season if not the best one. As I said before destined to become the new classic of Disney's new era. Fully recommendable for all ages."

","Some people say that Wall-e is derivate of Johhny 5 character. maybe it is true, maybe it is not. One thing is for sure. This movie is lovely, funny, and all in all- great. Story is simple. Earth is abandoned when humanity overflow Earth with junk and leave for outer space to find better and luxurious life. Mankind leave Earth to small robots, to clean it up. After many. many years small robot named Wall-e (name of janitor unit)is one of few if not only one left operational. He is lovely character. He takes care of junk, and collects interesting items, while only companion to him is a bug. One day, spaceship lands, and ""female"" robot EVE scans local ground in search for something.

"bobsgrock","9","2","4","3 July 2008"," Pixar never ceases to amaze me.
","It all started back in 1995. I was only 6 years old, but I was forever changed when I first saw Toy Story. Today, it is one of my favorite movies as well as a breakthrough for all animated movies. Now, 13 years later, Pixar is still going at it. After all these years, I can honestly say they have never made a bad movie, and they have also made some really excellent movies that in the future will be absolute classics (Toy Story, The Incredibles, Ratatouille). Wall-E is undoubtedly the most ambitious task they have undertaken to date with a serious lack of dialogue and a story that has universal appeal. For the first half hour, the only sounds heard are those made by the robots. Yet, the story moves along just fine and it is quite easy to understand what is going on. This is due to the incredible storytelling ability by the Pixar team as well as the extraordinary animation you cannot look away from. Seriously, you will wonder if some shots are shot with a real camera they are so clear and beautiful. With robots being the main characters, it is a bit more difficult for the audience to relate to them, but director Andrew Stanton does a perfect job of personifying them as well as making them very likable. The romance between Wall E and EVE is very cheesy, but so well done you can't help but smile. Be aware, this movie is not just for children. Adults will be amazed by the animation as well as the thought-provoking themes brought up about the future and just how much humans should rely on technology. Elements of 2001 and I Am Legend aside, this is one of the top 5 Pixar movies and definitely one of the best movies of 2008."
"mttheo","9","2","4","2 July 2008"," Simply Amazing...
","I have just seen Pixars Wall-E for the first time and this is my reaction/Critique: Short Version: To make it simple I have seen every Pixar movie and hold many of them dear to my heart (Toy Story, Monsters Inc.) but Wall-E may well be the best one yet.<br/><br/>Long Version: So I equate this film with the Charlie Chaplin great, ""City Lights"". The Relationship between Wall-E and his Counterpart is like that of the Tramp (Charlie Chaplin) and the blind girl. While in the later they displayed there affection through no words at all, simply pure emotion through the characters actions. Wall-E is a rare gem. While using two, maybe three, words the entire film, the characters display a stunning array of emotion from apprehension, to loyalty with a sweet touch of child like affection. While playing through their actions, the subtlety of the characters eyes and the tone in which they deliver their limited yet beautiful vocabulary is all that is needed. This in itself relates the passion they hold deep inside for each other. Wall-E is a timeless tale of enduring love that is certain to be a favorite among children and adults alike for years to come."
"rmwaal","9","2","4","2 July 2008"," WALL-E: Pixar's Most Ambitious Film, But Perhaps Derivative.
","Wall-e is Pixar Animation Studios' 9th feature film under the Disney name and it takes a different approach than any film preceding it to telling it's story.<br/><br/>The movie's story revolves and Wall-e, a garbage clean-up robot who, after cleaning up the human's trash on earth for 700 years, is joined on the desolate planet by a new robot named EVE, who arrives on earth to search for sustained life, which is the signal for humans to come home. While EVE stays on Earth, with Wall-e giving her a tour, the two form a very Disney, romantic relationship.<br/><br/>Much has been made of Wall-e's dialog free execution of this romance, and it is true that the first 35 minutes of the picture is relatively dialog free. But there several brilliant techniques Pixar uses to communicate their relationship, such as their love of ""Hello Dolly"", and EVE's enjoyment in seeing Wall-e getting hurt.<br/><br/>The film uses humor and simplicity to attract younger viewers, but I wonder if ""Wall-e"" is too simple. Much of the humor in the film is slapstick of Wall-e getting attacked, hit on the head or nearly getting destroyed, and it gets repetitive eventually.<br/><br/>Also, for a film with a ""G"" rating, aimed at kids, I don't know if kids will understand the Eco-friendly message the movie ultimately provides.<br/><br/>But still, its a satisfying, visually unbelievable film, and with fewer and fewer pictures these days made appropriate for all ages, it must see for families this summer."

","Wall-E is without a doubt, a masterpiece of animation. The story that holds it in place is credible, heart-warming.

It is a brilliant animated movie, with an inherent message and its heart in the right place, but a Rank 9 on the top 250? I don't think so. It takes more for a movie to be an all round ground breaker, be it direction like Pulp Fiction, acting performances like the Godfather and so on.

"Jangobadass","10","2","4","2 July 2008"," Little Robot, Big Heart
","Pixar's newest film, ""Wall-E"", is sure to go down in history as animated masterpiece alongside the ""Toy Story"" duo, ""The Incredibles"", and ""Finding Nemo"".<br/><br/>For starters, the animation is just gorgeous. Which is really saying something when the first part of the movie takes place world that is a barren, trash filled waste land. Unlike so many films from their animation rivals where everything is bright and crisp, the artists at Pixar always add real world textures to everything they make. Just think about the water in ""Finding Nemo"" or the food in ""Ratatouille"". While we are taken to a place where everything is smooth and well polished later, I was more impressed by how they were able to make everything dirty, rusty and dented...including our hero.<br/><br/>Wall-E himself is one of the most lovable animated characters I've seen in years. Unlike so many ""whacky"", ""zany"" cartoon characters who are annoying, obnoxious and almost soulless, Wall-E is able to emote and make us like him without saying a word. Well, he does say a few words, but they're so few and far between he's practically a silent film star for the 21st century, wonderfully using his eyes, hand gestures, and body movements. The same can be said for Eve, the probe driod who steals his heart (or is it motor?). It is interesting to see them together just because they're so different: he's old (maybe even ancient), clunky, dented and dirty as a machine can be while still working while she's sleek, fast and brand new. The two of them make a good couple, first as a comedy duo with Wall-E as the clown and Eve as the straight man, then as friends, then as lovers. There is even a scene of them ""dancing"" in space which culminates with the robot equivalent of a kiss. The love story in ""Wall-E"" wonderfully accomplishes what so many romantic comedies try and fail to do, and I'm not even sure Pixar realizes it!<br/><br/>I also really like the film's messages, which are ones we don't see very often and fairly bold. Most kids & family movies (including Pixar's previous works) use morals about friendship, family, honesty, being true to yourself, etc. There's nothing with that. In fact, it should a good way to impart some important information onto young viewers. But we've seen them all so many times those messages have lost some of their meaning. And sometimes those meanings tend to unfortunately get lost amid the slapstick, crude humor, action scenes, and pop culture references that much of today's family entertainment falls victim to. Not here. The first, most obvious message has to do with the environment: the Earth of the future is a barren garbage dump with no plants or water and Wall-E has made ""stacks"" of crushed and cubed garbage that are taller than sky-scrapers and the only animal we see is a lone cockroach.<br/><br/>But the movie took me by surprise when it started to show us something about today's society. The story takes us to the giant spaceship Axiom where humanity now lives and here the human race has evolved into a race of pudgy, pampered people who sit in hover chairs and very rarely get out of them, have robots do every single thing for them except eat/drink ""food in a cup"" (all junk food, at that), talk to each other via holographic screens instead of face to face even when the person they're talking to is nearby, have no knowledge of their surroundings (they spend hours lounging by the pool without even realizing there is a pool there, let alone trying to swim) or history, and the corporation that built the ship (and ruined Earth) tells them what to do via ads in place of a government. The scary thing is that there are several eerie parallels between the society of the Axiom and the one here in the real world that make me wonder about the real fate of mankind.<br/><br/>For the life of me, I can't think of a single flaw with ""Wall-E"". From the animation to the characters to the story, everything about it is so great I can't think of anything wrong with it. Not only will this be one of the best movies, animated or live action, of 2008, it will be one of the best movies of all time."
"blackmamba99971","10","2","4","2 July 2008"," Absolutely fantastic
","This film has to be the most artistic representation of robots i have ever seen. The mixture of emotions running deep inside two of the most heroic pair, Eve and Wall-e. Pixar has done it again with this magical film, showing us a lone robot wall-e which stands for waste allocation load lifter. Being the only robot on earth to clean up a mess which humans had created over a period of a few centuries only to leave the planet so it can be cleaned by wall- e. Except an unexpected turn of events catapult him into space to an earth ship drifting on auto pilot, chasing down his beloved eve, which has found a plant, evidence that the humans can go back and start over. The duo then becomes closer than any human can resulting in a kindred love for each other and how they protect both each other and the humans from a rogue misfit auto pilot who wants nothing to do with the plant evidence. Only to keep the humans enslaved forever, never to return to earth. But as we all know these two lovable robots will not let anything stand in the way of change. This film made me laugh horrendously and nearly cry for the emotional tugs of how wall-e and eve connect so deeply with each other. They are different in shape and functions yet they bond so well and work together as one, that nothing is impossible as the auto pilot kept saying to himself. But it goes to show us on how quickly our earth can go in the crapper in such little time, and the only ones who we could depend on is with one small robot who collects nick nacks and lighters for a hobby and use them to his advantage. his independence walloped the more high tech gadgets and showed the humans and robots alike that heroism runs deep, no matter if it's circuits and batteries or blood and bone, and his sacrifice to do the right thing saved humanity. Eve on the other hand is his soul mate in the electronic world and without her, the kids of the earth could not learn the meaning of love,life,and caring about the ones you would die for. Everyone can learn from wall-e and eve. Hats off to pixar, thank you for giving us a most memorable film to date. And i hope you guys win some Oscars."

A++++++++ for Andrew and his masterpiece."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","10","2","4","1 July 2008"," Easily Pixar's best and a whole lot more, ""WALL-E"" is something special.
","There's no reason Disney/Pixar's ""WALL-E"" shouldn't be able to compete with 2008's best films just because it's animated. Pixar compacts so much great material into this film, including incredible CGI, that I prefer it to live action. Live action could not tell the incredible story of WALL-E, the most admirable and lovable animated character to grace the screen in what feels like ages. This is truly Pixar's masterpiece: a film that takes everything you know about animated movies and rockets above and beyond it.<br/><br/>Almost instantaneously, you fall in love with WALL-E, the only intelligent being left on Earth, which has become a wasteland full of trash, to which WALL-E is assigned to crush and organize in piles. It's remarkable how quickly Andrew Stanton's character connects with you. His love of collecting things we know as everyday objects as artifacts, his love of music and movies--the only of which he has is ""Hello, Dolly!""--and just the way he goes through his day creates something so deeply and essentially human that it's impossible not to like him. He is diligent, curious, a bit of a klutz and he's infatuated with the notion of finding true love. Almost everyone can relate to that.<br/><br/>WALL-E's world gets flipped upside down when a spaceship lands and produces EVE, a robot dispatched to Earth by the humans now living off-planet who is responsible for searching for organic life. WALL-E is instantly love-struck and courageously pursues meeting and getting to know EVE. Eventually, he follows her back to the Axiom, a ship which is full of humans but run by robots. This is where ""WALL-E"" goes from being a really creative and well-written film to an amazingly creative, clever and even intelligent film. It does this by painting a grim and horrifying picture of humanity that comes across as deplorable but amusing--a non- threatening but nevertheless negative depiction of a universe where humans over- commercialize and consolidate Earth and end up living their lives in space, sitting in mobile chairs and relying on robots for everything. In this sense the film borrows from ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (it even borrows Strauss' music at one comical point as an homage)<br/><br/>All throughout this plot line is the love story between WALL-E and EVE, an unusual but very basic plot in the film. Unusual in that it's not covered in drama, but simple in that the two help save each other and that dedication fosters a love and a desire to not be lonely emotionless robots unlike the stoic species that humans in the film have become. The fact that the inventive and lively robots in this film who say barely anything capture our attention gain our approval more than the humans in the film says a lot about the job that Andrew Stanton and Pixar have done with ""WALL-E""<br/><br/>Top that off with CGI that convinces you you're not watching CGI at times along with some great action sequences and this is a truly special movie. I haven't felt so moved by an animated film since I was 5 years old watching ""Lady and the Tramp."" Name another Pixar film you love and this one makes it look amateurish. If you have any appreciation for good visual storytelling, you will love this film and easily pardon its lack of dialogue and occasional slow parts because of the piece of art that it is."
"Chris Knipp","9","2","4","1 July 2008"," Little robot makes good
","Earth is overrun with trash. Thus a little rusty robot has his lovely task: packing rubbish from humans, who've departed to space, into skyscraper cubes. WALL-E is a ""he."" We just know. WALL stands for ""Waste Allocation"" something-or-other (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class), but of course it reads as ""Wally."" Wally looks a little like ET. Has some of the sprightliness of R2D2. Wally's in the survivor situation of Will Smith in I Am Legend, but has no vicious enemies, only a cockroach pal that follows him around. But Wally is lonely. Wally is a lonely guy.<br/><br/>Animations anthropomorphize animals (as did ancient fables and the seventeenth-century poet La Fontaine), then moved on to broomsticks and other objects, and machines. Do machines have souls? Do androids dream of electric sheep? Will artificial intelligence rule? Will we have to rip out Hal's brain? These are perennial sci-fi dilemmas.<br/><br/>WALL-E is a robot love story. It's also a chilling if hopeful picture of humans exiled from a ruined planet and turned into consumer blobs wallowing in a space mall called ""Axiom."" This movie oscillates neatly between austere minimalism and cornball sweetness, with many Star Wars battles smashed together in between. It satisfies children and adults, but only by not quite fully satisfying either. That is still an accomplishment, the classic Shakespearean one of appealing to all levels of the audience.<br/><br/>Two ways WALL-E is wondrous are in the dusty, weathered look of its Pixar earth landscapes which Wally himself partakes of; and the endless mechanical business, the tricks and gestures of creatures and objects in constant, precise, often witty motion. But the loud sweeping music spoils the initial loneliness. How lonely can you be with a full orchestra at your back? And there is a limit to how much you can care about a machine. Or should be. Still, this movie for all its emphasis on tricks and images scores some surprisingly cool and resonant ideas along the way.<br/><br/>WALL-E is a triumph of the work ethic, the little guy who matters. He's also symbolic of the utilitarian, no nonsense life. When all else fails, when there's nothing but junk, he's there, sorting it. He throws away a diamond ring, but keeps the box: it looks useful. The movie also celebrates the baraka, the blessedness, of much-used humble objects that through human contact grow soulful and real. In his junk lair, where he sleeps (dreaming of electric sheep?), he plays a little piece of an old musical on a videotape, people dancing and happy, a couple singing of love. This is the kernel of humanity that's saved.<br/><br/>But WALL-E's a lonely guy, and when EVA comes, he's smitten. EVA is sent from ""Axiom"" to see if photosynthesis has returned. She--we know it's a she--is everything WALL-E isn't. He's rusty and clunky and articulated. She's round and smooth and white and her parts float in the air. He is indestructible, or nearly so, but she is higher tech, and emits sudden, alarming explosions, powerful and alien--yet somehow feminine. These are lessons in sexual differentiation for kiddies.<br/><br/>For adults are the bloated helpless future humans we see when EVA is returned to space and WALL-E sneaks aboard and follows her. The finale is simple and schematic--it's a letdown, despite the fun, comic reference to 2001, and the way Aliens is evoked by using Sigourney Weaver's voice for the malevolent controlling computer of ""Axiom."" Are we the prisoners of our own device? Even when it disappoints, WALL-E is thought-provoking. The little robots are real charmers, and there have been many ingenious delights along the way."

","I know a movie can't become a classic until it has stood the test of time, so let this be my personal prediction. This movie will be a classic. My generation had E.T., this generation has ""Wall-E"". I was amazed by how a family, children-orientated film could avoid excluding older age groups.<br/><br/>It also conveys so many relevant themes and social commentary without going over children's heads. It also has enough genuine emotion and entertaining moments that are told visually, without being ruined by corny dialog. This could have even worked as a silent film because the storytelling so effective.<br/><br/>I went to see this without much expectation other than some cool looking animation, and left stunned! The sense of hope that their can be more mainstream movies that do more then sell popcorn followed me out of the theatre and throughout my shift at work that followed.<br/><br/>""WALL-E"" is timeless. It could have came out in any year you can think of. And this is possible by not loading it with tons of trendy catch-phrases and shameless plugs for the current fleeting-shelf-life product of the moment. It is beautiful to see that someone in Hollywood understands the value in this. Especially in this digital age of disposable, ""fast-food"" art. This is what cinema is all about to me, DREAMING WHILE AWAKE, STORIES TOLD WITH MOVING PICTURES, ART THE FORCES A RESPONSE! Very legendary!"
"nyskins1","10","2","4","1 July 2008"," Ambitious and triumphant
","Pixar has one of the best reputations in movies today. They are known as a studio that does not make bad movies. All of Pixar's previous offerings are great movies in their own regards, but WALL-E is a masterpiece because of its ambition. WALL-E is among the greatest love stories, dystopian science fictions, dark comedies, and archetypical hero stories, all at once. None of these elements overpowers any other, nor does any fade into the background. WALL-E's success is in its balance. The film is so perfectly constructed that you walk out of the theater feeling as though it would be impossible to change a single thing about the movie.<br/><br/>What WALL-E really does (and how it succeeds with so little dialogue) is that it boils down human expression and emotion to its most basic level. WALL-E and EVE's facial expressions and electronic beeps capture pure human emotion, untainted by words. As a result, absolutely nothing is overdone.<br/><br/>And there's the greatness of it all: WALL-E is a movie about humanity, but its protagonist isn't even human. WALL-E shows us that makes us human is our ability to think and feel for ourselves. WALL-E is more human than the human characters in this movie because he has broken his routine of survival and has learned how to truly live.<br/><br/>And while this notion is conveyed very clearly, it is not overdone. WALL-E does not overdo anything or beat the audience over the head with any of its themes. It captures the essence of all of its elements, rather than attempting to string them out too far.<br/><br/>I can't remember the last time I walked out a movie theater without a single criticism, no matter how small. But even so, I found it hard to put into words exactly what made this movie great. The thing is, WALL-E taps into the essence of our humanity so deeply that we have trouble expounding upon what makes it great; we just know that it affects us. Maybe we should leave it untainted by words. WALL-E did."

I believe that all the other characters and storyline were set for the movie, but they wanted to improve WALL-E's character. So, in a eureka like moment of insight at a baseball game, the top animator for Pixar was using binoculars at a baseball stadium since he couldn't see the game from a distance. It was at that moment, when using the binoculars, that the animator realized he can use binoculars as part of WALL-E's face.<br/><br/>I learned this after the fact of watching the movie but still found it extremely fascinating from a creative standpoint.<br/><br/>In terms of the actually movie, it was so amazing even though there was such minimal talking.

","Don't get me wrong, Wall-E is a good movie that has also important messages like the care of our planet, the importance of an healthy lifestyle and a conscious use of the technology. It has also a brave opening for an animated movie because of the lack of dialogues in the first 20-30 minutes. But then as the setting changes I feel that the movie becomes a little too childish. Clearly this movie is intended for children but in other Pixar films this aspect was more balanced. Except for that the Wall-E is very enjoyable and it has also some references to very important pictures like 2001: Space Odissey and Star Wars and I'm sure I've missed some other more.

Most of the movie goes on without dialog, and without any confusion. If you dislike this movie, that's fine. But you can not deny its artistic value and excellent cinematography. I hate the people who won't stop whining about ""cliches"". A few years later, we will have people complaining about movies like : Why are the humans walking? It's cliche...
If a movie does nothing but using stereotypes which don't add anything to the story, then you can call it cliche. But when a movie does something fun and innovative with the existing concepts, the only reason to hate on it is to get some attention.
I'm not saying this movie is great because Pixar made it. Pixar made Toy Story 4 which is an awful movie and despite everyone saying it's good, it has a lot of flaws from a technical perspective. And of course Wall-E is not without flaws. But this movie gets so many things right that the flaws are totally overshadowed."

","In this miove, the director repeatedly used hands to describe emotions, showing a keen sense of ability. Holding hands is a physical connection on the surface, while the inner is the proximity of the soul. It is more like a love The ceremony, although simple, is sacred and of great significance. Perhaps Wali 's story proves that the goddess is not so difficult to reach. As long as it is brave and sincere enough, the technical otaku can also have spring."

","They do not speak, they have no thoughts, they have no carnal desires, they do n't have to worry about the house, they do n't have to care for the elderly, they do n't need luxury goods, and they do n't have to worry about all the burdens of having children.<br/><br/>So after pulling away from all that, what is distilled out is the purest and most primitive desire. But in order to hold a hand, he went to outer space and followed closely. She was the only one in her eyes. Everything but her was not a problem, let alone considered, it was the original intuition of love.
Thousands of mountains and rivers, the waves are turbulent. At the last moment of paralysis, she still insisted on helping her complete the task.<br/><br/>He would n't say, I love you, only quietly stretched out the little arm, and at the moment of fall, shy and lost, drawing small circles underground.<br/><br/>He can't do much better than her, and can only find everything that can please her. Rubik's cube, light bulbs, musicals, small plants. Although she often blasted mushrooms everywhere, making him worry that Xiaoming would never have any time, he still bravely pursued it.<br/><br/>They used that pair of manipulators to draw the simplest picture of love, beautiful and impeccable.<br/><br/>There were urges to cry several times.
When he called her name, eva. Silly, always illegible, reading a little harder. When he always stretched out his hand carefully and retracted carefully. When she protected him and tried to fix him in a panic.<br/><br/>about love. It was discovered in the movie that what we lost was not expression, but bravery.
We are not brave, but we are not brave for a person's love. Everyone is thinking about the sea once, forgetting it in the rivers and lakes, but look down on those who want to live and die, and resist the entanglement. How cowardly weeping, how shameful weeping for love, there will always be the next better and more suitable person, there are so many things in life that are worth bravely enjoying.<br/><br/>We have become more likely to survive, our hearts have become harder and narrower to accommodate another person, and our love has become more ambiguous, free and easier, neither of which is the same.<br/><br/>Men and women, just become strong and weak.
The strong is the mind, the weak is the heart. The more people grow up, the more they rely on mind and experience, not intuition. Regarding love, it is hard to escape this fate.<br/><br/>My friend said to me, to judge love or not, just give it to the flesh. For the joy of the heart and the joy of the flesh, one can meet across thousands of mountains and rivers.
All other girlfriends scolded her while admiring her.
I can't do what she did, but I can't deny that when I love someone, the pores, the cells, the hands, are full of the desire to approach him. Even if you hold hands, take a walk."

"Jeremy_Urquhart","9","0","0","23 April 2020"," A near masterpiece of animation
","Pixar are the kings of making you care about objects/ animals you'd otherwise be indifferent to. What other studio in history has been able to make adults feel such strong emotions towards a group of toys, or make a compelling, touching story about a rat who has dreams of becoming a chef? Seriously. There's rats in kitchens. Cooking food. And they're not disgusting or filthy or anything. They're awesome. Pixar made a compelling character out of a freaking rat.<br/><br/>I only watched Wall-E for the first time as an 18-year-old, which was kind of surprising, as it was at that point a five year old movie, and I guess the reason I never watched it before was because I felt too ""cool"" for animated movies while I was in my early teen-age years. You know, cos Wall-E's exclusively a kid's movie, for sure. But hey, we're all a bit arrogant as teen-agers.<br/><br/>I'd started to work my way through Pixar's catalogue of films, some of which I've never watched and some I hadn't watched for many years (the Toy Story trilogy is next). Ratatouille was the one I started with, and I thought it was great, being a kid friendly movie, but still hugely compelling and enjoyable for older audiences.<br/><br/>Wall-E was released one year after Ratatouille, and was, and perhaps still is, Pixar's riskiest movie to date. Much has been said about the film's lack of dialogue and its restrained pace, particularly in the first half hour or so. I'll agree with the lack of dialogue comment, because there's essentially none, seeing as the two main characters, EVE and Wall-E, are only really capable of saying their own, and each other's names. But to call it slow moving would be a stretch. Maybe not much happens plot-wise, but the individual scenes never go on for too long, there's a steady stream of jokes, most of them physical, some great character development for our title character, which gets us really invested in him, and plenty of great scenery to look at (the animation is unbelievably good).<br/><br/>In fact, it's this first act of the movie that's the most impressive. It plays out almost like a silent movie, with Wall-E roaming around the now desolate Earth, picking up rubbish, compacting it into cubes, and stacking the cubes endlessly, day in and day out. We're never told quite how much time he's spent doing this, but it's implied to have been a long time. He finds objects from an Earth that's long gone to hell, some of which he takes back to his little makeshift home. And somehow, through these fairly simple opening scenes, he becomes very likeable. We don't need exposition about his history. We don't need to be told what he's like. We're shown his charming personality through his actions, through the objects he keeps in his house, and through seeing just how alone he is, which makes him greatly sympathetic too. Then a robot by the name of EVE turns up, and we don't know why she shows up at Earth or who sent her for a while. Instead, a relationship is built between her and Wall-E, and somehow it's made really engaging and heartwarming.<br/><br/>What I'm getting at is this is another example of Pixar's genius. How they made me feel so much emotion towards a tiny, trash-disposing robot in a matter of minutes is astounding. And then he gets into this oddly endearing relationship with a shiny, white feminine robot, and I feel for the both of them. And barely a word's said this whole time! This is truly great story-telling, with a gloriously minimalist approach that just works on every level. The more I think about the first 30-40 minutes of this movie, the more incredible I realise they are. Funny, touching, heart-warming, memorable, stunningly animated, and dialogue-free. Think classic Charlie Chaplin, but animated, in colour, and with robots and a science-fiction setting, and you'll have something that kind of resembles this first act of Wall-E. It's pretty much film-making at its finest.<br/><br/>But of course, this charmingly minimalist style of film-making doesn't last throughout the entire movie. I won't go into detail about what happens later on in the film, but a few large new concepts are introduced that really shake things up, and they do make the movie feel a little more conventional in the process. Is this a bad thing though? Yes and no- some of the charm is lost when we start hearing more dialogue, and start seeing crazier things start to happen, but at the same time, it may not have been possible to make an entire movie about two robots falling ""in love"" on an abandoned Earth. It may have started to wear out its welcome and become repetitive- this could be one reason why Chaplin's films were relatively short (I have a version of ""The Kid"" that goes for 50 minutes, which is shorter than most individual episodes of shows like The Wire, The Sopranos, Games of Thrones...).<br/><br/>It took me a little while to warm up to the change of pace that happens about 40 minutes into this film, but I did eventually, and so I still enjoyed the second half of the movie. Wall-E doesn't get any less charming or endearing, and there are still a number of great scenes littered through the film's second half, including one scene involving a fire extinguisher in outer space. And like almost all Pixar film endings, this one's uplifting and heartwarming, yet at the same time doesn't feel too sappy.<br/><br/>This is a great movie, and to say too much else about it might ruin your enjoyment of it. Of course, you've probably already seen this movie before, but if you were like me by any chance and somehow have never watched it in the last five years then I highly recommend tracking this one down and watching it now. Ideally on Blu-ray, as this is a film that's really suited to the format, given the stunning animation and vivid colours. This is a film that anyone of any age can watch and enjoy, perhaps for slightly different reasons. It's a film with a phenomenal first half and a very good second half. It features one of the most sympathetic and adorable animated lead characters of all time, and is up there with the best Pixar has to offer. Definitely check it out."

","I normally fully respect people who choose to disagree with me. Opinions and all that at the end of the day. However, I honestly cannot see how you cannot fall in love with WALL-E. The few people who told me they disagreed claim ""it's boring"". Although I take the stance that interest is entirely subjective. When I use the phrase ""boring"", to me it means a large section of the movie where the plot is simply not advancing. You cannot say that about WALL-E.<br/><br/>In WALL-E, humans have destroyed the planet and have left to live in space. It's up to WALL-E to compact the rubbish so that the Earth can support life again. A new robot, called EVE is sent to Earth to look for signs of life. And she finds a plant.<br/><br/>This is Pixar's most ambitious film. WALL-E could have completely missed the mark. However, this is Pixar and of course it doesn't. WALL-E is one of, if not the most, original movies I have ever had the pleasure of watching. It is a modern masterpiece and will go down in history as one of the greatest films of all time.<br/><br/>Incredible characterisation. These robots have real emotions and react to the events of the movie with rational responses. The meticulously thought out plot has an attention to detail that is almost Kubrickan. The soundtrack and sound design are perfection. WALL-E is also Pixar's greatest love story.<br/><br/>What floors me is that the first half of WALL-E has no dialogue. We've seen Pixar dip their toe into trying this before. It is this that tipped the scale into obtaining a perfect rating. I honestly cannot fathom how they managed to tell a story as complex and intricate as WALL-E without dialogue. Makes it truly great watching.<br/><br/>Phenomenal on a fundamental level.

"brycepiper","10","0","0","21 December 2019"," WALL-E depicts global challenges in the most easily understood way possible
","WALL-E is a classic Disney movie which presents itself as a simple plot scheme of a robot who finds love, who then saves the world. Now, after analyzing the movie it is a lot easier to see the underlying themes of the movie concerning global challenges. In WALL-E's world, especially depicted at the beginning, he is completely isolated on a deserted planet. The only remnants of the past are artifacts that WALL-E collects and the abundance of garbage everywhere. WALL-E's job for humans was essentially to do the dirty work, by packing up garbage into a cubical shape and then stacking each garbage cube. While WALL-E is working on earth, the humans took matters into their own hands and abandoned earth, residing on a spaceship in space. On this spaceship, robots do every single task for humans that is imaginable, resulting in a particularly obese population. The plot thickens when WALL-E meets one of the spaceship's probes and they become a couple, per se, as they strive to get a single plant back to earth, signifying a new start. This movie depicts the ultimate result of all global challenges, if not confronted correctly. Pollution, of course, is the number one global challenge that is displayed in WALL-E. It shows that eventually, humans may run out of places to put their trash and it will interfere with daily life. When WALL-E goes into space, he sees earth as a dark, brown, smog-filled planet. With this information, it can be inferred that not only was pollution a problem in the world before, the resources of earth have been depleted completely or else it would have naturally grown back over the course of 700 years. The final global challenge that is highlighted in WALL-E is the overuse of science and technology. Technology is prominent in the film, and it makes one question whether or not future generations will experience something similar. The knowledge I gained from watching the film was superlative. I began to ask myself a number of ""what if"" questions, hoping to predict the possibilities of earth actually ending up like WALL-E's earth. I learned that the amount of trash on earth can only be hidden to an extent and some precautions must be taken in order to reduce the amount of pollution we are creating. For example, right now plastic straws are in the midst of being shunned due to their harmful effects on wildlife. If this were advertised for every product that decomposes slowly or harms the environment consistently then we would be in good nature. Another thing I learned from this film is that we should respect our bodies and continue to use them in the ways that we always have. For example, using our legs for walking seems like a dumb solution, but as WALL-E depicted, if we spend our time moping around letting robots do all work for us, then we will reach a generation of laziness. On a broader note, technology should not be overused and there are things that humans need to not replace with robots. I believe that WALL-E should be encouraged as a learning tool for studying global challenges or environmental science. Although it depicts a world centuries away from us now, we may be able to learn something to ultimately help us in the long-run."

"josephrygaard","8","0","0","15 August 2019"," Before Watching: Wall-E (2008)
","""Wall-E"" (2008) is an innovative animation movie for the whole family. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:<br/><br/>Wall-E is - obviously - first and foremost a children's movie. A few plot elements will not make sense if you think about them too much. Be ready for this if you are one of those who like to systematically analyze decision and options, instead, just enjoy the charm this movie has to offer.<br/><br/>That leads into the second important thing about this movie - it is surprisingly sweet and charming. There is a lot of emotions on screen, but they are carried by the main protagonists through expressions and body language rather than language - and it works extremely well. Do not be ashamed if you get touched, it is but another sign of this phenomenal way of storytelling.<br/><br/>A word also needs to be said for the great music and amazing visuals this movie has to offer. The earth environment is close to being photorealistic, and the colors are rich and vibrant throughout the runtime. Find a big screen with some great speakers and an adequate subwoofer, and you are in for a treat.<br/><br/>And stay for the clever end credits.<br/><br/>My personal grade: a charming 8/10. If you found this helpful, check my profile for more reviews."
"bunnymariofan","9","0","0","11 August 2019"," My WALL·E Review
","I think this is a very well done movie from 2008, I thought it was awesome and it was great as well! Andrew Stanton did a great job directing this film, he also directed Finding Nemo and Finding Dory. He also co-directed A Bug's Life with John Lasseter directing it as well. And the music in the movie had really great music, awesome music by Thomas Newman, who also does a great job composing the music for this film, I thought the animation was really well done, it's great because it's Pixar, I'm a fan of Pixar, and I thought the voice actors did a good job in this film. I thought Jeff Garlin who voices the Captain in this film, I thought Jeff Garlin did a great job voicing him, and Kathy Najimy she was good, John Ratzenberger he was good as well he starred in every Pixar movie. I thought the scenery was really well done. There's really nothing wrong with this movie, if you haven't seen this movie, where have you been? This is a really awesome movie from 2008. And this movie is the first Pixar movie to use Disney's logo from 2006 with fireworks and a new scenery, and a new looking castle."
"Vartiainen","Null","0","0","11 August 2019"," Captivating, sweet and memorable
","WALL·E still reigns as one of Pixar's finest films and a true testaments to the fact that you don't necessary need an overabundance of witty dialogue to tell your story. The first half of this film is practically silent, with perhaps a few lines of dialogue on the background to set the mood or to allude to the premise.<br/><br/>The Earth has become inhospitable to human life due to our own poor choices. Mountains of garbage have buried our once great cities and we have left our home planet behind to reach for the stars. But, we've left some robots behind to clean up this mess. And one of their last remaining members is the movie's titular character, WALL·E. He's quite happy pursuing his craft, until he meets another robot, a sleeker and deadlier specimen, named EVE.<br/><br/>What a fantastic premise and what a fantastic way to tell it. We learn everything we need to know about WALL·E without a single line of dialogue from him. Well, okay, he says his own name every now and then, and he definitely makes sounds, but they're more like bleeps and whistles. But that's all we need. His design is so amazingly expressive, so emotive, that we buy the soul behind his programming and code. His romantic spirit.<br/><br/>That being said, if the first half of this movie is an easy A+ of storytelling, with an honourable commendation thrown in for extra measure, the latter half floats around something like a B-. Still pretty good, but it loses something when it introduces humans back into the story. When it becomes a conflict. It's still quite good, but there was uniqueness to the story before that, which I found myself missing.<br/><br/>Still, WALL·E and EVE remain adorable throughout the entire film, it is extremely nicely animated and the message throughout the entire film is very good. It remains one of my favourite Pixar movies of all time and WALL·E himself just might be my favourite character out of the entire canon."

"Joseph-White","9","0","0","31 July 2019"," One of the best animated films ever
","Pixar has produced many enjoyable animated features over the last few decades but in my opinion WALL.E is definitely in the top 5. Being able to achieve such an engaging opening act with next to no dialogue really is impressive, as is the storytelling throughout the film as a whole. The characters are wonderfully animated and the relationships throughout, especially that of WALL.E and EVE are both satisfying and fun to watch. Rarely do I feel such an emotional connection to animated characters however in WALL.E I do find my self invested in the well-being of the majority of the characters.<br/><br/>The scenes where WALL.E is showing EVE the different assortment of items he has collected is probably my favourite overall, every detail in this scene; from EVE solving the Rubik's cube to WALL.E presenting her with the plant is very well thought out and contains a nice sprinkle of humour throughout. I also love how the message presented in WALL.E is dealt with, it is clear and informative without being delivered in a forceful manner. Overall I believe that WALL.E is an amazing animated film that you should definitely watch if you somehow haven't already."

","WALL-E is the only animated film that can make absolutely fall in love with a pair of inanimate objects that can only communicate through saying their names. The movie up until it goes into space is somehow extremely charming with a setting that is absolutely terrifying when compared to our own possible future. The music is amazing throughout and there are certain scenes that will make you tear up. However the 'bad guy' in the movie is not likeable and has no motive. This movie could possibly have been transformed to a higher state of film had the movie had been a pure adventure/comedy with romantic overtones in which our main character attempts to help communicate with the human population and also rekindle his relationship with a futuristic service droid, I think that the movie would have truly been a masterpiece."
"meganerdjack","10","0","0","17 June 2019"," Best Pixar Film and Possibly Tied Best Animated Film - Definitely Worth Watching
","This was my favourite film for a very long time and it was only when I started branching into other films and directors that it changed, but this is still No. 2 on my list. You should definitely consider watching this film if you haven't watched it already and you might come to love it as much as me and other people.<br/><br/>The way this film has been put together is absolutely exceptional and I believe that the way this film starts is very similar to the start of Pixar's next film from 2009, ""Up"" which is another one of my favourite Pixar films. There is no human dialogue at all (unless you count the random BnL playbacks but they are not interactive to WALL-E and they are mostly expositional) but just from the score and the way WALL-E moves and does things can tell you exactly what he is thinking. The tone is set very well in every scene and the characters are the most interesting and diverse I have ever seen in film. The characterization is very clear and everyone (or thing) has a purpose in the film. The only very minor problem I had was that the way the humans survived for 700 years was never explained clearly but like I said, very small problem which probably does have an answer. The message delivered by this film is so important and the way it is delivered is absolutely gorgeous.<br/><br/>This is certainly one of Pixar's darker films, but that is what some animated films need to be these days. Kids' films need to show that the actions of humans do have consequences and this is why I think this film has stuck with me so much. The way that humans' and robots' interaction in this film has been written to be very natural, which is something I don't think a lot of human/robot films can do these days. In particular, the interaction between Captain McCrea (captain of the Axiom) and AUTO shows what a normal human/robot relationship in that situation should be like. It starts off with the Captain relying on AUTO too much, but he later comes to think for himself and become a ""proper"" human. This adds on to how incredible the character development is within this film.<br/><br/>Subjectively, this is my favourite animated film of all time and to be honest, I think it will be quite hard to top. I only put ""tied"" in the title because I also love Studio Ghibli's ""Spirited Away"" (2001) and I think that this deserves to be recognised as the best animated film as well. This film certainly deserved its 2008 Best Animated Feature Oscar award.<br/><br/>To conclude, I absolutely adore this film and all of its elements like its characters, its animation, its music, the dialogue. EVERYTHING IS PERFECT. If you love cute robots in a semi-love story during a time of human crisis, then you should definitely watch this film. This is a very good film to teach children about the consequences of human actions of the present day and what it could lead to in the future, just maybe not as extreme as WALL-E makes it out to be. As long as the children watching don't get disturbed or distressed by mild violence and images created throughout the film, this is a fine choice for something to watch.<br/><br/>My Ratings:
Character/Cast - 10/10
Plot - 10/10
Dialogue - 10/10
Visuals- 9.5/10
Music - 10/10
Direction - 9.5/10

","While single-handedly cleaning up the mess that was once human civilisation WALL-E, an enduring and self-aware waste management 'bot 'meets cute' with sleek reconnaissance robot EVE, fall in love and follows her to the Axiom, a giant starship where the remnants of humanity are waiting out the clean-up of the home world. Little do the two 'bots know, but EVE is carrying both the hopes, and the fears, of the survivors and their doting electronic servers. The fast moving film is very clever and funny and there are endless background jokes that are worth a re-watch. Pixar's animators have an uncanny ability to imbue human characteristics to non-living objects and WALL-E, EVA and the various 'bots they encounter on the Axiom are no exception: they all have distinct and compelling personalities. The 'human' characters are also very well done. As 'hard science fiction' the plot's a bit shaky, but for a fun, futuristic fantasy, it's perfect."

","In the 29th century, rampant consumerism and environmental neglect have turned Earth into a garbage-strewn wasteland. Humanity is nowhere to be found, having been evacuated by the megacorporation Buy-N-Large (BnL) on giant starliners seven centuries earlier. Of the robotic trash compactors left by BnL to clean up, only one remains: a Waste Allocation Load-Lifter (Earth Class), or WALL-E. One day, WALL-E's routine is broken by the arrival of an unmanned probe carrying an Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator or EVE, sent to scan the planet for plant life. WALL-E is smitten by the sleek, otherworldly robot, but she goes into standby when he shows her his most recent find: a living seedling. The probe returns to collect EVE and the plant, and with WALL-E clinging on, returns to its mothership, the starliner Axiom.<br/><br/>In the centuries since the Axiom left Earth, its passengers have degenerated into fat, feeble slobs due to laziness and microgravity, their every whim catered to by machines. Captain McCrea, used to sitting back while his robotic lieutenant AUTO flies the ship, is taken aback by a positive probe response, but learns that placing the plant in the ship's Holo-Detector will trigger a hyperjump back to Earth so humanity can begin recolonization. The plant proves to be missing from EVE's storage compartment though, and she blames WALL-E for its disappearance.<br/><br/>With the plant missing, EVE is deemed faulty and taken to Diagnostics. WALL-E proceeds to ""free"" her along with the other faulty robots, causing them to be designated rogue. Frustrated, EVE tries to send WALL-E home on an escape pod, but they are interrupted when AUTO's first mate GO-4 arrives and stows the stolen plant in a pod set to self-destruct. WALL-E saves the plant from being lost forever, and he and EVE reconcile, celebrating with a dance in space around the Axiom.<br/><br/>EVE brings the plant back to McCrea, who watches EVE's recordings of Earth and concludes that they have to go back. However, AUTO refuses, revealing his own secret no-return directive A113, issued after BnL concluded in 2110 that the planet could not be saved. AUTO mutinies, electrocuting WALL-E and shutting EVE down, and throwing them both down the garbage chute before confining the captain to his quarters. EVE automatically reboots herself and helps WALL-E bring the plant to the ship's Holo-Detector. AUTO crushes WALL-E in his attempt to stop the return protocol initializing, but McCrea deactivates him while EVE starts the hyperjump.<br/><br/>Arriving back on Earth, EVE repairs WALL-E, but finds that his memory has been reset and his personality is gone. Heartbroken, EVE gives WALL-E a farewell kiss, which sparks his memory and restores his original personality. WALL-E and EVE reunite as the humans and robots of the Axiom take their first steps on Earth. During the credits, humans and robots are shown learning to farm, fish, and build, turning the ravaged planet into a paradise."

","It is 700 years in the future. A city of skyscrapers rises up from the land. A closer view reveals that the skyscrapers are all constructed out of garbage, neatly compacted into squares or bales and piled on top of one another. In all the land, only one creature stirs. This is WALL-E, the last of the functioning solar-powered robots. He - the story leaves no doubt about gender - scoops up trash, shovels it into his belly, compresses it into a square and climbs on his tractor treads and heads up a winding road to the top of his latest skyscraper, to place it neatly on the pile.<br/><br/>It is lonely being WALL-E. But does WALL-E even know that? He comes home at night to a big storage area, where he has gathered a few treasures from his scavengings of the garbage and festooned them with Christmas lights. He wheels into his rest position, takes off his treads from his tired wheels and goes into sleep mode. Tomorrow is another day: One of thousands since the last humans left the Earth and settled into orbit aboard gigantic spaceships that resemble spas for the fat and lazy.<br/><br/>One day WALL-E's age-old routine is shattered. Something new appears in his world, which otherwise has consisted only of old things left behind. This is, to our eye, a sleek spaceship. To WALL-E's eyes, who knows? What with one thing and another, WALL-E is scooped up by the ship and returned to the orbiting spaceship Axiom, along with his most recent precious discovery: a tiny, perfect green plant, which he found growing in the rubble and transplanted to an old shoe.<br/><br/>Have you heard enough to be intrigued, or do you want more? Speaking voices are now heard for the first time in the movie, although all on his own, WALL-E has a vocabulary (or repertory?) of squeaks, rattles and electronic purrs, and a couple of pivoting eyes that make him look downright anthropomorphic. We meet a Hoverchair family, so known because aboard ship they get around in comfy chairs that hover over surfaces and whisk them about effortlessly. They're all as fat as Susie's aunt.<br/><br/>This is not entirely their fault, since generations in the low-gravity world aboard the Axiom have evolved humanity into a race whose members resemble those folks you see whizzing around Wal-Mart in their electric shopping carts.<br/><br/>There is now a plot involving WALL-E, the ship's captain, several Hover people and the fate of the green living thing. And in a development that would have made Sir Arthur Clarke's heart beat with joy, humanity returns home once again - or is that a spoiler?<br/><br/>The movie has a wonderful look. Like so many of the Pixar animated features, it finds a color palette that's bright and cheerful, but not too pushy, and a tiny bit realistic at the same time. The drawing style is Comic Book Cool, as perfected in the funny comics more than in the superhero books: Everything has a stylistic twist to give it flair. And a lot of thought must have gone into the design of WALL-E, for whom I felt a curious affection. Consider this hunk of tin beside the Kung Fu Panda. The panda was all but special-ordered to be lovable, but on reflection, I think he was so fat, it wasn't funny anymore. WALL-E, however, looks rusty and hard-working and plucky, and expresses his personality with body language and (mostly) with the binocular-like video cameras that serve as his eyes. The movie draws on a tradition going back to the earliest days of Walt Disney, who reduced human expressions to their broadest components and found ways to translate them to animals, birds, bees, flowers, trains and everything else.<br/><br/>What's more, I don't think I've quite captured the film's enchanting storytelling. Directed and co-written by Andrew Stanton, who wrote and directed ""Finding Nemo,"" it involves ideas, not simply mindless scenarios involving characters karate-kicking each other into high-angle shots. It involves a little work on the part of the audience, and a little thought, and might be especially stimulating to younger viewers. This story told in a different style and with a realistic look could have been a great science-fiction film. For that matter, maybe it is.<br/><br/>Note: The movie is preceded by ""Presto,"" a new Pixar short about a disagreement over a carrot between a magician and his rabbit.<br/><br/>"

","27 June 2008. We are seeing the birth of a new form of life brought to the screen of animation. It is sometimes quiet without much dialogue, there is plenty of periodic humorous physical comedy, there is a message, a ""big"" one that is being broadcast to all of mankind here. While there are rough edges in this movie that is literally cluttered with the remains of humanity, this bold and creative adventure dazzles, makes us laugh and keeps young children's interest. There is something both childish (in this new beginning of animation) and innovative potential (there is more to come). There are fantastic physical, non-verbal communication movements in this nicely nuanced movie - there is eventually much heroism, and action-adventure surprisingly as this movie builds from its lonely, isolated beginnings. While it doesn't quite achieve the sustained underlying complexity, depth, and consistency of Spirited Away (2001) as a mature art form, the sustained action and emotional connection and powerful themes of The Incredibles (2004), WALL*E is amazing and definitely breaks a creative threshold on its own.

","Pixar continues to grow with each passing project and Wall E is a great film that continues this tradition.

"sebastian-baar","10","0","0","10 July 2018"," One of the very few movies that made me laugh, cry and think all at the same time.
","This movie is a masterpiece in terms of animation, story and characters. And as far as the latter go, Wall-E is one of the cutest, most memorable and awesome characters I've seen in animation (and movies in general). To me this movie sits right next to Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke. And while those two are more subtle and symbolic in their messages, Wall-E is way more direct but has so much charm and memorable moments that it doesn't matter.<br/><br/>At its core, the movie is a love story, but not the cheesy, cheap crap we're used to seeing in generic romantic comedies, but a real love story which doesn't seem forced or cliche. On another level, the movie is also great social commentary without turning into propaganda or having a forced political agenda. It's seamlessly tied into the story and after you're done laughing, it gives you a lot to think about. <br/><br/>This is a movie for both adults and kids and does not disappoint either. Oh, and by the way, the animation itself is one of the best I've seen. Period. <br/><br/>11/10 - would search for pizza plant again"
"RobertW311","9","0","0","1 July 2018"," Awesome animation & good story
","So back when this movie was released I got the chance to see it on the big screen, I have to say that the animation was absolutely fantastic. The story was also entertaining if not a little confusing, but overall it did make a good point, humans will eventually destroy the earth and live a sedentary life under their own technology. I like the fact that it took a less advanced robot to discover that life on Earth would be flourishing again and that humans could once again repopulate their lost home. For a kids movie it's good because kids will enjoy the characters, for adults I think it gives them something to really dwell on how they affect the future of our planet."

","This movie is a great example of how you don't need words to convey a message. The main character, WALL.E, is a robot that is cleaning the Earth after it has been too polluted by humans. Humans have left the planet and are living on a spacecraft far away. WALL.E is alone and is in desperate need of a friend. Then comes EVE, a robot sent by the human spacecraft to check whether Earth can sustain life now. WALL.E falls in love with EVE and they return to the spacecraft with a plant to prove that Earth can sustain life. Granted, it is not very believable, but if you look past the likeliness of this happening, you'll see the message behind. Apart from the 'save the Earth' message, the movie is follows the beautiful story of how the humans realise that they have forgotten the wonders of life by immersing themselves too much into technology. A great movie for kids and adults alike and definitely not disappointing."

"gregoryranky","9","0","0","10 February 2018"," A fitting tribute to classic sci-fi that adds its own touch
","'WALL-E' is on the surface, a spiritual sequel to classic sci-fi films such as '2001: A Space Odyssey', 'Silent Running' and 'E.T.', in its aesthetic, tone and subject matter. It's critical of mass consumerism, environmental damage, and human negligence. It's also about 2 robots falling in love against the backdrop of a garbage-covered future Earth, a sterile cruise spaceship and the cold vastness between the stars, all in magnificent animated splendor.<br/><br/>Several hundred years into the future, humanity has gone on an extended cruise in space whilst teams of garbage collection robots clean up Earth. At our story's beginning, only 1 of these-the titular WALL-E-is still functioning, replacing and repairing himself with spare parts from his rusted comrades. His life of compacting and scrounging humanity's detritus is interrupted one day by EVE, a trigger-happy scout robot sent by the Axiom, the largest starliner containing the descendants of humanity. When her mission is done, WALL-E stows away aboard her vessel, reaching the Axiom, where centuries of slothful living have turned humanity into immobile, childish simpletons. From here on out the story focuses on Wall-E and EVE's relationship, and their journey to return humanity to Earth.<br/><br/>Pixar has always managed to distinguish itself from Disney with style and tone (more melancholic), even now that the latter studio makes CG animated films of its own. They've stated that each film they make has a specific technical challenge to overcome, such as under the ocean for 'Finding Nemo', or foliage and hair for 'Brave'. 'WALL-E' challenged them with dust and debris on Earth, and scores of robots in the Axiom's halls. The soundtrack conveys a suitably epic scale, and never fails to give us the tender and heartwarming moments needed for a love story. Perhaps most impressive is the reliance on body language and vocal tone with a highly limited vocabulary for the vast majority of the cast, making this in many ways closer to a silent film.<br/><br/>'WALL-E' was my favorite Pixar film up until 2015's 'Inside Out', primarily as it's a rare positive portrayal of robots from a US creator, not just in it's leading duo, but in the vast array of maintenance robots that staff the Axiom, doing their jobs with care. Even the primary 'antagonist' here is primarily a set of ideas or an institution than a single being, one which whilst well-meaning, is ultimately flawed and in dire need of replacement. Most western animated films-and a good number of live-action films-make their antagonists exaggerated, one-note characters, and it's both refreshing and highly necessary to portray the film's message with the intelligence and realism that it does.<br/><br/>'WALL-E' comes recommended for Pixar fans, animation fans, robot fans, comedy fans, love story fans...buy this film, you won't be disappointed!"

"datautisticgamer-74853","10","0","0","8 January 2018"," The correct way to make ""environmental"" films and still offer more
","While flying back from Los Angeles, I had the chance to view this movie on the American Airlines in-flight entertainment. It was the one Pixar movie before their post-TS3 Dark Age that I had yet to view. So why is this my favorite Pixar film?<br/><br/>I appreciated the simplicity of the dialogue, which while not that creative, is executed differently than other sci-fi by focusing more on the robots. The setting is my personal favorite when it comes to Pixar films, as it reminded me slightly of my Ratchet and Clank-infused childhood; futuristic but indeed realistic, with so many different robots that have spoiled the human race. The humor works and the action is highly intense; for most of them I was just sitting there in awe. As for the environmentalism, it's highly subtle, but it does dawn eventually that we need to take more action to stunt the development of such a dystopia. Many other environmental movies like Norm of The North and FernGully fail because they end up becoming too preachy and pandering with the same overall message. For the characters, AUTO isn't my favorite Pixar villain, but it does encapsulate the dangers of surrendering common tasks to robots (as many other parts of the AXIOM scenes depict). The chemistry between WALL-E and EVE was delightfully complex, given how they have different and not usually overlapping directives, and how a lot of the stages allowed for a G-rated movie play out differently in this setting. Even 10 years later, the animation is nothing short of glorious, even for Pixar's standards at the time. The character designs and effects continue to resonate in an era where we have studios continuing to push out much simpler designs for characters and objects.<br/><br/>Some people who don't appreciate environmentalism may not like this movie, but I can recommend this to just about any curious viewer. It's safe for families (if a bit loud sometimes) and is, all in all, my favorite Pixar film so far. It's just one of those movies that we look back upon and say ""Really? How on Earth did we create this 10 years ago?"""

"ElMaruecan82","8","0","0","20 August 2017"," Not the emotional torrent I expected, should I apologize?
","""Wall-E"" elicited such a strong emotional response I feel almost guilty not to have been overwhelmed the way I expected.<br/><br/>Right now, it is still occupying the same spot it conquered on IMDb's Top 250, along with with ""The Dark Knight"" (although a bit lower). Those were the two cinematic events of the year and they seem to have stand the test of time and proved that they were more than timely phenomena. And yes, you can't help but praise the technological achievement ""Wall-E"" represents, and how complex it must have been to create such a unique character. But whether one character (or two) makes a movie is another matter.<br/><br/>Indeed, I have nothing against slow-pacing but ""Finding Nemo"" took you right into the relationship between Marlin and his son through a powerful five-minute opening sequence, ""Wall-E"" demands more patience and I'm fine with that but the more you wait, the more emotionally rewarding you expect the outcome to be. Well, ""Wall-E"" starts as a cute character and ends having a cute relationship; it's not exactly the most fascinating character's arc of Disney history. That's all right because there's a genuine likability in this character but he's too one-dimensional to carry an eighty-minute film, that's how I felt at least.<br/><br/>I guess I had the same reaction than with the movie ""Up"" (I saw both movies twice to make sure it wasn't just something I'd miss at first viewing). I liked the film, I can see why some moments garnered such universal critical acclaim, with ""Wall-E"", Pixar studios made quite a creation, cute as a button, with his mechanical 'body' language, the way he moves his binocular eyes, whizzes the name 'Eve' (that 'Eeee-vah' turned me on for some reason) and use his shovel arms, he manages to be both RD-D2 and Charlie Chaplin. And through Wall-E, Pixar have achieved something remarkable, another remarkable stunt, making a silent romance, made only of squeaking, buzzing and rolling and various object sounds.<br/><br/>They also made an environmentalist movie with a prophetic message about the future that awaits our Planet, Wall-E being the only robot to have developed sentience (thanks Wikipedia, I just learned a new word) and is capable to have feelings and reactions to his environment. Of course, you got to wonder how his feeling capability made him immortal and how he's supposed to be a 'he', do machines have gender or what? But these are the kind of contrivances we accept in the name of suspension of disbelief. The level of realism reached in the first act, believe it or not, makes the whole thing plausible. Because I would be believe Earth would end up like a human-less gigantic dump. Where the animals are is another question the film doesn't answer but there's a nice little character named Hal the cockroach who provides company to Wall-E, until Eve arrives and then the story takes off (for some reason, Hal doesn't seem to care about meeting a female cockroach, or is he the 'Omega' cockroach as well?) <br/><br/>But I'm digressing here, let's get back to the ""Up"" parallel. The sci-fi sequence felt like the zeppelin part in ""Up"", it came at a time where the movie needed an antagonist to advance the plot, and while there's nothing much to criticize about the part; it doesn't hit the same sensitive chord than the first act. What is the most memorable part in ""Up""? Yes, the romantic montage. So it's like ""Up"" and ""Wall-E"" are great concept movies, but it's like they rely on that simple principle defined by Howard Hawks (it's been a while since I didn't quote him) which is that a good movie if made of three good scenes and no bad scenes. If you stretch the notion of scene to sequences, you have a winner in ""Wall-E"", the encounter with Eve, the kiss in space and any other scene involving the humans. But that there aren't many bad scenes doesn't mean there's something to enjoy apart from the three memorable moments.<br/><br/>This takes me to the initial point: does the character make the film? Is ""Wall-E"" so cute and adorable that we need to follow him for almost twenty minutes, it dragged on for so long that even when EVE came, I wasn't really enthusiastic, I was more like ""God, we had the Wall-E alone, we'll have the Wall-E trying to make up with her"". Maybe I expected too much but I had just watched ""Finding Nemo"" again and the film proved that you can mix up heart with action with great visuals without trying to pull a ""2001"" and make something mature, especially when the film ends with the cartoonish representation of obese humans living in a star-liner. I liked that twist but I was wondering if the characters really belonged to the same movies, the paradox of ""Wall-E"" is that the robots are given more realism, depth and substance than the humans.<br/><br/>So I'm wondering if ""Wall-E"" wasn't actually a short film material, and the whole plot with the vessel and the mission could have been used for another movie. Maybe not but then I can't really say I enjoyed every bit, not as I would expect from such a universally praised film. Just because it deals with environmentalist issues and sends a powerful message about the way we treat Earth doesn't make it superior to any Miyazaki movie for that matter. Yes, I admire the feat of the creation of ""Wall-E"", but I don't think he was able to carry the film with his frail shovel hands.<br/><br/>And believe me, it's not that I didn't care, when the film ended, I put on the DVD bonus features and the part with the sound recording and sound design had me literally glued to the screen, it's very telling when you enjoy the making of the film, more than the film itself."
"wmullerswm","6","0","0","27 July 2017"," Splendid movie!
","Wall-E is absolutely a wonderful film. My only problem with it is its resolution. Everything goes back to perfect, and the ending is just too happy. I would personally love it more if somehow Wall-E does not recover his memories, and\or humans' interactions with the earth be more serious and severe. This, however, is almost just nitpicking because how great the movie is. There are just too many good things to say, so I will just talking about the music and the sound design. They are just just awesome. When the final conflict occurs at the end of the third act, the score chosen just keeps reminding me of 2001: Space Odyssey, and it is so well-used that the entire movie is boosted to another level. This is of course also a masterpiece of sound designs. Every movement feels real, and the entire world is left with countless imagination to our ears."

Every scene from the desolate Earth to the vastness of space bursts with some of the most beautiful animation committed to film.

","One of the greatest films ever made. The characterization is reminiscent of a simpler time in film, when body language was paramount and physical comedy dominated. Pixar made an emotional film about two robots that are barely vocal. A love story set against a backdrop with its own strong, relevant message. Not only that, the animation is done to near perfection. Focusing on atmosphere and lighting as if a live-action feature, WALLE has a powerful subliminal effect. Changing color schemes over time is a common technique, but desired results are seldom so realized. The accomplishments here took an unfathomable amount of finesse. It's truly awe-inspiring.

A slice of childhood, when 2000 year was fiction in the dish of present. Delicate pledge for human values, Wall-E is, in same time, provocation.

But the movie is not that good. Here are my reasons: 1- When the movie tries to be good, but you don't enjoy 90 percent of it, is it really good? 2- I wish they spent a little bit more time for drawing the people in the spaceship. Their drawing looks really amateur comparing to Wall-e. 3- It's nice that the movie has an ""ethical advice"" or something like that. But I don't go to cinema for JUST an advice. 4- I was bored when for the first hour of the film nobody talked."

","Please do not waste your time on this film.<br/><br/>The movie is even more flawed on a fundamental level. Should children even be watching animations about robots (as apposed to animals and fairies?) In the past Pixar has produced deeply human tales such as Finding Nemo, Toy Story, and Ratatouille. In WALL-E, the robots are intelligent, sensitive, and courageous; the humans are obese and imbecile at their best, manipulative and evil at their worst. The concept of a social satire disguised as a children's animation is as disgusting as a vanilla ice cream with a topping of foie gras gone sour."

In hindsight, I'm glad I managed to borrow the DVD from a friend as I would've hated to have spent my hard-earned money on it.<br/><br/>The movie is little more than an endless stream of in-your-face propaganda about us rotten humans wrecking planet earth, in this case by covering it completely with trash and garbage. The very notion that the earth is currently being overrun with waste and refuse is the biggest pile of garbage in reality! One stupid irony (of many) in this movie is that WALL-E doesn't separate the mountains of garbage into metals, paper, plastics, etc, for recycling, rather he only compresses it into convenient cubes so it can be thrown into a huge furnace for destruction. No wonder there's so much garbage! This flawed environmental agenda gets rammed down the viewer's throat for the entire movie.<br/><br/>The movie is slow moving and is devoid on any real plot and the two main characters are not at all engaging. WALL-E is a clumsy, simpleton robot who, for some unknown reason, falls head-over-heels in love with EVE after a single glance. EVE (EVA?) is a particular unsympathetic character as it (she/he?) is very aggressive and destructive with its (her/his?) continual practice of blasting into oblivion first and asking questions later while exploring the surroundings. As other reviewers have said, the cockroach is definitely the most interesting and likable character.<br/><br/>I can't be bothered wasting any more time and effort reviewing this abysmal movie.

","Before seeing the movie I was very excited to see Wall-e but after watching the film I feel very disappointed. The movie was not what I expected. The entire 103 minutes was nothing but Pixar pushing messages at the audience. It was disturbing to see earth and humans the way they were portrayed in Wall-e. The movie was offensive and not entertaining. The lack of dialogue made the movie hard to watch and the pacing slow. Wall-e is by far the worst of the usually outstanding Disney-Pixar movies.<br/><br/>The film makers did not go into this project looking to entertain people but to shove their opinions of the world into audience's faces. The character of Wall-e was cute but it was very hard to connect with him when there was hardly any dialogue. The film's portrayal of humans was callous and inaccurate.<br/><br/>Overall the movie disturbed me. It certainly delivered a message but the film makers could have made their point a different way. It didn't have to be so harsh and insensitive."

I have no problems with indoctrination media. However, I am already indoctrinated.<br/><br/>Beyond the fact that it is a beautiful piece of propaganda, WALL-e serves no purpose for me and I found it unenlightening and I believe that this movies has no place in the top movies of all time."
"Jacques98","4","4","12","21 September 2008"," Pixar knows how to preach clichés, but makes little effort to entertain.
","Wall-E is just sadly typical. There is nothing that hasn't been done time and time again in animated films, and then it just added on a cliché social commentary that really ruined the entire film for me.<br/><br/>Hollywood, even Pixar, simply do not understand entertainment value anymore. Action movies have turned into Lifetime TV dramas with something blowing up every now and then, horror movies have to be straightforward and predictable or they're labeled as ""lacking quality"", dramas lack realism, and originality in every drama is simply dead. But more obvious than any of those problems is the lack of ENTERTAINMENT movies have. If a movie doesn't pack a cliché commentary about the human condition, it's seen as pulp and pointless. In order to preach these cliché morals that we've known since we were old enough to talk, the entertainment value drops considerably, if not diminishes completely. And that has officially bled over into animated movies, with Wall-E carrying the cliché banner high.<br/><br/>I'll admit, when I first saw Wall-E I enjoyed it. Mostly. Wall-E himself is pretty cute. The adventure is giant and fun, and the love story was pretty nicely done, if not a little too predictable. The animation is absolutely gorgeous to look at, and shows a major improvement over the past attempts Pixar has put out. But there was hardly any humor whatsoever, the story was stale and predictable, and a lot of the movie was just uninteresting. But, as I said, the thing about Wall-E that just really bothered me was how much of the entertainment value was sucked dry to give us a social commentary that you've seen preached on the news stations every morning when you wake up. We're fat, we're using up our resources, we're polluting our planetgreat, fine, we KNOW that. We don't need a G-rated family movie trying to bash us over the head with it, what we need is a movie that is actually entertaining in a era when movies simply don't understand what ""entertainment value"" means.<br/><br/>Overall, I think this is one of Pixar's better efforts, but certainly not up to the perfection a many people seem to think it is. Not even close.<br/><br/>5/10"

","I'd given up on Pixar movies after The Incredibles, not because I thought they were not going to be any good but because of the deluge of CGI buddy movies from every studio out there, which is the same stuff churned out over and over. But then WALL·E came out and with it came fantastic reviews and nothing but praise which I though meant CGI movies had at last turned a corner and left the usual cliché stories behind. Unfortunately I was wrong and there is nothing new to see here and I think people are getting over emotional about WALL·E because it confronts them with what a lot of us know already about multinational companies and how they really only care about profits and any attempts to be 'green' to help the planet is only worth it when it creates more profit for them. There are some great moments in the movie but it just isn't as fun as the earlier Pixar movies which was evident to me after my 2 children of 6 and 8 who usually love all animated movies asked 'when is it going to finish' every 2 minutes from about half way into the movie. An OK movie but nowhere near as good as the hype and reviews suggest."
"strong-122-478885","4","3","8","28 June 2014"," Contamination Alert!
","To be perfectly honest, I found WALL- E to be one of the most frightening little stories that I've seen in a mighty long time.<br/><br/>What bothered me the most about WALL-E 's story was how I found that it made light of what I consider to be a very-very serious situation that is facing mankind on this very planet right now - And that problem is how man deals with his ever-growing headache of garbage that he continually creates.<br/><br/>One of the most horrifying scenes in WALL-E was when the ""search-craft"" was leaving Earth's atmosphere (with Wall-E attached to it) and this rocket had to literally crash right through tons and tons of litter that was surrounding this planet.<br/><br/>Now, of course, this scene was an obvious exaggeration, but, believe me, folks, tons of garbage really is out there right now orbiting this old planet of ours.<br/><br/>I guess when it comes to this particular scene, that well-known saying comes clearly to mind - ""Out of sight - Out of mind."" <br/><br/>The other brief scene in WALL-E that was equally disturbing to me clearly showed how humans were dealing with their garbage situation 700 hundred years later on the mother-ship, Axion. Here it was being compressed into uniform blocks and then (get this!) randomly fired out into space.<br/><br/>Talk about being utterly irresponsible! It completely boggles the mind to imagine this horrid thought of blocks upon blocks of man's garbage littering outer space from one end of the galaxy to the other. But, there you have it happening right in WALL-E! <br/><br/>I don't know about you, but, it sure looks to me like litter has certainly become man's legacy to this beloved planet, Earth - And to infinity and beyond, as well.<br/><br/>I also couldn't help noticing that the Axion was, in a sense, very much like a ""new age"" Noah's Ark. But the funny thing about this ""Ark-of-Survival"" was that there were no animals to be found and the ratio of whites to any other race of people looked to me like about 100 to 1. (or was it more like 1000 to 1?) <br/><br/>Yes. I do agree that when it came to WALL-E's animation, it was all so very-very wonderful to behold. But unfortunately WALL-E's story quickly disintegrated into an utterly ridiculous ""love story"" between, what came down to, a frickin' toaster and a blender. Do machines really do ""it"" better? <br/><br/>Well, the one thing that I was relieved to see in WALL-E was that in the 700 years that humans spent floating around in the Axion, getting more stupid and obese by the minute, they at least never got around to discovering another planet out there in which they could inhabit and deface with all of their horrible litter.<br/><br/>Phew! Thank goodness for that!<br/><br/>And, as a final word - Hey, don't worry about the future, all of you couch-potatoes - Little ""Wall-E"" will be there to save the day! Right!?"

The remainder of humankind leaves the planet, launching itself into space. (No, not the vast realms of empty space in Susan Sarandon's head.) Many centuries later, and the humans on the spaceship have evolved into a highly sophisticated, vigorous race of self-indulgent pigs. (Yes, a world of Beth Dittos.) It's up to a couple of robots to teach the ex-humans to stand up on their pudgy little feet again...<br/><br/>""Pixar"" once again affirms its total dominance in the field. Every release is better than the one before it, both visually and conceptually. That other company, the dump that without a hint of irony calls itself ""DreamWorks"", cannot hope to ever reach the levels of visual excellence or good script-writing that their main rivals have reached - i.e. had reached a long time ago. The best animated ""DreamWorks"" produce is far worse than the weakest that ""Pixar"" had ever done. ""Shrek"", ""Antz"" and ""Madagascar"" - just to name a few - combine to show a textbook example of a company's (creative) failure to compete with its superior rivals. (The immense commercial success of this garbage company stems from the fact that fans of ""Shrek"" are much like the chunky, semi-daft humanoids that inhabit Eve's spaceship - already quite a few of those!) Not entirely surprising, given the fact that His Royal Tinseltownic Highness The Master Schmaltz-Maker Steven Spielberg co-founded it. Of course it was going to suck! Whatever Spielberg's greedy little fingers touch nearly always amounts to nothing.<br/><br/>Apart from the excellent visuals, the solid gags, and the likable characters (even the humanoid swine are made out to be likable), ""Wall-e"" has the advantage of having a peculiar and refreshing distinction: because there is very little real dialogue, there are practically no annoying familiar actors' voices to be heard. Apparently, Sigourney Weaver lends her voice to someone, something or other, but I hadn't even noticed it. In other words, no Tom Hanks, no Mike Myers, no Cameron Diaz... a welcome relief. Most lines consist of ""Wall-e!!!!"" and ""Eve...?"" - and that's just fine as it is.<br/><br/>How do overweight people watch this film? I guess ""Pixar"" must have consciously gone the risk of alienating at least a fifth of its potential viewership. Nevertheless, they landed another hit. Could it be that overweight people didn't recognize themselves on the screen? And why was there no organization called The Anti-Defamation Of Fatties League protesting outside of America's cinemas?"

It is a good message, I would want my kids to get it and to live by it, but even a very young child doesn't need that many repeats. The plot is predicable. The anthropomorphic robots are somewhat charming. The jokes are cute, not really funny. The graphics are great. The movie steals from so many Sci-Fi movies as to look almost original, but anyone who has seen those movies recognizes them easily.

It is most certainly a love story, but it does touch on themes symbolizing economic/environmental things happening today. I mean come on, this movie has everything you need: robots, love, space, future. What more could you ask for? But seriously, the love story is my favorite part about the movie. The interaction between Wall-E & Eve is so great. I think Pixar was able to make me care more about the characters having so little dialog. Characters would then use more expressions, and the human imagination is wonderfully accurate at depicting these expressions. I want to say more about this movie, but I fear I am just rambling. But if you are planning to see a movie, and you aren't sure what to see, you absolutely MUST SEE THIS MOVIE! Every age group will appreciate this movie.

"colonel_green","10","3","8","28 June 2008"," Pixar works its magic once again.
","Over the years, Pixar has regaled us with stories involving children's' toys, ants, things that go bump in the night, fish, superheroes, and culinarily-inclined rats; so we now arrive at the next logical step: mostly-mute robots. The result is Chaplin's ""City Lights"" crossed with a bevy of science fiction (notable nods are made to productions such as ""2001: A Space Odyssey""), made with Pixar's now standard charm and craft. And the result may very well be Pixar's finest piece of work to date, which is no small thing in a catalogue that includes ""Toy Story 2"" and ""The Incredibles"".<br/><br/>WALL-E, a little robot, inhabits an abandoned, garbage-clogged Earth some 702 years in the future, after humanity abandoned the world as uninhabitable, leaving robots behind to clear things up. Over the centuries, most of the robots broke down, leaving only one, the title character. He has evolved a personality, and collects choice items for storage in his house, where he lives with seemingly the only other living creature, a cockroach. Then, one day, a spaceship deposits the ovoid probe droid EVE in the vicinity, and the lonely WALL-E is smitten. Eventually, he wins the all-business EVE's affection, before a turn of events forces the little robot (who looks like a mini-trash compactor with tank treads for legs and binoculars for eyes) to go on an epic adventure into outer space which I won't go into too much detail on, as this is a movie best experienced.<br/><br/>WALL-E, EVE, and the various other robots in the movie are triumphs of design, whose deliberately inhuman appearances do not prevent them from coming across to the audience as profoundly well-realized. This is not such a revelation as some would have you believe; R2-D2 and the magic carpet from ""Aladdin"" illustrated the depth possible and achieved here. WALL-E and EVE are a magical screen couple, despite dialogue that consists of each others' names, and some random guttural noises; inflection and some expressive eyes carry the day. The animation of the various human characters renders them more unreal in many respects, given what humanity has become in its 700-year absence. Pixar has been delivering the gold standard in CGI for years, and they don't stop here, even as the technology has become far more widespread (there were no less than three non-Pixar CGI films at my showing of WALL-E).<br/><br/>This is most definitely a film with a message, but it is artfully incorporated into the main story, which is all about EVE and WALL-E. Adults will spot more clearly the finer points of the story about environmental responsibility and consumerism (the latter is, somewhat hypocritically, perhaps, packaged in what will undoubtedly be a heavily-commodified production).<br/><br/>And, hey, you may develop a new appreciation for the film version of ""Hello, Dolly!"" while watching this."

With his little cockroach pal at his side, the two are the only living and functioning things on planet Earth. <br/><br/>One day while Wall-E's about to finish up work, a rocket ship lands, and out emerges an impressive little white robot whose purpose is to search for vegetation.

But for whatever reason, I was just ""down"" on Wall-E. But, as I am wont to do, I was convinced to go because, one, there was popcorn... and, two, there was Coke. <br/><br/>So in I went, merrily checking my watch to see when I would be getting out. <br/><br/>it seems to me that Pixar went out on quite a limb with this movie, and I don't think it quite worked. To be fair, the animation was excellent, and the story-line was... adequate. But it felt like Pixar didn't have a particular target audience in mind with this movie. <br/><br/>Most Pixar movies are meant for younger viewers... Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo to name a few. These movies all told tales that made sense to kids, and featured characters and plot elements with which younger audiences could identify. <br/><br/>But I think Wall-E missed this. <br/><br/>The somewhat linear love between the robots was simple enough, in a hackneyed way. Kids can identify with it because, well, it isn't any different from the ""love"" in any other kids movie. Also, the fact that there was no dialogue to speak of suggests to me again that this move was not targeted entirely for children. <br/><br/>The real meat of the story centered around a ship of humans who had more or less forsaken their ""humanity"" in order to live upon a variable interstellar ""Love Boat."" They were huge and unsightly, and had no real relationships outside of their hovering chairs and electronic gadgets. <br/><br/>The plight of the humans- and their eventual salvation- was too deep, I think, for the average Pixar viewer. Although it was an intriguing and interesting concept, I couldn't help thinking that the main plot belonged in a different movie. <br/><br/>Kids want fun. They want action. They want crazy hijinks and quotable one-liners that can be printed on t-shirts... and Wall-E delivered, I suppose, on a basic level. But it left me a little confused. I wasn't sure what I was supposed to think. I was not... and still am not sure who, exactly, the movie was talking to. <br/><br/>Wall-E was a decent effort, but it left me feeling a little disappointed."

Also, we get it, Hollywood thinks we pollute too much (as if there is such a thing as not polluting enough). It turns out robots do not have hearts or souls. This is the first time I have ever walked out of a movie.<br/><br/>The movie had next to zero laughs. The short before the movie was cute and funny. It says something when you get a lot more laughs from the short than from the main feature. The robots were humanized enough to frighten my children when they were put in scary situations, but not enough to make an adult care what happened to them. The animation was good because it is Pixar, but they forgot to make the characters lovable. The cutest character in the movie was a cockroach, seriously."

","Oh my, you guys wanna love Wall-E so bad you refuse to admit how bad it gets halfway through. Am I the only one seeing this...<br/><br/>The beginning truly is awesome, very quality. I thought I was watching an all-time great animated movie, then Wall-E goes to space and meets a bunch of fat humans, and it gets horrible! Really! It gets so bad...<br/><br/>It's like they spent years on the beginning and a day on the end. None of the details are there anymore, the visuals get completely dull. I mean the Captain was the only character, all the other humans were drones. What brilliant writing...<br/><br/>The second half of this flick is too simplistic and seems completely scattered. It seriously is just bad. It doesn't even look good. It's barely interesting. It's amazing the people who made the first part of this film made the second; was Wall-E a short story that had some Joe Blow writer come in and muster up this lame, uninspired ending to it? It doesn't make sense. Wall-E goes from A-quality to D-quality in a heartbeat.<br/><br/>Apparently everyone who reviewed this film just watched half of it. How else could you rate this an 8.5?!? So overrated! Eww. Wall-E doesn't want your pity rating. I give it a 6.<br/><br/>(First half of movie = 9/10, maybe even 10/10... / Second half = 3 out of 10/ Accumulative score = 1/10)"
"TheBlueHairedLawyer","4","4","13","29 August 2014"," Incredibly Stupid
","I am rating it 4/10 for its animation, and because it is a children's movie, the four stars are for that.<br/><br/>The missing six stars? Oh boy, if you love this movie you're about to hate me! Wall E is a tale of a little robot (well, you've gotta give 'em credit for creating a cute character) whose job it is to monitor and clean up the huge dramatized piles of trash left over by humans on a now-uninhabitable earth. The humans? They're up in space, living the lazy life of obesity and eating what could be Soylent Green in a cup, while robots look after them on a huge ship in Outer Space. One such fatso, the captain, discovers a cover-up of the fact that the government (apparently all nations banded together on one government?) has decided that remaining in space is a better solution. How can they get out of this mess? The answer is in a little sprout that Wall E's new friend Eva the robot has found (Eva is a soil sample collector).<br/><br/>I like pollution and hate the planet, so if you ever run into me I'll be the girl littering and spraying chemicals on the grass. Therefore I just didn't get the urge to clean up the earth after watching this. Nice effort though, Pixar.<br/><br/>Now, about the fictional mountains of garbage in this movie, uh, yeah... with all the garbage environmentalists are saying about reducing garbage these days, the scenario in this movie won't be happening anytime soon. And it's extremely difficult to believe that the fatties in this movie could ever be so oblivious as to get on a ship and get fat like that without thinking.<br/><br/>The soundtrack was nerve-wracking and the voices were bad and frankly very annoying, the movie also got very boring and I don't think kids would get the environmental message behind it.<br/><br/>Wall E is okay but not really worth it, try something else if you're smart."
"teck4201","7","4","13","29 June 2008"," Lovable little robot but lost a little interest towards the end
","First of all when I saw the trailer for Wall-E I was excited to see another Pixar film. After watching the movie I couldn't help but to wish that the story was more isolated on the two main characters instead.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the movie it was a little surprise to me with the subliminal message that they were saying but I was willing to see past that because of the little robot. He had the best characteristics from the beginning to the end of the movie and the fact that he was pretty much alone made it more interesting for me to continue on.<br/><br/>By the time I got to the second half of the movie I found that my attention was taken from Wall-E back to the subliminal messages again which seem to linger on. It became a battle for me between caring about the little robot versus caring about the outcome of the human race especially towards the end.<br/><br/>Overall I still think its worth seeing just for the production quality alone but be aware it will be a little preachy."

","I am a middle aged women who went with my grown son to see Wall-E because I had heard it was a masterpiece. True,the animation was amazing as in other Pixar films. However..it has been a very long time since I have been so bored that I kept looking at my watch. Depressing,slow paced,little plot development ...I couldn't wait till it was over! The theater was filled with kids being a "" Two Toonie Tuesday"" ($4.00) in Toronto..but you could not hear a sound from them, no laughing..giggling..yelling...just kids having FUN...like you would expect.NOTHING but silence! Where is the enjoyment in this movie?? Truthfully I felt the same way...why make a kids movie showing such depressing themes..it could easily have been ""Soylent Green"" from 1973..which was an exciting,fast paced action filled adult movie with the theme being future food shortages..but to have this theme in a children's movie..was extremely disappointing. I cannot understand everyone giving it top stars..other than the great animation!! You will be disappointed & bored..especially your kids!!!! Don't waste your money..wait for it on DVD."
"dmaboyer","3","6","23","26 July 2008"," Animated version of ' An Inconvenient Truth'
","Nothing like hitting you over the head with the ecology message. Nothing subtle about the message in this movie. Granted, most movies, especially kids movies, have an underlying message but this is to blatant. Without dialog it was mostly this wheeled machine whizzing around. That is cute for a few minutes and for the first few minutes the CGI holds your attention but with no plot you can only watch a cute CGI robot for so long. Young children will probably like this because of the cute robot but adults are going to get bored real soon. It would have made a nice 30 minute TV special but as a full length movie it was just too long. I especially could not get into the animated humans. They did not seem in anyway realistic. I would have preferred a mixture of live humans and CGI. The love story in the beginning was OK. The way Wall-E ""stalked"" EVA, but once the story left earth and got to the spaceship the plot vanished and it became dull. I did not really care that much about Wall-E. He was not cute enough to really get to like and without a voice their was no way to really get to know him. All in all, I think if they had stayed with Wall-E and EVA having a love affair on Earth and forgotten the spaceship it could have been an OK movie. But as is, like I said before, very young children will probably like it but beyond that I think it falls flat."
"clivey6","3","5","18","3 August 2008"," Heavy Metal
","Stunning visuals aside, I have to admit to not liking the character Wall-E the robot. Or his love interest; I might as well log on to a porn site to watch a dustbin humping a dalek for all the pleasure it might give me. Wall-E seemed too desperate the whole time, like a stray cat you might feed but then kind of wish he'd go away. The newer white robot seemed a stupid cow, like a bossy sort showing up at the office one day and ordering people about. Naturally Wall-E falls in love, and when she laughs it's like one of the Flinstones wives, all tee-hee shaking shoulders.<br/><br/>I got bored watching them go about their business and found the 2001 Space Odyssey reference a bit of an annoying rip-off rather than a homage. <br/><br/>I found it all a real grind, still it's mainly two characters and if you don't like 'em, that's gonna be that. I can't convey how unhappy and depressing I found this film, though I'll admit the idea is charming enough."

","Love Pixar, but,,,,,, 1. Story line was long, looong, looooooooooong. 2. Beginning was boooooring, depressing, and really set me up for wishing I had a pillow. 3. Beginning was the only part with challenging animation. 4. Middle was a vastly negative testimonial on technology replacing human fitness. 5. Middle and ending had decent but low detail animation, worse than Saturday morning cartoon stuff. 6. Ending was appropriately negative slam on humans spoiling environment. 7. Overall the movie was 15/16ths boring and depressing with about 3 minutes of hope at the end. 8. The writer disguised this negativism behind a cutsie crush between a couple of robots. This humanizing rotors was kinda weird, seeing 7/8ths of the movie was a vastly negative testimonial on technology replacing human activity and thought."
"bsman26","7","8","35","23 June 2008"," It was...OK....
","So - I really do have to say that I'm a big - dare i say huge - fan of what Pixar puts out - and I was incredibly excited about WALL-E.<br/><br/>I liked it - truly - but I didn't love it - and it annoyed me that its flaws were so apparent and so fixable.<br/><br/>To begin - what has always kept Pixar films so fresh are a few factors: 1) Facing adult issues in very direct ways that allow young people to fully understand its impact (i.e. the death of a parent) in a way that is both mildly realistic and emotionally honest. 2) There has been a concerted effort to create subject matter and humor that is equally accessible to both adults and children.<br/><br/>Many of the minor failures of WALL-E can be chalked up to the fact that a good deal of the subject matter and humor is dealt with in a way that swings wildly between material that only adults will ""get"" and enjoy, and pandering, bordering on saccharine ""kiddie"" humor - which, honestly, disappointed me a little. For how much attention to visual detail they've given this piece, I was more than a little disappointed that the subject matter (beyond the story line between WALL-E and EVE) was dealt with in an almost naive and cartoonish (in the bad sense of the word) way that belied not only the very important message that the movie was trying to say, but also belittled the intelligence of the children seeing the movie.<br/><br/>All of that having been said - it is still a pretty good movie. I just didn't think it was up to the Pixar standard of such extraordinarily well made (and written) films like ""Toy Story, ""Finding Nemo,"" ""The Incredibles,"" and ""Ratatouille ."""
"vranger","3","3","9","8 June 2009"," Journeyman effort
","Wall-e is definitely worth a watch, but doesn't match some previous Pixar efforts in a few categories: strength of plot, interesting characters, or amusing asides. Toy Story, Finding Nemo, and The Incredibles were MUCH stronger movies in virtually all areas. Arguably Monster, Inc., Cars, and Ratatouille were as well.<br/><br/>Still, you can't make those movies every time, nor re-watch them endlessly, so there is no harm in watching this movie, which is at times visually depressing but at other times a visual feast.<br/><br/>It succeeds in being interesting even though very little about either the story or its backdrop makes any sense at all. (Why would a culture with hyper-space travel sit in the middle of space for hundreds of years instead of exploring for a new planet to live on? Why would a robot tasked with finding evidence of life on the former home world of its makers blast anything that moved or made a noise without first investigating for actual danger? Why would it immediately go into a shutdown mode after finding one small sample, instead of continuing its exploration to draw as complete a picture as possible, since its purpose was to invite a possible return to the planet? I could go on and one, but I'm not going to.) Even though the story had very little real thought put into it, it is a typical Pixar technical animation feast, and is worth watching for the images no matter how much you have to grind your teeth at the story."
"whitnall","6","3","9","14 July 2008"," Definitely a kids' movie
","This movie seems to have everything going for it: a great story, a truly lovable lead character, a plot in the classic sci-fi style, amazing animation, lots of clever little visual jokes and allusions, interesting character development (Eve). The problem is the jokes aren't really that funny, and, most seriously, it's lacking any real drama. The tone is almost always kept on a very bland, non-threatening level. The movie starts out strong, on Earth, where the most accomplished, realistic animation takes place. Also, in the early scenes, the music is actually interesting (Louis Armstrong!) When the movie leaves Earth, though, it becomes more like a cartoon, and the music gets extremely bland. The group I went with were all very disappointed, based on the rave reviews we'd seen. The classic Disney movies like Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, and Pinocchio had real drama! I guess they're considered too scary for kids nowadays. (By the way, don't expose your kids to any of those scary fairy tales like Little Red Riding Hood and Hansel and Gretel - you'll warp their little minds!) Anyway, I recommend seeing this movie because it's a unique achievement, but lower your expectations."

What does that tell our children?<br/><br/>Other issues: What economic model is this based on? Who in the heck does any work? Robots with feelings? We have little idea were ours come from, much less creating them in a robot.<br/><br/>With the ease of turning out movies there seems to be fewer folks that can write a good story. <br/><br/>Don't spend your money at the theater.

"ana-horserider","8","2","5","27 January 2009"," A movie you should check out!
","I remember watching this movie with my little siblings who loved it so much. My little brother in particular loved it so much he began to beg for all sorts of Wall-E toys! ^^ (We got him some, he still loves to play with it). My sister and I had a laugh a few times and they did feel sorry for poor Wall-E picking up all the trash. Although this movie did not have THAT much talking, my younger siblings did understand the main point. Its pretty touching movie for just about all ages and has a strong effect on people's views on the planet. Wall-E is such a sweet character! You just want to pick him up and hug him! Its a great movie on friendship. Its also quite creative; I don't always see cartoons or movies that children enjoy that are based around a robotic trash collector. Its a different movie to what I usually may end up watching. You don't need violence or all this horror stuff people usually watch to make this movie worth the time to watch. Its I think if you have not seen it already, you should try watch it if possible, perhaps with friends or family. Again, fantastic and a touching movie full of smiles and different attitudes when walking out of the movie theater."
"steve2901","10","2","5","3 January 2009"," If it doesn't get a Best Picture nom at the Oscars, it won't be getting the recognition it deserves.
","Disney/Pixar's ""WALL-E"" is probably the most touching film I've seen in years, and probably one of the most original concepts in years. Forget the environmental message; it's a love story, through and through. And yes, the protagonists are robots who have a limited vocabulary, but their chemistry is more pronounced than that of other recent romances such as ""The Notebook"", and especially that garbage known as ""Twilight"". Coming from a straight bloke, WALL-E is actually the only film to ever make me go ""awww"" out loud; it's one of the sweetest, cutest love stories ever told, and the way the film Hello Dolly! is used to show how WALL-E has learned to love is genuinely moving; his early attempts to hold EVE's hands are really something. And when his devotion to his new companion is repaid, you're really jumping for joy for this little guy; it really is the most romantic film since Beauty and the Beast. The scene where WALL-E and EVE dance around the Axiom is as romantic and spectacular as the now-famous, iconic ballroom dance scene on Beauty and the Beast, the only animated film to be nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards. I emphasise this point; WALL-E, a picture that has touched and moved just as many people, surely should get more than just a nomination for Best Animated Feature. It really isn't enough for this film to win just that award. Forget The Dark Knight - WALL-E is the film that we'll be remembering from 2008."

","For several decades, some of the most brilliant scientists have been warning Earth governments, officials and their populations of the dangers of Global Warming and the consequences of not doing anything to stop it. Yet, Year after year and decade after decade, with a gigantic preponderance of accumulating evidence, our planet Earth is in danger of environmental disaster, yet few officials in any country are doing anything to stop it. They are like President W. Bush, who refuses to acknowledge our guilt, pretending it isn't our responsibility and burying their heads in the sand, hoping it will go away. This movie called "" Wall-E "" (Ben Burtt) is but one dark future ahead of us, if we do nothing. Planet Earth, 700 years into the future, has one remaining robot called Wall-E who is still carrying out it's primary function. It's job is to collect Earth's rubbish and make squares out of it and stack it into sky high column's, creating a replica of Earth distant past. Busy carrying out it's duty, Wall-E is interrupted, by a Earth probe, designed to learn if there is any plant life left on the Earth. The new probe is called Eve (Elissa Knight) and has our hero robot falling for her. The two machines are drawn together in a human-like drama which becomes a heart felt tribute to story-tellers everywhere. Both bring together the human race floating in a deep space vehicle commanded by Captain Jeff Garlin. Realizing the human cargo needs to return to their home planet, before they all sink into total atrophy, the Captain decides to head for home. Their only problem is the ship's computer called MacInTalk or AUTO who has orders to stop them. The story is compelling in many ways and is destined to become a classic. ****"
"DJMo","9","2","5","22 December 2008"," Wall-E is an instant animated classic!
","Unlike other Pixar films, I went into this one knowing next to nothing about the characters or storyline. I was absolutely floored. The film reminded me of Kubrick's '2001' and Chaplin's 'City Lights' and 'Modern Time' with Wall-E as the cute Chaplinesque robot on a mission of self-discovery and love. Eve is the perfect foil / robot love interest (whose design was allegedly influenced by the iPod). How often can a film, much less an animated film, mesh romantic silent film with sci-fi, consumerist satire, and post-apocalyptic dark comedy all in one? Sure, the ""humans are slobs"" motif is a bit heavy-handed, but I suppose our society deserves the wake-up call, subtle or not. 'Wall-E' is hands-down the greatest animated film ever made."
"98nurdinm-1","8","2","5","22 December 2008"," Wall.E
","Wall-E is a helpful trash bot, one out of many who are assigned to clean up Planet Earth in the future when the human population has made too much mess and had to evacuate. Now he is the only robot left on the planet, and his loneliness has forced him to create a personality of his own. Then a mysterious spaceship arrives and with it a sleek vision named Eve...<br/><br/>Thank god Pixar have got back on track. After the surprise dullness of ""Cars"" and the almost-good-but-not-quite-there of ""Ratatouille"", everything was riding on ""Wall-E"" if you were a Pixar fan, and there was no disappointment at all. This is probably one of the most beautiful looking, touching films that was released throughout 2008, and definitely the best looking Pixar film of the bunch.<br/><br/>The answer to this is Andrew Stanton, the genius behind that other beautiful looking film, ""Finding Nemo"". Stanton understands the importance of colour, of spectacle, whilst never giving up the fundamental idea of story. Unlike ""Nemo"" and its multi-cast of hundreds, for the first forty minutes you only ever see three characters - Wall-E, Eve and a cockroach. With every minute of this opener the film is in danger of becoming tedious due to this, and yet wonderfully, absurdly, it never gets boring for a minute.<br/><br/>Now this is obviously my opinion, a man who sat through ""The Age Of Innocence"" and thought it wasn't too bad. Unlike most of Pixar's films this is not one for the very young - not because its scary or not suitable, far from it, but because they WILL get bored easily throughout the beginning. When we journey off of Earth, out into space and finally meet some humans (and finally hear some dialogue), then interest may be sparked again - for everyone else its a joyous experience.<br/><br/>This film also forever portrays the difference between Pixar films and other computer animated works. The latter always, always, ALWAYS rely on top name celebrity voices to sell their films, no matter how good the films are, you will always hear in the trailer who is in it. Pixar never do this - even with ""Cars"" where Owen Wilson was in it there was still no mention of his name. The reason? Pixar don't need to pull this trick, especially when they're making films of THIS calibre. There are no famous voices in ""Wall-E"", save for an almost unrecognisable Sigourney Weaver who has a few lines as a computer and Pixar's good luck charm John Ratzenberger.<br/><br/>This is a very brave film to pull off and only Pixar (with maybe the exception of Aardman Animations) could do it and do it as brilliantly. There is so much sentiment in the story, with the romance that develops between the two robots so sweet and believable, more so than any human romance story I've seen since ""When Harry Met Sally"". Pixar are right back on top, where they deserve to be. Thank goodness - for a moment I was getting worried.<br/><br/>8/10"

And it happened. In June they came out with Wall-E, right up there with the best of the best.<br/><br/>Wall-E is special because for me because for a good 60% of the movie, there is almost no dialogue. In the beginning of the film, the audience is engaged by the animation, the robots, their mannerisms. Wall-E is such a vivid character that even without words we know exactly what he is thinking and feeling.<br/><br/>The story is great, the music is astounding, really just a brilliant, brilliant movie. Another Oscar coming."
"ruthierocks","10","2","5","15 December 2008"," Believe the ratings: this is the best Pixar yet.
","I was amazed by WALL-E. Not only was it adorable (as Pixar films always are), it had a deeper message than I expected. It also featured a sweet love story between two adorable robots. WALL-E features gorgeous animation, lovable characters (well, the robots anyway), and is a film that can be enjoyed for numerous reasons by people of all ages.<br/><br/>WALL-E begins with a look into the terribly polluted Earth. We watch Wall-E, an outdated robot designed to clean up the mess, and his insect friend as they go about their daily, lonely business. We learn that Earth became so polluted that a world leader sent every human into a space ship for a five year ""cruise"" as the robots cleaned up the planet. One day, Wall-E discovers a newer, more advanced robot. Her name is Eve. The two robots develop a relationship. But when Eve discovers plant life, she is forced to return to her spaceship as she was given a ""directive."" We then follow Wall-E as he tries to go with Eve and we discover some distasteful things about the planet along the way.<br/><br/>WALL-E is easily one of the best films of the year. It has now topped my list, beating The Dark Knight for first place right now. There are many elements that make WALL-E great. The characters are sympathetic, the message is simple but important, and it features brilliant animation. There's not a lot of talking throughout the film, but this hardly weakens it. If anything, we're better able to capture the loneliness that Wall-E suffers on a regular basis because of it. WALL-E can be enjoyed by everyone: children will love the cute robots, adolescents will be amused by certain quirks, and more mature viewers can appreciate the message presented. WALL-E is getting a lot of praise as being one of the best Pixar films and this is definitely deserved. This is a film that will stand up with the best of them.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Where to start? Wall-e looks so silly...a box with large binocular eyes and treadmills for feet. At first glance this seems little more than a childish escapade into science fiction for kids.<br/><br/>But if you stopped there you would be missing one of the most remarkable cinematic experiences you have ever had. For Wall-e is so much more than an animated feature, so much more than a little robot with an adventure, so much more than thousands of other similar stories that have appeared on screen before.<br/><br/>Wall-e is a tale of human stupidity. Its message cuts deep - greed and the ever-increasing want for comforts and easy living will destroy us. Wall-e is a tale of the value of life, all life, vegetable, animal, even robotic - and its connection with the planet that birthed us, the place we call home. Wall-e is a tale of resolve in the face of impossible odds, of awakening from stupor and taking action to restore our humanity. Wall-e is about a little square robot with big binocular eyes that shows us the power of friendship, of courage, of love. He shows us why we must never let go of our dreams and, above all, why we must always value our home.<br/><br/>The human expressions and gestures in Wall-e are beyond description. You could watch it as many times as you want and still be amazed at the sweetness, concern, fear, resolve, hope, and a hundred other emotions that flow through those mechanical eyes and limbs. He is truly alive, and what a wonderful gift for us that he is.<br/><br/>His obsession for grabbing Eve's hand will make you smile, his dance through space with a fire hydrant will make you laugh, his offering his life for the people's return to Earth will make tears come to your eyes, his childish but oh-so-human love for Eve will fill your heart with happiness.<br/><br/>Wall-e is a truly remarkable experience. It transcends entertainment and becomes magic. Watch Wall-e, let him fill you with his message, and go out there and be a better human to this Earth that needs you."
"Grayswain","9","2","5","6 December 2008"," Ironic Beauty
","Wall-E is one of those motion pictures that are advertised to death and raped by toy makers in order to gross mass amounts of profits and cooperate dollars, but still deep within the foundations of the film lies a message that is still as important as it is hidden. Of course Wall-E is in essence a kids movie, the cute lil robot all alone on earth who falls in love with an ipod/ sleek female robot, EVE. During the course of Wall-E's adventure all he is really trying to do is hold EVE's hand. Its heart warming to a boiling point and will make anyone feel good inside. In animation is unsurpassed and generally superb, the voice acting is very well done (there isn't a huge amount of dialouge spoken, mostly by various different robots saying either the other robots name or their own)and it is sure to delight both children, the parents and pretty much everyone who gives it a chance. Its very unlikely you will hear bad things about this movie from any person who watches it. Now back to the movies core message, which is that of global warming, over consumerism and cooperate evil. As the title of my review says, i find this extremely ironic seeing as it is Disney that has released the movie on the world, as they are in many instances the evilest of cooperations exploiting both child labour, cheap labour and profit chasing. The over all feel of this from a studio point of view is that Pixar are now able to pull away from the Disney label and become independent and that they are now un-afried to make a movie that points the finger at its main supporter. I love each and ever Disney/Pixar movie that has been realised and am eager to see what Pixar will offer the movie going public once the inevitable split from Disney comes and they can really go to town without holding back due to the evil company that they have to make money for. Disney now faces a problem, Pixar movies gross more then any independent movie it can produce, (with exception to ""favour of the month"" High School Musical and Hannah Montana, another example of that if you stick a picture on a cheaply produce piece of merchandise, the masses will buy it) Overall i love this movie, i thought it was awesome and have recommended it to more then a few people."

That's basically because my kids seem to have them on a constant loop in my house. The reason i have decided to give this the ValleyJohn treatment was the news that Wall-E maybe nominated for best movie , not best animated movie at next years Academy Awards. I wanted to know why? <br/><br/>The year is 2700, and planet Earth has long been uninhabitable. For hundreds of years, WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class) has been taking out the trash, and collecting precious knick-knacks in order to stave off the boredom of his dreary routine. Little does WALL-E realize that he has recently stumbled onto a secret that could save planet Earth, and once again make the ravaged planet safe for all humankind. When highly advanced search robot EVE makes friends with WALL-E and realizes the value of his remarkable discovery, she excitedly races back to let the humans know that there's hope for their home planet after all. But after centuries alone in space, WALL-E can't stand the thought of losing the only friend he's ever known, and eagerly follows her into the deepest reaches of space on the adventure of a lifetime. Along the way, the friendly trash-collecting robot who has always known what he was made for gradually begins to understand what he was meant for.<br/><br/>Although , as i previously said i'm not big lover of animation i can appreciate a good film when i see one. If i had to pick my favourites of recent years i would say Toy Story 1 & 2 and Madagascar top the list.<br/><br/>Wall-E is undoubtedly up there with some of the best Disney Pixar movies but i couldn't help being disappointed with what i saw.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the first half an hour when Wall-E was doing what he does best and there were some really clever moments but as soon as he clung on to Eva's ship and found the humans holiday paradise in the sky i felt it lost it's way.<br/><br/>I also found it slightly depressing. I know it's a love story and a story about hope but what a grim look on the future the makers of the film have. Give me Buzz Light year or Woody anytime over the talking trash can and the fat humans. <br/><br/>Wall-E cost 180 million dollars to make and while it certainly looks spectacular I'm baffled as to how it cost that much to make. Not that Disney Pixar care , it made a staggering 500 million dollars world wide.<br/><br/>I think it would be be a big mistake if the Acadamy enter this film as best film and not best animated film. It's far more likely to win the latter.<br/><br/>Finally the best judge of films like Wall-E are kids themselves and while my two sons enjoyed it , it hasn't been back in the DVD player since they watched it last week while in the meantime Alex and Marty in Madagascar have entertained them for 150th and 151st time. That says it all.<br/><br/>7 out of 10"

","Wall-E (2008) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Pixar film takes place seven-hundred years in the future when Earth is empty of humans because of all the trash they left behind. Wall-E is a robot system who cleans up the trash but after years of loneliness our hero comes across a new robot who is here to see if humans can return. Soon the two are on a trip through space with the human race up for grabs. I can't say this film knocked me over as much as I was expecting but there's no doubt this is a very strong film. I was mainly attracted to the film after reading interviews with the production team when they said this was very much a silent picture and that's what they were going for. I think that was a great description and they certainly did their homework as the character Wall-E really comes off like a Charles Chaplin type character. I think the film also owes a bit to Spielberg's E.T. but that's certainly not a bad thing. The animation is downright flawless and the imagination behind it is simply mind blowing. The opening thirty-minutes were probably my favorite as we see what appears to be skyscrapers but on closer viewing it's just the trash that Wall-E has been gathering. The visuals in these early scenes are quite remarkable and that includes the house Wall-E lives in with various items that he's collected over time. The stuff on the space ship is just as entertaining with all the references to Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. The one thing that bothered me about the film were the ""human"" characters. I'm guessing there was a point in having all of them look alike but I never really cared for any of them and whenever they were on screen I kept thinking they were taking away from the real fun, which was the robots."

","This...This is what movies are all about. I'm actually pretty speechless. The way Pixar has made all these animated characters come to life is miraculous. The feeling of loneliness and needing to feel love in Wall-E is a joy to watch. Sound design is absolutely awesome and Ben Burtt outdid himself with this one.<br/><br/>Wall-E has a surprisingly sad story. The characters are great and full of life (Especially Wall-E who seems to spread life wherever he goes) but the backstory and Wall-E's loneliness make this film somewhat melancholy.

","The first forty minutes of Pixar's 'WALLE (2008)' comprise the most fascinating and skillfully-executed science-fiction story since well, it's been a long time. Alone on a near-lifeless Earth centuries after the evacuation of the human race, a lone garbage robot, the last of his kind, obediently continues to carry out his duties, compacting rubbish into solid cubes and piling them into lofty buildings. The sky is brown and dusty, smothered by the detritus of Mankind's wastefulness, and the garbage cities are often bombarded by stinging dirt storms that ravage the filthy landscape. But, thanks to WALLE (an acronym for ""Waste Allocation Load Lifter  Earth-class""), there is still life to be found on our planet's barren remains. As he goes about his day, our delightful little hero picks up any odd item that happens to catch his eye  a Rubik's cube, a plastic ""spork"", a light bulb, and, dearest to his heart, a battered VHS tape of Gene Kelly's 'Hello, Dolly! (1969),' which inspires the romantic in him.<br/><br/>One day, WALLE befriends a lonesome and resilient cockroach, and the pair carry on with their job each day, even discovering a single, tiny plant growing in sterile soil. Then, one day, love comes erupting into this little robot's life. A slick, white (and female!) robotic probe named EVE (""Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator"") arrives on the planet in search of photosynthesising organisms, blasting any perceived threats with her trigger-happy plasma cannon. Needless to say, WALLE, however rusty his exterior, falls immediately in love with this beautiful feminine visitor, and what ensues is a genuinely-touching love story that serves as a charming amalgamation of Chaplin's 'City Lights (1931)' and Trumbull's 'Silent Running (1972).' Best of all, and very daringly for a children's film, this entire opening act unfolds with minimal dialogue, the two robots restricted to shrill buzzes and brief electronically-articulated utterances. Thus, their communication is almost exclusively through body language, and more meaning and emotion is recognised behind WALLE's deep, sincere eyes than is to be discerned from most real-life actors.<br/><br/>Had Pixar sustained this level of brilliance for the remainder of the picture, I would have had little reservations in declaring 'WALLE' a masterpiece. However, for its final acts, the film descends slightly from the stratosphere of excellence, and eventually begins to acknowledge its human participants. After WALLE hitches a ride on a departing spaceship, he ends up at a distant space station named ""Axiom,"" where the surviving human civilisation, now hopelessly obese beyond belief, idles away their lives before computer screens, allowing machines to cater for their every need. This commentary on our increasing over-reliance on technology (and technology's inevitable revolt) has been done to death in science-fiction, comprising everything from '2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)' to 'Alien (1979)' to 'I, Robot (2004).' In contrast to the deep, earthy colours of the earlier segment, here the colour palette is bright, vivid and almost migraine-inducing, the visual equivalent to being injected with an overdose with caffeine. These sequences work to a degree, but the human characters are ill-defined, and so all we really care about is WALLE.<br/><br/>This being Pixar, of course, the film contains countless minute details that will thrill parents who are observant enough to catch them. There's the mutinous HAL-like ship computer, that nostalgic Mac start-up chime whenever WALLE recharges, the adorable cleaning robot who feverishly scoots around the ship chasing foreign contaminants, the obligatory inclusion of both ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" and ""The Blue Danube""; I was also amused to notice a brief snippet of D.W. Griffith's 'A Corner in Wheat (1909)' when the ship captain (Jeff Garlin) requests a definition for ""earth"" {this, I suppose, is how you distinguish the true film buffs from the fakers!}. Younger audiences will probably find the film's second half  with its zany colours, funny characters and chase sequences  to be more appetising, but perhaps the more mature among us will lament the passing of that lovely, wholesome innocence in WALLE and EVE's silent courtship, a style of art practically lost in time since the Little Tramp told his girl, ""Buck up - never say die. We'll get along."""

","Pixar has done it again! I love their films, I can sit and watch any of their films with the kids and I enjoy them just as much as they do. My favorite one is still ""Monsters Inc"".<br/><br/>Wall-E teaches us some great life lessons though. Some of it's obvious, with regards to trash for example. It's definitely a good idea to recycle and try not to trash the whole world (or space too in the case of this movie) but there's some great advice in their besides that.<br/><br/>Wall-E takes us to a world where technology has made us all extremely lazy to the point where nobody does anything for themselves anymore. Not only that but it has made people anti-social toward other people. The very technology that people are so fascinated with could lead to our own undoing. By immersing ourselves in video games and online chatting all day long, we forget what it's like to just get out and talk to people...imagine that! The film isn't preachy though. It gives out advice and shows that this is one particular path we could all be headed in if we're not careful. It's great fun for the kids too. It's amazing how you start to feel genuine empathy for two robots and a cockroach.<br/><br/>Fun for the whole family, I recommend it very highly"

","When I was six years old, I used to watch all the great Dysney classics such as Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast. I remember those epic moments of the movie where something magical would happen, something that was truly unique. I would get butterflies in my stomach and I would feel like I was in the actual movie, sitting on the flying carpet next to Aladding and Jasmin. As time went by, this feeling went away. I grew up and children's movies evolved to become a bunch of 3D animals who were all played by celebrity voices. I had begun to move away from the children's movies and had moved on to more adult ones. It had come to a point where I would feel sick from just watching the trailer of Madagascar. And then..out of nowhere...came Wall-e.<br/><br/>I went into the cinema with low expectations. I was hoping to have a couple of laughs and walk out with a mild satisfaction. But I got a LOT more. Wall-e brings back that magic I spoke about. That magic that made you want to watch the movie over and over again. I knew what was going to happen. I knew that there was going to be a happy ending. But I will not forget how much emotion I expressed in that movie theater. During the middle of the film, I began to feel strange, to feel a bit warm in my tummy. At first, I didn't really react, but then I noticed. I was that same feeling I used to have when I was a child. That same feeling!! I left the cinema with my mouth open. I couldn't not believe that I had just gone through. So that is why i'm sitting here writing this for you. Yes, the visuals are impressive and the story line is great. But the feeling of being six again is incomparable. I recommend this film to everyone. But I think that only those who remember the magic that Dysney gave us, will truly appreciate how great this movie is. <br/><br/>Thank you Wall-e. Thank you for making me feel young and innocent again.<br/><br/>10/10"

"vaibhav_bhandeo","10","2","5","6 September 2008"," WALL-E : A Must Must Watch
","As the time progresses the machines are overtaking on human and replacing them in the area where we lack. While hatred over religion, race and colors is growing exponentially; the time has come to learn how to start love unconditionally from our WALL-E. If in one word I could describe WALL-E then it would only be ""Overwhelming joy"". A visual treat to watch with the characters so very mechanical yet so real that while watching you would like to be one of them. At least everyone would like to be so pure and genuine as WALL-E while they watch movie.<br/><br/>Being alone and cast away is one hell of experience but even a small spark, a simple hope could give birth to that new and everlasting feeling to spend a lifetime as our beloved WALL-E goes through while he finds his hopes in EVE, a robot sent to earth for assessing if it is livable to the human species where the only two creatures staying currently are WALL-E and his cockroach friend, a blissful one. <br/><br/>The storyline is set against the post-apocalyptic staggering climate, when the man made spectacular sky-scrapers of garbage awaiting for disposal, which shockingly remind us of true dilemmas of our time. <br/><br/>In our world, while pollution, energy, and quality of life each make up an intimidating problematic in themselves, there is an underlying human tendency, a techno-savvy and chasing the comfort of lifetime which is shockingly mirrored in WALL-E's world. In this world, humans are saturated with information, over-connected through their internet devices, yet entirely unattached to themselves, each other, and the world around them, may be the future we are moving towards where the personal touch is only left with the remote control and to the mouse click, really shocking. But technology is in no way to be blamed. The robots are only built to service human needs, for their comfort. WALL-E reminds us creating a humane personality takes time, exploration, adversity, love, fascination, hurt, pain, sacrifice and a never-ending spirit of curiosity; the qualities which sets human apart from other living creatures on earth. <br/><br/>I could not find enough words in my dictionary to praise the magnificent bit of art work put through by Pixar motion pictures; they are simply ""the best"". For the very first time I felt being short of that very hand which I would like to hold and watch the sunset while WALL-E sits next to EVE and tries viciously to hold her hand but couldn't succeed, to dance on a beautiful jazz piece toe to toe and hand to hand as WALL-E desired with EVE. I felt and went through all these emotions and I am sure everyone who was watching with me went through the same experience. I couldn't find a single moment while watching when I wasn't sad as WALL-E was or was overwhelmed as WALL-E was at that very moment. I looked the world and love through WALL-E's eyes and I must admit I had never seen life so beautiful and meaningful earlier. This is not a movie; it's an experience, of being loved, to love someone; which somehow is being getting erased from our lives. This movie isn't just an animation movie for children; it's a learning for all age groups.<br/><br/>Next time when you tell someone ""don't be like a robot without feeling"" (Sometimes our Heroes in movies are called robot for their expressionless performance) ; please think of WALL-E and reconsider you statement. I now know that even machines have heart which bits for someone and everyone."

","Truth be told, I left the cinema speechless. Pixar has truly done it again. How, I ask you, HOW, can a simple yet absurd tale of a robot that falls in love be fantastic? Which brings me to the liberty of writing this review about how this became humanely possible, and is pulled off brilliantly.<br/><br/>What if mankind had to leave Earth, and somebody forgot to turn the last robot off? After hundreds of lonely years of doing what he was built for, WALL·E (short for Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class) discovers a new purpose in life (besides collecting knick-knacks) when he meets a sleek search robot named EVE (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator). EVE comes to realize that WALL·E has inadvertently stumbled upon the key to the planet's future, and races back to space to report her findings to the humans (who have been eagerly awaiting word that it is safe to return home). Meanwhile, WALL·E chases EVE across the galaxy and sets an adventure into motion.<br/><br/>If there is something to love about the film, it is the main characters WALL·E and EVE. The two are astonishingly lovable, adorable, and without a doubt appealing. The chemistry between them is just gorgeous, and will make you believe that robots can actually fall in love. Without hesitation, dating couples should see this film for this reason alone. No really, I mean it. The two characters are personified and makes them more human than any of us could believe.<br/><br/>What works for the two protagonists is that there is little, if none, traces of dialogue between them, so they communicate via means of body language, and it is executed perfectly. Because of this trait, we are able to understand their profound feelings towards each other, making them two of the most genuine and everlasting characters you'll ever see in media history. There are also some other robots to watch, and a cameo appearance by Sigourney Weaver (of ""Alien"") as the Axiom's computer.<br/><br/>The animation is fluid, clear, and beautiful. From the wastelands of (possible) future Earth, to the vast infinite borders of space to the bright and lively display of the Axiom, the drawings are unbelievably beautiful and realistic. The Pixar team and director Andrew Stanton really gave their all and determination to brush their vision across the big screen. All I can say is, their hard effort paid off in more than full.<br/><br/>The moral message is also clear - 700 years in the future we have polluted Earth to such an extent we have to live in outer space, the final frontier. As a result of relying too heavily on machinery, human evolution has resulted in the decrease of bone mass, making them obese and literally couch potatoes. This is a nice and not too harrowing reminder of the possibilities and consequences of polluting the Earth and relying heavily on machines too much.<br/><br/>With its lovable characters, beautiful art, and majestic scale, I crown WALL·E the king of animated features thus far, as well as one of the best romantic tales of the era. Seriously. Do yourselves a favor and watch this piece of art. It's one not to be missed by men, women, children (and robots) alike.<br/><br/>9.9996/10<br/><br/>Delton"

Especially in my country, Indonesia where a lot of people chose to watch awful horror movie, an adventure Mummy movie, and an 'adult' comedy. It just so sad when I saw a lot of people didn't go to see Wall-E. They miss an achievement in cinematic experience. But what makes me even sadder, is the fact that a LOT of people didn't get the movie. They said it was boring, stupid, weird, etc etc. Well... I gotta say (and I rarely say something like this...) they have the worst taste in the movie.<br/><br/>Wall-E (the movie) is the example how you can see an ART form in front of you, moving with the most poignant and beautiful story ever told. The execution was flawless, the editing, even the cinematography is the best I've seen in the movie for a long long time. The screenplay was beautifully done. The last movie with the best screenplay I've ever seen is last year's No Country For Old Man. Wall-E is on the same level if not better.<br/><br/>It's not 'only' animated movie. It's a love story / science fiction / adventure / drama / comedy movie that so good you won't GET all of it at the first viewing. You HAVE to watch it again and again. And believe me, every time you watch it you'll got something new from it.<br/><br/>Pixar IS the best film studio out there. And I can't jealous enough for the Americans to have one of the best film studio. I really hope my Indonesian fellow could learn from Wall-E, how do Pixar crafted such a perfect characters. How they can makes us understand everything that the characters said without a words. <br/><br/>Wall-E is a 10. This is a movie specially made for you, IF you loved movie, IF you understand what art really is, IF you are mature enough to digest something as complex as this, than Wall-E is for you.<br/><br/>But if you're looking for sex, stupid chasing scene, hot girls, brainless entertainment, it's NOT for you..."

The first 30 minutes of the film has no dialogue at all, only sounds, beeps, etc. However, the film doesn't even need dialogue to tell you how the characters feel. This is all achieved by body language and the sounds they make. Pure amazement. This film is definitely at the top with other Pixar movies, like Toy Story, The Incredibles, and Finding Nemo. It isn't only one of the best movies of the summer, or year, but all time. This will definitely go down in movie history. Even if you are not a child or don't have any kids, you will still enjoy this movie. Just because it is animated doesn't mean it is a children's film. If you are a Pixar fan you will love it even more. It towers over the 2006 film Cars, which is a failure in my opinion. You should definitely see this movie. Pixar has mastered the realms of living toys, bugs, monsters, fish, super heroes, rats, and now robots. This film is worth your money.

Wall-E had everything every Disney/Pixar movie did, but in vastly larger quantities.<br/><br/>Graphically, this is perhaps the most beautiful film ever made.

The sequence where WALL-E and EVE are ""dancing"" is one of the more spectacular visual sequences in recent memory.<br/><br/>The story, as is Pixar's habit, is touching and deeply sad throughout. There are quite a few ""tear-jerker"" moments, but for extremely right reasons. WALL-E, it turns out, is one of cinema's more ""human"" characters. The plot is very simple and there is almost no dialog, just each robot's strange, endearing way of greeting each other.<br/><br/>This film has set the bar for animated film-making and will be used as an example in every graphic design textbook made from now on. WALL-E touches briefly on matters of a pseudo-political agenda dealing with large corporations, but the statement is made with crystal clarity and for the right reasons.<br/><br/>Everything about WALL-E screams ""Oscar"" at the top of its lungs. If this isn't nominated for Best Picture, I'll be terribly surprised.<br/><br/>WALL-E now holds the unique place of being what I think to be the greatest animated film of all time.

Oh yes, I wouldn't lie. <br/><br/>""Wall E"" has a very simple yet effective plot about a cleaner droid left on earth to tidy up our very dirty planet while the humans go on a ""space cruise"". After many, many years Wall E is the only droid left and his only companion is a little bug. That is until an investigator droid named Eve comes and leads him on a grand adventure. <br/><br/>Something about this movie really connected with me. Everything was so well done, like the film was made by ultra high strung perfectionists. The filmmakers convey a world of emotions from Wall E, yet all he ever says is ""Eeva!"" Sorry R2-D2, I have a new favorite robot. They have gotten so good at the CGI that everything looks like it's completely real. You will laugh so hard at parts that you might fall on the floor. Like a scene on an immaculate spaceship where Wall E makes a mess and an obsessive-compulsive robot throws a fit. <br/><br/>And don't even get me started on the short film called ""Presto"" which opens the film. It's about a hungry little rabbit and his magician owner who refuses the poor bunny his carrot unless he does tricks. I will warn you not to partake of any popcorn during this short lest you want to choke and have to call an ambulance and miss the amazing movie. <br/><br/>Pixar just keeps stepping it up movie after movie and they never fail to please and enchant with quality films that kids and adults alike will adore for ages. ""Wall E"" will go down as one of the greatest family films of all time."
"blanbrn","8","2","5","7 July 2008"," Well done. Nice and clever work again from Pixar. Marvelous feature.
","I for one have never been a big fan of animation or cartoon type films, yet something just interested me about ""WALL-E"" it just seemed like a nice and cute touching tale of a lonely moving robot about to start his journey thru the planet. I must say after seeing it that I wasn't letdown either overall it was pretty impressive work everything from graphics to the style of it's story with the fantasy characters living in cool settings. Starting in a rusty desert of junk where the only living thing that moves is square robot ""WALL-E"" who has such catchy and droopy binocular eyes. Much of the first parts of the film we see the robot as stubborn and alone as the action and journey of discovery doesn't really take off till he meets up with a landed spaceship and another ray eyed robot ""EVE"". This movie is clearly a film of discovery a new type of journey that involves future themes of space and saving humans with the central hero being a robot a lifelike possibility with the technology of the future as machines and droids may soon rule the planet. This may not be your cup of tea yet no matter your age check it out you''ll have a fun and mind exploring time watching it."
"airish-3","10","2","5","7 July 2008"," WALL-E is relevant, intelligent and terrifying. And great for the kids, too.
","I am thrilled to think children across this great land have dragged their parents to see what seems a harmless kid's movie, but what really is a searing and frightening critique of our way of life. That said, believe it or not, WALL-E is a delightful animated movie, probably among the best I've ever seen and certainly the finest Pixar has yet produced. The tale of robotic romance holds plenty of comedy - from guffaw-inducing slapstick (reminiscent of the masters of the silent screen) to splitting satire, WALL-E is a funny and entertaining film for both kids and adults.<br/><br/>But onto the deeper side of this fun animated film, WALL-E is the only mainstream movie that hits exactly what's wrong with America and exactly what will happen if things don't change quickly (only there's no G-rated interstellar second chance for us). Beyond the befoulment of Earth, however, WALL-E offers its most pressing lesson in space. Pixar envisions a Corporation-State whose omni-convenience has turned men into jelly. This process has even reached the person running the show, the ostensible captain. In WALL-E, the machine is no longer the servant of man, the man is the slave of the machine. With homage to Kubrick, the film gives us a much more disturbing and relevant Hal. Do we even have the capacity to change course and prevent the environmental devastation that awaits? Or is Buy N' Large at the controls - not a person, but a machine?"
"nruss78-1","10","2","5","7 July 2008"," This film should be seen by all
","This is a kid film for certain. With goofy characters, lively animation, and dialogue and action aimed at that demographic this film further shows Pixar's ability to deliver brilliant kid films. The animation is a technological marvel; this will be studied by art students in the future even more so than Toy Story and Shrek. But I would recommend this movie for all ages because it will appeal to everyone who's ever been to a land fill, played a Massively Multi-Player Online Role Playing Game, or used a sensor to flush a toilet. For it's also a film that will horrify you and make you laugh all at once. It depicts a very possible future for humanity and, because of this, is probably one of the most important films of the year, if not of the age. There were times when I just sat, mouth agape, in awe at the horrifying nature of things while all manner of goofy adventures occurred on screen. And yes, I can guarantee that this film is still a kid film, since the sensibilities used in it are still aimed, even with such a reaction as I had, at that demographic first and foremost. This will change how you view a recliner and remind everyone who sees it how much danger over consumption really poses to the planet, all the while in a package well made for kids of all ages. I predict this movie will be on the next list of AFI's Top 100 Films of All Time and is a very strong candidate for all awards that deal with film/animation/and the like. This is a film that is well worth the ticket price, even of the most expensive variety. In short, see this film regardless of how old you are and even, if you must choose, over other blockbusters like Iron Man and Batman: The Dark Knight. It's simply that good."

","WALL*E is a true masterpiece. I won't reveal any part of the story, but I will say the story is touching, at times funny, at times heart-breaking, and overall extremely remarkable. WALL*E himself is an adorable creature, the kind of person who needs others but can't have them, and that situation is tragic in a way but has potential for a heart-warming story.<br/><br/>WALL*E is a wonder in every sense- the story, the art, the characters, and especially the message.<br/><br/>When leaving the theater with my family, my father heard a women say, ""I think I'm going to go take a jog and plant a tree."""

Is this movie as good as Starwars? NO! But it's not fair to just vote '1' because you think it shouldn't be in that rank. If you completely hated the movie then say why you hated it. Do not just vote it down because people enjoyed the movie.<br/><br/>I Think this is probably one of the best Pixar movies in a while. Second only to The Incredibles, and maybe Monsters, INC.

"PulpVideo","9","2","5","6 July 2008"," Fall in Love with Machines Falling in Love (again!)
","WALL-E is the third love story in a row from Pixar, and they just keep getting better at it, as it seems with everything they do. It's only been 2 years since they first made us fall in love with machines falling in love in ""Cars,"" yet they have outdone themselves this second time around, pairing two robots separated by centuries and light years of space.<br/><br/>As with ""Cars,"" the folks at Pixar have gotten us to care so deeply about a pair of machines that during the most touching, romantic moments, the audience was absolutely quiet. At several points in the film I could sense the baited breath and hear the sobs.<br/><br/>I'm sure that by now you are familiar enough with the storyline that nothing needs to be said here about its particulars. I will add that it was amazingly unique and quite strong, even though there was barely any dialog between the main characters.<br/><br/>What I think was best about the film was the depth of involvement I had with the characters (which the audience clearly shared). I had just come from a more packed showing of ""Hancock"" and though it was fun, I just didn't care for the characters nearly as much, even though they were human---well, sorta.<br/><br/>The visual effects in ""WALL-E"" were as brilliant as any CGI to date, and there is an imaginative ""dance"" that is fun to watch. As always, Pixar has done a great job of mixing the very realistic & gritty with the soft & cartoonish.<br/><br/>If you have to choose only one movie to go to for the next few weeks, ""WALL-E"" is hands down the pick to make, even over ""Hancock.""<br/><br/>And, if you are just coming around to collecting Pixar films on DVD, in my opinion, this is a tie for first with ""Finding Nemo."""
"theantimonyelement","10","2","5","6 July 2008"," Proof that a Pixar is worth a thousand words
","Wall-E, Pixar's newest blockbuster, is more than merely a feel-good summer flick with cute robots and a happy ending. Surprisingly, a whole lot more. Its message is both superb and sobering, a haunting and starkly beautiful view of one possible future. With graphics that do for earth, air, and space what ""Finding Nemo"" did for water, it is a visual delight for all ages. Wall-E, EVE, and their pet cockroach are unbelievably cute (even the roach). The storyline is clever, quick, and accessible at every level, from a fun space adventure to a hauntingly sad--yes, sad, at least at first--story of what humankind lost when we left earth. And also how we can find it again, through the help of one little machine who has learned how to love. But perhaps the most amazing part of this film is not the incredible graphics or the tight, heart-string-pulling plot.<br/><br/>It is the complete lack of dialogue. With the exception of the few scenes featuring humans, the movie is carried out by showing, not telling. The titular character Wall-E and the love of his life, EVE, ""speak"" each other's names, but little else; the only humanizing sounds present in the first fifteen minutes of the movie come from a recording that Wall-E plays to keep himself company. His loneliness is palpable and heartrending in the extreme.<br/><br/>And he doesn't have to say so. The folks at Pixar have outdone themselves here; Wall-E's message is not shoved down our throats, but is both subtle and poignant. Something about this little machine embodies what it means to be human: to long for companionship and something beyond what we can see. The fact that the film can create such an emotional 3-D-ness about Wall-E without the need for words is truly proof of Pixar's genius. Such a tactic could have failed utterly, but here it succeeds in brilliantly transforming a good film about cute robots into an amazing visual and aural feast. Ratatouille's Remy would be jealous."
"shawn_m_roeder","10","2","5","6 July 2008"," Great Family Entertainment
","Once again Pixar has created a great G-rated film for adults that children also enjoy. Much of the comedy in this film is reminiscent of silent films of the past. I saw this at the drive-in during a fourth of July fireworks display. Even though I did not hear much of the film over the fireworks, I do not think I missed much. It was still hysterical.<br/><br/>My children laughed as much as I did. I do not think they will be pondering how scary this film actually is though. After burying the earth in so much trash that the planet has become uninhabitable, humans have become hi-tech couch potatoes in space. This film is just as frightening as it is funny. The laughs come instantly. The message sinks in a little later. While highly entertaining, this movie is more than the usual audio-visual candy for the ears and eyes that has become the standard of summer entertainment."
"vovan_xm","10","2","5","6 July 2008"," More than you could've ever expect
","Kind and serene, yet strong and meaningful.<br/><br/>These are the feelings you'll definitely get by viewing this movie. No need to speculate over its similarities with the masterpieces from the past. There are always things one may not like (one may be even bothered by the Mac sound WALL·E does when charging, although quite a deserved tribute to Steve Jobs and his effort to bring Pixar to all of us). But besides the beautiful details, there is something more. The idea, and what's even more important - the atmosphere of WALL·E will fascinate any viewer, whether he is a child, a teenager or an adult. For sure this animated movie will run for at least another Oscar, but it doesn't even matter as long as seeing it time after time is still an enjoyable activity."
"KUAlum26","9","2","5","4 July 2008"," I keep waiting for PIXAR to let me down;alas,it hasn't happened yet
","I've seen practically all of the PIXAR productions for the big screen,and I am drawn to them for the exact reason that I'm convinced that,sooner or later,they will fail me:namely,beautifully crafted imagery and stories with memorable characters and the belief that they will,in their lack of uniformity or decreasing inspiration,become disappointing.<br/><br/>It hasn't happened yet,and in fact this may've been an up-tick.<br/><br/>The title character,a garbage collecting drone,has spent seven centuries performing the lonely and depressing task of cleaning up the unimaginably voluminous waste left behind by a futuristic mankind that has been consuming cheaper and cheaper materials and disposing them at an inequitable rate. As Earth has become uninhabitable due to this accumulation,there is precious little able to function in this world(save the cockroaches,of course),but this does not,somehow stifle WALL-E's ability to gradually become sentient,developing thoughts,emotions and longings that he doesn't fully understand but is oh-so-familiar with. His encounter with a exploratory droid named EVE will not only change his destiny but will create a ripple effect on the world he's been(and mankind's descendants have not been) familiar with.<br/><br/>Director Andrew Staunton is more like the team project leader on a large-scale animation project that defies description. Very limited voice-work(with choice cameos by KAthy Najimy and PIXAR reg JOhn Ratzenberger to back Jeff GArlin's turn as the captain of a traveling space habitat)is able to fill in mostly gaps where the robots cannot fill,which isn't much.<br/><br/>I won't go into which PIXAR films are my favorites and which aren't,but suffice it to say that even the weakest of their creations is still some of the best animation out there and could stand up against even some NON-animated films out there. This has an appeal that can stretch generations and a quality that is unique despite any of its flaws(i.e. preachines,cute,hidden agendas and standard ""happy ending"" canards you find in animated films,PIXAR or no). And while I feel like PIXAR's next offering may be the one to finally really disappoint,after this film,it wouldn't surprise me if it didn't."

This movie will make you feel a broad array of emotions from happiness to sadness to anger. wall-e and eve complement each other in this movie more so than any human pair so far this summer.While there is no dialog apart from a few words, the message is very clear;it is simply a love story.Two beings that would go to the ends of space for each other, that is the true meaning of a love story. Frankly the addition of words would have made the movie less appealing. This is a must see for everyone."

"Matt_Layden","9","2","5","3 July 2008"," Pixar Has Yet Another Incredible Film Under Their Belt.
","WALL-E is a robot left on Earth to compact garbage into little squares after humans have left because the planet can no longer sustain life. 700 years of doing what he's been programmed to do and his only companion is a little cockroach. One day a giant space ship lands on earth and sends out a robot named E.V.E who must complete a classified mission.<br/><br/>As soon as I saw the teaser for WALL-E I knew it was going to be something special. What I did not know is that it is one of the most original and entertaining films I have ever seen. Pixar has an incredible list of films under their belt and is the leading studio in animation, WALL-E have a spot at the top of that list and has set the bar for future animated films.<br/><br/>Why does WALL-E stand out from the rest of the animated films that have come before it? Is it the incredible detail in the animation? The lack of dialogue for it's main characters? The epic adventure? The story or morals? Wel, it is all that and more. The first half of the film has WALL-E doing his daily routine of garbage compacting. Without a single word spoken we know everything we need to know about this character. The old saying of ""show, don't tell"" is used here and perfectly I might add. Through the endless fields of garbaged packed to level the skyscrapers we know that WALL-E has been here for hundreds of years and that the world is nothing but a baron desert. We know that we as humans did this to ourselves. We are given a quick back story through futuristic billboards that activate on motion when WALL-E passes them. WALL-E collects items from the trash that he finds interesting, everything from an iPod to a Rubik's cube. He examines them and tries to learn them, as if an alien from another planet were to come to earth and try to learn about our species. E.V.E arrives and WALL-E instantly falls in love with her, trying to win her affection at every turn and she turns him down every time because it's not her directive.<br/><br/>This first half of the film has the most realistic looking creations I've seen in animation. Every close-up of WALL-E (specifically when he plays his radio device) looks amazingly realistic. Almost as if this is occurring in our world, it's not until we get to the second act that we begin to see more vibrant and animated aspects of the film. After WALL-E offers E.V.E a plant he found, she scans it and takes it. The ship she arrived on comes back, we begin to put thing together and WALL-E hitches a ride into space, a place he only dreams of. The mother ship is where all the humans are, they are fatter now because they are waited on hand and foot by robots, they are driven around on hover chairs and are constantly talking to another on a futuristic video phone, so much that they don't even realize the place around them. They don't even need to get out of the chairs to change their clothes, one press of a button and you go from a red suit to a blue one.<br/><br/>The film throws back to the days of silent films and the lead character , WALL-E manges to show more emotion in a single look then some of the finest actors today do in whole films. The introduction of humans is when 90% of the dialogue kicks in and the plot is kicked into motion. I won't give it away because it is an important part of the story. The appeal of WALL-E is universal, everyone can connect to him through his actions. He is a cute, lovable and ultra-cool robot.<br/><br/>WALL-E has been roaming Earth for so long that he takes the parts of other WALL-E robots so he can sustain his directives. He's rusted and falling apart everywhere, yet has a big heart. E.V.E is sleek and beautiful, yet dangerous. She can destroy you in a blink of an eye. These two robots are obviously from different worlds, have different directives, yet share a connection. What most animated lack WALL-E has. Most animated films as of late (Save for PIXAR) aren't adventurous enough. Kung-Fu Panada stays within the village. Even the Shrek films seem to be lacking in adventure. Both of those films created worlds that could go on forever, yet they never explore them. WALL-E seems bigger then it actually is and it's ten times more entertaining. <br/><br/>It's one an only fault is that t becomes too preachy. It has a message and it gets it across, but it seems to beat you over the head with it. It's forgivable since the film flies through it's running time and has a grand epic scope of adventure that kids will love and adults will cheer. This is the first time I actually loved an animated film. Finding Nemo, The Incredibles and Ratatouille are all great films, but I never had a strong connection to them as much as WALL-E. WALL-E is one of the best animated films of all time."
"Dmagic5000","10","2","5","3 July 2008"," WALL-E soars in triumph and is out of this galaxy
","Having Seen WALL-E twice now, I can definitely say that out of all the movies i have seen this year, WALL-E is without a doubt the greatest of them all.<br/><br/>What if mankind had to leave Earth, and somebody forgot to turn the last robot off? After hundreds of lonely years of doing what he was built for, WALL*E (short for Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class) discovers a new purpose in life (besides collecting knick-knacks) when he meets a sleek search robot named EVE. EVE comes to realize that WALL*E has inadvertently stumbled upon the key to the planet's future, and races back to space to report her findings to the humans (who have been eagerly awaiting word that it is safe to return home). Meanwhile, WALL*E chases EVE across the galaxy and sets an adventure into motion. Joining WALL*E on his journey across the universe is a cast of characters including a pet cockroach and a heroic team of malfunctioning misfit robots.<br/><br/>WALL-E Works as a sci-fi, romance, comedy, and as an adventure movie. The animation is breathtakingly gorgeous. As WALL-E travels through space it is truly breathtaking as he passes the planets and as he looks back on the galaxy. WALL-E is perfectly animated, His eyes being the best feature. One look at him and the audience is immediately attached to him. That shows how good the animation really is.<br/><br/>I liked the romance between the two characters. Yes, it was corny at points but it worked. As i watched, i thought that it was a real romance; that it could work. I truly believed that they cared for each other. Their expressions were perfect and made me believe further. <br/><br/>The first half-hour plays like ""I am Legend"" which was another great film. WALL-E travels around a earth that is abandoned much like Will Smith. This was a triumph on it's own. Here, there is very little dialogue, only action and movements and expressions. This was truly engaging. I couldn't believe that it was keeping my attention. Watching WALL-E move around and do what he does was just so beautifully done and so beautifully animated. It truly was a remarkable moment. I actually think this is the best act of the film here. It is so well executed and as an audience we get to learn about WALL-E and watch his character develop. Then when Eve comes we watch, through very little dialogue WALL-E falling for Eve. What I found remarkable was that they were able to illustrate WALL-E's feelings for Eve through actions and without dialogue. This is total triumph. It extremely illustrates just how beautiful the animation really is. While Act 2 and 3 are wonderful as well, The first Act With WALL-E on earth alone and then with Eve is really the better and most remarkable part and conveys just how moving the story really is.<br/><br/>WALL-E is without a doubt the best animated movie that i have ever seen. I will buy it when it is released onto DVD, and i will be able to enjoy it as much as i want. WALL-E is a great, fun and amazing experience that the whole family can enjoy. Watch for it at the 2009 Academy Awards as it wins the Best Animated Feature award and many critics are also predicting that it could become the second animated film nominated for Best Picture, an event that i can definitely see happening. Go out and see it and be ready to e taken to another Galaxy. WALL-E is as close to perfect as you can get.<br/><br/>10/10"

","wow. i came into the theater expecting something as good as last year's Ratatouille(which was just short of perfect). I was blown away to say the least. The things i was most impressed about was Pixar's ability to tell a beautiful, adorable, and an incredibly ballsy story.<br/><br/>You can't not fall in love with every character. Wall-E's quirky and curious personality playing off EVE's mixture of cold but also lovable personality make for tons of laughs. By the end of the movie you'll be cheering so much you'll think you're at the Super Bowl.<br/><br/>Wall-e reminds me of No Country For Old Men in a werid way. Wall-E and NCFOM both are incredible films, but i think one of their biggest similarity is feeling of dehumanization. that is most apparent in the any of the scenes with the fat people. it hits a little too close to home for a lot of us.<br/><br/>If no one else is going to say it, i will: Wall-e is easily the best movie of the summer so far and in the running for best film of 2008"
"jstnblke41","9","2","5","3 July 2008"," Unbelievable
","I'll keep this brief, I saw it tonight with a friend and I have NEVER seen a movie that has touched me as much as this one did. With Wall-E, Pixar has, I feel, truly mastered nuances of film making. It is tough to say everything without saying nothing, but in the first half hour or so of the film, where there isn't a single real word spoken save for Eve and Wall E, everything was set up perfectly. What Wall E is doing on earth, how caring he is, how innocent, just everything.<br/><br/>I loved the commentary on humans in the future too, you'll have to see it for yourself but I thought it was done tastefully without saying outright how messed up we could be poised to come.<br/><br/>I think that kids will really enjoy this movie, but I think adults will appreciate it. There is enough slap-stick with Wall E falling down and getting pummeled to keep everyone laughing, but there are parts that I haven't seen real human actors do even 1/2 as effectively. It had me tear-eyed at several parts. I loved this movie, and I'm sure you will love it too."
"topherwriter","10","2","5","2 July 2008"," Different...but in a good way!
","I just saw this movie last night, and I've got to say, I can see why people have rated it so high. After I walked out of the theater this man told me ""It was sure different that's for sure,"" and he was exactly right, it was different but it was different in a good way.<br/><br/>Part of what makes it different is the fact that there is very little dialogue. The movie forces you to pay attention to the action rather than what they are saying. This isn't very hard though because the action and the scenery is very intriguing to watch. For example when the robot named Eve is first introduced she floats around the land in such a way that is very beautiful, and very pleasing to the eye.<br/><br/>What makes this movie especially great is the amount of character development it has achieved with the lack of dialogue. Wall-E never talks except for when he says his name or the name of Eve. This movie shows rather than tells, and that is quite an accomplishment. Rather than Wall-E telling someone what he desires, this movie uses various ways to show it.<br/><br/>With this character development comes the concern for the characters. Throughout the movie you are concerned about what is going to happen to Wall-E and his robotic friend Eve, but mostly for Wall-E because he is so fragile. In the beginning, Wall-E makes friends with a cockroach, who's name is never given, but despite this, I often felt concern for the bug, and I wanted it to survive.<br/><br/>Another thing that makes this movie different is that it is a social commentary. The thing I liked about this is it's not all about environmental issues (though there were some), but it is also about social issues that we as humans are headed towards-though they are shown in the extreme. I won't reveal what these issues are, because you will have to see it for yourself.<br/><br/>Wall-E is certainly different from any other Pixar movie, but that is what makes it great! 10/10"
"steeped","8","2","5","1 July 2008"," Great movie and message(s).
","Wall-e was a 700 year old robot and the last of it's kind on Earth. Since garbage and pollution on Earth rose too fast over the 22nd century because no one was ""green"", the earthlings decided to leave their home planet and live on a massive, technologically advanced ship. Of course with the advancement in technology over the century, some robots can't think for themselves such as the evil ""autopilot"" which turned rogue. But as you can expect, Wall-e is very smart and can be considered a person as he has the basic feelings of loneliness and the need for a companion.<br/><br/>What makes this movie amazing is the camera-less cinematography. The computer generated images of the deserted Earth is stunning, and throughout the movie I was just magnetized to the amazing scenery. It was done so well that it really makes you feel for the poor robot and makes you want this piece of metal to succeed.<br/><br/>Along with the amazing artwork, this movie is loaded with different messages which can teach morals to the adult and children audiences. Being green and recycling, obesity and loneliness are all very well told, and even though we may already know that pollution is a problem and that exercising is important, this movie really opens our eyes as the story of this one robot's troubles can be related to todays modern society."

This earth trash shattering robot is definitely the most appealing character graphically drawn up by the Pixars. ""Wall-E"" stands for ""Waiting Amazingly Long Lines- Exasperatedly"", No! It actually stands for ""Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class"". Wall-E is a small waste collecting robot who is in a solitude futuristic earth with just a tiny pet cockroach to keep him company. However, Wall-E is not a total waste because he is very ingenious in doing the garbage work in a very compacting and useful manner. Wall-E is primarily a love robot who craves for the robotic touch of a Mrs. Roboto. Before you can say ""Hello Dolly"" (which is the film Wall-E constantly sees in his trashy apartment, lol) he falls for a female robotette named Eve which has traveled to earth to evaluate living organisms. Wall-E and Eve fall in love and then Wall-E eats a devilish apple which thenÂ… (Wait! Wrong Eve story here). OK, here we go: Wall-E eventually follows Eve into a grandeur spaceship which takes him out of the earth-lands. In the second chapter of ""Wall-E"", the film turns into an insightful environmental lesson on the futuristic fate of our universe via Wall-E's hilarious, passionate, romantic, generous, and heroic ""space cadet"" spaceship adventures. Director Andrew Stanton brilliantly provides homage to Stanley Kubrick's classic ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" by inserting elements of the Odyssey into ""Wall-E""; i.e. Blue Danube space, a similar HAL villain, the fate of mankind, etc. Somewhere in ""Stanton Island"" there is a Stanley Kubrick Memorial! There is not much dialogue in ""Wall-E"", but I must verbalize that it was the way to go in the ""Wall-E"" tale since it is Stanton's marvelous directorial orchestration that is the primary presentation tool of ""Wall-E"". It would be a waste if Stanton is not nominated for a Best Director Oscar nomination! ""Wall-E"" is the love guru that you should really be watching this summer! ""Wall-E"" will not be a waste of your time! One of the best films of 2008! I am not being off the wall when I say that ""Wall-E"" is so far one of the best films of 2008! Take off and see it today! ***** Excellent"
"SHarris11-1","10","2","5","30 June 2008"," Masterpiece
","While I was watching Wall-E, something weird happened to me; I actually felt like I was a kid again. When I got out of the theater, I had the biggest smile on my face, despite the fact that the people I went to go and see it with called it mediocre. All of Friday afternoon I could not get Wall-E out of my head. So I went and saw it again that night. And Sunday afternoon. Why? Because Wall-E is not only one of Pixar's best, it is also the best animated film I've ever seen, the best kid's film I've ever seen, and one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. <br/><br/>Now that's not saying that it's for everyone. As with all great movies here at IMDb, there always has to be some people that declare The Godfather as the worst movie they've ever seen because stuff didn't blow up. I'm not talking about those people though. I'm talking about almost every kid that has seen an episode of The Suite Life of Zack and Cody or Hannah Montana. This type of movie will not work for them because the comedy is not constantly in your face, and some of the movie is very dramatic. And their are some people who did not understand the movie at all and will say that it tried to be to ""pro-green."" To be completely honest here, I loved the scenes on the Axiom and while they were defiantly not as awe-inspiring as the scenes on Earth, without the Axiom we would have never got the dancing scene or M-O, or the scene where Eve views her security camera. <br/><br/>Now the plot basically is about a trash-compacting robot that lives in a very gloomy future. All the humans have evacuated Earth after it's been spent as far as pollution goes. The company you can blame for this pollution puts all the humans in a star cruiser, sends them off on a 5-year cruise, and tries to fix the mess. 700 years later, Wall-E is still trying to clean up that mess. Soon another robot named Eve falls to Earth and Wall-E tries to befriend her, giving her his handy little knick-knacks. One of them catches her attention and in short, she is picked up by a space ship bound for the Axiom with Wall-E trailing her. <br/><br/>Now this is the part of the movie that lost both moviegoers and critics alike, but in truth, I loved the Axiom scenes. I understood the message that Pixar was trying to bring us and I do not care that it was practically pushed down our throats. The Axiom was what I felt brought a lot of the movie's humor. <br/><br/>Now the story on the Axiom is that a fully robotic crew on a ship+hover chairs that take you everywhere+fast food in a cup=fat flabby humans. But with Eve returning with her discovery, humans might have a chance to return to Earth. What we get is basically 40 minutes of shenanigans aboard the Axiom. And I loved it.<br/><br/>Also I will note that this movie is a movie that almost made me cry when I was in the theater. This never happens. Seriously when me and my sister's were watching Old Yeller when we were kids I did not understand why they cried at the end of that movie. But some of the scenes in this brought me very close to tears. I'm talking about the dancing scene, when Eve reviews her security camera, and the ending which almost brings the movie to have a Romeo and Juliet aspect to it. <br/><br/>In short, Wall-E will entertain almost everyone. Almost. A lot of people are saying that this should win Best Picture and while I would love to see that, I highly doubt it will happen. But if this loses to Kung Fu Panda...<br/><br/>Also as a side note, I'm writing this review right as Wall-E is being placed in the Number 6 movie of all-time. While I love this, I think maybe that stuff should wait, maybe a year after DVD sales."
"gothy_doll","10","2","5","30 June 2008"," Heck ya, it is a GOOD movie.
","My friend and I went to see wall-e on the opening night. It is hilarious and it's kinda sad, too. We went to see the movie because it's from pixar, Disney. I know that pixar always produces good, funny, and very touching movie. Wall-e is a shy and curious robot that who falls in love with Eve who is very smart robot, too. In Toy Story, it's about toys, in Monsters, inc, it's about monsters, and in Finding Nemo, it's all about creatures that live in the ocean. They all are very funny and excellent movies. In fact, I only watch rated PG-13 or R movies. When pixar G-rated or PG-rated movies produces, I'm the first person that lining up for the tickets. So, if anyone says this movie is bad or lame, he or she's the one who doesn't know a good movie and is lame."
"xvilleobsesser","10","2","5","30 June 2008"," WALL-E is what the world needed
","walking into Wall-E, i knew very little. the trailers were vague and i relied solely on that fact that it has some cute looking characters and some masterminds of the business behind it. walking out of Wall-E, i had never been happier to have known so little in the beginning.<br/><br/>it was a pure, innocent, yet harsh and eyeopening wake-up call to the world of today. it was the perfect blend of cute characters and cute story lines, with what we could soon face, and what we have to be aware of. we fail to notice at times how much we take for granted and how much we could do more to ensure our home will stay our home, and Wall-E is that kick into the reality of things.<br/><br/>Wall-E is a perfectly executed, adorable and much needed film. it is perfect for the whole family, but doesn't fail to hold a strong message. it had hints of 2001: A Space Odyssey and apocalyptic themes, along with the cute touch of Pixar. Wall-E is the kind of hope that could save our world from ruin."
"skyflowerrgirl","10","2","5","30 June 2008"," Great Movie
","Pixar has yet again proved that they can do no wrong. I was there with my family, and it was the first time I had actually heard an entire audience clapping when the film ended. The only disappointing part of the whole thing was the runtime. I wish they had been able to do more, maybe flesh out the humans a bit (not that they needed it) or explore what had happened on earth and how the current situation had developed. Now for the positives. The characters were wonderful. They make the tiniest sound or move a little and you read their expressions perfectly. The robots were extremely real as characters. I personally think the fewer words worked, because it was easier to focus on the action. The animation is beyond belief. Every little bit of trash or random wall is a work of art. I really like the story (being big on post-apocalypse stuff) and there was never a time where I thought something was just filler. It's completely appropriate for kids (of course, there are a few small jokes, but it would go completely over their heads), but it's interesting for adults as well. Of my family, ages 54, 16, and 12 liked it, so it's pretty much good across the board."
"walkman666","9","2","5","30 June 2008"," Superb Film
","I guess the only thing keeping me from giving this movie a 10 is that very few films would achieve perfection. The Pixar folks continue to raise the bar on film-making, and not just animation. The stories have depth, characters you care about, great humor, and wonderful animation. This particular movie is very deep in so many ways on the one hand (waste, exercise, passivity, taking initiative), and yet silly at times on the other, and then has a little love story to boot. On so many levels, this movie is so much deeper and more meaningful than so many movies out there, it's almost unfair. And to do this in a kids' movie where you have to have some silliness and fun is beyond comprehension. At several points, this is a silent movie, and yet what the Pixarians say in such a format goes way beyond what you normally get in most Hollywood productions, these days at least. Well done, Pixar. I want to this film again more than my two kids!"
"liberalgems","10","2","5","30 June 2008"," What A Profound Cautionary Tale!,
","Wall-E is a surprisingly good film. It's touching, humorous, imaginative and quite subversive. Something you don't see too often in a children's film! <br/><br/>I think this brilliant film makes three very important points. First, robots will someday become sentient (self-aware) akin to Data from Star Trek or Hal from 2001: A Space Odyssey. What makes Wall-E so interesting is that a simple maintenance robot becomes self-aware, unlike Hal or Data, which are the most advanced technology known within their respective worlds. Granted, Wall-E's sentience took place over a 700 year period, but it makes one think if someday this could happen in the real world!<br/><br/>Another important insight is the current plague of obesity Americans and many other technologically advanced nations are facing. What I found so fascinating was how, taken to an extreme, the ""Couch Potato"" lifestyle would play out in human evolution. Amazingly, humans were literally losing the ability to walk! The toes were even starting to disappear! If machines do all the manual labor, nothing will be left for us to do but engage in shallow conversation over a television-like screen while eating liquid fast food!<br/><br/>What brilliant satire! The message is clear! People need to get outdoors more often and enjoy life. Get off the computer, shut off the T.V. and leave your Cell Phone in the glove compartment! Don't let technology rule your life or make you sick!<br/><br/>But I save the best to last! Wall-E is first, and foremost, a cautionary tale about wrecking the environment. Through the eyes of an adult, I found this film to be profoundly sobering. In Wall-E's world the Consumer Culture has literally consumed the planet making it uninhabitable. People were so focused on a throw-away economy and vapid entertainment, eventually nothing was left except one sentient maintenance robot struggling to find a purpose. The stupidity and ugliness of the human race was juxtaposed by the beauty of Wall-E's determination to enjoy his existence.<br/><br/>What an amazing and poignant story! My hats off to Pixar for attempting to warn us about sustainable living and protecting the environment in the process! <br/><br/>If I could recommend one book, which I actually finished the day before I saw Wall-E it's: ""The World Without Us,"" by Alan Weisman. I consider this book to be one of the best non-fiction books I have read in my entire life. I can't recommend it highly enough!"
"eev76","10","2","5","29 June 2008"," Best animation feature I ever seen, greatest Si-Fi movie, next step in animation design!
","Absolutely SPECTACULAR animation feature. I love everything in this movie. Great characters, sound effects, exiting story, SPECTACULAR style and design, idea of hiring Apple designers was great. Amazing animation, textures, matte paintings, great colors (not disturbing as in Speed Racer). I like a lot idea of making 50% of movie without conversations, and at the same time all robots voices are great. Sigourney Weaver's voice in ship works really great, reminds me ending scene voice of mother in Alien (1979). SPECTACULAR movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Can't wait to buy it on Blue Ray."
"Eddie_Dean","10","2","5","29 June 2008"," I couldn't be happier with this movie
","It's not just that Wall E is cute, but the way is story is introduced. The storytelling is perfectly done- the robots don't talk and nothing is explained to you, yet by watching you quickly learn the entire history of this world, why Wall E exists, why he does what he does and why he is the way he is.<br/><br/>You also feel for Wall E like almost no other movie character I can think of off the top of my head. He oozes with emotion every second he is on the screen and every second builds up his character. Every move and sound he makes is endearing, every hardship he goes through pulls at your heartstrings. I was always impressed how they made R2D2 such a lovable character in the original trilogy even though he just wobbled around and gave little beeps and boops every so often. Wall E however is on a different level.<br/><br/>The other aspect of this movie is the entirely unsubtle social commentary on our own existence as people- the way we live, what we do to this planet and the so called 'solutions' we find to our problems. Without giving away too much you are going to laugh and cry a little at how this movie depicts us and the planet earth.<br/><br/>Instead of describing this movie more I suggest you go out and enjoy it yourself, its definitely my favorite movie of the year so far and I look forward to seeing it again!"

"Angel62197","10","2","5","28 June 2008"," Wonderful movie for all
","I took my 4 year old son to see this as his first movie in a theater- I wanted Kung-Fu Panda, he insisted on ""the robot movie."" I could not have been happier with the outcome. While perhaps the plot was a little over his head, it kept his attention and was a treat for me to watch. The characters were enchanting, the backdrop incredible and every scene was well thought out. I didn't realize beforehand that it had such a strong environmental message; it was at times a little preachy, but it wasn't in an obnoxious way at all. I hope people will not avoid seeing this movie because of that strong message. In the end, it is a sweet, romantic, funny story that people of every age can enjoy. Wall-e is one of the most endearing characters I have ever seen in a movie. Congrats to Pixar on a winner!"
"magicwalnuts","10","2","5","28 June 2008"," ""I don't want to survive...I want to live!""
","Pixar's latest endeavor comes out on top, as should be expected by now from the likes of these animators. While a large portion of this movie contains no dialogue whatsoever, you would be hard pressed to even notice. Wall-E the eccentric but lovable protagonist conveys 99% of his emotions and intentions through movement and electronic sounds alone. Which was wonderfully done.<br/><br/>I'll admit that for the first 40 minutes of this movie I was becoming skeptical about how complex the story was really going to be, but out of Pixar's cleverness you realize that the beginning; which portrays the budding love between two robots is meant to symbolize the simplicity, but importance of such an emotion, and how the humans portrayed in the movie have completely lost touch with the most important and simple things in their lives. This beautiful contrast is a subtle but very meaningful social commentary.<br/><br/>Like many of the great science fiction stories of our time this movie does not slanderously preach about environmental and consumerism issues, but gently conveys a message that we may very well be destroying ourselves as human beings if we continue to be blind to such problems.<br/><br/>This is most certainly an Oscar worthy film, for it is not only a charming and often hilarious children's movie, but a wonderful story that can be appreciated by all ages."
"sylviajean","9","2","5","28 June 2008"," Drop your preconceptions and SEE IT NOW!
","This movie transcends labels. Forget , ""I don't like cartoons,"" ""It's just a kids movie,"" and ""Who needs more sci-fi?"" Leave behind your expectations and prejudices. Go in to see WALL-E with an open mind and an open heart and you will be rewarded as you never have before. The artistic detail of garbage-strewn earth, the space ship (part Carnival Cruise Line, part Enterprise), and the various workings of every single robot (pivoting heads, jointed legs, detached hands, a different personality and ""voice"" for each) is a dizzying delight. And WALL-E and EVE are the cutest couple since Lady and the Tramp. As many others have commented, their communication needs no dialogue. WAL-E's huge searchlight eyes and EVE's computer screen baby blues speak volumes not to mention their vastly different, but somehow compatible hands. Their love dance in space will leave you wondering which to cheer, the characters or the animators. And, as always, reliable Pixar sets itself apart from ""kid's movies"" that depend on sly pop references (touchpoints from ""2001,"" ""Star Trek,"" and ""Alien"" don't count) and potty humor. A film with genuine imagination doesn't need these things. You would think that the fat, lazy former earthlings would be disgusting, but they are not. They're good, cheerful people who don't know any better. Their awakening to what human beings and their planet should really be is a gratifying part of the plot. Watching the captain get hooked on the facts provided by the computer about what earth was like, you root for him to learn about human joy and duty before his HAL-like robot assistant catches him. Long-distance shots are breathtaking and funny by turns. One of the best visual jokes is when the ship's robots are all moving in an exact geometric pattern, when WALL-E and a bunch of off-kilter 'droids he has freed from their repair shop/asylum come barreling in from all directions and scatter their counterparts like rolling marbles. The only reason I withheld one star is that a couple of sequences go on a little long after they have contributed to the plot. But if you want to expand your artistic and imaginative horizons, go see WALL-E and let yourself be caught up in its visual and auditory wonders."
"ChrisSpartan117","10","2","5","28 June 2008"," Wow. Just wow.
","This is a movie that just blew me away. Everything is awesome about this film. The characters, the animation, even the message itself. This is really Pixar's best work, and this is coming from a person who loved Ratatouille, The Incredibles, Finding Nemo, and Toy Story 1+2. Even the short featured in the film, ""Presto,"" is amazingly good, let alone the film.<br/><br/>Where can I begin on how this movie is good? Well, let's begin with the animation. Seriously, this is one of the best looking computer animated films ever made, and Pixar has always been good in this department, especially with Finding Nemo and Ratatouille, but this is just stunning. The detail is marvelous, the characters move fluidly, and you really feel like you're there. I'd give this field a 10 out of 10.<br/><br/>But what's on everyone's mind is, how are the characters, considering that, for the most part, there is no dialouge? Wow...I mean, Wall*E...just wow. I actually felt a connection with this character, and he never talks expect say his name and EVE's name. And EVE herself, OK, she does have a little more potential considering the way Pixar did her eyes, but she felt like a real character all of the time. And while the side characters didn't have the same polish as the rest, they felt believable for their position, particularly the captain of the ship. 9 out of 10 for me here.<br/><br/>I'll move to the music now, and there isn't much to say, expect it helped you get into the mood of the film very well. Overall, I still prefer Ratatouille's music, but this is still very good. It's just the kind of music you'd prefer listening to during the film and not outside the film. 8.5/10.<br/><br/>Overall, like I said, this could easily be considered Pixar's best film to date, and that's no small achievement considering the studio's past work, and one of the few films that actually feels like it needs a sequel. Keep it up Pixar, let's hope your tenth animated film, Up or 1906, whichever it is, is just as good as the rest of your excellent films.<br/><br/>Overall: 9.9/10"
"vv234","9","2","5","28 June 2008"," Kung Fu Panda can't match with Walle.
","The beginning was probably the most boring part of the movie, it was so boring that I could've fallen asleep but the sounds kept me awake. The funny part of Walle were the fat people on hover chairs like the captain of the Axion space cruiser. There wasn't much talking but that's what pictures are for. The interesting part of the movie was the hi-tech cruise, so much new technology in the movie. Along with the hi-tech cruise there were so many robots with so many abilities. Overall this movie movie was great but it proceeded slow at some part.<br/><br/>Kung Fu Panda cannot match with this movie! Kung Fu panda was to short Dream works cut off to many parts. <br/><br/>All Pixar movies are great but WALLE is a new type f movie format."

The attention span of a 4-year old isn't that long, as parents know. They sat through the whole thing.<br/><br/>Being a kid at heart, I have waited for this movie to come out since I saw the first previews. I was not disappointed! From the time you first lay your eyes on WALL-E, you fall for the little guy. Most of the first 20 minutes or so show what has been previewed in the trailers. When you see it on the big screen though, you never pay it any mind.<br/><br/>The ending of the movie actually put a lump in my throat and brought a tear to my eye. The movie shows that love does conquer all and that maybe the human race isn't doomed to be a bunch of couch potatoes and mindless beasts.<br/><br/>A Must See!!"
"PolishMagic","10","2","5","28 June 2008"," Probably the best movie this year!
","Well, I just came back from the movies and I have to say that again, I'm impressed. Since I was a kid I watched Pixar movies (especially Toy Story and Toy Story 2) and this, I have to say, is a completely different movie than anything the studio did before.<br/><br/>If you have ever seen the trailers, this movie is set in a sort of apocalyptic stage of the Earth where humans don't live on it anymore. Humans have infested the Earth with so much pollution, that you can actually see satellite, and other machine parts, in the atmosphere. Instead of living on the planet, all the humans in the world (I don't know if every human left, it doesn't say.) went aboard on a ""cruise"" spaceship. Technology, in the ship, became so advanced that humans don't even have to stand up to do anything! They just sit in chairs and robots do EVERYTHING for them. This is so ironic lol.<br/><br/>Anyways, back to Earth and Wall-E. The beginning of the movie shows the current state of the Earth in the year 2700. You see Wall-E do his/her business, which is taking trash and making them into small blocks and arranging them so systematically, that they eventually turn into what looks like skyscrapers. Although there is barely any talking in Wall-E, as you may have heard, you can definitely tell some symbolic things such as the fact that Wall-E is lonely etc. Then one day Wall-E finally meets someone besides a cockroach (lol). I think I'll end the summary of the movie right now because you need to see it for yourself!<br/><br/>I loved this movie and I recommend to anybody that loves a good movie! There is a great message in this movie and if nobody got it, then at least enjoy the terrific visual look that this movie has!"

","In many movies and books, characters have discussed beauty. Some of these characters have mentioned seeing something or someone so beautiful, it moves them to tears. In the middle of the movie, after watching the characters interact and really understanding what the writers were aiming for in the story, I found myself crying. (Were I not in the middle of a crowded theater with my girlfriend and daughter, I would have really let the tears flow. I digress...) I wasn't told this was something beautiful, ready for my consumption as many things in this over-hyped world are sold.

","I'm guessing that after people see this, the number of views on Hello Dolly will increase. Nevertheless, I had just returned from seeing this and have to say I am impressed. Pixar has made 8 flicks and this is their 9th flick. 5 of those flicks have their own position in the IMDb's list of 250 of the greatest movies ever made. Of course they made 3 bad flicks: A Bug's Life, Monsters Inc., and don't get me started on Cars, even though me and fans of Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends like that movie. Anyway, the visuals for this movie are stunning. I'm a movie maker myself and have to admit I never ever learned how to do 3D animation and visual effects, even though my movies, or episodes, consist of model, blue screen, and computer-generated 2D effects. You can find my production site here at http://www.sampsoninc.com. Pixar, however, excels at this and makes the incredible world of Wall E beautiful. Oh, and the great cinematographer Rodger Deakins worked as a visual consultant on this film. He worked on great films like Assassination of Jesse James, No Country for Old Men, and In the Valley of Elah, all of which contain content that is not for kids because they are R-rated. Now onto the characters. WALL E, the title character, is downright incredible. Such charm and cuteness goes with this robot that it makes you laugh along with his antics. It works best when you are watching this with an audience and not alone. EVE, the lovebird of WALL E, has a futuristic touch to her and does whatever she can to help him out. Both robots turn out to have hearts and feel emotions whenever the script calls for them. The character development between them was done to an all out excellence. The scenes where they are both together you can actually see their personality. I think the major film critics will do better at admiring this flick than me. By and by, Wall E is an instant classic, and this is why today's kids will enjoy growing up with this company because they had the same awesome gig going nonstop for 13 years. I say that because Toy Story was their first flick. Oh, and don't forget to watch Hello Dolly."

Hopefully the message the movie is trying to convey will get across to all audiences. I haven't had that much fun in the theater since The Incredibles. Easily the best G rated film ever made (including none animated ones). Dark and heartwarming at the same time with excellent visuals.

Eventually, he does, and shows her his stuff. When EVE sees a plant WALL-E found, she takes it and goes into an unconscious-like state. Later, EVE is recalled. And WALL-E follows her. Then they land on the AXOIM (spelling may be wrong), a ship that contains all of earth's old residents. When the captain sees the plant, he is happy that they may go home.

"johnnymacbest","10","2","5","28 June 2008"," Charlie Chaplin is to cinema as WALL-E is to animation.
","Every once in a while something comes along that wows you in such a way it becomes an unforgettable experience upon first viewing. When a film or any piece of art leaves an ultimate stamp on your psyche, you can't help but smile with nostalgia and euphoric abandon. WALL-E achieves all that and more. With little to no dialog, the movie holds its own; even against ""Kung Fu Panda, and that's a film coming from Dreamworks of all things. Audiences will find a lot to love about this ingenious and charismatic robotic character with all his perks, quirks, mannerisms, all in a semi-realistic/sci-fi setting. I'm not a huge fan of CGI animated features but this one captivated me not because of it's originality, but also because the main character is a robot which most people have trouble sympathizing with, mainly because they're used to so many animated animals and people (though there are some humans in WALL-E). But the human characters don't overshadow the experience at all. Simply put a great film with terrific character development and a story so heartfelt and engrossing I'm sure it will make tons of money at the box office.<br/><br/>Here's to Disney for bringing something new to the table. There may be some similarities in terms of appearance to Johnny 5 of ""Short Circuit"" fame but WALL-E is his own character and he's definitely more lovable than said automaton. Anyone who appreciates great film-making or animation with a dash of wholesome family entertainment should see this film. WALL-E is to animation as Charlie Chaplin is to cinema. Don't miss it!!!"

","Pure emotions put on screen!!! That's a rare thing nowadays. It blows my mind that it comes from robots. I haven't even begin to philosophise on that idea...And that's the beauty of this film, it has many dimensions, it is a love story first and foremost, biting satire, a social commentary, a call to action, and many other things you want it to be.<br/><br/>Too much good has been said about this movie...modern masterpiece, chaplinesque, pure poetry. So I'm not going to indulge in that exercise...The film has so many amazing moments: poignant, funny, joyful, that I'm going back for the second time (and third), to pick my favorite wall-e moments.<br/><br/>Having said all the praises, the movie is not pitch perfect (gasp!!), the second half of the movie gives us one of those clichéd let's-save-the-world plot. At times, the chase/adventure scenes pander too much to mainstream, the ending was a little rushed. But the second half also gave us the dancing in space scene (it's divine!!) <br/><br/>All in all, the movie was redeemed by the hearts and beauty of the two robots in love. Any technical glitch with the story or the pacing (though not with the animation, it was perfection) is easily forgiven. I'm looking extra-extra forward for edgy and envelope pushing new releases by pixar more than ever...just don't give us Toy Story 3 or Cars 2 (which they are working on!! wtf pixar??)"

Most of the crowd comprised kids - hanging over chairs, running up and down the aisles, screaming and laughing with their friends.<br/><br/>Then the movie started - and the kids were entranced. The talking and shuffling stopped. The kids were leaning forward in their chairs, watching. And commenting and talking on the movie. ""Why is WALL-E so sad, mommy?"" ""Look out WALL-E!"" <br/><br/>I didn't see a single kid leave his seat during the movie. Many kids didn't finish their popcorn - they were that fascinated. <br/><br/>The adults in the audience were laughing along with the kids -- and they were laughing very hard at the inside-gags scattered throughout the film. I won't mention them here -- but Pixar definitely knows their American cultural references. <br/><br/>*********************POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT ************************* Yeah, there's a dopey subplot on how evil pollution is.

","Hands down, this is a legendary picture. Never has so much genius gone into the creation of a film, animated or live action. In WALL-E, Pixar has created two robots that fall in love. Remember when Allan Arkush gave us the unforgettably abysmal Heartbeeps? Same concept, yet WALL-E is on the complete other end of the spectrum. For all of the reasons we hated Heartbeeps, we now love WALL-E. The two stars are barely humanoids, yet their fantastically subtle gestures are so human that I was once reminded of a mannerism of a friend. The plot is appropriately ecological (we ARE living in the green decade, after all) and much of the script follows that of a traditional children's film. Yet Pixar's unmatched ability to mix unreal visuals with simple, hysterical wit shines through and gives us the greatest masterpiece in the history of animation. Hands down, the animated feature of the year, and a kick to M. Night's package for turning out such a disastrous ""horror"" flick when the heart of a child carries this flick to the highest level of film. Just see it!"

Amazing on every front: hysterical, original, and its message is one that's important and relevant to everyone here on Earth. I intend to tell everyone I meet to see WALL-E. The purpose of WALL-E is seemingly to address two major issues: our continuous destruction of the environment and how little we care about it. The future generation in the movie is completely plugged-in: they watch small computer screens that are plugged in front of their faces, and live in hovering chairs. They never walk, and never actually interact. Our current generation is threatening to become more and more like the extreme portrayed in WALL-E. Hopefully, the messages in this movie will help give us a push in the right direction."

I usually miss about half of the movies we see together because of her constant whispered questions and observations, but Wall*E was different. She just sat there in awe, as did I. To her 6 year old psyche, this beautiful piece of film-making is nothing more than a sweet and simple story. Lonely boy meets pretty girl and will do anything to be with her. For me it was that and so much more. This is one you have to see on the big screen. If you like action movies, this is for you. If you want a date movie, this is for you.

","It's truly amazing what PIXAR does with the two main characters. With as little as three words repeated occasionally throughout the entire film (two of them being each others' names), they create more emotion and personality than most actors ever could. PIXAR continues to raise the bar in this genre. The world, the animation, the characters, the story, the music, the humor, the emotion, and design were simply incredible. The films PIXAR creates have a habit of being extremely touching and this one doesn't disappoint. Not once, but TWICE I found myself tearing up. WALLE, EVE, (and MO!) are simply some of the best characters PIXAR's created since Finding Nemo. I can't recommend the film enough and if you only see one movie this summer, make it this one.

","We moviegoers just love cute robots--think of the little Coke machines in Silent Running, Robbie from Forbidden Planet (well, maybe not so cute)and of course C-3PO and R2-D2. There's a tiny bit of all of those guys in WALL*E, along with a healthy heap of Charlie Chaplin's Little Tramp.<br/><br/>WALL*E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth class) is a small robot left behind on Earth to clean up the place after humans have covered it with trash and absconded to a starship. It's been 700 years since the humans vanished, and WALL*E stays behind, doing his job, with no company except a VHS tape of ""Hello Dolly"" and his pet cockroach. But then, a new kind of robot appears on the trash mountains--a kind that WALL*E has never seen before . . .<br/><br/>All I have to say about this movie is that Pixar continues their streak of great films. These guys just can't seem to make a bad or even mildly disappointing film (sure, Cars wasn't quite up to their usual standard, but even Cars was better than 75% of the films released in any given year). As the digital wizards at Pixar have refined and improved the technology they use to create their imaginary worlds, their films have become deeper and more thought-provoking. This film looks sensational, but the masterful story-telling is what will hook you, draw you in, and have you alternately laughing out loud and surreptitiously wiping away the dampness from your eyes."
"MrGKB","9","2","5","27 June 2008"," ""WALL-E"" proves the fatal flaw in ""Cars""...
","...was the lack of direct connection to the world of humans (despite the anthropomorphic appeal of the title character and his sleek, hi-tech inamorata); with ""WALL-E"" (and last year's wonderful ""Ratatouille""), Pixar Animation Studios has more than obviously learned from their past mistake. Sentient machines, even those capable of emotional response, have become an accepted part of our culture, but only because they are a part of OUR culture. They are our Promethean creation, and their fire emanates directly from our fingertips, not from the lightning bolts of remote deity. Thank you, Pixar, for realizing this and giving us a story firmly rooted in humanity, however far removed from ""reality.""<br/><br/>""WALL-E"" is basically a love story heavily cloaked in science-fantasy elements: lonely boy meets girl, tags along on her predestined quest, and finally wins girl while coincidentally saving the human race from a fate perhaps worse than death. Fairly simple stuff, done with the usual grace and wit that keeps Pixar one step ahead of the competition, ""WALL-E"" is quite kid-friendly, yet retains the adult sensibility that defines Pixar's brand of animated entertainment. Writer/director Andrew ""Finding Nemo"" Stanton has come through yet again with likable characters, an engaging conflict to drive them, and a number of pointed observations along the way that are almost never heavy-handed, but manage to touch us with a sense of import. I'll be very much looking forward to seeing what he does with ""John Carter of Mars."" Oh, and did I mention that the animation is >insert superlative here<? It is, absolutely stunning. Or that the camera-work, editing, production design and so forth are all of a kind? Yep. Did I say the music by Thomas ""Jarhead"" Newman is utterly >insert appropriate descriptive here<? It is. That the nods to various sci-film inspirations are apt (cf. Signourney ""Alien"" Weaver's computer voice during a self-destruct sequence)? You got it.<br/><br/>And did I also mention that ""Presto,"" the de rigueur short feature before the film (and as close to a Bugs & Daffy cartoon that Pixar is ever likely to get), is absolutely worth making sure that you get to the cinema on time? It is. I'll be looking forward to it on the DVD.<br/><br/>My rating of ""WALL-E"" may very well jump to the ultimate notch upon re-watching it, but for now near-perfection will have to be fair recommendation. You could easily do worse for your entertainment dollar, and would have a darn hard time doing better.<br/><br/>11.17.08 edit: Caught this one again second run and enjoyed it just as much.

","I haven't had such a good time at the movies this summer since Iron Man was released back in May. Pixar has done it again, and this time it easily surpasses many of their previous attempts such as Cars and The Incredibles. I find now that Walle, Toy Story and Finding Nemo remain in a dead tie as to which is my favorite, but they are all great films. In Walle, Pixar manages to convey a large amount of emotion with very little dialog. Of the robots that appear on screen most say one or two words tops, everything thing they feel comes out through their eyes and actions. There is eventually spoken dialog in the film from other characters but not until after easily spending the first 30 to 40 minutes of the film with Walle alone on whats left of Earth.<br/><br/>In his time alone on the planet, Walle (who reminds me a little of the robot from Short Circuit) has become somewhat of a packrat, picking up little odds and ends and then taking them back to his home to add to a large collection. Many humorous situations arise as he explores the trash left behind by the humans hundreds of years before for more things to add. Walle seems to have also developed a soul in his time alone as we bear witness to his obvious loneliness since the other Walle units shut down or malfunctioned in some way. He has only a single friend to keep him company in the form of a tiny cockroach that often journeys with him on his collecting voyages. One day Walle meets a new robot Named Eve. Eve seems to have been sent to earth to find something as she is always searching the surface. The two eventually form a relationship, but when Eve's automated ship returns to collect her Walle stows aboard in an attempt to stay together. The two then are returned to the giant spaceship that houses what remains of the human population. All that ensues as the two attempt to reunite and then escape is a fun and exciting romp throughout the rest of the film. One which has Walle meeting his first humans as well as several other new robots of various design. I won't go into to much more detail for fear of spoiling the fun but long story short this is a great animated romantic comedy/space adventure that I think everyone can enjoy. Pixar really knocked the ball out of the park on this one!"

","***Minor spoilers, but nothing crucial***<br/><br/>First of all, I'm not a conservative. Far from it. That said, I decided to see this film based on my reaction to the trailer, which piqued my curiosity. It's about a lonely robot in the wasteland that departs for something otherworldly, and that's it.<br/><br/>I truly loved the beginning of the film -- at least the first 20 minutes, mostly dialogueless in minimalist style, focused on Wall-E and his discovery of something alien. This was quite audacious for Pixar for reverting to minimalist style considering children might have short attention span because they need cartoon characters that talk and joke in rapid-fire conversations (which I hate in animated films).<br/><br/>I almost cried near the ending which was quite an achievement for animated films after Pinocchio, Bambi, Beauty and the Beast and Spirited Away, and I rarely cry at the movies. Personally, I like the first 20 minutes and last five minutes the best. In between the film it's a naked sociopolitical film which is very ill-suited for children and may offend the adults' intelligence, contrary to positive reviews' claim it's a terrific film that will appeal to all ages.<br/><br/>A political message disguised as satire was already done and *better* (for lack of expression) in Mike Judge's film Idiocracy. Wall-E may be genuinely offensive to some viewers -- it sums up the message as thusly: that fat and lazy humans are responsible for neglecting and destroying Planet Earth because of mass consumption promoted by irresponsible corporate culture.<br/><br/>I find this message profoundly hypocritical, given the fact there is merchandising for Wall-E (go to Toys R' Us or check Amazon or ToyWiz for proof). The recent worst offender in overdone merchandising for movie promotion is Cars, which I never saw and do not intend to because I heard it's the worst Pixar film to date for contrived story.<br/><br/>Andrew Stanton and co should leave idiotic politics at home because it won't work well with me, as I'm sure millions will concur with me that Pixar should not be a vehicle to push propaganda while being profoundly hypocritical with the merchandising toys that will end up in the landfills once children and collectors find products of no value. The fact that Andrew Stanton chose to use Wall-E as a vehicle for a soapbox message is nauseating that might actually dilute the emotional and aesthetic impact of the film.<br/><br/>WALL-E begs for a fan edit by eliminating and minimalizing the human parts and unnecessary scenes to focus on Wall-E and its love interest to maximize emotional resonance without any pandering political idiocy (environmental or otherwise, because the point is already made by ""Idiocracy"" despite its R rating limiting the audience). Call it ""The Slim & Lean Version"" that runs at only about 45 minutes. A talented editor eliminated and silenced Jar-Jar Binks character in the legendary alternative version of ""Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace"" and ""improved"" Episode II by removing 38 minutes of bad materials (The Phantom Edit).<br/><br/>I support environmental issues as long as it is sound, but Wall-E was definitely harmed by the non-subliminal politiking in the middle (which makes it tedious in pacing and tone change) that have no reason to be in the gosh-darned G-rated film.<br/><br/>Excellent CGI art all around, the best yet in a Pixar film so far, and the most poignant story involving only scenes with Wall-E. It would be a lot better as a short, yet the obnoxious message was forced into the film by petty ""liberal-bent"" politics at Pixar to pad the length. This may translate to less earnings at the box office once the mixed word of mouth propagates with dissatisfied adults taking children to the movies, expecting (to put it simply) ""mindless"" entertainment only to be insulted by the pandering attitude of pompous and moralistically shrill Pixar storytellers.<br/><br/>*** out of 4"

The story's heart is simple; a lonely robot doing it's job finds love(?) and struggles to keep it. Fine, I can deal with the 'robots with emotions' bit but there are too many plot distractions for me to enjoy the simple story. 1.Why are all the other WALL-E's non functional? 2. Why would they be nothing more than robotic trash compactors? 3. If everyone is gone, why is there power? 4. If all the plants are dead, then why is there air? (this is an assumption on my part, all left due to over garbage, bad air (seen in video message), but we see that the oceans are still there, so plankton should still be present, I thought I saw birds, so I'm confused as to why 'we' left. 5. Probe sent to search for plants back on Earth, even though the ships Autopilot has taken control and initially prevents the return to Earth, so why send probes at all? 6. Why the huge automated probe ship? oh, that's right Wall-e has to have something to cling to on the return...duh. 7. How did a plant live in a sealed refrigerator? 8. If the space yacht is dumping garbage, where are they getting the raw materials to survive 700 years in space in the first place?<br/><br/>There are other flaws, and any movie will have them, but when there are so many, it exceeds my suspension of disbelief factor and then I get annoyed.<br/><br/>..why would Wall-E awake and be the first robot in the movie to exhibit 'robot like' behavior?<br/><br/>I can only assume that Lassiter was Ex.Producer in name only, and didn't lend his steady hand to this project."

","I don't make any excuses for it, but I am pretty resilient toward the wave of computer-animated films that has come to dominate our post-millennial cinematic experiencecall me old-fashioned, but I grew up with reruns of Looney Tunes, Saturday-morning cartoons, and theatrical releases done solely via cell animation. Appreciation of animation is a cross-generational phenomenon that has become more diverse with the ushering-in of computer technologyplots contain enough colorful, slapstick humor to entertain the kids, but also a fair share of mature, witty writing to amuse their guardians. Yet still, I have never really gone out of my way to view these CG-rendered productions, and have always relied on the persuasion of others to give this emerging technique a chance.<br/><br/>With ""Wall-E,"" I may be sold on computer animation for the first time everthis is the kind of movie that justifies the extra wait in line on a major holiday.<br/><br/>Being Pixar, ""Wall-E"" is preceded by a short (entitled ""Presto!"") that is aimed squarely at the 10-and-unders sitting in the audience: the tale of a magician's rabbit going to extreme lengths to get his owner to cough up a carrot. It is five minutes of madcap, frenetic amusement that is funnier in concept than its ultimately overachieving execution. If anything, it only helped raise my guard for the feature presentation.<br/><br/>""Wall-E"" begins on a note of stunning minimalismthe image of an abandoned Planet Earth, home only to the robot of the title (think ""Short Circuit"" meets ""E.T."") and his best friend, a chirping (and adorable) cockroach. Wall-E's function? To compact all the leftover trash (and there's a lot of it) into cubes. The opening scenes convey a sense of isolation and awe (literal skyscrapers of junk), and immediately garner sympathy for our likable (if frequently Woody Allen-ish) protagonist, who has a storage unit filled with his own fascinating finds (including a VHS tape of ""Hello Dolly!""). Living a life of routine, Wall-E (whose 'voice' is limited to a few robotic-sounding words) becomes smitten with a mysterious robot named Eve, whose objective may be the key to reviving a planet that, as we're told, has been unoccupied by humanity for 700 years.<br/><br/>While ostensibly an animated feature aimed at kids, the surprising thing about ""Wall-E"" is how its wide-ranging mash-up of cinematic genres and films synthesizes into such a fresh, original whole: while Wall-E and Eve may owe a debt to German Expressionism (Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"" in particular), their homage to a cinematic era when no spoken dialog was required to move audiences to tears, is remarkably effective and well-rendered (the early courtship scenes even recall classics like ""City Lights""). And additionally, some later moments on a massive spaceship recalls the lunatics-running-the-asylum spirit of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" (only with robots). Granted, writer-director Andrew Stanton inserts an incisive (if anvil-heavy) satire on our Wal*Mart-fixated culture of consumption, and keenly wonders if we've lost touch with the very acts that make us human; it only adds to the irony that, amid his attempts to save the world, Wall-E is really just a persistent romantic, looking to snare the woman he loves by any means necessarythe endless pursuit of the blue-collar, working-class male to win over a beautiful woman whose career won't let her slow down for romance.<br/><br/>It makes for one of the most moving motion pictures I've seen in a while."

Without that dialog, it gives the film a rather keystone cops sort of appeal which I found very refreshing. I found myself laughing out loud quite a few times at the on-screen antics.<br/><br/>Children will love it for the cuteness factor and the slapstick. There is some adult humor in it, although nothing over the top. There's actually less in this one than typical for Pixar films.<br/><br/>Lower your expectations from it's current 9.1 IMDb rating and you should do fine. It's great, but not the all time IMDb top 10 material that it's rated for right now (#9 of all time at last glance).<br/><br/>Overall, two thumbs up, fun for the whole family ;)"

","A sappy love story between 7 year-olds. Ratatouille was marvelous, the perfect film being as appealing to adults as to children. Wall-E on the other hand dumbs-down to be a film where only the visuals can appeal to adults. Finding Nemo was a great adventure, not wrecked by its celebrity voices as are many animated features (or by their obsession with celebrity voices). Wall-E avoids the celebrity voices route but falls down by being an adventure without detail or substance. This one is weak the whole way through after its intro, in contrast with 'Up', which falls down completely after a wonderful opening. A shame in both cases that the flagship company for animated features (their animated shorts are like out-takes only) would go ahead with either of these films that could only be badly flawed."

He falls for a robot named Eve and he is obsessed with some film called Funny girl(you know the one with Barbara Stresland and Walter Mattheu and Micheal Crawford from that old TV sitcom Some mothers do have em.

","I agree that the animations were fantastic and all that. But I am not a movie criticist - I do not judge movies that way. I went to see the film along with my four children ranging in age between 4 and 12 - none of them was thrilled by the experience. <br/><br/>Were was the witty dialog? The humor? The small portions of action contained in the film seemed misplaced (not that I demand action, but if the robots prefer not to speak, they might instead do something funny). The possible sens moral were so vaguely stated that no child would ever have to bother about making a second thought about it. There were obvious openings - ""a robot arriving from earth teaches humanity to humans"", or simply ""do not waste the planet"" - but Pixar did not take the time to spell them out properly. <br/><br/>We left the theater speaking about other matters - the movie had left no impression whatsoever."
"zoltangyalog","5","3","11","28 October 2009"," Math of Emotion
","Wall-E is 111% professionalism, THEN some more. This is the animation that has a perfect understanding of a consensus stock-psyche, thus the installment pulls you through a series of mathematics spontaneity, each coming to you via masterful calculations, eager to - effectively - toll your strictly expected reactions for the precise outlines of complex emotions. Emotions presented with all the risk free tones of a pink ink, spilled with pinpoint accuracy on a risk free pink canvas.<br/><br/>Wall-E offers no minutes, seconds, not even stolen nanoseconds to any form of freedom you could longing for as an appreciator of this solid CG accomplishment. You are not granted the fluidity to interpret the happenings on the screen in any other way than the way they ARE happening by indeed. Each movement and/or vibe you see or feel on the canvas is placed in front of you because of crystal clear intent. Yet, in reality, Wall-E offers but a harshly limited set of the usual, radical CG emotions, making sure though to squeeze and present the holy pink frick out of them, THEN some more. (For your amusement, by the way.) The vibes Wall-E collides you with are already declared rigorously, you are but the mirror that will justify how precisely the intended emotions are sought for, how precisely they are provoked out of you. Remember, you are the viewer and you will be tolled for your empathy. Surely, you will laugh when you are wanted to submit to laugh. Surely, you will feel pity when you are wanted to submit to feel pity. This all should be normal. Causing emotions is crucial aspect of art. Wall-E though, I think, does little more than overkills, rapes the usual CG emotions via a perfect understanding of them. And you, as viewer, end up as living justification of how flawless of an understanding of superficial emotional channels the creators do possess.<br/><br/>You will render the emotions, as will the other viewers in the audience. You will endure the same dramaturgical fabric you have seen a 642387462384 times before. While this extremely strait field of interpretation could be viewed as the narrative strength of this animation, in total, Wall-E does not yet aspire, and, as such: naturally does not succeed at presenting more complex emotions than what you already have seen being delivered by the genre on numerous occasions.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, Wall-E is a reasonably solid CG beast taking you by the neck, forcing you to lick up all the foam of risk free, pre-calculated fun and risk free, pre-calculated melancholy it brings to the - presumably - risk free table. It makes sure that the color of your memory of it, and that of the secret inner puke you will deny it caused to eject out of you in a weak moment of escapist realization - will conform nicely to the commanding shade of this installment. Math of Emotion, baby. Pink math of pink emotion to be specific.<br/><br/>Oh, and in case you have wondered, Wall-E is a masterfully calculated and carefully synthesized torpedo of risk free fun for the Whole Family. No irony here at all. And this is the problem, too."

","Don't get me wrong WALL-E was a good movie, but it wasn't on the same level as The Incredibles or Toy Story/Toy Story2. The story centering around this lonely robot was cute but not the kind of thing that would keep a kid enthralled long enough to sit through it. I also take issues with the humans in the story; they were a little over the top 'stupid'. I don't think we are mindless as robots content to do the same thing as someone else. We are too individual to just follow the leader. The animation was gorgeous but no better than any of the other Pixar films. The images of Earth really were no as mesmerizing as the critics seemed to think they were. So a good effort but not great. Waiting for the Incredibles 2 and more Edna Moes."
"lucasaq-1","7","3","11","27 June 2008"," Great Love Story Disappointing Side Story
","Usually Pixar wow's me with its story as well as it characters, but the latest tale from the people at Pixar has been a major disappointment in the story department. It is a run of the mill love story with a dystopia setting where man has been driven off earth because they trashed it. A very environmentalist viewpoint which is disappointingly simple for Pixar and in the class of Happy Feet as far as I am concerned with is a death knell normally for me, but it rises above the previous films problems by having a keenly interesting and investing main character in Wall-E. It is the love story that makes this film tick.<br/><br/>The ads focused on Wall-E and hyped the film in that respect the film flourishes. Wall-E is given great meticulous character and detail by the artists. He is the most lovable of all the characters because he is unpolished and has the most nuisances of any character in the film be it human or robotic. He gained his character from being stuck on earth on eternal cleanup. Having only one single companion, an interestingly lovable cockroach, yeah that is a feat unto itself. He cherishes this companionship, but still yearns for something closer and more relatable for himself as he watched Hello Dolly to death. It is the opening exposition about Wall-E that gives the film solid momentum to get through the rest of the rough story as Eva comes down to search for life on the earth, which Wall-E has previously discovered. Her directive takes over from there and then it is simple struggle between machine and character, which is disappointingly uninteresting in itself, but for Wall-E and his determination of pleasing and loving Eva, the film would be a failure.<br/><br/>Eva herself is almost the anti-thesis of Wall-E a pristine new robot with nary a scratch or piece of dust on her design. She is slowly but surely broken down by Wall-E's careful persistence. The love story is beautiful between the robots and surprisingly well design as opposed to the rest of the story with the obese humans and their regimented and sheltered life on an eternal cruise. That part of the story is shockingly overt which Pixar is usually good at avoiding.<br/><br/>The film is great in its references to classic pop culture references with its films and songs. For that and Wall-E and his love story the film flourishes and is one of the best I have seen, but the side story involving the humans and the restart on earth or disappointing simple and blatant. Thus this latest venture from the people at Pixar specifically director Andrew Stanton and co-writer Pete Docter is a mixed bag."

","I am a huge fan of Pixar movies. I loved the two Toy Story movies, all the Shrek's, and Finding Nemo. So, when Pixar announced another movie about a little robot named Wall.E (who looks a lot like No. 5 from Short Circuit), I couldn't wait to go see it. I got my chance this past weekend at a drive-in, no less, which is my favorite way to watch a movie. 15 minutes into it, I was ready to leave. What a disappointment. Although the character Wall.E was cute and did some funny things now and then, it was the worst movie I have seen in a long time. If it wasn't for the fact that the drive-in was showing a double feature with Get Smart, I would have left with the other dozen or so cars that pulled out after about 15 - 20 minutes. I kept watching and watching, hoping it would get better, but it seemed to just get worse and worse. Maybe I need to see it again to try to see what others got out of it, but I will have to wait until I can rent it for $1.00. I'll be damned if I am wasting more than that to see it again."

"howard.schumann","8","2","6","7 July 2008"," Personalities of the characters give the film its life
","For those who have been out of touch, Pixar is the company responsible for some of the most popular, highest-grossing and memorable animated films from the past few years. What you must bring with you (along with your kids) to the theater, however, is a suspension of disbelief. In films such as Toy Story, Babe, Finding Nemo, and others, dogs, pigs, rats, toys, bugs, and fish can talk, have feelings or fall in love. The new Pixar film Wall-E is no exception. Robots talk like Mac computers, have deep feelings, and even kiss each other. Although it probably will not be a film I will become personally attached to in the same way as ET and Short Circuit, Wall-E is a strong film that entertains while telling us it is past time when we must pay attention to taking care of our planet.<br/><br/>In the film's premise, Planet Earth has been uninhabitable for hundreds of years because of some undisclosed catastrophe, yet mounds of trash remain uncollected on the ground and a single robot remains functioning, methodically collecting the junk and piling it into stacks of neat boxes that rise high enough to become indistinguishable from the ancient skyscrapers. Like ET, Wall-E creates creatures that do not exist, that do not even speak, yet gives them life and personality and makes you care for them (the sounds for both characters were designed by Ben Burtt). Wall-E, a Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class bot, grudgingly goes about his assigned task, the last surviving robot from a failed program, collecting trinkets of an age long past like the video of a song and dance sequence from Hello Dolly.<br/><br/>Wall-E's ""life"" changes, however, when a spaceship containing the remnants of the human population that left Earth a long time ago brings Eve, an Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator, to search for evidence that Earth can once again return to life. Wall-E is smitten with the much sleeker robot and their ""love affair"" takes them on a journey to the spaceship Axiom where humans are more robotic than the bots in the film. Human activity consists of what you would expect on a cruise to the Caribbean: playing games, talking on video cell phones, watching programs, constantly being waited on and fed messages through a propagandist using a huge screen. Nurtured by the Buy-N-Large Corporation, humans have grown fat and passive. Without any detectable ambition, they just accept what is put in front of them to make their lives easier without thinking or noticing what is going on around them.<br/><br/>When Eva and Wall-E arrive aboard, however, the film changes pace and becomes full of hyperkinetic activity with lots of bangs, chases, and explosions. The Captain in charge must battle the defenders of the status quo, the computers who do not want their order to be compromised, telling us to ""stay the course"" (where have I heard that before?) rather than look for a new possibility. Like a Chaplin or Keaton film, Wall-E is a mostly silent film in which the actions and personalities of the characters give the film its life. The two main characters cannot speak to each other in a language we understand, yet they bond because of a shared yearning to give and receive love, demonstrating that our relationships are rooted ultimately in our feelings and connections, not in our language."

","What an awesome little movie! I was much pleased by both its graphic quality and philosophical content. Granted, it is a kid's movie, so don't run in expecting to see Aristotle's physics or Freudian breakdowns, but do expect to be pleasantly surprised by the story and it's implication for eight year old minds.<br/><br/>The visuals were truly astonishing, as one has come to expect with Pixar. The designs are terrific and well utilized for comedy. The story itself is touching in a pre-adolescent way, and the limited dialogue is a welcome escape form the Pokemonery I had expected. <br/><br/>In short, I recommend it to anyone, including adults.<br/><br/>I just wonder about the sequel.

"thagg","8","2","6","5 July 2008"," Loved it, but there are so many issues...
","WALL-E is beautiful, charming, and poignant. I recommend it without reservation, especially for the parts of the movie that take place on Earth.<br/><br/>There are so many parts of the movie that make no sense, though; that I find it impossible to believe that it has passed muster with all the people involved in making it.<br/><br/>For example -- WALL-E was clearly built by humans just before they all left Earth for space, and the humans have become almost vegtables in the meantime. Yet, somehow, technology advanced insanely far on these remote small starships; the anti-gravity, sentient robots, and the hyperspace drive point to dramatic advances of technology -- who created those? The people on the ships seem unable to think, but it had to be them who made these. The EVE robot in particular embodies technology impossibly beyond WALL-E.<br/><br/>Also, I found the trash on the starship to be odd at best. The ship is shown disposing of extremely large amounts of trash, something that couldn't possibly be done on a starship isolated from resources -- everything would have to be recycled for a ship like that to fly 700 years. Also, I found it amusing and poignant (and it couldn't be accidental) that WALL-E just cast his CO2 fire extinguisher aside as trash when it was empty -- isn't that just the opposite of what he would do? But...hey. I'm willing to forgive. It was fabulous.<br/><br/>Thad Beier"
"nyc man","8","2","6","3 July 2008"," A computer geek / scientist chimes in
","Okay. I will put in my 5 cents. I liked ""Wall-E"", but they could have used a fresher story, instead of re-cycling (paying homage to) old movies. And one of them was Noah's Ark. But, I did like the animation. What I hated was the: 1. hyper-drive (okay for Star Trek, but aren't we beyond that?) 2. not attached head (for Eve) 3. over-crowded skies of junk (Futurama did it better when the female captain squeegee's off the windshield and removes insects and the Voyager space probe) 4. transporter rays 5. ""too resilient"" cockroach 6. too fast return to earth and re-adaptation 7. too many coincidences (garbage chute reappearance, people knowing Wall-E being next to each other)<br/><br/>Now, there were some great things in the film, including astronomy shots (did they credit APOD? www.apod.NASA.gov )<br/><br/>So, I gave it an 8, and would give it higher if they corrected the ""technical"" flaws and added a real story-line.<br/><br/>On the other hand (my third hand), I liked the 2001 homage, the tactile memory sequence, the trauma to Wall-E, the repressed memories of Eve coming back, the new and improved internet."
"scyker","8","2","6","3 July 2008"," Pretty-Perfect Film
","WALL-E................WALL-E, WALL-E, WALL-E, where to start, where to start? First off, the animation was incredible. I don't think it better then other 2D or 3D movies because of animation, because that would just be pointless. But I thought it was just brilliantly animated, at times even tricking my eyes into thinking it was a real live action movie. Not often, but enough.<br/><br/>Now, as everyone SHOULD know, good animation does not a decent movie make. It gets points, but not A's. The plot was good. It was sent into space and punctuated by emotion and a message but overall it was just a standard love story. But most entertainment stories are love stories. The Matrix was part love story for God's sakes. It was a unique love story in that it was put together with only two near-mute characters and how they function together.<br/><br/>The most interesting part of this movie is ow well emotion was worked into it. By using the animation, yes back to the animation, the animators intricately make it so that WALL-E's eyes move up and down like eyebrows and one can see that deep inside the frames there are metal circles that go over his inner eyes similar to eyelids. It's interesting when EVE freezes and WALL-E works with her like that. A very ""Twilight-Zone-Last-Man-On-Earth"" kind of scenario. Usually the only emotion shown on a Disney movie is the helpless girl crying over her love leaving or how how much she screwed up. (Sorry, ladies, it's just how stories have historically gone.)<br/><br/>The voices are good being that there is more audio dialogue in an early Charlie Chaplin film then there is in this movie. I like how there we're several intricate and important characters that had so much to say that really couldn't say ANYthing. Pretty gutsy move for a kids film. There are really only four normal characters that use normal voices.<br/><br/>Message.... The movie was really good, but it just got really preachy. People are L-A-Z-Y and nobody, I repeat, NOBODY, can deny it. But really, Disney? Did we need the ending to be the animated version of ""An Inconvenient Truth""? I love the message, but maybe not so heavy in a kids flick, alright? There has to be some irony in the global Disney corporation having an anti company message in a movie.<br/><br/>To cap it all off, one can't really say that the ending was realistic. Yes, I know it's a Disney flick. Yes, I know it's a movie about us living in space, which ain't gonna happen, sorry Trekkies and Star Wars losers. But come on, everything is hunky dory and the world continues on with humans for the better? Doubt it.<br/><br/>Overall, good flick. It's hands down no questions asked going to win the Oscar. Sorry, Kung Fu Panda. Is it better than Beauty and the Beast? No. Lion King? No. Shrek? No. Finding Nemo? No. But is it a really good film that deserves ALMOST every bit of praise it gets (as long as critics keep their heads on)? Yes. So overall, I give this film a B+ to an A-. Which is higher than most other films of today. Probably because it's better than most films of today."

Rated ""G"" in our society has somehow been skewed to automatically imply that the movie is for the kiddies, when all criteria for said rating is simply that the movie will not use any content that one might find ""questionable."" A kid can watch this movie and be entertained without being exposed to questionable material, which is nice, but obviously no measure of the greatness of this movie.<br/><br/>I will admit, I went into this movie with practically no expectations. I went because other people wanted to see it, and was not expecting much from a movie with zero-dialog advertisements. ""How could this movie possibly say anything other than 'aww how cute look at the robots.'?"" I wondered. Pixar then proceeded to prove to me just how wrong I was for even thinking that way.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most amazing thing about this movie is precisely that there is such minimal dialog, yet you are able to connect with each character on a level such that communication is possible through non-verbal communication almost exclusively. This movie forces you to think about how much of communication is fluff, and what meanings can be attached to nothing more than a name, simply through the use of voice inflection and facial expressions.<br/><br/>""Intriguing, but perhaps just a novelty, worth maybe a few extra points for creativity but not the 10 you're giving it,"" you might be thinking. It doesn't end there.<br/><br/>This movie takes a fairly typical plot in literature that never seems to surface in recent movies - Utopia. In the first minutes, you are presented with a post-apocalyptic world wherein WALL-E is the sole inhabitant, and are quickly shown what happened to cause such a catastrophe. From that point on, you are launched into a story of humanity attempting to survive in space, with the hopes of someday returning home being nothing more than a faint memory, with the humans on board simply going about their days in gluttonous and slothful livelihood. Needless to say, this story is aimed directly at our society.<br/><br/>Watch this movie with an active mind, and you will be rewarded with one of the deepest, thoughtful movies of the decade, and this is including live action as well as any animation."

No, Wall-E is nothing short of what movies should be. What can I say about this film? What makes it so great? To start it off, there is barely any dialog in here. The first 30 minutes into the film has no dialog at all, yet the film manages to pull it off.<br/><br/>The look of the film is very grand and visually extensive, no doubt. The animation is pitch perfect, like the rest of Pixar's previous films and this movie actually pulls off a great plot! And you know what I'm worried about? People will complain the movie is ""too preachy,"" while one critic already said it's ""An Inconvenient Truth"" for the kids. If you're one of those people, please don't be such a wimp and fuss about because there's a good moral message in here, along with an irresistible romance between the two protagonists, Wall-E and Eve.<br/><br/>While it's really hard to decide which is the ""best Pixar film,"" Wall-E could be nominated. It's one of the more satisfying films I've seen in theater that was worth the money. I also found the movie touching and heart warming, as well as hilarious in some great comedic scenes. I also found the film awfully similar to ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" even though I have never seen it in my entire life. I guess that's a homage.<br/><br/>As I ramble on with the movie I've just seen, let me finish this off by saying that this movie is worth your time and money. I find it the best film of this year, so far and I think it'll be hard to beat in the Oscars. The film is better for the adults than for the kids, if that's possible, but everyone at all ages should like it, unless they are cold-hearted."
"RCWjr","8","2","6","28 June 2008"," Another quality film from Disney/Pixar, but not the best
","This film has been hyped out of this world (pun intended). Personally, I found it to be another fantastic Disney/Pixar film, but definitely one that is still aspiring, as all Disney/Pixar films have, to reach the bar that Toy Story 1 and 2 set so very high. <br/><br/>The story is a sweet one, Wall-E, alone, wanting nothing more than to have someone in his life, like the images he watches over and over on the VHS tape he views every day. His mundane existence is changed when a probe robot, EVE, comes to earth to search for new life. Wall-E ends up falling for EVE and her with him. EVE ends up finding life and the probe ship comes to pick her up. Wall-E tags along. Once on the mother ship Axiom, prat falls and awakening moments ensue.<br/><br/>The way that Pixar artists can make you care for these characters every single film is amazing. They are inching even closer to producing a photo real world. The best evidence of this is on earth. I thought the photo realism was lost once the story moved to the Axiom. My only problem with the film is the rendering of humans, still a problem that the Pixar animation experts have yet to crack. I know that the humans in the story are supposed to represent a physical caricature of what humans looked like prior to leaving earth, but still, there is still a plastic quality about how humans are represented that has been a ""work in progress"" for Pixar and continues to be the one area they have yet to create realistically. <br/><br/>I would have to agree with some that when the story moves to the Axiom it does loose a bit of its charm. The second act drags a bit more than the rest of the film. I was in a theater filled with kids and the awed quiet of the first act was replaced with a lot of stirring and restlessness in the 2nd act. <br/><br/>Masterpiece? Greatest Pixar film ever? In my opinion, it is definitely a very good film, it is what we come to expect from Disney/Pixar, but masterpiece? I would not go that far."

It has its hilarious scenes, don't get me wrong, but this movie is more of a film that tells a surprisingly deep story more so than it is one that passes a simple moral story with comedy. I was shocked at the depth, honestly. It is obviously for all ages, but there are so many satirical subtleties in this movie that relate to us, our society, and our perception of government that it caught me off guard.<br/><br/>There are also quite a few references to 2001 that only fans of Kubrick's work will recognize, and most certainly not children.<br/><br/>Overall, if you're looking to laugh your ass off, don't go, it is insanely cute humor that is impossible not to smile and laugh at, but it is a very deep story at heart and doesn't contain much dialog at all so you don't get any wit in the form of that.<br/><br/>There's also a 7-8 minute Pixar short movie before Wall-E starts involving a magician and his rabbit that make this worth the admission alone.<br/><br/>The only thing that keeps this from being perfect in my opinion is that, at times, the lack of dialog really did make it feel like a very extended short film. Wall-E and his entire life and job is summarized in the opening credits, which I think increased the difficulty in finding something for him to do while building up to meeting Eve and boarding her shuttle."

","Pixar has had a had a wonderful streak of making amazing movies. The movie has a deep message found through out the choices we have to make. Most of the movie is quiet due to the fact that there robots so there's not many conversations until near the end of the movie. This movie is a movie made for all ages. <br/><br/>The Animation in this movie was incredible, but you should expect any less coming from pixar. The humor in the movie is simple but it makes the movie pretty good. The music in the movie made it seem like fantasia because it plays such a key role in the movie than just background music.<br/><br/>Be sure to watch the movie until the credits too."

"zkonedog","9","1","2","11 March 2017"," One Of A Kind, To Be Sure
","Some movies are good because they take a tried and true formula and add a unique twist. Others are good because they do something completely different and unexpected. ""Wall-E"" falls squarely into the latter category.<br/><br/>The story is simple: In a post-apocalyptic world, a trash-collecting robot (WALL-E) wanders the desolate terrain. One day, a visitor (EVE) descends from the heavens and involves WALL-E in a wild adventure to once more bring life to the barren planet.<br/><br/>This entire film is so different from anything Disney/Pixar had produced to that point, yet the overall quality is still top-notch. The story is simple (yet charming), the characters are innocent (halfway in you'll forget that you're essentially watching robots), and the visuals are both unique and spectacular at the same time.<br/><br/>Perhaps the hallmark of this fun little film, however, are the numerous sights gags it perpetuates. The Disney/Pixar team knew that since the fare was robots, the ""goofiness"" factor could be upped for this effort. On multiple occasions, whether you're four or forty-four, you'll find yourself chuckling at something that just transpired on-screen.<br/><br/>Thus, I highly recommend watching this film with the kiddie of your choice. It toes the line between the intellectual humor of Toy Story and the slapstick of Finding Nemo, all the while providing genuine laughs and heart along the way."

","The most charismatic and human character of Pixar is a robot. But not any robot, this one is a brave and enthusiastic guy who does his best to survive in a huge pile of soil, from which he extracts every single speck of life available.<br/><br/>Wall-E shows us that there's hope for anyone and that to make life better, you just gotta believe in it and fight for your love, fight for your life, fight for your future. <br/><br/>When we do the wrong thing for the right reason, when we go beyond the standard people who just want to survive, that's when we're being humans and not machines. Life is an adventure and we can make it a better place, anyone can, we just gotta go out of our Auto mode and make the magic happens. <br/><br/>And not only that, let's never forget about love 'cause happiness is even better when shared and, again, only depends on you to make it happen. No matter who or what tries to stop you, keep it going, doing what you believe. Any seed can grow into a tree and all these rules don't apply when you're high in the sky.<br/><br/>Great characters with a lot of feelings and one of the most original ways to tell a story that I've seen.

","What I loved most about WALL-E is that it tells us to not just build robots and throw trash everywhere and to clean up after ourselves and the fact that anything is possible. And I personally love the art style and already free-handed Eve it was a lot of fun drawing her years after the movie came out. Also never let a robot space ship take over and not let you return to earth ever! Not as fun as it sounds or looks considering what happened during the movie but lucky all was good in the end of the movie. Funny how I first watched the movie while I was in 5th grade still enjoy the movie to this day (2016). This goes for every other Disney movie i've watched for example Bugs life (1998), Dumbo (1941), The Great Mouse Detective (1986), The Rescuers (1977), The Rescuers Down Under (1990), as well as a personal favorite Robin Hood (1973), Sleeping Beauty (1959), The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996), Hercules (1997), Mulan (1998), etc think you guys get the idea I could go on forever. -Allons-y!"

I don't see this as bashing any one group of people based on their weight (...and I love that one person commented on how this movie would offend ""fat people"". Don't you think that some people might find that label offensive?). It does raise some important questions about the amount of time that we spend in front of our computer/screens these days, the lack of time that we spend playing outdoors and interacting with others face to face, and the nature of the ""corporate beasts"" that rule the retail market. More importantly, it's got great music, amazing graphics, and is truly endearing and hilarious. Must watch this movie."
"d_x_s_s","7","1","2","25 August 2016"," Pixar's WALL-E best animation
","The movie has a wonderful look. Like so many of the Pixar animated features, it finds a color palette that's bright and cheerful, but not too pushy, and a tiny bit realistic at the same time. The drawing style is Comic Book Cool, as perfected in the funny comics more than in the superhero books: Everything has a stylistic twist to give it flair. And a lot of thought must have gone into the design of WALL-E, for whom I felt a curious affection. Consider this hunk of tin beside the Kung Fu Panda. The panda was all but special-ordered to be lovable, but on reflection, I think he was so fat, it wasn't funny anymore. WALL-E, however, looks rusty and hard-working and plucky, and expresses his personality with body language and (mostly) with the binocular-like video cameras that serve as his eyes. The movie draws on a tradition going back to the earliest days of Walt Disney, who reduced human expressions to their broadest components and found ways to translate them to animals, birds, bees, flowers, trains and everything else."

","Wall-E is a small robot that was produced in series by the millions to clean up all the dirt that covered the planet, while the human race lived in a gigantic spaceship in orbit, fleeing to a polluted and uninhabitable planet. But now it remains only one, and he got feelings. What will happen when he falls in love? Written and directed by Andrew Stanton, this animated film from Disney / Pixar has a good cast of voice actors, headed by Ben Burtt, Elissa Knight and Jeff Garlin.<br/><br/>For me, this is a particularly beautiful film that seeks to prove the power of love and feelings. Feelings can be so strong that even a machine, made for the most impersonal and inhuman tasks, can love. Another topic that this film deftly explores is our current waste crisis. The planet, more polluted than ever, will have a limit? Will we one day (and our planet) will no longer be able to deal with the waste we produce? And if that happens, there will be hope?<br/><br/>The script is excellent, the story is very moving and how it develops is very fluid and natural. The quality and realism of the animation is what we expect from Pixar and Disney, two giants of animated world. It's not a movie just for kids, it will easily appeal to audiences of all ages. The voice actors were well chosen and did a good job, even though half of the film does not have any elaborate dialogue. The scenarios are excellent in both the planet and the human ship. The characters were made in interesting ways, but the ones that stand out are the robot Wall-E and Eve, who are more human than most people. The soundtrack is also very good."

","In 2805, Earth is abandoned and covered in heaps of garbage left over from decades of mass consumerism facilitated by the megacorporation Buy 'n' Large (BnL). Seven hundred years earlier, BnL evacuated Earth's population in fully automated starliners, leaving behind WALL-E trash compactor robots to clean the planet for humanity's eventual return. The plan failed, however, and all WALL-E units are now inactive except one, which has developed sentience after decades of life experience. He manages to remain in operation by repairing himself using parts from other inactive units.<br/><br/>One day, WALL-E discovers a growing seedling. Later, a spaceship lands and deploys EVE, an advanced robot probe sent from the BnL starliner Axiom to search for vegetation on Earth. WALL-E falls in love with the initially cold and hostile EVE, who gradually softens and befriends him. When WALL-E brings EVE to his home and shows her his collection, she sees the plant, automatically stores it inside herself, and goes into standby mode waiting for her ship to retrieve her. WALL-E, confused why EVE seems to have shut down, tries numerous methods to reactivate her. When EVE's ship returns and collects EVE, WALL-E clings to its hull and thus travels through space to the Axiom, which is hidden behind a nebula."

","**** May contain strong spoilers ****<br/><br/>This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....<br/><br/>This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.<br/><br/>I attempt to force through my own opinions and preconceptions lately... and with and through that get more experience of movies and other things. So.... Wall-E is a movie I have neglected... thrown through the window with the sign ""Disposal"" over it. And... now I am sitting down and will watch this Academy Award Winner of 2009. It will be interesting.<br/><br/>First off I am struck by the fine animations of universe and expecting some epic orchestra striking a magnificent tune. And.... well... no, no, no... already here Wall-E comes out with a Big Bang (pun intended) and let us enjoy... a little musical tune as coming right from the musical of ""Annie"". Interesting. And moving on.... Amazing animations showing the chopper perspective of a planet/city that has gone under some kind of natural disaster or something... the tune fades away and leaves us in silence with the words ""I won't come home""... spot on! Wall-E breaks the silence and rolls down and between some alleys and buildings... what song is that Wall-E is playing? Yes... the musical tune comes back. A lot of good directing, sound editing and the showcase of a production team making their finest. This is only the first couple of minutes into the movie. This leads to my first big honest laugh; a cockroach (or some bug looking like a cockroach) is Wall-E's friend and following him in its work. The 'roach is crawling into a ventilation system of Wall-E and tickles Wall-E... hence Wall-E is giving a little robotic giggle. Fun! Thereafter... a moralic chunk of message goes through the screen, to the story and gives the whole motion picture is in depth thinking; BUY LARGE.... a franchise that everybody is buying from. Buy a lot, and save money. Buy a lot and there will probably be much waste and with waste a harsh strain on our planet Earth. So, Wall-E comes out big time proclaiming that it is time for us to take care of our Earth.... otherwise we may end up similar to a well-known film about a robot on a planet collecting trash... did I hear the bell of wisdom sound off now? <br/><br/>Really cool and top notch way of getting through with those commercial videos with real humans and actors in them... genius! Thorughout the movie there is a lot of moralic dilemmas taking place that is giving the viewer time to reflect. Nice touch! Also nice to see all the retrospective things like VHS, cassette tapes and....the game of Pong! Long time no see!<br/><br/>A fantastic animated movie showing the aftermath of a probability where humanity has forced forward and maybe too far in getting robots doing every little daily issue and tasks. Where humans is living in a spacecraft for 700 years and lost all aspects that makes us humans; awareness, love, analyzing ability and so on.<br/><br/>Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Wonderful animations. Academy Award Winner! Further questions anyone? - The actors : Oh... Wall-E is fantastic in showing its feelings for Eve....a. - The story : A creation made by masterminds. Is the future this cold? - Entertainment : Very amusing. So exiting to see Wall-E and Eve dance in space. - Age : 7<br/><br/>8,4 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 9 Brilliant and admirable 8 Excellent movie and a solid production)"

","The movie discusses the importance of being Eco and green friendly. It starts with planet earth in its disastrous future when all humans have left to live on moon as Earth is all bombarded and destroyed with the help of war instigating leaders. There is just one sensitive programmed robot left who is functioned as a trash compactor who happens to find a seedling while segmenting trash but it is located and extracted out from earth by another female robot who is programmed to demolish and destroy any Eco-friendly fundamental on earth. Wall-E the robot develops a tendency to love and it blossoms in it more when it sees another female robot arriving on earth, Eva. Whilst Eva and Wall-E are taken away to moon the true reason is known by Wall-E and Eva that some fanatic and evil mastermind humans were responsible for the dying earth. It is then up to Wall-E to show the spoon fed non-moving lazy bum humans to show what actually humans were when they had a life on a beautiful earth. It is a quite sarcastic movie is a slap on the leaders and generals creating warfare all around the globe that they are missing the element of humanity and love which is not a robot's property but a human being's."

","The movie WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class) is set 700 years in the future where Earth has been deemed uninhabitable due to excessive garbage. WALL-E is set out to change that and finds himself alone on the planet. One day EVE (Extra-terrestrial Vegetation Evaluator) visits the planet to scan earth for living vegetation and WALL-E becomes infatuated with her. The adventure continues in space when EVE finds a living plant WALL-E has found amongst the debris deactivating EVE and sending a beacon back to the ship. Humans aboard the ship are excessively large and have been waiting to see if Earth could ever be inhabited again. Autopilot tried to eliminate hopes to return, however EVE and WALL-E overcome and the Humans return to Earth to start again. <br/><br/>The theme of the movie is a critique on society for how the world manages waste. This is apparent in the opening scene as it shows the Earth 700 years in the future and the extreme amount of waste left on Earth. WALL-E collects items he finds dear to him, which are common items wasted and not recycled. The critique on society is similar to the Lego Movie, however instead of garbage it reflects consumerism and always having the newest hot item and easily disposing of the previous item. <br/><br/>WALL-E is a great film that shows us what life could be like if we do not avoid simple things like walking and exercise. Becoming a lazy technology could leave us ending up like the humans in the movie and leave the Earth in a whole heap of garbage. WALL-E is a reflection on how we need to enjoy ""life"" as represented in the plant WALL-E had found and to make simple changes now to avoid desperate measures in the future. <br/><br/>The animation in the film is very crisp and uses great vibrant lighting and colors to illustrate outer space. Long shots in the film really help to show the vastness of EVE and WALL-E's trip outside of the ship. The colors in the scene are very brilliant and vibrant to catch the viewer's attention. There is great detail in the futuristic ship, the Axiom, in each robot and their job they were created to do. The robots are all very lovable and show their personality. This is shown in the scene with the robot that is made to clean up tracks left by WALL-E and his obsessiveness with cleaning every spot that is made. <br/><br/>Overall this was a great film and I recommend it to children and adults as there are a lot of adult mannerisms in the movie. WALL-E and EVE take you on adventure to save the human race and get the humans to depend less on consumerism and technology."

","Rating-9/10<br/><br/>WALL-E is a Pixar animation that is one of yet again, a great animated movie. It is just such a sweet tale with robots who seem so human like it is just amazing and lovely in equal measure. This film really goes to show that Pixar is at the top of it's game still and really to be fair in the world of animation, they are still reigning supreme. I thought this was just about amazing and here below is just why so.<br/><br/>The movie is just the right length and so well timed as well with it's jokes but also it's more sweeter moments which blend together so well. The movie is pleasant all the way through, sure some things happen along the way but even in the more less happy moments, you still can't help feel a smile coming on watching little old WALL-E the robot trundle along, and on the case of WALL-E he is perfect as our main character, created with just the right amount of cuteness. <br/><br/>It has such a beautiful score accompanying it too with Thomas Newman making scenes even more brilliant with his delicate touch in music. Peter Gabriel's song ""Down to Earth"" is amazing as well and when it is played in the final credits you will just feel so warm about this movie. The animation style is also a massive highlight here too, it is so detailed and yet keeps that signature Pixar style to a tee, just wonderful stuff and all credit goes to the staff for doing such a good job.<br/><br/>One thing that really stood out for me is that the robots hardly communicate with voice, you can understand everything that is going on perfectly well with just the noises and actions of these really sweet little bots. I loved the style in which they talk too and the way Ben Burtt makes WALL-E's various sounds is just glorious with every little action and noise being completely flawless and yet again, so sweet.<br/><br/>Now there is no doubt this is aimed at kids of course it is, but it brings up very important points about the earth and how we treat it, and ourselves. The way in which now humans can't live on earth because of so much toxicity is weirdly disturbing to watch and raises absolutely massive environmental questions even if it just an animated movie. It also brings up the old robots of the future question, now of course some robots in this aren't the best of robots but this is one of the first films where future robots are portrayed as sweet and actually have feelings.<br/><br/>Now this is just fun all the way through and I couldn't recommend this more to anyone, whether kid or adult this is sure to make you happy and even the most grumpy of people could be swayed by this. It is also a good old laugh too, now I have seen funnier animations but this is still pretty funny so again all credit to the team and if you want a laugh too then this is it also.<br/><br/>Overall it is sublime animating and must be one of the best animations of all time(I know for some it could be of all time!). I can see just why critics and cinema goers alike loved this and going into it I expected a lot but got even more than I expected afterwards."

"kaustubhkumar94","10","1","2","1 April 2015"," Food for thought
","It's amazing how Pixar has flooded the alleys of emotion and depth with a concept not thought of in animated movies before. Food for thought, that's what this is... A concept this deep portrayed through a movie as light as Wall.E is a feat in itself. It's bizarre how the scriptwriters have delivered a power packed message in a manner simple enough for a kid to grasp and yet so engaging so as to keep an adult's eyes glued to the screen constantly too! It is an absolute must-watch for all people, children and adults across the world alike. The accolades presented to the movie are proof enough of the enormity of it's success among not only the viewers. Critic's have shown great appreciation for this truly wonderful piece of art. As a viewer, its only as simple as this: GO WATCH THIS!"
"joncheskin","10","1","2","25 February 2015"," First droid love story
","It is very rare that I award a movie a 10 out of 10 on one of these reviews, but WALL-E fits the bill for that rating for sure. To earn the rating, you have to do something completely brilliant, something that really has not been done before. WALL-E does just that.<br/><br/>The secret is the characters, and actually the trajectory of the artistic idea starts with the film to which WALL-E is most indebted, 2001: A Space Odyssey. In that movie, Stanley Kubrick decided it was time for a computer to be a real movie villain. The computer becomes a character, and actually turns malevolent. The idea touched a nerve that spawned an incredible number of spin-offs, most notably the Terminator movies, in which the idea is inverted (after the first movie), and the computer (machine) actually becomes a hero.<br/><br/>In WALL-E, what happens is we get the first love story between two pieces of technology, and the question is seriously raised about the meaning of love and humanity. The possibility of full-bodied in-love droids that actually strive to save humanity make a very clever point that technology is not necessarily evil, it only becomes evil with careless use or lack of control. The love story is incredibly touching because it occurs between objects that are the product of human creation. The whole idea is really original.<br/><br/>Add to this all of standard technical brilliance that we know of Pixar--awesome animation, music, etc., and WALL-E simply outdoes anything that Disney has done recently. It is rare to encounter a movie that is simply mind-boggling because of its originality."

","In the distant future, a small waste collecting robot inadvertently embarks on a space journey that will ultimately decide the fate of mankind.<br/><br/>What makes this film so great is how for most of the film (at least the first half), most of the story is told silently. Or, that is, at least without dialogue. To do that and still hold an audience's attention is a good feat. The artwork is also amazing, quite possibly the best Pixar film up to this point (2014).<br/><br/>The ecology theme is nice, but more than a little blunt. A ship full of fat earthlings who are so lazy they do not even know they have a pool? Now, it is one thing to say the future has the planet covered in trash (""Idiocracy"" made a similar claim), but this is just too blunt..."
"clercsyl9123","7","1","2","10 June 2014"," Love at first sight
","Many years in the future, the movie paints a hard picture of an earth that has been rendered inhabitable due to pollution. Wall-E is a robot who put in order earth but also collects certain objects he finds intriguing and brings them home for himself. When a higher-tech robot named Eve emerges from a spaceship, Wall-E is simultaneously terrified and intrigued. As we gradually learn, she is on a mission from a huge space station which houses the remaining human being, and her job is to look for any signs of life on earth. The humans of the future spend their days lying around on flying lounge chairs, with junk food and junk entertainment available to them at the flick of a finger. This film is full of love, full of respect and full of message. It's the best way for young people to see issues which could be determinant in the future."
"petervaughanvideos","9","1","2","30 April 2014"," Possibly the best animation I have watched!
","From the stunning visuals, to the incredible story, Wall.E is a truly amazing film that I can watch time and time again. I love how the animators have made the little robot feel so human. Watching Wall.E you really do empathise with Wall.E and you begin to put yourself in his situation on Earth. This film is visually stunning as well. It feels as if a lot of time and effort has gone into making this film, which you can appreciate. I do not think that another classic animation like this one will come around again very soon. I seriously recommend watching this film as it is a true piece of art and story-telling beauty. A film that you'll enjoy no matter your age."

This is such a touching and sweet story that makes it impossible not to fall in love with Wall*E.<br/><br/>The first time I watched it, I ended up crying! The story is very moving. The cuteness of Wall*E is something that perhaps many of us humans have already forgotten. It shows you how the simple things in life are actually the most valuables because at the end of our lives, it is all about he memories and how well we have spent our life.<br/><br/>It is based in a future were Earth was no longer safe for humans, but at one point they want to go back home and make everything right.

","I was quiet moved when I watched this movie at the first time. With demonstrating robots about human feeling. It was all about humans still it shows it to us with robots. Robots are quite evil in all movies. But Wall - E is not in evil or good. Robots can be like us with feelings. Nature of people can change but with using robots we got lazy. It is best animated movie of the year. It is perfect robot story. I advise you to watch it. Director shows us how human can be with using robots. It is one of the first movie we had loved robots not like transporter like. Editing Walt Disney Pictures released WALL-E in the United States and Canada on June 27, 2008. It grossed $23.2 million on its opening day, and $63.1 million during its opening weekend in 3,992 theaters, ranking number one at the box office. This ranks as the fifth highest-grossing opening weekend for a Pixar film. Following Pixar tradition, WALL-E was paired with a short film, Presto, for its theatrical release."
"meganvanwinkle","10","1","2","6 March 2014"," Amazing and Meaningful
","This story is not only funny it is cute, thrilling and inspiring. This story has much more of a deeper meaning than what you think. In my opinion the story has a strong sense of the meaning that if you love someone you got to show it and work for it. <br/><br/>Though, the one meaning hidden behind this is that all though we are all different, like the different machines, and some of us seem broken we are not. Since, all of us are different, no one is ever going to have the same beliefs as another or the same personality and looks. For, we all have different purposes in life. And our story's affect others. Wall e showed this to the others machines and showed them that they were perfect they way they were."
"Laakbaar","9","1","2","19 February 2014"," Brilliant animated science-fiction film with a strong message
","There's not much I can add after almost a thousand reviews. I agree with the collective wisdom of IMDb users. This is a wonderfully written and beautifully animated science-fiction movie with lovable, human-like robot characters.<br/><br/>Yes, I suppose children might enjoy this film, but it is also aimed directly at adults. None of the characters in this movie are children (of the human, animal or robot kind). As charming and cartoonish as it is, ""Wall-E"" is a rather intelligent, harsh indictment of American consumer culture. One of the themes is environmentalism; another is humanity's growing dependence on its machines.<br/><br/>A huge amount of work must have gone into inventing and creating this film's version of the future Earth, and also the world of ""Axiom"". The way the creators were able to anthropomorphise the robots was remarkably creative. The movie reflects our own ambivalence: we love these little bots, but at the same time we see the danger. Can we ever live without them?<br/><br/>Six years after release, this film still delights and amazes. It's difficult to think of a single thing to criticize about it.<br/><br/>I can't say that I am a die-hard Pixar fan per se. Many of their films (eg Cars) don't work for me at all. This is one of the best of the bunch, right up there beside ""Finding Nemo"". Kudos to Andrew Stanton.<br/><br/>After seeing it three times now, I'm tempted to give it 10, but 9 will do for now."

Sure, WALL·E is adorable, and as much credit as the animators get for that, this film would be nothing without Stanton's screenplay, which features very little dialogue but is still notably intelligent and surprisingly subtle, making a refreshing change from the 'go green' campaigns we're all so used to. Does ""WALL·E"" have a message? Sure, but it's an important message and it is delivered subtly and beautifully."
"senuke111","Null","1","2","15 January 2014"," indeed such a touching cinema
","AdamZ. Jan 12, 2009 9 It stuns me to think that there are actually people out there in the world that did not enjoy this movie. What Pixar, Stanton and his team have created is a heart-warming throwback to the core values of what we as humans should be embracing, purity and at the centre of that, love. Stanton has achieved that through a most unlikely but completely enchanting and lovable character in Wall-E. To watch him potter around a once rich and teeming landscape now reduced to a desolate wasteland by the greed and inaction of the human race, casually collecting up trinkets of a lost civilisation along the way and enjoying the 9 to 5 job for which he was created was nothing short of a delight. To watch him develop a sense of his duty to the human race was profound. No mention needs to be made of the films visual qualities - it is as expected. Stanton delivers also on the speed and pace of the movie. You are never left wanting. The movie opens with the unsettling imagery of the earth's landscape in complete disarray. It is familiar and yet disturbing all at once. Earth is a complete mess and has been so for 700 years previous, save for the extraordinary efforts of the little leading robot. You literally love Wall-E at first site and for the more jaded among us, grow to love him as the movie progresses. Wall-E is to modern cinema what Chaplin was to pantomime. This cannot be understated and the significance of Wall-E's on screen presence, by and large, should have every audience member captivated. By and Large? Possibly an acronym for the films corporate villain, BnL? The addition of EVE served to provide the audience with the perfect foil for Wall-E's doting eccentrics and the perfect partner it seemed for Wall-E himself. A classic example of the lady and the tramp, a lovable charming lout, rough around the edges, trying to and succeeding in, gaining the affections of the upper class lady. The two fit perfectly despite coming from obviously different environmental backgrounds. The scenes involving EVE and Wall-E are pure cinematic genius. You find yourself asking if its possible to actually ""love"" a robot but in Wall-E it is actually possible. It is initially an alien notion but you find yourself warming to him when you gradually discover you indeed share many of the same affections and traits. His dance routine with the hubcap, the way he tried on the bra, keeping the box and throwing the diamond ring away and the way he grasped at his metallic appendages while watching the old VHS being notable examples. Scenes involving Wall-E's complete selflessness are tear jerking and you cant help but feel for the little guy when, having been rescued from deep space ejection, he crawls, mangled and critically damaged, to retrieve the plant that the future of the human race depends on. Handing it to EVE, he says ""Dirrr...ect..ive"" and at that moment the only ""directive"" in your subconscious is to burst out crying. Even more upsetting was the sad realisation that having been repaired and rebooted by EVE upon return to earth, Wall-E seemed never to be himself again, his memory apparently having been erased. An electronic kiss from EVE restores his memory and finally we, on screen cast included, all breathe a sigh of relief. Without drawbacks as such to comment on, the only ""drawback"" I can see is that there are actually people out there who didn't love this film to bits. Those in this category need to ask themselves some very hard questions indeed!"

","Throughout the last decade, I haven't felt that Disney has come out with many cartoon films that were as great as the ones prior to the year 2000. I personally feel that films like Cinderella, The Lion King, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, and Mulan were great films. The Little Mermaid is also on that list since it's the first movie I ever saw in theaters. I loved it so much as a child that I danced up and down the isles. I was extremely happy with Wall-E. It was highly original and kept me interested thought the whole film. It didn't compare to or copy other Disney films and it was a bright new idea. I would definitely say that this is on my list of top Disney cartoon movies. This movie was original, and touching. The story made me laugh, and tear up a bit. In future years, I hope that Disney continues to come up with great films like this."
"zinskye","9","1","2","8 November 2013"," One of the best Animated Movie I've seen!
","It's equally beautiful and fun to watch. I just couldn't imagine that even robots can touch your heart too. :) no wonder many people loves it! Also it contains a whole lot of moral lessons to learn, and a lot of realizations about things will just pop up on your head while watching it because of it's creative concept. I think this movie stands as a reminder or whatsoever for us to become more responsible but in a fun way!<br/><br/>The movie has a wonderful look. Like so many of the Pixar animated features, it finds a color palette that's bright and cheerful, but not too pushy, and a tiny bit realistic at the same time. The drawing style is Comic Book Cool, as perfected in the funny comics more than in the superhero books: Everything has a stylistic twist to give it flair. And a lot of thought must have gone into the design of WALL-E, for whom I felt a curious affection. Consider this hunk of tin beside the Kung Fu Panda. The panda was all but special-ordered to be lovable, but on reflection, I think he was so fat, it wasn't funny anymore. WALL-E, however, looks rusty and hard-working and plucky, and expresses his personality with body language and (mostly) with the binocular-like video cameras that serve as his eyes. The movie draws on a tradition going back to the earliest days of Walt Disney, who reduced human expressions to their broadest components and found ways to translate them to animals, birds, bees, flowers, trains and everything else.<br/><br/>What's more, I don't think I've quite captured the film's enchanting storytelling. Directed and co-written by Andrew Stanton, who wrote and directed ""Finding Nemo,"" it involves ideas, not simply mindless scenarios involving characters karate-kicking each other into high-angle shots. It involves a little work on the part of the audience, and a little thought, and might be especially stimulating to younger viewers. This story told in a different style and with a realistic look could have been a great science-fiction film. For that matter, maybe it is."
"StevePulaski","10","1","2","12 October 2013"," A refreshing, limitless landmark
","WALL-E is perhaps one of the most subversive films by Pixar Animation Studios and one of the most significant animated films in many years. The film is comprised of little dialog, breathtakingly clear, but often dirty visuals that contradict the bubbly, colorful palette of colors we're used to seeing in contemporary animation, and can be seen as a showcase for several motifs and deep themes.<br/><br/>We open in the year 2805, where Earth has become a haven for mass amounts of garbage thanks to extreme levels of consumerism perpetuated by a massive corporation called ""Buy N Large."" Earth's population was evacuated in the early 2100's to reside in certain ships in space. Left behind were ""WALL-E"" robots, small trash-compactors that would make identical cubic blocks out of the trash left behind by humans before stacking them into gigantic skyscrapers. Eventually, all the bots died off, except for one, who is still mindlessly operating and compacting trash day-after-day.<br/><br/>WALL-E lives in a storage truck, kept cozy by pieces from human civilization that bring him comfort. One day, he is brought more comfort by discovering EVE, a much-more advanced robot who is deployed from the Buy N Large spaceship to track down vegetation on Earth. WALL-E meets and is attracted by EVE, and the two form a bond, communicating through ambiguous sounds and the occasional disjointed line of robotic dialog.<br/><br/>There is hardly any dialog during the first act of the film; the second act is populated by a bit more than the first and the third is largely devoted to speaking because our focus has shifted from the dilapidated Earth to the more populous Axiom spaceship. Much of the film is largely focused on showcasing the variety of sounds WALL-E and EVE make, leaving the viewer to utilize those little bits of sound as the main point of reference when it comes to trying to define the emotion and the feelings the characters are currently going through. The sound design was largely conducted by Ben Burtt, the so-called ""godfather of sound"" for the film industry, and his meticulous craft shows. A viewing of the making of WALL-E reminds - or perhaps informs us - that when animation is made, nothing has a sound. Animated character movements are, by default, silent and every sound, down to the footsteps, must be done in real life before being uploaded to the film itself. The meticulous craft of Burtt and the entire sound team is an act of devotion and perfection that may go noticed by an inattentive viewer.<br/><br/>Returning to my point made about WALL-E being the most thematically heavy film Pixar has ever made, such themes are technological advances, mass-consumerism, Christianity, love, corporation-takeover, and conformity. Consider the Buy N Large, the massive store in the sky that caters to an obese population of men and women that ride around in hovering seats, consuming food and drinks out of a cup, and wearing whatever the loudspeaker tells faithful shoppers what to where. The scene exploring the Buy N Large warehouse is a fascinating but poignant look at the effects of mass consumerism in America. It shows the kind of thing we'd like to believe we're immune to as humans but, unfortunately, are not and can be manipulated and directed in ways we never truly thought possible.<br/><br/>The film was directed by Andrew Stanton, who largely led the team in creating Finding Nemo, one of Pixar's most renowned pictures for its emotionally touching story and beautiful animation. Finding Nemo featured some of the best animation, I believe, the CGI world has ever seen, and WALL-E's grittier, darker animation is not to be dismissed either. Stanton and the team of animators capture the vast landscapes of Earth and its desolate state, as well as space and its limited state. The animation is put to an incredible effect and Stanton proves to be worthy of operating with the animation company.<br/><br/>WALL-E, too, shows a future where conformity is incredible. Everyone wears the same thing, possesses the same features, operates with little individualism, and function in the way where laziness appears to be something of an achievement. This is a frightening feature in a kids film; one that I don't see many young children picking up instantly. This isn't just the part of the film that keeps adults awake but keeps adults questioning the future we may be in for.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the film works beautifully as a tone-piece and an amazingly made film in terms of grandiose animation and sound design. Ben Burtt's sound design and meticulous craft in pairing each obscure movement with a practical sound is easily the strongest thing in the film. Despite the lack of dialog, the film never fails to engage a viewer by showing them an unconventional love story that is made unpredictable because the way that Wall-E and EVE communicate is nonlinear and often ambiguous. These ingredients make WALL-E a truly stunning piece of animated art.<br/><br/>Directed by: Andrew Stanton."
"Rendianami","10","1","2","19 July 2013"," All of my Creativity is now Gone
","There is a time when you have to wonder, ""Will I ever see anything that can possibly top this level of intricacy?"" Because I have never seen a more beautiful and mind-blowing animated film than WALL-E. <br/><br/>This movie has been my number one animated film ever. I never saw it in theaters, my first time being about an hour on the television, but it was one of the most captivating things I had ever seen, so I went ahead and bought it. I do not regret seeing it 15+ times now.<br/><br/>There's so, SO much to praise about this. You have to appreciate PIXAR's work on this. It's almost like a silent film, where you go 15 minutes into the film without dialogue, which is impressive because they handled it beautifully. Then, there's the music. I have found my new favorite composer. <br/><br/>And THEN there's the graphics. They are beautiful and realistic (well, at least on Earth. Once we reach The AXIOM, humans are a little unrealistic, but then again, they have a great style that contrasts with the live-action video that is played of previous Captains of the AXIOM). <br/><br/>Then there's the characters. I don't think most people will get into depth with this, but nearly EVERY character is dynamic in some way, and it all happens from WALL-E's interactions. While WALL-E is a static character, the characters surrounding him change in some way, mostly personality wise. Like an automated bot, learning to wave back at WALL- E. It breaks from the stoic life that robots learn to live with, and teaches them that diversity and personality aren't always such a bad thing.<br/><br/>Then there's AUTO. Many people believe he's the villain, but in all reality, he's just following his directives. Many of the directives are so vague/simple, that it creates conflicts with higher priority directives, causing him to have to go against his orders to follow the highest priority directives. I can't even try to get deep enough into this, because it's such a complex ordeal that most people won't understand. He's not the bad guy, though. There's no real 'villain' in WALL-E, really. In fact, if we actually look at who might be the real 'hero' of the movie, it would probably be M-O, due to his actions in the movie that contribute to the success of WALL-E and EVE's actions. <br/><br/>And then there's the plot. I love EVERYTHING about it. WALL-E was PIXAR's last ""original"" movie. Oh man, there's too many words in my head to describe it. It's just so amazing.<br/><br/>And I cried. I cried a lot to this, because of how PIXAR managed to do everything right. I seriously regret not being able to see this on the big screen, but if ever a time comes again that they play it, I will be there to spend all of my money on it.<br/><br/>The best animated movie I have ever seen, and if ever a movie manages to triumph it, it will still remain in a special place in my heart."

It's just that I would not mix it with the story of WALL-E and EVE, or any other love story. <br/><br/>And so that's what I liked about WALL-E, it was a love story and it was wonderful and touching (and how touching was the act of physical touching, between WALL-E and EVE). I just finished watching it on DVD, and I'll be taking it for a spin again, perhaps right after I've written this, but I'll most likely skip the lazy fat gluttony parts, and skip also the threatening even lethal Auto-Pilot robot, who looked suspiciously like HAL 9000.<br/><br/>But I want to leave on a good note, in recognition of the wonderful love story. <br/><br/>I liked WALL-E's collection of recycled treasures found among the ruins, and the way he saw a trash can lid as a facsimile for a straw hat, like the one worn by Michael Crawford in the ""Hello Dolly"" clip he seems to watch to stave off loneliness. And he uses it as a prop (just as Crawford did) while inviting EVE to trip the light fantastic... but she's so heavy on her feet (and so enthusiastic), she nearly destroys his humble home in an earthquake. I liked when WALL-E presented EVE with the only living thing left on earth (other than the Cockroach, which is not a very romantic gift), and how then the little green plant becomes not just a symbol of life, but of love too.<br/><br/>I said I was touched by their physical touching, and it made the film at it's end, when a resurrected but apparently different WALL-E, made from replacement parts, didn't recognize EVE or even show any emotion at all... until EVE, in a touching farewell to a lost love, held WALL-E's hand, and he came back to her and to us.<br/><br/>I am of course giving this movie a 10, and I'll immediately watch the DVD again, but like I said I'll skip over some of the parts, as being something I'd rather think about in a different venue, separate from a love story."
"ChristianUnchained","9","1","2","23 April 2013"," An actually *Important* Pixar feature
","A consistently ingenious little animated comedy. The material here is fairly dark and mature, while there are plenty of laughs for the kids. Pixar knows how to blend these styles in an expert manner, and Wall-E proves it, further proving that the creative process is, at its core, the most important first step in creating a memorable film. <br/><br/>Wall E is memorable, emotional, very funny and important. Its wonderfully told minimalistic story is ingenious, and the movie is brought to life with technical wizardry. I do believe certain elements could have been drawn out and couple plot points further expanded upon, but overall Wall-E is one incredible little animated film."
"joemhoward","10","1","2","3 March 2013"," Masterful, intelligent and yes..a little preachy
","I can understand some people's dislike for Wall-E. Yes, it could be construed as ""preachy"", but isn't all art with a message a little like that? When it comes to the environment, it is hard not to come across as preachy. However, that is just one facet of this truly magnificent film. Pixar really outdid themselves with the detail and beauty of the animation. The story is simple enough, and Andrew Stanton homages everything from 2001 to Star Wars in his movie, but in reality, Wall-E just kicks along beautifully. Its almost a silent film with beautifully dramatic and touching moments. It also puts across an apocalyptic message which for me, worked wonderfully, but as I said above, is preachy if you couldn't care less. And the love story at the heart of the film is as touching and moving as any I've seen and along with UP, Pixar have managed to outdo virtually any movie I can think of when it comes to romance.<br/><br/>If you haven't seem Wall-E, do not hesitate any longer..."
"hinkle13","10","1","2","10 February 2013"," Pixar does a fantastic job bring robotic characters to life
","WALL-E, voiced by Ben Burtt, is a robotic trash compactor designed to clean up Earth that has been destroyed by trash. He is the only compactor left on Earth after all humans were sent to live on a spaceship. Robotic probe's are sent back to Earth to detect if the planet is safe for the humans to return. EVE, voiced by Elissa Knight, is the robotic probe that comes to Earth. WALL-E quickly falls in love with EVE and shows her the plant he has found. This is what she needs to report back to the ship. The ship comes back to get EVE and WALL-E doesn't want to lose her so he hitches a ride to space on her ship. Here they struggle to show the Captain, voiced by Jeff Garlin, the plant that will start their return to Earth. Building their friendship, WALL-E and EVE encounter many obstacles in order to return the humans to Earth.<br/><br/>While plot is important, this film focuses on the emotional effect the bond between WALL-E and EVE has. EVE is taken after being declared defective and WALL-E causes chaos trying to follow where she is going to make sure she is okay. WALL-E is forced onto a ship to be sent back to Earth so he is no longer a threat to the secret plan put into force by AUTO, the robotic ship pilot. EVE follows the ship he is set off on to save him from destruction. This relationship goes back and forth building the connection between the two.<br/><br/>After EVE and Wall-E return to Earth a jump cut is used to show the transition from inside Wall-E's home to outside. This aids in focusing on the reconnection of Wall-E and EVE. The camera goes directly to them locking hands (or robotic parts in this case). Even animated films can make viewers feel the emotional connections between characters. In many scenes, the camera angle gives you up-close shots of the machines and allows you to feel the emotion they are going through during these scenes. Although machines don't actually have emotion, this film allows you to use your own emotion for the characters. Much like WALL-E, Disney Pixar's Cars is a movie that focuses on the relationship built between Lightning McQueen and Sally. The plot is important but the theme of the film brings you back to how close they become. Animation allows viewers to make their own interpretation of each character and Pixar does a fantastic job bring robotic characters to life. Excellent film!"

","Pixar animation designed the lighting of this film in a perfect way as to capture the darkness the sludge filled water way Wall-E was rowing Eve through. Also, during his trip through space when he was reaching out to touch the vibrant blue lite or even as they pass along the sun. This trip reminds us that nature is beautiful and we should appreciate our surroundings. In addition to the lighting the animators captured the angles of the ship over head of Wall-E in a splendid way. The following details such as the glowing red rocks and the top of his head added a detail to the film that can be noticed throughout. This film has all the makings of a classic. The artful animation and the lovable character, both human and robots, bring a sense of togetherness.

","WALL-E is just a sweet movie, which deals on the loneliness and determination of a singular robot that developed sentience while watching videos of human interaction and listening to music. WALL-E was the only one of his kind left on Earth and he kept at his job even though others like him have been unable to keep up and have become rust and parts for WALL-E to use to carry his singular assignment as a cleaner of the earth, along with him is a friend, a cockroach which WALL-E adores.<br/><br/>WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter – Earth Class) developed a romantic endeavor with another robot named EVE (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator), a romance that Andrew Stanton (a Christian) the writer/director came up with, as he viewed WALL-E's loneliness like that of Adam in the Bible and how God gave him Eve as a companion, so the name of WALL-E's companion was named EVE in reference to the Eve in the Bible.<br/><br/>With Stanton wanting WALL-E as a box with no mouth or nose and EVE as an egg with no mouth or nose the animators watched a series of Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin movies for almost a year to be able to learn how to create emotions silently.<br/><br/>WALL-E's plot is about a singular robot that in 2805 was still cleaning the earth after the humans were evacuated in 2105 to starliners. <br/><br/>As the Earth was becoming a waste land humans had to be taken out of it so that it can be cleaned so when all human were gone, left behind were trash compactor Waste Allocation Load Lifter – Earth Class (WALL-E) robots, to clean the Earth but as the years passed all other robots broke down leaving except one, so this singular WALL-E robot carried on with the earth cleaning task.<br/><br/>One day a beautiful robot named EVE came to Earth, and WALL-E fell for her; although she was a hard nut to crack, WALL-E triumphed but when her task was trying to set them apart, WALL-E followed her to a starliner where humans were, there we come across other plots and subplots concerning the humans if there are to go back to earth or not.<br/><br/>WALL-E deals with a lot of major issues that we are either facing or going to face in the nearest future, the problem of waste management, laziness, obesity, consumerism and environmental problems that the world will be facing if we don't sit up.<br/><br/>WALL-E won numerous accolades, including an Oscar for Best Animated feature, it was also ranked number movie in the 2010 Times magazine movie of the decade.

"Desertman84","10","1","2","1 March 2012"," One For The Ages
","WALL-E is a computer-animated post-apocalyptic science fiction film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and directed by Andrew Stanton. The story follows a robot named WALL-E, who is designed to clean up a waste- covered Earth far in the future. He falls in love with another robot named EVE, who also has a programmed task, and follows her into outer space on an adventure that changes the destiny of both his kind and humanity. Both robots exhibit an appearance of free will and emotions similar to humans, which develop further as the film progresses.<br/><br/>After directing Finding Nemo, Stanton felt Pixar had created believable simulations of underwater physics and was willing to direct a film largely set in space. Most of the characters do not have actual human voices, but instead communicate with body language and robotic sounds, designed by Ben Burtt, that resemble voices. In addition, it is the first animated feature by Pixar to have segments featuring live-action characters.<br/><br/>This computer-animated tale is about a wide-eyed robot who travels to the deepest reaches of outer space in search of a newfound friend. The year is 2700, and planet Earth has long been uninhabitable. For hundreds of years, WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class) has been taking out the trash, and collecting precious knick-knacks in order to stave off the boredom of his dreary routine. Little does WALL-E realize that he has recently stumbled onto a secret that could save planet Earth, and once again make the ravaged planet safe for all humankind. When highly advanced search robot EVE makes friends with WALL-E and realizes the value of his remarkable discovery, she excitedly races back to let the humans know that there's hope for their home planet after all. But after centuries alone in space, WALL-E can't stand the thought of losing the only friend he's ever known, and eagerly follows her into the deepest reaches of space on the adventure of a lifetime. Along the way, the friendly trash-collecting robot who has always known what he was made for gradually begins to understand what he was meant for.<br/><br/>Charming, audacious, and timely, Wall-E's lighthearted magic and stellar visuals testify once again to Pixar's ingenuity.It is a story about love and loneliness, perseverance and triumph, the possibilities and pitfalls of human existence. That this story is told by way of the exploits of a tiny, faceless robot only makes it more extraordinary.It is one for the ages, a masterpiece to be savored before or after the end of the world - - assuming, like the title character, you're still around when all the humans have taken off and have access to an old video player."

","I have always been the one to love Pixar films. If its from Pixar I will always love it and laugh because Pixar produces the best films ever. Wall-E is a perfect example of this. Its fun, funny, and has a storyline that could happen eventually. The idea of giving robots voices is great, but to give them the personalities of humans, was amazing. Making them feel emotional that you start caring for the robots and that you want them to succeed in whatever they are trying to do. The humans are totally oblivious to what goes on around them, and somehow a company seemed to take over all of mankind, and they didn't even see it coming. Wall-E is great and I highly recommend that everybody see it."
"paul2001sw-1","9","1","2","20 June 2011"," A glimpse of the future
","I quite like some of Pixar's films, but I tend to feel that they're somewhat overpraised, and there's certainly a theme linking their protagonists, who have variously been cute talking toys, cute talking insects, cute talking monsters, cute talking fish, and cute talking cars. Prior to watching I didn't have that much anticipation for 'WALL-E', about a (presumably cute talking) robot - but how wrong I was. The robot doesn't talk for a start, and the film has the most extraordinary animation I have seen, notably for its inventiveness, attention to detail and sheer beauty. Indeed, many of the scenes have a balletic grace, with obvious nods to 2001 but also (especially in the first half of the film, where there's barely a word of dialogue), to the silent movie era (was I the only one reminded of Chaplin's skating scene in 'Modern Times' by some of the choreography?) Throw in a truly eerie and disturbing portrait of a post-habitable earth in which even (almost all) the robots have died out, and an opposing dystopia of a space ark where humanity survives in total comfort and zero dignity, and you have many of the elements in place of a classic film. Perhaps inevitably, the second half (while still good) is more like a traditional Pixar movie, the story of the triumph of the underdog and the audacity of hope; yet the overall tone of the movie is such, that when the ending threatens to be very sad, you have no idea whether there will be a final happy twist or it will leave you in tears. Until now, even when I've liked good animations, I've scoffed at those who argue they rival the best ""real"" films - but 'WALL-E' is a genuine artistic achievement, and wholly deserving of its praise."

","OK so I've read the reviews that slate this film and to those people, I have only one message: You have completely missed the point! While I agree that this film does not have a complex and original storyline and no, it does not have finer nuances of sub-plot or subtlety. I agree that this film has clichés, that it occasionally lacks substance and that the narrative sometimes lacks direction but SO WHAT? Did I miss something? When did this film advertise itself as a historic milestone of cinematic genius? At what point does the synopsis imply that the viewer will be kept pondering until the ultimate denouement when it's finally discovered that all was not as it seemed? GET A GRIP! Not all films are there to be dissected and analysed by pseudo-intellectuals with an over-inflated sense of their own importance and way too much time on their hands. We COULD sit here and analyse the cartoon Tom & Jerry pointing out the racist undertones, the overt animal cruelty and the inaccuracies to real-life situations OR we could get a life! If you want to stroke your intellectual ego then go analyse a film worth analysing; don't pick on a cartoon that promises nothing more than what it is: A funny film that can be enjoyed by young and old alike. <br/><br/>I find comments like 'giving this film a high score says more about the person voting than it does about the film.' and 'a superficial film for superficial people' insulting. This implication that a person who likes this film must lack intelligence actually says more about the people writing those comments. OK, so you didn't like the film but how conceited are you to attack those who did, suggesting that we are merely sheep who cannot think for ourselves? Oh let us bow down with gratitude to you for lighting the path and showing us the errors of our ways! Or better still, let's not.<br/><br/>To those of you who do have a life and are simply looking for an hour and half's worth of entertainment, then Wall-e comes with a high recommendation. Wall-e is a wonderful film, a Pixar classic – it does exactly what it says on the tin, nothing more, nothing less."
"dragosmarcean","9","1","2","12 January 2011"," A Wonderful Pixar production,but....
","As usual, Pixar managed to impress it's audience with it's amazing movies. Wall-E is one of them. The graphic detailes are exquisite. The fluidity of the character's movement is, as usual, incredible. The deailes ar very realistic. You can almost feel like you are gathering the trash allong with Wall-E. The sounds are as realistic as they can get. The explosions made were so realistic that almost made me shiver as I watched the movie at a higher volume. The rocket's landing made you feel like you were in Wall-E's shoes and you were digging to save your life. Some things that I didn't like and the motive that I gave it 9 and not 10: The expression of Wall-E's eyes symbolises a life on Earth with it filled with garbage. Even if he looks sad, he actually has all the emotion of a human being: love, fear, timidity, careness, anger etc. Still the constant sadness in his eyes doesn't work for me. The fact that every person on the ship was morbidly obesse, shoes what to much advanced technollogy can to to a person. It has the role to make our lives better and not destroy them. That made me think about the future of my great-grand children. Also, the first space travel between Earth and The mother ship was a little boring. And the lack of funny dialogues was a minuse of this movie. I understand that the robots were saying only a couple of words, but in a movie I prefer dialogue humor. ""Wall-E"" is the kind of film that makes you cry or say""AAAWWWW!"" and laugh at the same time."
"Tweekums","10","1","2","2 January 2011"," Another classic from Pixar
","Having enjoyed Pixar's 'Incredibles' and 'Toy Story' trilogy I was keen to see 'Wall-E' when it was on television. The reviews I'd heard suggested that I'd be in for a treat and they weren't wrong; Pixar may make films that are aimed at a younger audience but adults are unlikely to feel childish if they watch them; this is especially true of 'Wall-E'. Set in a distant future where the Earth has been abandoned by humanity because pollution and the build up of garbage has made the planet uninhabitable one small robot toils to tidy up the mess left behind; that robot is Wall-E. Throughout his days he crushes the rubbish into cubes then stacks them in towers that have come to dwarf the city's long abandoned skyscrapers. When he finds items he likes such as an old Rubik's Cube or a small weed he takes it back to his 'home' to store. His existence is changed one day when a spaceship arrives and drops off a shiny new robot who we later learn is called EVE; the two of them become friends and everything goes well for them until he shows her the plant, then she takes it, puts it inside her and shuts down. It appears that her mission was to search for plant life then wait to be retrieved. When this happens she is taken away on the space ship, not wanting to be without her Wall-E clings on and is taken back to the Axiom; the ship where what is left of humanity lives. The people aren't like people now though; they are all over-weight which is hardly surprising as they don't seem to get out of their hover chairs and are waited on by a variety of robots. Once here Wall-E and EVE's adventures are just beginning as they must avoid the security systems and deliver the plant to the scanner which the ships autopilot is determined to stop them doing as it had been informed that Earth would never be suitable for resettlement.<br/><br/>As always with Pixar films the animation was just about flawless, I was surprised however that it was not 100% animated; the various adverts and messages recorded at the time of Earth's abandonment featured live action actors, this was an inspired move as it only served to emphasise how much humanity had changed when we saw the fat CGI people later on. The minimal use of dialogue was a brave idea that worked for me, one would have though that having no dialogue spoken by a main character in the opening twenty minutes and not a huge amount afterwards would lead to a boring film but it was in fact engrossing. The character designs were good; the beaten up look of Wall-E, which reminded me of 'Number Five' from 'Short Circuit' contrasted beautifully with the clean modern EVE. While there were a few nods to other films such as 2001: A Space Odyssey the viewer is unlikely to feel they are missing something if they don't get the reference; as Pixar don't feel it necessary to fill their films with lots of pop culture references I can see this and their other films being watched for decades to come in the way old Disney films can still entertain today's children."
"gigan-92","10","1","2","13 December 2010"," Andrew Stanton's Best
","I saw the film and honestly believe it could easily be Disney's best. Pixar is already known for providing something different with each film, but this one goes beyond all others in its scope and tone. It works on many levels, that of a children's' film, a unique love story, as well as an sci-fi epic. Ben Burtt did wonders with the sound and yet these mostly silent characters are more involving and moving than any animated film's I've seen in along, long, time. The animation is visually stunning to say the least, and every shot is done beautifully. It's done with an artistic style that future films will struggle to even come close to.<br/><br/>Not only that, but the film has a thinly veiled message concerning the future of our once precious Earth. The film delivers particularly clever writing, literally going well beyond what most thought could be integrated in a film aimed for children. Truly Disney's greatest achievement, although I to this day struggle over whether it overtakes my fondness of ""Toy Story"" and its excellent sequels. ""Wall-E"" is among the best films of all time."

I have spent the last 30 years working at a waste-water plant, a profession that others look down on, like our little hero who does a job that is needed. I relate to it with no reservations. His simple joys and his pain of unfilled love affects us all. Eve is the dream boat of his imagination - totally perfect except for one minor thing, her atomic gun which she uses to easily. The space trip is beautifully done with just the right amount of humor intertwined in it. You can't help but appreciate the time and details that went into this film, I even like it that we humans are shown in less detail (fat with low bone structure).

"scarletminded","7","1","2","23 September 2010"," It's cuter than 9, but has a lot of problems...
","Being that I just wanted the movie 9 (the steampunk one, not the Fellini inspired musical Nine) and Mike & Molly, I am surprised how much the two of these item fit into my Wall-E review. Both this movie and 9 are set on an earth that has been killed off, probably more so in 9. But where 9 takes the depressing low road, Wall-E takes the high road. It's cute. The lead robot much like the robot from Short Circuit, revamped for the future age. Even though the movie is showing destruction and how people get covered in their own garage so much it kills everything off, it still does this in a charming way, as Wall-E collects items and even watches musicals and acts them out. He is a robot with a soul, though we aren't sure where it comes from, since we aren't told. Maybe these Wall-Es came with AI, maybe not. <br/><br/>Anyway, Wall-E is out for love and finds it in Eve, a robot that comes to his supposedly dead planet to look for plant life, for once it is found, the humans who left the Earth for a 5 year, but now 700 year tour, can return to their home planet. I should point out it has to be plant life because Wall-E's companion cockroach apparently isn't life enough for the humans to return. I always felt plants had to be there in order for cockroaches to survive, but maybe the old surviving a nuclear blast thing is true. Wall-E finds his love in Eve and has a lot of misadventures taking care of her and then leaving Earth to be with her.<br/><br/>The humans in 700 years have become fat tourists, sitting by a pool they never use, constantly consuming, not being able to walk since they float on platform chairs and have robots do everything for them. This is where my viewing of Mike and Molly comes in. I am not sure about the current influx of obese people as a hot topic, but it's sort of annoying. I don't think obesity is such the epidemic people say it is and also, it is used to get a laugh in a way I am sure Anorexia nervosa would never get. I am sort of tired of seeing it. There are plenty of people I know who eat a lot of food and don't exercise that are slim because of high metabolisms. It's a minor gripe, but if you are sick of fat people jokes, I would only watch the first hour of this.<br/><br/>Plus, I wonder why the president is a real life person (Fred Willard) while the captain of the ship is digital. It sort of bugged me. <br/><br/>Overall, this movie will keep your attention, despite its faults. The plot line is decent, it isn't scary for kids like 9 would be, it goes a long way on character development, which is seldom used these days, instead of action. There is action in this one too, but not an excess of it, again good for the creators of this film. They made something fun and interesting, without the cheap pitfalls other movie companies to do get a quick buck. This movie looks like people really cared about it."
"msb-utils","6","1","2","5 September 2010"," Simple and safe story in a high quality CG movie
","First of all, I have to add my voice to the mass that praises the technical aspects of this movie. Considering the budget, we couldn't expect less. The soundtrack also is orchestrated as expected from a work of this financial magnitude.<br/><br/>The story, however, have mixed features. I also analyze it in 2 halves. The beginning is nice: I consider it has originality in the future it portrays. The main plot and elements are a common formula, the details are what count. Except for the exaggeration in the robot's ""humanity"", it's a very good start. Then we have the second half, which may be totally dismissed. It's almost like a totally different movie. It portrays the USA society almost as it is now; it displays an absolutely human robot; it tells us a tale that have been told over and over for centuries. The characters, action and everything else is so overly far-fetched. Although the pace of the film is eventful, apart from a few references that may make it enjoyable, it's a bore.<br/><br/>I recommend it for the less thought-demanding audiences.

","I do regret missing seeing ""WALL-E"" on the big screen, so I had to console myself by watching this ""mechanical"", post-utopic, sci-fi romance melodrama on Encore at home. My attitude towards the overall product is somewhat ambivalent. Overall, I am generally glad that I saw it, but I am leery of comments declaring it a complete masterpiece. Make no mistake; WALL-E solidifies Pixar's impressive track record of entertaining movies with something substantial to say, but I felt that in the last analysis it gives its unassuming protagonist a little bit of short shrift.<br/><br/>WALL-E (hereafter WALL-ET because of his obvious homage to ET and his beneficial effect upon Pixar's revenues, hee-hee) is a bit of a Frankenstein. In addition to ET, he is also an amalgamated mash-up of R2-D2, Johnny 5 from the ""Short Circuit"" films, the gardening droids from ""Silent Running"", and even the hobbit Bilbo Baggins. This sentient trash disposal unit lives a near solitary existence on a trash-besotted Earth in the 29th century. Ironically, although it looks like a sepia-toned nuclear wasteland, Earth just choked up on its own refuse. Humans have abandoned the planet and plan to return when Earth is once again habitable. WALL-ET's eternal job is to clean the rubbish one cube at a time. He has done this so long he has constructed cubed junk towers and pyramids. During his eons-long existence he has accrued enough sentience to collect discarded items like a packrat, watch a time-worn ""Hello Dolly"" videocassette (what, no DVD?)and to befriend the only living thing left, a surprisingly appealing cockroach (although given their legendary durability, WALL-ET should have had thousands of cockroach friends).<br/><br/>The first, rough third of the movie silently records WALL-ET's bleak daily grind. The second third of the movie depicts WALL-ET's encounter with a ""feminine"" robotic scout from a reconnaissance ship. Named EVE, her job is to scan Earth for any signs of vegetative life. At first, WALL-ET and EVE's encounters and courtship is tentative and perilous, as EVE basically regards WALL-ET as a hostile enemy good only for shooting and WALL-ET timorously tries to make friends with her. EVE eventually warms up to WALL-ET when he shows her a plant he has transferred to an old shoe (for me, this was a poignant moment that asserted that life will always find a way no matter what). She appropriates the plant to take back to the mothership, the Axiom, for analysis. Upon analysis, the Axiom will determine that it is time to return home with its cargo of dispossessed human passengers.<br/><br/>So, for the first two-thirds of the movie I was quietly charmed by stark, photorealistic scenery and themes of loneliness, abandonment, contact, human profligacy, and corporate greed (Buy & Large being the corporate villain - clever name! By and Large, buy and enlarge, get it?) Pixar is our ""American anime"" with its meticulous rendition of mechanical and non-organic characters. However, in the third and final act, when WALL-ET follows his new friend EVE to the Axiom, that same ""American anime"" showcases the same weakness as its Japanese counterpart - goofy-looking, grotesque humanoids.<br/><br/>The Axiom resembles an ultra-modern space cruise ship that caters to everyone's need. However, the passengers have been at space so long (700 years) that they have regressed into flabby beanbags with appendages. They need hoverchairs to get around. WALL-ET encounters both mechanical and human obstacles on his way to meet EVE again, and the overall chase is fun. Yet, the problem I found with the movie at this point is that although nominally the hero, WALL-ET, for all his appeal and pluck, is eclipsed by EVE and the Axiom's captain, just as Bilbo Baggins was eclipsed by more colorful characters in ""The Hobbit"". The captain's struggles against his ship's computer AUTO, and his own physical inertia take precedence. Even when our little reluctant hero sacrifices himself to save the Axiom a la ET, he is still eclipsed. Of course, EVE saves him with the spare parts WALL-ET has amassed on Earth, and the captain manages to bring the passengers back to Earth for recolonization. Uplifting as this ending is, it seemed too pat and abrupt for me.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, ""WALL-ET"" is much more than a sensationalistic thrill ride and the adventures of the obligatory cute robot seeking companionship. It is also an ultimately somber and disconcerting testimony to conspicuous excess and wretched consumption, which it took a dedicated trash compactor to point out."

","The people at Pixar are geniuses, that is a fact considering the films there have made: the Toy Story series, Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc., The Incredibles, Ratatouille and Up. WALL-E can join them and is one of the best amongst that list of excellent films. Pixar have a real understanding of film, know that people crave a strong story and characters that we can love. They are skilled at making films for adults and children without the need to parody or reference films and pop-culture for adults.<br/><br/>Humanity has left Earth 700 years ago. The planet has become nothing but a wasteland after years of over-consummation and waste. Only one robot is left, WALL-E (Ben Burtt), who is cleaning up the mess in New York. After years alone he has developed a personality, he collects items of interest, his only friend is a cockroach and he continually watches the musical Hello Dolly. He longs to hold his hand with someone else. It is a sad existence. But one day another robot lands on Earth, EVE (Elissa Knight), a slick powerful robot on a mission to find plant life. After initial hostiles the two becomes and when EVE discovers that WALL-E has a plant the two are sent to the spaceship Axiom. Since humans have been in space for 700 years their bone have weaken and become morbidly obese, becoming more lazy and stupid. When the captain (Jeff Garlin) learns of this he gets excited about prospect that humans can return to Earth: but there is a conspiracy in the ship's programming to keep everyone in space. It's up to our heroes to ensure that humans return to where they rightfully belong.<br/><br/>The writer/director Andrew Stanton knew straight away that focus of the film had to be one the film had to be on the title character. WALL-E is just such a lovable character whom loneliness which drives his need for companionship. Along with EVE Stanton was able to establish a strong relationship between the two robots with very little dialogue and a lot of facial expressions. The nature of their relationship changes throughout the film and it is basically a wonderful love story with two great characters. Stanton also creates some wonderful character designs, with WALL-E being a crude robot, whilst EVE is a really futuristic robot, with a perfectly simple and elegant look. Stanton is also ambitious, showing Earth to be dark and dirty with the blocks of rubbish joining the New York skyline to the bright, artificial world of Axiom where it is a false paradise, seeing the negative affects on the people. Stanton did also use 2001: A Space Odyssey and Alien as an influence, because of the film's grand scale, broad, epic designs, music and the fact that the computer has alternative programming. But he keeps the film fresh. Stanton too is very cleaver with small subtle details, like all the rubbish on the floor telling how this situation came about.<br/><br/>There is a lot of humour, mostly involving slapstick, visual jokes and jokes relying on WALL-E misunderstandings. But this is not a comedy film, WALL-E is a drama and an adventure in a sci-fi context. You get to feel for the characters and at times it is a little sad. But overall it is a touching bit of entertainment for all the family.<br/><br/>WALL-E is the Pixar film that is most open to interruption. I'm not saying other Pixar film do not have deeper meanings, it's just that WALL-E has a lot in it. There is of course the theme of environmentalism and the problems that are caused by waste and the overfill of landfills. It's an important theme that I can easily agree with. There is also other themes: one major theme is humans' over reliant on machines and that they need to do more for themselves and the fact the people have become ignorant of the world around them and loosing basic general knowledge. It is pretty thoughtful for a family film."

","The ninth film from animation kingpins Pixar, Wall-E comes with a considerable reputation. Boasting awards aplenty and an almost entirely positive critical reception, it adds much to the already significant commendations received by the studio.<br/><br/>The film, a future parable, focuses on the eponymous robot and his single handed efforts to clean the world up after humanity has abandoned it, and their rubbish. We soon learn that mankind is orbiting in space, floating about in dozens of gigantic ships, awaiting the time when they may return to an again healthy world. We see the arrival of Eve, a scanner robot sent to Earth to detect signs of life. Wall-E, alone in the world with nothing but a cockroach and an old copy of ""Hello Dolly!"", sees in her a chance to know something other than loneliness.<br/><br/>Wall-E provides an emotional depth rarely achieved by live action films. The animation of the main character is astounding, the realisation of this originally perfunctory machine as a fully rounded personality a stunning achievement. Through the simplest of motions, we are from the start able to connect with the robot and understand the poignant loneliness of 700 years. It is difficult to believe just how involving, engrossing and spellbinding the character is, and all that without any form of dialogue. Amazing. Once the plot gets kicking, we are treated to humour aplenty, a perfectly entertaining story, and an appropriate underlying message. The laughs come in equal measure as the tears; Wall-E's clumsiness as effectively brilliant as his hopeless romanticism. The running motif of his desire to hold Eve's hand is wonderfully moving, as beautiful in its implementation as the emotional scope of his eyes.<br/><br/>Incredible animation, an emotional depth unparalleled by its rivals, a perfectly fine plot, and an important message. Wall-E is a great, great film."

Some of the junk he chooses to save, with the thought that it might someday be useful: A light bulb, hubcap, Rubik cube – they all becomes a part of his home, decorated with strings of bright holiday lights. At the end of a long and monotonous day, our hero replays a scene from the 1969 movie, ""Hello Dolly"", enthralled by Michael Crawford and Marianne McAndrew, holding hands and singing a tender love song. <br/><br/>One day Wall-E and his cockroach sidekick Hal, witness a spaceship depositing a sleek little hover craft, designed to collect data and soil samples from the surrounding environment.

Eva's life consists of living in a vast space center, where the human population is virtually waited on hand and foot. <br/><br/>My daughter's snoring interrupted my amazement at a new plot twist.

Because the earth is filled with a lot of garbage. There is a waste treatment robot ""WALL.E"" alone at the earth. He has worked for 700 years. The best of his hope is that he wants to hold hands with someone. One day, the shiny robot ""EVE"" appears in front of ""WALL.E"". He shows ""EVE"" many things of his treasures to appeal to her.

For example, it tells us to the importance that people talk with people by face-to-face and that people act by using their body without depending on using the machines. These are the good points for this movie. But, this movie tends to be thought kids' one. I really think this movie has many messages, but I feel kids' one too.

It's a good and bad thing for it.<br/><br/>That is to say, both of the children and the adults can enjoy watching this movie, for the children can enjoy watching at the character's acts, voice and cuteness, and for the adults can enjoy understanding the message which the movie wants to say.

There are three main reasons WALL-E's an amazing film. The first reason for this is the first half of the movie, the entire first half of the movie has almost no dialog, besides the occasional ""Wall-E"" and ""Eva."" I greatly respect this because it's hard to make a movie when you have only physical comedy to express how the character is feeling and thinking. This is the closest movie to a silent film that I've seen in a very long time, and for that the movie is great. The second reason this film is so great is the second half of the movie. It shows us where we might be headed if we keep consuming. This movie has effected me more than An Inconvenient Truth. The way it shows us the terrible future for our planet is genius but somewhat subtle. The third reason this movie is so great is the cute love and chemistry between WALL-E and EVE. This is the reason this is one of my favorite romance movies ever made."
"thesar-2","10","1","2","2 July 2009"," Wall-e vs Wal-Mart, guess who wins?
","Too bad, this ninth Pixar feature didn't jump on the 3-D bandwagon until the 10th: 'Up.' 'Wall-E' would've been even better in 3-D. Though, I can't see much to improve on. The story, the character development, the special-effects, the comedy and the message are all top-notch. In fact, this is just another work of art/cinema. As a science-fiction/space adventure, it actually leaves a lot of the live-action movies in the space dust. This one, despite the computer animation, is so incredibly realistic; I thought I was watching real-life scenes. And the best news yet: it's never about the F/X. It's about the story – the essence I always look for when deciding to buy a movie ticket. We live in an era that gives us 'Transformers' (or part 2) that gives us NO SOUL, or script, and we follow along like we're shopping at Wal-mart, sorry, I mean ""Buy'N'Large."" I can't rate a movie that doesn't excel on plot/story/originality. Wall-E does that. He's a compact little machine that's directive is to clean up the mess of a world we made 700 years from now. Until he meets a probe, Eve, that's sent to look for signs of life. Ironically, her mission, or being, in turn gives him life and on goes the adventure when he follows her into space to meet the human (and robot) survivors ready to return once Earth's inhabitable again. In a word, this movie's a masterpiece. Finally, a movie void of almost complete dialogue, you rely on body language and silent love. Rarely does a look show love in movies. In fact, for the most part, we're shoved love down our throats by words. Hardly is it shown with true love. Strangely, we have to turn to robots to open our eyes. Do not miss this movie."
"jpriest75","10","1","2","17 June 2009"," Greatest Pixar Film Since Toy Story
","-*- Spoiler Warning -*- Being an avid sci-fi geek, I can't help but be truly moved by this amazing film. WALL-E dabbles in so many different genres, like adventure, romance, drama and action, its hard to confine it to any one title but incredible.<br/><br/>On a lifeless Earth, some 700 years in the distant future, a small cleaning robot scours the barren, trash-strewn landscape. The robot, named WALL-E, spends his days compacting the garbage into space-efficient cubes. After a hard days work, WALL-E returns to his home inside an abandoned space freighter. One day, while out working, an enormous ship lands in an empty stretch of land and deposits a small, white robot probe on the ground before shooting back into space. The probes name is EVE. WALL-E befriends EVE, and the ensuing adventures they share alter both of their lives forever.<br/><br/>WALL-E is a purely visual film. Dialogue takes a back seat to animation here, so if you're a person who likes a movie with a lot of chatting, WALL-E is not your film. The character designs, for both WALL-E and EVE, are amazingly detailed and give them very humanistic quality.<br/><br/>The sound effects in this movie are unique and original to the point where I found myself smiling every time a character spoke. The beeps and buzzes of the work droids, the various alarms of the ship and rocket launch noises bring an uncanny realism to the movie.<br/><br/>The main theme of WALL-E is ultimately the most powerful aspect of the entire film. The evolution of machines to the higher emotional level and mankind's overthrow by means of laziness and avarice gives the story a chance to tell itself by letting the characters develop, instead of the movie simply being a series of event after boring event to drive the plot forward.<br/><br/>When I went to the theaters with my family, I had to choose between going with my father to see the Dark Knight, and my mother and sister to see WALL-E. Ultimately I saw The Dark Knight (which was very good), and since both my mother and my sister said WALL-E wasn't very good, I was relieved that I had missed it to see DK. When I finally rented WALL-E, I was blown away. Anyone who is a fan of animated movies, science fiction movies, or just plain good movies in general, I highly recommend you see this one. You'll never forget it.<br/><br/>My rating: 10/10"
"Islandeye","Null","1","2","19 July 2008"," Important, hilarious, moving: WALL-E
","For a Disney Pixar film what surprised me most about WALL-E is just how dark it is. Yes, there's the fast-paced motion-based comedy and quick visual jokes, but there's also a different kind of tone in regard to the human characters. There's none of the comfortable security present in so many children's films. In fact one could even argue if WALL-E is primarily a children's film, there's none of the colourful backdrop (at least in the earth segments) of Cars and Finding Nemo, no array of funny sub characters chipping in with quickwitted comments, and an image of the world that's shockingly grim and cynical. This is all very beneficial to WALL-E, its Pixar's most ambitious film to date; they have raised the bar yet again in what they will focus on and how they tell their stories, if anything it's more like an art film than a multiplex blockbuster. Yet it retains the core elements of all the best Pixar films, a daring world-of-it's-own universe, strikingly fluid and astounding animation and genuine emotional development and depth in its characters.<br/><br/>WALL-E himself is one of Pixar's most lovable, engaging and well-drawn (literally and in terms of personality) characters. His little mannerisms and mechanical features are so thoroughly articulated and designed, his clunky tyre tracks and jittery head giving him all the dimensions and expressions of a person. The only human facial feature that WALL-E retains are his prominent eyes- no mouth to smile or frown with, and he still manages to be as emotive as any of Pixar's weird spins on real-world objects or creatures. Ben Burtt, the man responsible for recording and orchestrating the sounds of WALL-E and other robots deserves credit for the life he has breathed into these characters just through sound. WALL-E's curious whirring noises and beeping squawks work with the exceptionally thought-out visual design to really give the little robot presence and a heartfelt endearing quality.<br/><br/>WALL-E is the one and only individual left in a world full of robots controlling humans and turning them into lazier, fleshy robots. The society of the future is basically nonexistent, there's no socialising to speak of. Screens are projected in front of everyone's faces 24/7, they play virtual golf and in classic sci-fi fashion, eat entire meals in liquid form. It's a very dark image, and while done to poke fun at the stupidity of the humans, it's slightly depressing. Advertising screens are never out of frame when we board the new home for earthlings, the space ship Axiom. There's a gloomy paradox in WALL-E present in many Sci-Fi films, that once humans have reached and explored the depths of the universe, they're unfazed and even ignorant of the limitless freedom of it all. There's a lovely montage of WALL-E marvelling at galaxies and stars, reaching out and being in awe of it all  on the space ship, the humans simply sit in their hover-chairs and have even begun to forget where they are.<br/><br/>With all these political views underpinning the entire film, at heart WALL-E is a classic love story. The opening section of WALL-E shows us just how alone the little robot is  the impressive photo-realistic animation of earth, with the towering structures of garbage and dusty wastelands surrounding the city give the film a very dystopian and gloomy atmosphere. The quick zooms and pans, wide tracking shots of WALL-E bobbing along doing his daily chore, and the detailed tour of his job and trinket-filled home paint a picture of a very isolated little robot, who over 700 years has evolved within himself and extracted all of the best human qualities through our devices, games and even movies. We see WALL-E watching the 1969 musical Hello, Dolly!, focusing on a song involving two partners holding hands, an important gesture that WALL-E in his advanced state instantly recognises as a sign of love. When EVE, a robot sent to look for vegetation, shows up its delightful and exciting to watch WALL-E do his best to keep up (literally) and connect with EVE. The way their relationship evolves is excellently handled and very involving, they barely speak a word to each other yet the relationship is crafted in a believable, gradual way as they learn how they learn to relate to each other.<br/><br/>WALL-E is so successful because of how challenging it is with its dialogue-less opening segment and its political message, simultaneously combined with a beautiful love story and typically imaginative Pixar twist on the world. I've noticed that in all of Pixar films there are several clearly defined processes at work  In Toy Story, the rigorous regime of surveying Andy's birthday presents, in Monsters Inc, the structure and organisation of the monsters' work  In WALL-E, what makes it so unique in Pixar's canon is that it its processes directly relate to our own. While put to the extreme, the vision of the future, with its blatant commercialist control exerted so subtly so the humans don't even know its happening  Is tragically all too reminiscent of the corporations of today. The environmental message is just as relevant and important. Hopefully, as the message is so well handled and masterfully blended with a terrific story it will manage to influence the people of today  and tomorrow, and of many generations to come."

","Simply amazing.<br/><br/>Best animation film out there since Finding Nemo, and yet it surpasses it in many ways, making this film extraordinar-E. The plot is fairly simplistic, but the execution is great.<br/><br/>The last robot on Earth wasn't turned off, and what happens after 700 years? He becomes lonely. The story goes beyond what the movie industry calls making us feel sad for the protagonist, because it does more than that; it makes us feel the sadness he's suffering.<br/><br/>This film really should deserve multiple Oscars, and ultimately surpasses Ratatouille. Albeit the fact that it's rated PG, it should be PG-13, due to the theme being apocalyptic and about human obesity.<br/><br/>Recommended for everyone who wants to go out and see an Oscar worthy film.

","Pixar just can't miss. Even their worst movies are better than average compared to a lot of the slop that's put on the screen year after year, but Wall-E is really quite superb, even for Pixar.<br/><br/>It centers upon Wall-E, which is basically a moving garbage compactor left to clean up Earth after all the humans have left it a dusty, discarded mess for some 700 years.<br/><br/>The real beauty of the movie is in its elegant use of simplicity. The protagonists barely speak half a dozen words, using them over and over and over in believable ways which betray personality. Juxtaposed against these wonderfully human robots, the real humans of the movie can be taken as a stark warning of a possible future in which consumerism has destroyed the Earth and our entire species is left to wallow in paradise.<br/><br/>The message is a rather frank one, and I'm sure some will grumble about it, but I think they see the coal and not the diamond inside. Wall-E and EVE have become two of my favorite Pixar characters, bar-none. The movie has comedic moments, sappy moments, and simply stunning/beautiful moments. It's a well-done symphony set to screen, and if you are, or ever have been, a fan of Pixar's films, go see it.<br/><br/>You certainly won't be disappointed."

","I recently saw this film, and having heard all the mixed feelings about this movie, I went into the movie theater with my mind wide open; well, what can I say? I left the movie theater with a mind full of thoughts and reflections on our society. Wall-e, the newest film from Pixar, not only entertains you with its comical, robotic- romance theme and its very interesting general premise, but it challenges you to think in unexpected ways (i.e, these thoughts have been triggered by an ANIMATED movie, very few animated movies can do this) It is a well-crafted warning for us about the dangers of media, pollution, global warning, etc...<br/><br/>The only draw-back-- the ads. and trailers for this film make it seem a lot more entertaining for kids so don't be surprised if your kids get bored (especially towards the beginning of the film) Two thumbs up!"
"jdkraus","10","1","2","5 July 2008"," The first film that I've given a 10 for 2008
","There are many reasons why I like this movie. For starters, the animation is absolutely amazing. ""Toy Story"" may have begun the 3-d animation genre, ""Finding Nemo"" may have added more details in the scenery, and ""The Incredibles"" may have introduced the retro looking characters. But ""Walle"" brings a whole new look at animation. It took only the opening sequence shots of space and the acceleration towards a dusty, abandoned, futuristic, and trashed earth to make me say ""Wow"" on how good its animation quality is. <br/><br/>The second thing I like about this movie is the characters. Walle, a lonely and curious robot does not say much, but he easily makes a lovable character. His friend and later sidekick Eva is likewise a fun character. It amazes me that it doesn't take a lot of dialog to make enjoyable characters. What was so interesting about these two machines is the friendship and the length they are willing to go to save one another as well as the humans from a total apathetic state. <br/><br/>This then leads to the third reason why I like this film, the plot. It may sound too corny or even far from the truth that 800 years from now, we would be living space. However, much of what the social situation that the humans live in is very close to home, for instance: <br/><br/>1.) The earth being a total waste by the lack of care for the environment, by pollution and improper waste disposals. <br/><br/>2.) The humans overweight (with fast food styled meals), busy talking to one another on their screens, and floating in portable chairs. <br/><br/>3.) The heavy reliance on technology and computers rather than doing it ourselves.<br/><br/>Does any of this ring a bell? It sounds like us doesn't? Who knows what can happen in 800 or even 10 years. <br/><br/>The film is great entertainment with also a grand message. No doubt that ""Walle"" will win the Best Animated Film Award for next year's Oscars. It could also very well be nominated or even win for Ben Burtt's wonderful sound and sound effects editing used for all the machines and other characters. I also hope that Thomas Newman gets a win for his wonderful score that sets the emotions in such an excellent movie. 10/10"
"ZookGuy","10","1","2","5 July 2008"," Not In the Top 25 But Still Great
","Does Wall-E, the newest film in the Disney/Pixar cannon, a bit preachy at parts? Yes. Did some of the themes become to much in one scene? Yes. Do some characters get extremely annoying? Yes. Will it probably be the greatest film this year? Heck yes. Considering the rental-and-nothing-else value of Hancock and Get Smart.<br/><br/>I walked into the theater thinking that it wouldn't be thought-provoking, I just expected a cute 110-minute film. But I did become thought-provoked. Especially when there portraying humanity in 800 years as obese, mind-numbed, and idiotic and relying on machines to do all the labor is pretty interesting, considering that most of us can't find our own home without a GPS. Also with a corporation (Big'N'Large or simply BNL) taking over government and consumerism (think Wal-Mart taking over the world) is just another factor showing humanity's empty-headed materialism.I also think Wall-E was Disney's best character since Woody in Toy Story a truly memorable sci-fi epic."

","It is extremely bold, joining what is essentially a silent movie and characters that are extremely simple yet so emotional and empathic (a box and an egg). Despite the director claiming no 'political intention', it is an extremely accurate vision of what is happening to society and humanity as a whole - we are always talking but when do we really see things? Do we truly connect with people? Do we love, cry, grow and die? It shows something that has been said in many good movies, from Princess Bride to Secondhand Lions - True love conquers all, it doesn't matter if you are a peasant or a robot. Through work and hardship it is possible to live a more fulfilling and happy life. That life is harsh and many times unfair, that many beautiful things will perish due to greed and ignorance and that we all must fight for what is good. Technically speaking, it is flawless, the art direction is great and the photography and character design is amazing - animation is downright incredible. Also, the reference to the various art periods at the end was very memorable, it was an incredible way to end the movie, showing beauty and life evolve, change, diverse, until it reaches what it currently is and then makes all that is current a part of whatever evolution is going on. I didn't cry, but damn, I got goosebumps more than once (and I almost cried). Best movie I have seen in a long, long time."

As a graphic designer, I extend Kudos to the hundreds of gifted people involved in creating this film. I attended the film with three other people. Whatever our affiliations, we feel the film is more politically correct than we care for. The premise that America will be solely responsible for future destruction of planet earth is irresponsible. All of us on this planet shoulder responsibility for the present and future. Hopefully, in our personal families, a member's problems or difficulties are handled with love - tough or otherwise - and not by casting them to the masses and before the world. In WALL.e, Disney/PIXAR has cast America, our 'greater family,' to the masses and before the world.<br/><br/>The characters, Eve and WALL.e, are appealing and their love story is touching. The message that the creators of the film wished to convey is important. The future is important. What we do today is relevant to future events for us all.

"rlevi14","1","6","33","24 November 2011"," Time called this the best movie of the last decade?
","An Inconvenient Truth is more entertaining than this (I'm not joking). Wall-e was just boring, probably the most boring movie I've seen. I thought 2001: A Space Odyssey was pretty boring too but I do understand its significance. It changed an entire genre. Wall-e seems to be aspiring to the same heights that Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke did when they were working on 2001 but it falls short. I'm not saying that 2001 created a barrier that can't be passed. It's not even my favorite movie or anything. Few films have changed a genre the way 2001 did, but many sci-fi movies have been made that presented new ideas in an entertaining way, like Blade Runner, Brazil, Alien, and, of course, Star Wars. You might think its unfair to compare an animated movie to films like these but if the makers of Wall-e had such grand pretensions (and it certainly seemed that way when I watched it) then I say it is fair.<br/><br/>Another thing was the humor. It just wasn't very funny. Every Pixar movie is funny, in my opinion, except for Wall-e.<br/><br/>Wall-e might have received a lot of praise but just remember that it has the fifth-lowest worldwide gross for a Pixar movie (with inflation unadjusted). And considering the fact that the first two Toy Story movies came out long before it did, they probably sold more tickets. A lot of people must have just decided that it looked too pretentious.<br/><br/>The animation was excellent, though. But an animated movie needs more than great animation to be worth watching, like a live-action movie needs more than great art direction and cinematography."

"jimmy2","7","2","7","8 March 2009"," Good, but over-hyped
","If I had the opportunity to, I would have voted this 7.5 out of ten. I don't think this movie deserves an eight, though.<br/><br/>The animation on the Blu-ray is simply stunning to say the least. There were times that I could hardly believe I was watching an animated film. As such, I highly recommend anyone who has a Blu-ray player to use this as a demo disk. This alone highlights the merits of the format.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the plot isn't as great as the animation.<br/><br/>Andrew Stanton took considerable risk when devising the plot; of that I have no doubt. Boy, wouldn't I want to be the fly on the wall in the Disney corporate office when Andrew was proposing this story to the big wigs. Seeing how much pull Andrew has within Disney itself, it's not too surprising that they gave the green light for this film.<br/><br/>The movie starts out well enough. There's just enough going on in Wall-E's hum-drum existence that entertains us for the first twenty minutes. However, I believe the worst part of the movie was the middle portion.<br/><br/>I'm sorry, but I as an audience member can't get worked up over some plant. Yes, I understand the significance of it, and how it can wake up mankind from the restful slumber of laziness and complacency, but it still doesn't grab me in the plot department. I found the whole human race subplot rather forgettable in general.<br/><br/>No, the plot highlights were the robot interactions with each other. Those were the highlights of the film, but one could get the feeling that you could get just as much enjoyment out of that as watching a short film about them. Speaking of which, the BURN-E short almost outclasses the main film in this regard.<br/><br/>So, the bottom line is I don't believe that it deserves credit for the best feature film of 2008, as there are much better-plotted films that were released that year. However, as good as the animation is, I'll reserve judgment until I've seen Kung-Fu Panda, which apparently has animation at least as good as WALL-E, according to what I've read and heard."

","Perhaps I expected too much on this film because people's voting in this website are terrific and many wrote that this is ""the best animated film ever"".<br/><br/>From the time of E.T., I have been wondering why American want robots or things like that to be human-like. I don't want to see pandas chew gums like Yanks or robots look down when they feel sad. Is that ""reality"" for American? Pandas are real when they do things we cannot guess and so do robots. There is no mysticism here and that is so unreal to me. When fantasy is drawn unreal, there is no chance for that movie to knock on my emotion.<br/><br/>I am not an enthusiastic patriot, but to talk about animated films, why don't you just watch Miyazaki's films? Those are the ones filled with fantasy or imagination I am talking about. You may say children cannot appreciate the characters when they do not move the way we are familiar with, but let's just believe in children's open-minded nature. I have just witnessed children laughing and got excited watching Miyazaki's strange new film ""Ponyo on the cliff by the sea"". In my humble opinion American only try to listen to the sound of two-hands-clapping not the sound of one-hand-clapping. Imagination, man. What if god does not speak English or not even human-like?

"BabyCheddarGoldfish","8","2","7","30 June 2008"," A Cinematic Axiom
","Rather than focusing on the basics of the plot (there are many resources for the curious), I'll focus strictly on my impressions. While the good far outweighs the bad, I mostly list the latter.<br/><br/>This movie has tons of good  the plot (in the most general sense, more on this later), the characters, the animation, and the sparse presence of dialogue. What this movie does so well is tell a story visually. Of course, it complements the visual candy with sound but at its core, the images are so fundamental, so visceral, that they transcend language. The robots in many ways are more human than any human in the film.<br/><br/>Before I get to my main complaint, there is one other thing that really bugged me  the use of live action. Pixar claims (at the end of their movies) that everything is hand-animated. In Wall-E there is, quite obviously, no such line  and it's for the worse. The use of live action is incredibly out of place  it doesn't enhance the continuity of the film. If anything, it is a non sequitur. It is never explained; frankly, I doubt if they could explain it very well if they tried.<br/><br/>My main gripe however is that the film falls prey to an axiom  not the one in space, but the one in the plot. The significant flaw of the film is the premise  the overall idea that humans may destroy earth works, but the one that a corporation gets enough power to destroy the earth does not. The following critique is economic, so if you don't enjoy Economics, skip. First, how did this corporation get so powerful? Government-enforced monopolies could make this plausible, but that in itself leaves a lot to be desired. Furthermore, if it was through the market that BNL got its power, the premise is nothing but ridiculous. After all, why would a greedy company that cares only about making more money let the earth become overrun with pollution? They would be able to make a fortune in providing clean, livable areas; definitely at a lower cost than providing the same on a hyper drive-equipped spaceship. Furthermore, on Axiom, why are there advertisements for people who are supposedly engrossed so much in their portable televisions that they don't notice the rest of the ship? At certain times in the movie, they do look up, yet can't even realize that they have a pool.<br/><br/>The worst part is that, while I am willing to excuse all of the above, they felt the need to have the ""stay the course"" line. Regardless of position (I am an environmentalist), I do not go to movies to be told what I should think. I want to see a good plot and a good movie. If politics I don't agree with make sense in the logic and context of the movie, I don't mind. But if, as in the case of Wall-E, those politics detract from the story and oversimplify the problem they address, I take issue with them.<br/><br/>The irony of all this is that on the one hand, Pixar lambasts people for being gelatinous vegetables that do nothing outside of cinematic entertainment. Yet they use the very medium they attack to make that point. Should we take their point seriously when this is the case? That being said, even for the aforementioned extremely annoying flaws, the movie is brilliant. It is a pleasure to watch as all Pixar movies are.<br/><br/>8.5/10"

","On the surface, a precious movie about an antiquated robot survivor (WALL-E)who is contented but lonely as the only ""living"" thing left surviving on an earth that's turned into a trash heap, other than a cockroach pal who follows him around but has little interaction. No talking, just a cute guy who likes to replay an old ""Hello Dolly"" tape and do the music as he works away at his prime directive of functioning as a sophisticated trash compactor.<br/><br/>Arrive a spaceship, which deposits a very sophisticated robot, shaped like a white egg with detached head and arms and huge blue sensor-eyes. WALL-E's in love! Okay - that's all precious and off they go to space and have adventures and it is wonderful. The other reviews will describe all of this. Oh and the movie is preceded by what I take as a cartoon - something I sorely miss. And the cartoon is marvelous. A magician and his very clever and hungry rabbit. You'll love it.<br/><br/>But back to WALL-E. And the true story, which is the understory.<br/><br/>It is depressingly visionary, not unlike 1984. Human's consumerism has destroyed the earth, which is a vast, lifeless wasteland, populated by huge heaps of garbage. Where are the people? They've taken off 700 years before in a gigantic spaceship, leaving the robots (all of which have ceased to function but WALL-E) to clean up their mess. Billboard style signs litter the trash dumps, entreating people to buy, buy, buy.<br/><br/>It appears that all the big-box stores are finally owned by one company and they wanted all, got all, but had no place to put the refuse and the refuse gobbled up the planet's resources, along with the consumerism demands. Very dishearteningly believable. No birds, no animals, no people, no life on our precious planet.<br/><br/>Jump to the big space ship in the sky. Humans now, due to lack of real gravity (ha ha ha), spend their time drinking computer-generated concoctions and everyone is a fat blimp, unable to walk and supported/living in floating air-cushioned chair-beds with computer screens in front of their faces that also seem to serve as cell phones. They are all numb, dumb and it is eerie in the similarity of going to a big mall and listening to loads of fat people talking on cells phones while they eat fast food.<br/><br/>The computers have really taken over, nothing new or original in that. And the story really goes nowhere that isn't predictable. It is the subtext that punches the gut in its predictive doomsday which dovetails today's reality that multi-nationals now rule the world instead of countries, that we are held in the clutches of our own consumerism/addiction to having and eating more and using all the planets resources to accomplish it and yet numb and oblivious to the inevitable outcome.<br/><br/>Very brave of Pixar to do this. It's sort of an Al Gore comedy/tragedy that's wonderful done."

At one point I wondered if this film was even worth watching, after a small while however the plot picked up slightly, with the introduction of a new character who could potentially bring some sort of goal into the film. During the next fifteen minutes, I did think the film picked up somewhat, then it launched back off into some roller-coaster ride of confusing ideas and twists and new, often worthless pieces of information to digest into your already muddled mind.<br/><br/>Maybe this film wasn't for me, perhaps it is more of a younger persons film who would gain enough joy in the mere animation and comical voice of Wall-E.

","Okay, starting with the fact that I'm usually obsessed with all Disney-Pixar collaborations (except for Cars, didn't like that one), this was not something for me to be obsessed about. I liked it, don't get me wrong. I loved, loved the relationship between Wall-E & EVE- it was just tooooo adorable. And I loved the fact that wherever EVE went or was taken off to, Wall-E was sure to follow, no matter what predicament he was in. And of course, Pixar does an amazing job w/ animation. Whoopty-doo: this was something we all knew was gonna be great.<br/><br/>***Spoilers***<br/><br/>Herein lies my problem- the story line. Now, apparently somewhere in he early 2000's, humans let the Earth go completely to waste. Literally, the entire Earth is covered in trash, with no sign of natural life anywhere. The movie starts with all these logos (Buy N' Large only) everywhere. As a solution to the Earth's ""problem,"" the President of BNL, also the president of the world, sends humans to a floating Space Station. We're now warped to an environment where humans don't walk anymore, they're waited on hand and foot, and I'm pretty sure they were being brainwashed. We'd become completely dependent on the use of robots and A.I. <br/><br/>This bothers me for the simple fact that I had the feeling throughout the movie, Pixar was practically accusing us of letting things get that far. I got the feeling that right above the screen, there was an invisible ""pointing & wagging finger,"" like a parent lecturing us. Slowing global warming and taking care of our mother Earth is important. We only get one Earth. We're doing a heck of a job so far. I just felt like the movie was trying scare us straight. Sometimes that works, at other times it fails. I liked Disney films cause they had a great message and alotta funny bits, and they're light-hearted. I thought this was a lil too heavy. <br/><br/>I also loved how as soon as the humans figured out what was going on, they realized what they had to do. They didn't care about the risk, they didn't care how long it took, or how much work that laid ahead of them- they did it. I really enjoyed that idea of brotherhood amongst us. I also liked when the humans didn't reject Wall-E and the other robots at the end. They didn't try to blame the robots. They didn't fear them. They let them help rebuild the entire Earth from square one.<br/><br/>As far as the story about Earth & humans go, I give that about 4/10.

I'm just flat out puzzled as to how anyone over the age of 10 found this entertaining and how it's rating is so high! So I think that Pixar didn't do its usual magic with this one and I give it three stars only because it did have some originality to it!"

","After so many of my friends have watched the movie and seemed to take a liking to it I thought I should give it a try. Much to my dismay as it turned out. <br/><br/>The movie was quite silly to be frank: it plays in the distant future where apparently all humans are extremely dumb (borderline retarded as it seems) and morbidly obese due to their sedentary lifestyle and dietary choices. The main protagonists are two robots: Wall-E (who acts like an annoying prepubescent child throughout the entire movie) and EVE (who is an extremely advanced robot that shouldn't even exist in the first place since the intellect of the depicted humans isn't sufficient enough to conceive such technology). <br/><br/>Just because the robots are cute that doesn't make the movie great. I can see how AUTO is an homage to HAL 9000 but that's about the only positive thing about the movie. In my humble opinion this is probably one of the worst Pixar movies I've seen so far. The story was simply not compelling enough."

","The movie ""Wall-E"" from Disney was created in 2008.Andrew Stanton made the regie. The movie genre is animation and a movie for children. Wall-E and Eve are the main characters. The robot Wall-E has to clean up the earth. He meets a robot woman with the name Eve. The movie has a very serious plot, because the dirty environment is a very important theme. I think the director didn't do a good job, because the movie is very boring. The movie would be better, if the robots could speak. The music is very bad. I think the special effects and the animations are nice, because it is good for children to watch. All in all I advice against watching the movie, because it is very boring to watch. I got sleepy when I watched the movie."

","Wall-E is a good movie and is a return to form for Pixar after 2 very lackluster films (cars and the Rat movie sucked). Wall-E has many themes; it's more than a sci-fi film. It's about Love & companionship, blind vacuous consumerism, & how humans use technology to the detriment of the race not to the enhancement. So machines end up in control & have more of a personality than humans do. It actually gets quite preachy. I don't have an issue with a message movie, unless the movie maker (Disney/Pixar) is more guilty of the offense than the people watching. How many toys, DVD's, and cups will Disney sell with this movie's name attached to it? I don't like hypocrites. Of course the movie does eventually find a compromised middle road and redemption. Beyond that obvious hypocrisy the movie looks great and is very funny. The adults in the theater seemed to enjoy the movie as much as the kids. So it's a solid time at the movies."

This happens from time to time and then I start second guessing myself. But you know, one doesn't have to like what everyone else does, and in that respect, there's a fair amount of negative reviews for this picture as well.

But then I suppose, in this instance, practically everyone was a robot!

"rachelxrodriguez","10","1","3","29 November 2011"," The movie begins in the year 2700, and the earth has been considered
","Wall-E (2008) Film Review Directed by: Andrew Stanton<br/><br/>Wall-E is a film for the ages. It was made to enrich the minds of its viewers, all while allowing us to enjoy the adorable tale of two robots that save the world. With a few underlying, environmentally friendly messages, this movie tells the story of two robots from two entirely different worlds, falling in love and finding a new haven in our old home.<br/><br/>The movie begins in the year 2700, and the earth has been considered uninhabitable. Wall-E is a robot sent in order to take the trash off of the earth, and collects little knick-knacks while doing so. While collecting, however, he stumbles upon a knick-knack that's worth saving. It isn't until Wall-E meets the highly advanced robot EVE when he realizes the importance of his discovery. She runs back to the humans in order to let them know of Wall-E's finding, and that there is still hope for their home planet. After centuries alone, Wall-E couldn't stand the thought of losing his new and only friend, so he follows her deep into space, onto a spacecraft that the humans are forced to call home. On this grand adventure, Wall-E , who has always known what he was made for, gradually begins to understand what he was meant for.<br/><br/>First and foremost, what is the ambition of this film? What is it trying to explain to its viewers? Well, that answer is quite evident. EVE enters the movie as a character in hopes of finding a way for humanity to survive as it did before. She personifies every man and woman out there hoping to restore this planet to its natural beauty, and give humans the chance to bask in its glory for many, many centuries. Wall-E represents the curious aspect of human nature, and the adventurous side of us that has yet to discover or release itself, until it finds a force to push it (in this case, love). Together, these characters explain the entire objective of this film. As humans still roaming this earth, we're losing the grasp we had on nature, we're deteriorating and forgetting how important our earth really is. We have to remember why we're here, we have to open up to curiosity and actually enjoy the adventure of saving our home.<br/><br/>It's easy to say that the film has succeeded in getting its messages across. It uses its characters in a very clever fashion in order to create and depict certain concepts or ideas. For example, as inhabitants of this planet, it is up to us humans to really keep the earth alive. However, as technology advances and helps us live our lives with the very little need to be active or intelligent, we begin to care less about everything else around us. This concept is portrayed in the film by the actual humans within its diegesis. They have forgotten the concept of time, they spend their days eating and watching a floating screen in front of their faces. They live on the chair which they sit on, and have everything else done for them. They even learned to depend on robots to save THEIR home. However, these robots become a representation of our essential nature. <br/><br/>The collision of two opposing forces created yet another sweet love story. Wall-E was the nervous, shy robot while EVE was the stern, intelligent, and stoic character in this film. They help create a concept of love between two entirely different beings. It tells the viewers how easily we can find companionship in someone who can be our total opposites. It demonstrates the unpredictable beauty of love, and how blind it is to one's social class, one's appearance, and anything that is not a part of one's soul. <br/><br/>The relationship between Wall-E and EVE also depicts how a simple, innocent bond can be enough to open one's heart to any adventure. It can be enough to help us lose whatever fear we've held in our hearts, and actually go after whatever it is we find important. It shows us that one single person can be enough to make us fight for what we believe in, as well as what they believe in. Such as Wall-E and the plant. Wall-E had no idea why EVE needed the plant, or how it could possibly interest her. Nevertheless, Wall-E fought off the superior humans (owners of the spacecraft) and risked his life for that plant, only because he knew it meant something to EVE, who meant absolutely everything to him.<br/><br/>This movie may seem like a silly, G rated Pixar film. Just another movie aimed at children, about two adorable creatures on some journey. However, there is more that meets the eye. This film hopes to bring to our attention the fact that our planet is slowly wasting away due to our oblivious attitudes. It shows us how the advancement of technology may actually hinder the advancement of the human race. Wall-E bring us to tears with a love story strong enough to reach the stars and back. Strong enough to face any fears and risk the lives of our two main characters. This movie is yet another Disney classic, a funny tale, and definitely a tear jerker. All of these elements combine to create a memorable and amazing film."

","Pixar surprised me with this one.<br/><br/>I was expecting another dud. However Wall-E the garbage collector is a nice character that you like. The opening was perfect. And the first thirty or forty minutes was really awesome. The story with the little green plant was interesting and it kept me keen to see what was next. WHen the second robot arrives, I thought okay, this could be good. And it was good. When they transported back to the space station, I thought it would stay just as good. The second part was all right but more over-the-top with the animation, it almost made my head spin so much was going on. This was all the more clear when you compare to the very simple first part. However all in all, this is a good film worth checking out."

Meant to get clean up all the garbage we left behind as we fled to space. One day he meets EVE, a robot who was sent to Earth to find signs of plant life. She does, goes back to the spaceship, and Wall-e hitches a ride.<br/><br/>I really loved this movie. I can't believe that two robots could have such chemistry. The animation is absolutely beautiful, easily some of the best I've ever seen. This may sound stupid, but was some of that stuff real? It also has a good message to stop being so lazy, or else you'll just get fat. Although it may hit you a little too hard over the head with it.

","I have a serious problem with this film. I have alienated my mother-in- law and many friends because of this movie. It's not like it was with Garden State – I'd instantly have no respect for someone who loooooved that film and it chaaaaaange their liiiiiiiife. Understandable, I think. This movie I loved. To put things into perspective, I have a pretty strong ""never watch twice"" policy for movies – there's just too many of them to see to waste time and there are few that I enjoy so much, I'll watch twice. I have watched WALL-E probably 12-15 times. I own the DVD (one of about 10 I own, including the entire Futurama set). I have a copy of the Blu-ray at work hidden from my wife who told me not to buy it. I have a Blu-ray player at work, so I can ""test"" HD systems. and watch WALL-E. LOVE. THIS. MOVIE.<br/><br/>Here's where the problem begins. I loan out one of my other copies of the movie to someone who has not seen the film. On a rare occasion someone comes back with the movie and says the loved it. We are now best friends and they are allowed to use my car and eat my food. Many people come back and say ""Aw, that was a cute movie!"" I ask them if they think it should have gotten at least a a Best Picture nod, and while I really loved Slumdog Millionaire, didn't they think that an animation could easily stand up to those films, especially The Reader – ha! Who cares about stupid Kate Stupid Winslet and her nazi reading bullcrap. So they stare at me. There are a very few that come back and say, without fail, these words: ""It was boring.""<br/><br/>BORING? Like a sunrise over a tropical island boring? Are you colorblind? Were you born at the age of 60, demanding fiber and hating everything good in this world?<br/><br/>Andrew Stanton has created some of the most memorable films in the past 15 years: Toy Story, Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo, and the list goes on. Why would a man capable of such amazing stories that entertain young and old create something ""boring."" Maybe he believes the art of animation isn't just for kiddie cartoons, and that it can express beauty, humanity, and world-themes through unconventional means. Maybe he thinks that creative sound design can tell a story that no human voice could have expressed. Who knows, but I do know that WALL-E was an incredible moment for me when I saw what a team of dedicated, creative people could do with a bunch of computers, software, and passion for their art.<br/><br/>I don't really think I need to review the content of WALL-E. We know it's about a little robot who is plucky and courageous, risks his life for true love, and in the end gets the girl. We know it has some incredible scenery that are hard to believe are computer generated. We know that the wacky side-kick is expressed through a cockroach in a way that makes us uncomfortable, but impressed that it could be done. We know that the sounds that came from Ben Burtt's imagination were so realistic and deeply human, that it made us forget we were watching a couple of robots in a trash-filled wasteland.<br/><br/>I know some people will find The Triplets of Belleville a bit grotesque and strange. I know not everybody appreciates Charlie Chaplin as Hitler in a comedy. But to watch this movie and then dismissively call it ""boring"" without at least recognizing the significance of the film and the technological achievement that it represents, even while missing the story altogether well, I pity you. And hate you."

","1st watched 10/10/2009 – 8 out of 10 (Dir-Andrew Stanton): Excellent animation movie with a message. The story revolves around a world left in ruins to be cleaned up by robots(aka. Wall-E's) while the humans find refuge in an outerspace station where they are pampered and grow fat. Wall-E is getting a little bored of his routine where he day-in and day-out turns refuge into blocks and disposes of it. He gathers relics(similar to Ariel in ""Little Mermaid"") to make his time more interesting and has a friend in a roach with antenna's. Then arrives another robot searching for plantlife for the humans named Eve. Wall-E becomes infatuated with her but her prime directive is notifying the humans when she finds a plant and then staying in the spot until they return to pick her up. The idea here is when she finds it, they can come back to Earth to re-colonize. There is very little dialogue in this movie yet we understand the emotions of the characters, which shows us how amazing the animation is by the Pixar people here. There is a lot of slapstick similar to old Warner Brothers cartoons giving us plenty of laughs with a plus being a message about us taking care of our motherland, the Earth. This is a real step up for a cartoon studio and it's all done really well. It's amazing how such a small idea was expanded out to make this very well done movie. Another triumph for Pixar as they pick up from Disney's ways to rule the animation world in the movies of this current time."
"hall895","8","1","3","30 July 2009"," An absolute treat
","Drama, comedy, romance, science fiction...this movie crosses genre boundaries, it has a little bit of everything. The visuals are stunning. The sounds, both the effects and the music, are done brilliantly. Really there's not much to quibble with here. The movie looks great, it sounds great and the story is incredibly charming and compelling. It's certainly one of the great triumphs in the annals of animation. But it shines not just in comparison with other animated features. It is so well done that it can rightly take its place in the category of classic films, right alongside all those live-action films we have come to know and love. WALL-E is not just a great animated film. It's a great film, period.<br/><br/>Our story takes place long into the future on an Earth long since abandoned by humankind. The planet is covered in trash, to the point life on Earth is unsustainable. When the humans took off for outer space they left behind an army of trash compacting robots named WALL-E to clean up the mess. The idea was that after a five year space cruise everyone would be able to come back home. But there was just too much trash and as the film opens it has been 700 years since humans walked the Earth. And just one lonely WALL-E unit still functions. But as this unit goes about its futile cleanup task we will see that this WALL-E is no ordinary robot. It's developed a personality and the ability to feel emotion. It has even come to understand the concept of falling in love. Of course there's nothing on this deserted planet for our robot hero to fall in love with. But then EVE shows up.<br/><br/>One day WALL-E's peaceful existence is shattered when a spaceship lands and from the ship emerges a sleek feminine robot. This is EVE and she has a mission which we will come to understand holds great importance for the future of humankind. WALL-E immediately falls hopelessly in love. Initially rather hostile, and concerned only with her mission, EVE will come to take a liking to WALL-E. But before romance can truly bloom EVE's ship returns to collect her. WALL-E will find himself along for the ride on a thrilling journey through space, the ultimate destination being the the Axiom, one of the starliners on which humankind has been living all these centuries.<br/><br/>Aboard the Axiom we see what has become of humankind and it's not a pretty picture. Everyone is obese to the point of being unable to walk and completely dependent on the Axiom's fleet of robots for pretty much everything. But if EVE, with WALL-E's help, can complete her mission perhaps things will change. Great drama unfolds aboard the Axiom and WALL-E is right in the middle of it. This robot we have come to love will find himself in some rather perilous situations. There are some moments of great tension, some serious tugging on the viewer's heartstrings, as the film builds towards its conclusion.<br/><br/>All in all it's a simply terrific film. The nature of the plot dictates that things start out a little slowly but the story is always intriguing. And as things play out the story will prove to be rather thrilling and more than a bit inspiring. It is a brilliantly conceived story, told for most of its running time with basically no dialogue whatsoever. Jeff Garlin, as the Axiom's captain, has the one speaking part of any real significance and he does very well with it. But this story is really told through its beautiful visuals and through the wonderfully simple sounds of our robot hero. Full credit to sound designer Ben Burtt who magically brings WALL-E to life. It may not be a perfect movie, it has a few lulls now and again. But the ultimate effect is wonderful. For all the beautiful animation and wondrous sounds what really makes the film work is its story. It's a story, and a lead character, which you can't help but embrace. Brilliantly done."
"ryanaustinf","9","1","3","9 June 2009"," Cute. Just too CUTE!
","This is my second Pixar review and I'll be reviewing an earlier project of theirs. Older by merely a year, WALLE is another one of Pixar's masterpieces. But let me make clear that all of this is opinion and zero fact and the only fact is an event in the movie or otherwise. -----------------SPOILER LINE------------------<br/><br/>The main characters in this film is of course WALLE (Ben Burtt) and EVE (Elissa Knight). These characters are charming and WALLE is very cute, maybe it has something to do with his eyes. Those eyes stare into your soul! EVE is like Colette from Ratatouille or Ellie in Up, a tough female. Stuff is interesting when you switch it right? Anyway, the main ""villain"" is AUTO. He's not really a villain, it's his programming. His programming makes him do ""evil things."" Shelby Forthright (Fred Willard) said that the Earth is uncleanable so, even if EVE did find a plant on Earth, AUTO's programming is preventing him from letting the ship go back to Earth. AUTO also spoofs HAL 9000 from 2001: A Space Odyssey. The supporting characters are basically, M-O (Ben Burtt again) and Captain McCrea (Jeff Garlin). M-O is annoyed at WALLE at first but at the end, they become friends and stuff. Captain McCrea is the captain of the AXIOM (Sigourney Weaver). Now the genre of WALLE is basically comedy/family/Adventure/Romance/Sci-fi and more. It is funny at some times but it's a ""cute funny"" not a genuinely funny moment. There's nothing much that will make it un-kid-friendly. It is full of adventure, the romance between WALLE and EVE is cute. The science in here is not that accurate (sound in space). Now the story is not that bad and complicated. Mankind has polluted Earth and WALLE's try to clean it up but soon, here is only one WALLE left. One day, that WALLE meets an EVE. WALLE falls for EVE but shows her a plant. They go to AXION, AUTO pisses them off, they go back home. Anyway, this movie is more on ""cuteness"" but still I give it an 83% awesome."
"vfdnoble","10","1","3","17 January 2009"," Made me think.
","WALL-E is a movie that follows a robot stranded on an uninhabitable future Earth. This robot, named WALL-E, has been programmed to clean the Earth however he can. This robot's story changes when an expedition is set for Earth, sending the probe EVE. After ""courting"" this new robot, WALL-E follows EVE back to a ship in space that contains one of the many groups of humans that have abandoned the planet Earth.<br/><br/>EVE, on the other hand, was sent to Earth to discover life, which she did in the form of a plant. Once she returned to the ship to deliver the plant, she and WALL-E continue adventures on the ship to put the plant in it's rightful place so that the humans could return to earth, in spite of a malfunctioning auto-pilot.<br/><br/>First off, the animation was superb and detailed. Not really much to say there. Second, this movie takes on a challenge I have not seen before: a love story involving robots. This movie revolves around them. ""WALL-E"" also uses very little language, relying on the gestures and scenes to communicate what the robots are feeling.<br/><br/>This story also uses very little depth, and yet so much mystery behind the characters. I find this very intriguing as the characters are not hard to get to know, but as you watch the robots communicate, you see that there are very complex emotions behind these characters.<br/><br/>What really got me in this movie though are all the questions it asks. What is the purpose of humanity? This movie has a very ironic story-line: all the humans had everything literally handed to them, and yet only when these things were taken away did they find true happiness. The captain was also not content with the auto-pilot's answer concerning the state of Earth. The captain was not content to keep his ""perfect"" life; he wanted to return to Earth to start anew and find new meaning to this otherwise pointless existence.<br/><br/>Another question I usually shun but pondered this time around is ""What are we willing to do to our home?"" Is progression everything? I was alarmed to find myself asking this, especially since I usually lean for progression over preservation. But this story made me wonder to what extent will I neglect my home?<br/><br/>This is an excellent movie with a very simple plot but extraordinary meaning. The children can understand and enjoy while those that are more mature can ponder extravagant ideas. It will be many years before I watch this for the last time."
"Robert_duder","9","1","3","15 January 2009"," An artistic feat of Animation that will become an absolute legendary classic!!
","I wanted to see Wall-E from the minute I saw the trailers. I thought he looked adorable and the film looked cute and then the reviews said it was kind of dark and very little dialog and finally I got to see it. I was moved, blown away, excited by it, cheering for it...I fell head over heels for Wall-E and it's completely original and touching love story. Essentially I believe Wall-E is indeed a love story...both between two completely different robot entities and between a robot and his world. The animation is brilliant from the completely obliterated world of earth to the enormous futuristic ship and the adventure is non stop fun!! Despite some reviewers opinions of the film being too dark and too preachy for kids I think its a case of over analyzing because the film is fun and cute as it is serious. Yes the film does have a strong message but it is still told in animation for anyone and everyone to enjoy and the story is still happily ever after in the end. The amazing thing is the film makers really make this relationship between Wall-E and Eve so strong and so powerful and so cute that you will feel a romance between two robots. Something only Disney could do...or Pixar in this case.<br/><br/>Ben Burtt and Elissa Knight are just brilliant as the voices of Wall-E and Eve respectively. Knight's pleading voice twirping ""Walll-Eee"" will forever be a classic moment in animated films. Burtt makes Wall-E come to life and however digitized the voice may be he still gives the character depth and soul. Jeff Garlin is terrific as the overweight Captain who fights the system to save his people. Fred Willard is a great comedian but I found his performance a little monotone in the film and misplaced considering his part. Pixar favorite John Ratzenberger and Kathy Najimy (Peggy Hill) are residents John and Mary and although they have small roles they are really great in their roles.<br/><br/>Wall-E has been heralded with great reviews and numerous award nominations and I think is sure to walk away with an Animated Academy Award at the very least and it is completely well deserved. In classic Pixar style the film can be completely enjoyed by adults and children the same. Considering the first 30-45 minutes is Wall-E exploring the barren earth and setting up his character you will love every minute of it. You will be enthralled with Wall-E and the movie right from the very beginning. He is a subtle hero of the utmost. Pixar director Andrew Stanton has had his hand in at least six of the most popular animated films of the last decade including Toy Story one and two...which I think was a stepping stone in the current level of animation we see now. Wall-E is a feat of animation and will be a new bar of standards to future Pixar animations as well as other companies. An absolute must see for everyone. 9.5/10"
"mzojala","6","1","3","3 January 2009"," Too perfect to be fully enjoyable
","Pixar's much acclaimed computer animation presents an ecological dystopia in which Earth has sunk under garbage and people live on a giant spacecraft operated by robots. The film recycles ideas and themes from several sci-fi classics. The way of life on the spaceship, aimed at the immediate satisfaction of human needs, reminds of The Brave New World; the relationship between human and machine is a familiar theme from 2001: Space Odyssey; and the anarchistic action motivated by the contradictions between a consumer society, a totalitarian bureaucracy and a constant threat of terrorism comes close to Terry Gilliam's marvelous Brazil.<br/><br/>Both the animation and the artwork are impressive, which makes the film a joy to watch. However, as typical for an animated film, WALL·E suffers from excessive pace and technical perfection. The flawless narrative exposes the plot's determinism and fails to create an illusion about alternative twists or open moral choices. The humanized behaviour of the robots and their society is quite predictably depicted, and the presentation of the much more interesting human society remains superficial. Thus, the film largely ignores the crucial question: why the harmonious easy living created on the spaceship by and for the humans must be so condemnable and unsatisfactory? Why does the film stress the importance of human effort, when the result of such activity (of work and consumption) has been a world filled with trash? Because the film does not analyze the social and economic relations in which the collective human effort has lead to the ecological destruction in the first place, it comes dangerously close to glorifying any kind of collective action (as opposed to inaction), regardless of its political and ideological purpose."

","The first half-hour of Wall-E is a magnificent piece of art, a wonder to behold. Wall-E himself is so well-realised in the opening that you wish you could put your arms round his metal frame and take him home. <br/><br/>The Wall-E & Eve relationship is wonderfully rendered one really can feel their emotive core even though they say very little! The middle part of Wall-E does struggle at times to maintain one's attention, and I do feel that Pixar did not seek to match the splendor of animation at the beginning with that later in the film.<br/><br/>However, Wall-E should also be applauded for its conjecture and thought throughout concerning planet Earth. Earth is becoming more and more consumerist in its nature, and indeed individually I believe more selfish. Wall-E makes this point very well. <br/><br/>The ending to Wall-E is one to cherish and it completes what is a beautiful, pertinent and wonderful film."

There is no missteps here this movie is Pixor's best. It doesn't have the heavyhandness of Finding Nemo or the stumbling around of TOY STORY 2 .

"Egg_MacGuffin","10","1","3","1 December 2008"," Pure cinema.
","There has been quite a bit of backlash regarding this film and I don't understand why. Maybe because it doesn't have expository dialogue to remind you of what is going on. Or perhaps it could be the lack of cheesy one-liners and asides that are all too common these days. It just might be the story, which doesn't involve a lot of things that blow up real good. I don't know.<br/><br/>Wall-E is pure cinema. It goes back to the silent film days where you didn't have the luxury of dialogue to tell a story. The filmmakers then had to rely on images to give the viewer all the information. It's not like today where an untalented director points and shoots because he wants to. Each shot had a purpose, and the juxtaposition of shots and images and actions were all important - scratch that...NECESSARY - to tell the story. Today, film editing is a complete joke. Either nobody understands it's purpose, or nobody applies it.<br/><br/>What elevates Pixar above everyone else is their understanding and application of what you could say are the ""rules of cinema"". Of course there are no rules, but there is what works and what does not. Pixar takes the time to find what works rather than what looks cool or what is the current trend. And the result of this is a story that everyone can enjoy. Today, a month from now, twenty years from now. A story where the main characters are not actors. They are not even physical, tangible objects. They are computer generated images with one or two word vocabularies. Yet, we grow to care for them as they learn to care for one another.<br/><br/>This is all possible through the magic of cinema - a VISUAL medium.<br/><br/>I want to go to the movies more often, but there are so many bad movies that I simply can't. I can't make myself go anymore. I used to for a long time, but now...I just can't do it. A rare film like Wall-E comes along and completely ruins any hope for me leaving the house to pay money to watch crap. I don't want to see lousy writing and bad dialogue and muddled images and inept editing and inferior story structure and flat characters lacking emotion, horrid acting and unoriginality. That is 97% of movies these days and over 99% of television.<br/><br/>When the the standards drop so low? Did I miss a meeting? I praise Pixar for staying true to themselves, and rebounding from their two worst outputs with their most cinematic film yet.<br/><br/>I just hope the rest of today's filmmakers and those of the future come to understand how cinema functions. What works and what doesn't. I hope they realize that film is meant to be a VISUAL medium, and not an economic one."

","The first 30 minutes of WALL-E were totally mind blowing and it was already clear that this was going to be a great film.<br/><br/>Unfortunately Pixar wasn't able to hold this quality all the way through. Of course this would have been almost impossible but after the ship takes off it is weaker than before.<br/><br/>Also the other ""good"" robots were kind of thrown in and it didn't seem like they really fitted in.<br/><br/>But apart from that: WOW!!! The animation was pretty much as we can expect from Pixar but that wasn't the main reason why I liked it. It was because I had the same feeling I had when watching Finding Nemo. The characters (WALL-E, EVE especially) were just great and memorable. I remember wondering how they were going to have a robot that doesn't really have a voice show emotions and bond with the audience but there were several very sad or happy moments. The cinema I was at was almost sold out and you could see that everyone was moved by certain scenes.<br/><br/>This is without a doubt one of the best animation films ever made (although I found Finding Nemo a bit better but that's only me) and will obviously win the Best Animation Oscar in Febuary. I don't think it will win Best Picture but a nomination would be nice and deserved."

With hardly any dialogue, the first 30 minutes are still able to capture you, by stunning animation, careful sound design, and Thomas Newman's score, which varies between eerie and playful.<br/><br/>It's hard to describe why Wall-E is so good without giving spoilers. So I won't. Just see for yourself."

Wall-E is better than a thousand live action movies put together; it has been a long time since I haven't taken part so much, as a viewer, to what I was watching. Wall-E doesn't speak but his eyes and his ""EEEVAA-h"" can express much more than an human actor, according to me.<br/><br/>I was fighting to not cry in front of all the cinema; this movie hit me, because it touches a subject, the environment, that I often forget, and that I should consider more important.<br/><br/>Of course, music and animation are perfect (Pixar guarantees); I particularly liked the corto before the movie's start, ""Presto"", so try to get on time to the cinema!"
"herbert_heart","10","1","3","3 October 2008"," Occam's robots
","The robot WALL-E, much like HAL 9000 in Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", did evolve through some sort of unknown higher order logic. While HAL's program paths started to differ from the calculations of his twin machine on earth, WALL-E develops emotional reactions and keeps going while the other machines of his make are long defunct.<br/><br/>There is however one big difference between WALL-E and HAL: while HAL shows rather verbose responses, WALL-E does not or cannot talk much at all. And EVE, the other robot that comes into play later, is about as monosyllabic as WALL-E. Also, their gestures are quiet limited, WALL-E can shake his telescopic old-school binoculars a little and EVE displays a high-tech screen with one color bitmap eye-like silhouettes.<br/><br/>However, this is enough for Andrew Stanton and his team to express a relationship between WALL-E and EVE which is deep enough to repeatedly move the viewer to tears. While the movie works best on the emotional level, it also contains intellectual surprises. It deals with similar topics like Spielberg's A.I. - but in a lot purer and (even) more intelligent way by almost completely leaving out the concepts of good, evil and unnecessary melodramatic elements.<br/><br/>It is simply amazing how the robots in this movie were stripped from every unessential gadget and how these machines grow into the heart of the viewer only by the doing of their deeds. The movie does on top of this display a very high degree of artistic visual perfection and simply contains a story told well."
"jzappa","10","1","3","28 September 2008"," Friendship, Love and Working Together vs. Consumerism and Corporate Greed
","WALL-E is an extremely accessible and emotionally touching family film that tells its story more in accordance with its medium than so many movies most older people would honestly rather see. There is something essential, fundamental, stimulating about a movie without any dialogue for its first half: It is telling its story with, guess what, images! And what magnificent images they are. They have centuries of history to them, centuries in our future. Long, long before the film opens, a megacorporation, perfectly named Buy n Large, assumed every economic use in the world, including the government, as one would think of course inevitable. Filled by unrecycled waste, the planet has been so polluted that for seven hundred years, life has been unsustainable. In an attempt to keep humanity alive, the Buy n Large CEO, played in live action on a 700-year-old city screen by Fred Willard, sponsored a five- year exodus from Earth aboard a fleet of starliners that would support every need with a robot crew. Hundreds of thousands of waste-disposal robots were left behind to clean up the planet by compacting the trash into cubes and stacking them into skyscraper-like towers for easy disposal. However, this plan was rejected when Forthright determined that Earth was too contaminated for return to ever be possible. Now, only one of these robots remains operational. That history alone makes our title character one of the most crushingly tender characters ever to be portrayed in the movies.<br/><br/>Centuries of lingering activation have given this individual robot consciousness and a sense of interest in things. He collects centuries-old things, things that in this film's world which is so real we feel are so foreign regardless of our daily familiarity with them. This robot, WALL- E, finds them interesting among the mountains of garbage and waste, pragmatically accumulates spare parts for himself from other inactive WALL-Es, and often watches a VHS of Hello, Dolly!. As he continually watches it at the end of each day, we realize that he is developing emotion, paying particular attention to the doing of holding hands, which he deciphers to be an act of showing love. With no one with whom to hold hands, WALL-E, for the first time in centuries, feels lonely.<br/><br/>We love this robot for the same reason we love dogs. And I do not simply mean that he is cute, but there is innocence, nobility and unconditional love projected by the cuteness. His eyes are a luminously brilliant touch: He doesn't really have a head so much as he has two steel-encased lenses upon steel stilts, and these lenses can tilt into an arch, which makes him look adorably pitiful. The little guy can draw his limbs into his body and create a cube when he senses danger or when he is resting. He experiences romance, real and powerful romance, and goes on an adventure, none of which is alluded to us any more than to WALL-E himself.<br/><br/>What's more, as such an accessible and emotionally involving movie, it unravels into a hilarious, and quite daring, satire undertaking a direly relevant ecological agenda. There are critics who have said that it does so with a lightness of touch that allows you to accept or ignore the message. This is not true. Besides, if someone ignores the message of the film, it is not because the movie wants them to. Its confrontation with the issues it faces is evidenced by the outrage of Conservatives who have called it partisan propaganda, or that Disney and Pixar have spent millions of dollars on a film to announce an offense to its consumers. There is something noble and vital about the lengths to which society will go to telegraph the topical agenda of environmentalism.<br/><br/>The way the movie sees it, after centuries of living in micro-gravity aboard spaceships, humans have lost significant bone mass, causing them to be too obese to stand or move without robotic assistance. Even the ship's commander, voiced by the hilarious Jeff Garlin, has entrusted all his duties to the ship's robotic autopilot, an obvious homage to HAL 9000. The unique behavior the action of the story brings aboard the ship causes the humans to act outside their standard routines, much to their delight. So the filmmakers do not necessarily see humans as inflicting the evil of mankind as some Conservative critics have claimed, but as creatures dangerously prone to routine and subjugation. Having entrusted their existence to a robotic autopilot and robotic servants and assistants of all necessary kinds, they have finally submitted themselves to the dominant power of constantly advancing technology for the sake of their own luxuries. The filmmakers do not necessarily see the toxic excess of waste to be a product of human evil, but of human lack of initiative or awareness, of the training, indoctrinating nature of constant, privileged routine."

","Mate, flipping unreal.. #1 film ever, its got everything.<br/><br/>I will now begin by reinforcing opening line review of WALL-E, not only is this the most pristine masterpiece of cinema in my life time, it is without a doubt my most favorite movie of ALL TIME. Certainly i did not foresee anything busting my sci-fi love for Aliens except maybe Avatar - James Cameron is going to have to seriously have a revelation or like Doc Brown, hit his head on the toilet for a good idea.<br/><br/>Now the fact that i got dressed to go see this is an achievement in itself, furthermore going there alone whilst everyones with their mates (yeah its a gamble to fly solo in the cinema) and all based on a news ste review which had a bit of a 'sparkle' in its text - usually the <br/><br/>Audio/Music: <br/><br/>100/100, perfectly chosen and synced, makes the movie very lucky or they had a VERY talented crew whom had the time and respect given to deliver such a result - thats rare.<br/><br/>Design Elements: <br/><br/>The initial planet scape, ruins, rubbish, advertisement propaganda, thick dust leave no gaps with which to pierce my a-hole Graphic Designer and Logical-Nagging criticism habits - one that supported Fallout for many years as the only artistic post apocalyptic setting - well this one takes the cake, because it dared to push sci-fi ideas into a logical setting for a future apocalyptic environment - all have failed, i would never attempt it myself, this film did and nailed it.<br/><br/><ul><li>The film is essentially like your mixing water and vodka, the WHOLE-F'ING thing is still intact.. You just get a bit of a buzz after 5 minutes without expecting it.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Cant say that about the latest flicks.. Comparable to throwing old pre-mixes together, shaking it up and waiting for some bugger to open it.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Design (3D) Overall: </li></ul><br/><br/>I really wasn't expecting to see the next-generation of 3D films being any time soon - proved wrong. This level of design and detail is miles ahead of the rest, it is borderline photo realistic but keeps the 3D element in such a way that it appreciates the film 10 fold - the way Band of Brothers lighting/hue was the first of its kind to set a new benchmark.<br/><br/><ul><li>Storyline: </li></ul><br/><br/>Mate if voting had a 5 star limit and each person on earth had a God given right to ONLY-ONCE give a 6 star vote - this is that time - without a doubt - please indicate on IMDb that Ben votes 6 stars and will take that to his grave..<br/><br/>Reasons why it rocked: 1) Studio executives paid by production/film crew to wear a muzzle, blindfold and ear plugs whilst in the studio. 2) Possibly looked like a 50/50 in the studio anyway, but turned out great. 3) The most talented story writers, designers and producers, all knew what needed to be done, had a true passion and just went to town.<br/><br/>Also: Fat humans after 700 years of doing the equivalent of a WOW player whos flying the magical elf mount 5 days after expansion.. That sounds fair.<br/><br/>The last 15 years has been consistent increases in technology trends + quicker and remotely operated services/devices + require less thinking + A lot less movement or input & they continue to be aimed at the most unintelligent people for ease-of-use ""if he can use it, anyone can"". These are the same hopefuls who put facebook, myspace, guild leader and ""can fix pc"" on their job applications - Lazy, Hover Gaming Station & Life Support Couch Operators in the making.<br/><br/>And the reference to the Super Store that is on every product and even in bed with the Government during the film. It could happen, i mean big companies always merge - either they cant afford to compete or shareholders benefit from such a deal. The execs today see money on all markets and thats it - not, ""Why do we need this when its being done by many other brands? Well we have a popular product which cant be met elsewhere, people come buy it, we get them to buy our poor quality cheaper product off the shelf and slowly work our way, hopefully one of the other brands gives up sending new consumers our way or sells their product to us us and we just rename a quality brand"" <br/><br/>Happens all the time and Aussie supermarkets sell their own brands now, usually half or 3/4 the price of other brands and despite advertising rules, they employ bright silver packaging that blinds customers from seeing other products.. joke<br/><br/>OH well im happy to see a family friendly movie with a good storyline highlight these issues in a 'covert' way.. Better than Michael Moore up raving for 2 hours and only getting support from people over 30."

","It isn't often these days that you find a movie like Wall-E. It isn't a film that asks much of you, that strongly tries to force a particular opinion, or makes you feel like a cheated idiot after you have paid however much to see it. All it asks really is for you to be a human being. It asks you to feel. It asks you to relate to and understand the entire spectrum of emotions that we possess.<br/><br/>You become familiar with a machine which has been built for one purpose only, like many before it. Yet somewhere along the way, this machine became aware to the point of having a conscious. Ultimately the only thing that separates Wall-E from being anything other then what he was built to do is his ability to love, desire, want and appreciate. Much like us really. Though I think the fact that we can relate to that is the main point of it all. The entire movie visually is breathtaking and the animation so subtle and clever. There is hardly any dialogue throughout with the protagonist saying not more than one word. But to be able to understand when he is sad, happy, elated, scared, depressed or in love from the slightest movement, noise or action he makes. And to respond with my own emotion and empathy, well, that just makes me very proud to be human. Nothing can dampen a strong will, and only love can fix a broken heart. This film is fantastic, and you should see it.<br/><br/>10/10"

","If we can live in a real world with cold blooded criminals<br/><br/>Why can't we watch an animated film with heart warming robots?<br/><br/>I had just watched WALL.E earlier this week - it is without a doubt one of the best animated film i've ever watched and i find it a challenge to describe the brilliance of this show. Note that i am not trying to change the minds of people who finds this show ""over-rated"" or ""a retarded show"". To each their own, i have the rights to love, they have the rights to dislike.<br/><br/>WALL.E - acronyms for Waste Allocation Load Lifter.Earth-class, is a film that sets our hero as a robot named WALL.E. WALL.E is a lonely robot who dutifully collects waste, compresses them into square cubes and neatly stack them together forming skyscrapers of dumps and trashes with only an indestructible roach as his companion ever since human left Earth due to over pollution and dump wastes. After 700 years of solitude, a sudden visit of a spaceship introduces WALL.E to EVE (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator) a sleek white high tech robot who was deployed back to Earth to search for plantation life form on Earth for hopes of human returning home. It was love at first sight for our squarish friend and he embark on an adventure of his life time to seek out his heart-throb.<br/><br/>The concept was undeniably realistic. The pollution and great increase in the damage of our environment is not some cock and bull story to frighten people into conserving and caring for our planet Earth.<br/><br/>The animation was undoubtedly fantastic. The 3D effect of the show made the world look pretty much too real at times, small details like the cloudy atmosphere, reddish sky, dried up ground, all the way down to the pebbles and debris contributes to the art of a great animation.<br/><br/>The storyline was indisputably simple. Yes, its simple and sweet, and thats what makes the show an enjoyment for people, a robot falls in love with another robot, he seek her out, help her in her mission to recover a plant, and earth sweet earth... its that simple! think again, there ain't many shows that can be this simple and yet so captivating right?<br/><br/>The portray of WALL.E as a simple minded robot is impressive, he has character, determination, personality and most important of all, a human heart. EVE is not one robot to belittle either, her cute laughter, occasion aggressive approach, fierce loyalty for her job and strong-will makes her a lovable character too! Many other robots in the show is like the icing on a cake, they are small, but they are indispensable, each of them have their own unique feature.<br/><br/>Pixar continues to surprise and pleases us in many many different ways, while the whole story is mostly about WALL.E and EVE's romance and journey. The message which is being delivered is crystal clear - ""Save The Environment"" - nothing much to elaborate here right? Another message which is entrenched within is none other than... us.<br/><br/>The people in the animation is shown to be over-sized creatures who relies on technology for everything. Each and everyone slouching on a hovercraft that provides transportation and virtual communication, robots at their beck and call, clap once for a drink, click a button for change of clothes. Most people, and most reviews i read state that this is obviously showing our pending downfall due to die-hard reliance on electronic applications and gadgets. I however not only see the humans end result inside depicted as our future... I happens to view it as our PRESENT. It maybe quite an extreme way of an example, but think again... we are constantly submerging ourselves in material needs, doing what we are 'suppose' to do, studying, working, going through the rat race of every aspect in our own tiny world thinking the sun revolves around us, neglecting the bigger world out there, and what i think is that we need a push to get us out of the virtual chairs, and start noticing what we have around us.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Strongly encourages all of you out there to catch this movie, while i can't assure you that you will love it, it may just get you thinking about things in many different light. For me at the very least, WALL.E really got me thinking a lot, from the simplicity of the storyline, to the complexity of the messages hidden within. WALL.E satisfy me more than any animated show so far and Pixar is in for a challenge to produce a better film than this... but then again, i thought of the same line after ""Finding Nemo"" and voilà! Along came WALL.E.<br/><br/>9.5/10"
"dirty_dutchman","9","1","3","20 August 2008"," Actions Speak Louder Than Words
","Isn't that a message we should be teaching our children? Actions speak louder than words. In an age where everyone has an opinion, and every issue is a headline, what is more effective: the arguments of politics, or actions to resolve the problems?<br/><br/>This may be a stretch to pull out of WALL-E, but the principle is there. WALL-E, the latest offering from Pixar, is one of the first ""children's"" movies that delivers this most meaningful of philosophies. And yet, WALL-E has been wrongly criticized for that same point. For a ""children's"" movie, WALL-E is somewhat dark, grim, and burdened with messages. But for those parents out there who complain about the poor quality of cartoons on one end, and then expect someone else to raise their children for them, WALL-E is the perfect film. It combines the silliness of a lovable robot with a very powerful truth of the human condition.<br/><br/>What makes WALL-E so unique is the fact that there is very little dialogue, particularly in the first half of the film. Instead, you are drawn into the world of a small, lonely robot, whose sole job is to clean up the planet. Yet even though the main character is a predominantly voiceless machine, his mirroring of humanity grows through his curiosity and longing for a companion. And one day, his wish is granted. He meets EVE, a far more sophisticated robot, who has come to Earth in search of life. While EVE is met by the lingering WALL-E, the two find a common ground of curiosity. But as WALL-E shows off his collection, EVE finds a plant and is forced to complete her mission.<br/><br/>This takes the plot into outer space, where WALL-E comes to a space station, where humans have lived for hundreds of years. This is where the film takes some interesting turns. Due to the lack of gravity, humans have become fat, lazy and clueless. All it takes is one visitor to begin to change all of it. While the humans want to get back to Earth, WALL-E just wants to find EVE. In the end, WALL-E is really a story of love, but one that you wouldn't expect. He will do anything for his love, even if it means sacrificing himself.<br/><br/>WALL-E is a dark movie, but that does not mean it is unsuitable for children. The blatant messages may be over the top at times, but the themes of love and action are hardly reserved for adults. Much like some of Pixar's other creations, particularly The Incredibles, WALL-E proves that animation is not reserved for childish antics and jokes. It is a medium that enables storytellers to imagine wonderful and fantastic tales. WALL-E has its flaws, but its positives far outweigh them.<br/><br/>I do suggest that parents take their children to see it. Not everyone will agree with some of the messages. I surely don't agree with them all. But the strongest themes, namely love and acting for what is good and right, those make the film more than just entertainment. WALL-E is an experience of the imagination and the heart. Those are concepts that transcend age and politics."

","This is a film that well deserves a 15 out of ten. I never thought I would find a new favorite Disney Film than the Lion King, but WALL-E sure took its place. I never had seen more beauty in characters, scenery, plot and love until i witnessed the lonely little robot looking up into the stars listening to a song from a classic musical. WALL-E himself is more in depth as a person than any other human could come close to being. And with the brilliant designers and artists at Pixar, I've never seen any CGI look almost real enough to touch. When I first saw pictures of WALL-E, I was thinking that it was some sort of spin-off of Short Circuit and E.T., apparently not. WALL-E and EVE together beat any lovers and love story dating even farther back than Romeo and Juliet, and the emotions they have for each other are clearly defined in their gestures, expressions and how they sound when they talk to each other. How EVE would scold, cry out and praise WALL-E would just make any person swoon due to the rhythmic quality of her voice. Along with the heart warming and melodious score, I never thought I would see a highly complex machine nearly start swelling with tears, it nearly brought some out of me, too. This is a movie that will defy the ages, it has surpassed any other animated movie ever and is definitely the best movie to come out this year, if not the past decade."

","Wall.E is definitely among the best movie i've ever seen. Hats off to Andrew Stanton and Pixar for the extraordinary movie.<br/><br/>The film looks more lively and in some scenes you will feel for characters forgetting they are robots and its a animation movie.In course you will feel love between Wall.E and Eve forgetting they are robots.The way they look at the future is lovely. Their imagination goes wild especially everything that goes on inside axiom the space ship where people live.<br/><br/>Another impressive thing is the way a animation film is delivered without a dialogue for most part of the film thats really amazing.

","Another great effort from Pixar, though it does not scale the heights of last years Ratatouille, its still a commendable effort that deserves the highest praise for its imagination and sheer bravery. With a plot that is far beyond the scope of normal...(read more) kiddie fare, very little dialogue, and an absence of cute fuzzy creatures, Wall-E succeeds due to the strong characterization of its protagonist (sans dialogue), a wholly believable plot that does not drag, and its stunning animation (the beginning shots of Earth, the trip into space, and the robots on the ship being highlights). If theirs one flaw, I would say the film is far too preachy. Though its intentions are noble, the message becomes jarring in the 2nd act, and its ending left me with more questions than answers. Like, what are they going to do now? So what if one plant was salvaged, it does not mean Earth is once again ripe for sustaining life. Those small criticisms aside, I thought Wall-E was not brilliant, but was another enjoyable Pixar product with something profound to say, and once again proves that animation is not just for the kiddos."
"thekarmicnomad","10","1","3","17 August 2008"," Why are Pixar so great? My first ever 10
","This film is amazing. Pixar just keep pulling them out a dark nasty piece of me wants to see them fail just once. Yet despite bringing out films about cooking rats and robots that can't speak they seem unable to.<br/><br/>PLOT The plot is simple so small children can understand it without having to ask you too many annoying question, yet the underlying story is powerful enough to keep adults hooked. Walle can't really speak but he never actually needs too, there is a little bit of narration through TV screens but the story tells itself.<br/><br/>ANIMATION OK it is really great and all done by a super computer. clap clap. But what is really amazing is how much personality is infused into the characters. Also it looks genuinely funny there is a scene near the end where my partner and me were creasing up with laughter.<br/><br/>DETAIL There is so much detail in the film it is unbelievable. Look around the edges of the screen and you can see tiny pieces of background and details that you are only consciously aware of if you really hunt for them. The opening sequence is a master piece, I could watch it all day long.<br/><br/>I saw it in the cinema all the kids were gripped and laughing, I genuinely felt a bit teary in places and cannot recommend this enough.<br/><br/>My first ever 10 goes to a cartoon, who would have guessed?"
"seruzz2003","10","1","3","16 August 2008"," A brilliant dose of imagination
","The '·' in WALL·E is an 'interpunct', used to separate words in classical Latin long before a 'space' is even thought of. With it being in the film's title, a sense of nostalgia with a blend of mystery and sci-fi is invoked. The decision to combine a futuristic sounding title with an extinct punctuation definitely sets this film apart from any other animated films. Unlike most current films, much personality is already given out by only reading the title itself. Having said that, it is also unsurprising to know that the film's achievements greatly mirrors the purpose of the title.<br/><br/>WALL·E stands for 'Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class' and WALL·E is a robot. The directive for WALL·E is to do what his name says, cleaning up trash on a post-apocalyptic (not in the usual sense) Earth habituated by absolutely nothing at all except for WALL·E's only friend, a cockroach. WALL·E showcases sapient behaviour unprecedented for a machine in our time. Despite being a machine, WALL·E clearly exhibits emotions which endears him to viewers and gave him much more of a personality than most cartoon characters can dream of. Out of nowhere, EVE, an Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator, appears on Earth and drives the brilliant plot of this film forward in a delightful pace.<br/><br/>The plot (which I am not spoiling here) of WALL·E is an amazing, imaginative and original ride that will make absolutely anyone laugh, cry and think. If one has a very short attention span and is unable to work their thought process, this film is definitely a pass for them. Fortunately, this film works on almost all levels (except for the select few that I mentioned) and is definitely a joy to watch for anybody of any ages. Like every other Pixar film, imagination is abundant in this film and it is surprising to think that those at Pixar possess such vast amount of it.<br/><br/>Pixar outdid themselves in every aspect of film-making again. In particular, visuals are a main composition of an animated film and WALL·E trumps in this aspect. From the rubbish towered landscapes of an isolated Earth to the vast sea of space, WALL·E is a visual feast for the eyes. Live-action shots in this film are also a first for Pixar and they are utilised to great visual and dramatic narrative effect. Unorthodox for an animated CGI film, depth of field shots (and other cinematography techniques) are littered throughout the film inciting tension and drama in scenes that demands it. Dull, colourful, bright and vibrant are words to describe the colour palette used for this film and they are used to great effect in terms of creating emotions and depth. Various feelings of delight and melancholy are displayed wonderfully in WALL·E just by the visuals itself making this film another of Pixar's finest efforts.<br/><br/>Atmosphere is abundant throughout the film with perfect use of music. The score is evidently the main component for a film like WALL·E which exhibits silent films' characteristics. Tension, joy, calmness and humanity are ejected with ease into viewers through the use of music. This film's achievements in the audio department greatly rival musical efforts by Disney such as Fantasia 2000. Classic and lovable songs are also inserted at poignant points of the film invoking a sense of nostalgia much like the title itself. All in all, the score is such a wonderfully refreshing experience that anyone can go through over and over again.<br/><br/>To call WALL·E a cartoon greatly diminishes the quality of the film. Social commentaries are a main part of this film that most people will overlook. With obvious themes like mass-consumerism, globalisation and degradation of humanity, this film is no longer a cartoon. It is a film that rivals any live-action films in terms of intelligence and heart albeit in the form of an animation. Viewers will be given a choice of either thinking or not thinking when undergoing the process of experiencing this film. Needless to say, the viewers' minds will not be taxed that much for the themes present are all laid out easily for anyone to follow. With intelligence infused linearly for the viewers, the joy of watching a film can be undertaken without much confusion.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, WALL·E is the film of the year that everyone should absolutely catch. WALL·E is a film that appeals to anybody and will definitely give everyone a great time. For those complaining about the film being too slow, it is because the visuals and the themes are overlooked. There is also not one ounce of popular culture that is present in this film (unlike Kungfu Panda which strives on that and sacrifices quality) and that makes WALL·E a refreshing watch. Therefore, WALL·E is highly recommended by me and it should be the film everyone watches while it is still playing.<br/><br/>PS: A great short by Pixar is also present before WALL·E begins ala Pixar's other films. This allows us to watch a feature length film and a short film for the admission price of only one feature length film!"
"blackburnj-1","9","1","3","14 August 2008"," A film to introduce a new generation to the magic of cinema
","Children's cinema is underestimated. It is perhaps the most difficult genre to pull off well. You have to be entertaining to young children and to parents as well and you must hold the former's attention for well over an hour  a very tricky thing to do. And yet, despite the many challenges that face the filmmakers in this genre, Pixar's animations clear the bar every time, and many of them clear it, raise it and then clear it again.<br/><br/>But, Pixar do not just make good children's films. They very often make bold ones which don't condescend to the younger audience (""Ratatouille"" is a prime example) and, every once in a while, they make great children's films that tick all of the boxes and bring the magic of cinema home to their audience and start millions of new relationships with the wonder of the silver screen. ""WALLE"" is one of these films.<br/><br/>Many thought that ""Ratatouille"" was about as bold as you could get with a children's film. The idea of a film about rats and cooking in France struck many as too high-brow and not interesting enough for a young audience. Those who were unconvinced by ""Ratatouille"" must have shuddered at the pitch for ""WALLE"". The first fifteen minutes have only two characters, namely a cockroach and the eponymous robot, who share little communication and no dialogue, naturally. It is forty minutes before any human contact is made and there is a large subtext of environmentalism, anti-consumerism and anti-corporationism (somewhat ironically showcased in a film from Disney, a corporation whose very existence is based on consumerism). This is hardly the easy fun of ""The Jungle Book"", for instance. And yet it works, and it works brilliantly.<br/><br/>There are many reasons for the movie's success. Firstly, the direction of Andrew Stanton is key to the film's excellence. He is, on the basis of this film alone, a visionary. It is clear in the character of WALLE, a creation of staggering brilliance, that this is a man of rare and great talent. How something so inanimate as the central robot can be designed to express so many emotions and thoughts is mind-boggling. But the central character is merely the crowning glory of a film which is extraordinarily well designed, firstly in a bleak post-apocalyptic earth and then in the sleek space ship. Every shot is beautiful and every character is perfectly created. The sound design completes the film's world with gusto and endless credit must be given to Ben Burtt whose work on character sounds in this film must at least equal his great work on the ""Star Wars"" films.<br/><br/>The film is also very funny. Most of this is silent-movie-like, with WALLE's actions making him like Keaton or Chaplin or, from the talkie era, Laurel and Hardy. There are the almost compulsory film references. ""Silent Running"" looms large thematically, but for laughs ""2001"" rules supreme. Humour is only one of this film's strength but it makes it all the more enjoyable but there is balance and it is encouraging to see a family film with a good dose of darkness in it. The loneliness in the opening is not without this (shots of other, ""dead"" WALLEs are brought in early) and there are many other low-moments in the film. It is sufficed to say that the film has a happy ending, although it flirts with a downbeat one. From an adult perspective it might be better if that was pursued, but this is after all a kid's film and even a pro-darkness in kids' films advocate, such as I, thinks that amount of darkness to be too much.<br/><br/>The darkness is not overwhelming and the prominent sense one has upon leaving the cinema is one of magic. The first sequence in space is an absolute joy, as is a dancing sequence. The spine tingles at many points in the film, due to a combination of the film's emotional weight, its spectacular visuals and the brilliance of Thomas Newman's score. It is this overriding sense of wonder that makes the film a must-see.<br/><br/>This is not Pixar's best (which is hardly a criticism really) but it is a great film of its type. Magical, ingenious, at times awesome and always spectacular, this film is a joy and an instant classic to be enjoyed for generations to come. Once again, the bold and visionary Pixar brand has cleared the bar by quite some distance.<br/><br/>N.B. The traditional short which runs before the film, ""Presto"", is wonderful, amusing and another delight to behold."
"tortietiger","10","1","3","13 August 2008"," Rediscover the magic of movies!
","When I went to see ""Wall-E"" I already had high expectations; I hold Pixar films to a higher standard than other films because of their astounding track record of making exceptional movies. I was also optimistic because Andrew Stanton, who wrote and directed another one of my favorite films, ""Finding Nemo,"" was behind ""Wall-E"" as well. I expected a movie that would be an A+ but what I got was a movie that was A+++! The character Wall-E is one of the most endearing in cinematic history; he's a character you simply enjoy watching and want to spend as much time with as possible. The romance between Wall-E and Eve is one of the most beautiful, romantic, and moving love stories that I have ever seen. You know a film is special when even the end credits are brilliant! As opposed to most family-oriented films which aim to the lowest common denominator (poop jokes and all), ""Wall-E"" expects the audience to rise to its full potential in understanding the material. This is intentional; in an interview Andrew Stanton said that he believes that audiences want to feel intellectually challenged while watching a film- they just don't want to realize that they're actually working.<br/><br/>I've heard a lot of comments saying that this is Pixar's best film, which is probably true (although all of Pixar's work is, excuse the pun, incredible). Some others say that it's one of the best animated films of all times. This is also true but on an even larger scale I think it's one of the best films of all time. It's as magical and captivating as the original Star Wars and as artistic and unconventional as Fantasia. This is a movie that even the hardest cynic and youngest child can love. Through ""Wall-E"" I have rediscovered how magical films truly can be!"

I couldn't have been more wrong. This movie had everything. Great story, great characters, unbelievable animation and most importantly heart. No other movie touched me more than this one. It is hard to imagine how anyone out there did not like it. If you are five or a hundred Wall-e is for you. The word ""cute"" is not a word I often use, however... Wall-e is soooo damn cute! Also as always it is great to see how much attention Pixar gives to the little details. I am sure you can watch it over and over and each time see something new."

Then out of nowhere, 3 minutes into the movie I'm LOVING it. I was thoroughly entertained the entire time, laughing, enjoying myself and totally engrossed in the film. It really was so fun and a real gem. Wall E couldn't have been a cooler, more affable protagonist. I mean this was an adventure movie, love story and sci-fi flic all thrown into one. It just so happened to be animated...and VERY well done I might add. I guess I need to be more open-minded about these animated features because you know what else I loved...Kung Fu Panda.

","I have always been a Pixar fan, but lately I have lost interest in the animated area. But WALL~E gave me what was most likely my last real charm in a Pixar Film.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, WALL~E is a Futuristic trash compactor in a Landfill Earth. The plot at first seemed very boring and dull, but as simple as the plot may be (A human in the Monster world, Toys being alive, a Car lost in the desert), Disney/Pixar could really spice it up.<br/><br/>Like all recent Disney/Pixar films, the animation was great and the characters were so likable. It was a mix between a Future Sci-Fi and a Romance, which means it was a great family flick, and the comedy could satisfy anyone.<br/><br/>There really isn't much to the movie (explaining the length of my Review), but it was a charming movie and the latest in a lineup of awesome Pixar films. Go see it!"
"julito32","9","1","3","20 July 2008"," Near perfect.
","I just have to bite the bullet and come to accept that CGI animation just has a place in cinema. I've always said it looks incredible when its robots, animals and environments, but when you introduce the human element, it just doesn't come across as 'human' as traditional animation. Same occurred here. Some parts I was amazed how it looked like the action was being filmed _by_ a camera. But then the humans came. Which I was willing to actually not nitpick, but it doesn't help visually when in a scene you're establishing a shot with a CGI human and goddamn Fred Willard in the same scene. It's just jarring and it reminds you the people are just fake, no matter how real the robots look.<br/><br/>BUT, as far as the story goes, it's near flawless. If you wonder how could tell a story with almost no words and just actions, this is how you do it. I had wished there were less 'people' interaction at the end. All in all, I'm staring to believe Pixar can do NO WRONG."
"edwardrevans","10","1","3","19 July 2008"," Pixar do it again.
","They gave us Monsters Inc, and now for something completely opposite, as the trick here is most of the movie has no Dialogue, so Pixar have worked much harder, and delivered.<br/><br/>The visual gags and expressions from Walle and EVE the two principle characters are brilliantly executed , as the as the audience themselves try to figure them out as well as there is negligible dialogue between the two robots. For instance EVE is busily scanning objects on the deserted earth, but what wonders and Walle and the audience is she looking for then ? It clicks when Walle gives her a Plant that he has found when cleaning up the junk. Bingo She's looking for signs of life, where in return Walle is looking for a Companion.<br/><br/>So there's something for the kids and the adults as the central message to the movie, which is summed up nicely by a sign on the moon, advertising an Shopping Mall. Humanity has become lazy, and has ruined the earth so they can no longer live there, leaving the mess to Walle(s) to clean up. Trouble is that the mess is so bad that the Humans who have left Earth over 700 years ago cannot go back. So they wait in space on an large spaceship living a sedentary life, where everything is done for them from the comfort of there arm chairs, they use them to travel eat and sleep, to change their clothes at a touch of a button taking no exercise, which in turn causes their bones to disappear. Instead the robots including EVE do their work for them even taking over the decision making, not to return to earth when EVE returns with the proof that earth can support life.<br/><br/>But after a battle with the Spaceships computer, man is now in charge of his own destiny and returns to earth with Walle to start anew."

Most of all, it's a CLEAN movie with no profanities, nudity, sexual innuendos or suggestive language/acts like other children's movies are riddled with. This is the NEW STANDARD in animation and children's movies even though any adult will thoroughly enjoy this movie!

The romance was so pure and innocent and it was a breath of fresh air to see compared to the filth and trash in our movies today.<br/><br/>The message of the movie was also pleasant. We need to take good care of our home EARTH and all it takes is a little care from each one of us to do our part. <br/><br/>Even though there is very little dialogue in the movie, the scenes, characters, music/score truly communicated the message and it's a universal one.

"B_Mayer","9","1","3","7 July 2008"," Excellent Movie
","If you've seen a trailer for the movie, you can predict the plot of this movie within 5 minutes. It is not as funny as your standard Pixar movie. It is not politically neutral. There is very little dialogue.<br/><br/>So why do I love this movie? Because it is beautifully made. The animation is rather stunning, the artwork is enthralling. The main character is perfect. He has the ability to touch everyone he encounters by just introducing himself. There is no need for dialogue or cheesy jokes. You want action? see the Incredibles You want cheesy jokes? see Finding Nemo<br/><br/>You will hear parents of this movie criticize or praise it for it's message on environmental issues and preaching about eating less and getting out more. These messages are important, I am not sure why they receive any static from parents. The movie probably is not meant for people under 5, it can be slower and less action packed but that is at the parent's discretion. I think these themes are important and starting to address these issues with our children while still young should be a priority. I disagree with anyone who considers it particularly preachy, while the themes are not all too subtle, the message is not slammed down our throats as a viewer, there are no clear cut bad guys. The movie also predictably ends with a message of hope. And it shouldn't end any other way.<br/><br/>I mean after all, WallE is not particular interested in any political issues. He is a robot interested in friendship, love, and hope. And in the end, this is nothing more that a tale of pursuit of these concepts. And really... what can be more important?"
"MonkeyVooDoo","9","1","3","6 July 2008"," One of the Few Films to Keep a Smile on My Face from Start to Finish
","WALL-E is a simple story of a ""creature"" designed to clean up our waste, who ends up finding love. The entire metaphor for the movie is completely obvious; one mans trash is another ""mans"" treasure. WALL-E is fascinated by the objects we take for granted on an everyday basis, from sporks and light bulbs, to twinkies and plants. This movie is simply a fun ride with one of the greatest stories I have seen since Peter Jackson's interpretation of ""The Lord of the Rings."" If you have not yet seen WALL-E, it is simply the best film of the year thus far, and a definite winner of the Best Animated Picture award. When an robot built to clean up trash becomes sentient and learns to love, we know that humanity has run its course in life, in another light, it is Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines without any of the crap (which was most of the movie), and one of the most lovable characters modern day cinema has seen in what seems like ages."

","I knew little about this film before going with my daughter and a friend, but I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>I won't echo what others have said, I just want to explore a point no one has mentioned: why did this WALL-E survive when the others had not? We know by the ending what his behavior was supposed to be like, when he was repaired by Eve, but the implication is that his 'humanity' is what enabled his survival. The fact that the WALL-Es failed in their job is yet another indictment of the system that created them (and the need for their services). Of course, the job they were given was just a band-aid for the problem of pollution; compacting garbage and heaping it up wasn't going to solve anything."
"ferryboy","9","1","3","28 June 2008"," Cute, Passionate, Smart
","I had been anticipating this one for a few months, and It delivered on my expectations fully. Again, Pixar makes a great family film that really is for the WHOLE family. A simple, yet very passionate story, a simple message (which may have been a BIT much at times, but I'll get to that), eccentric characters, and, as we can always expect from Pixar, Eye Candy.<br/><br/>You first realize that you are seeing a different kind of picture right from the start. A vast view of space coupled with an upbeat show tune dazzles the eyes, and (at least in theaters) gives a sense of vertigo. The camera then pans to Earth, and with a short breath, we are whisked down the the desolate, dry surface, giving perfect contrast to the colorful view of the universe we just left.<br/><br/>Then, of course, we meet Wall-E, who is everything we have wanted him to be. Curious, playful and loving (Cockroaches have never been so cute), we glimpse his life for a glorious few minutes as he scampers around a ruined Earth, gathering artifacts from our dead culture.<br/><br/>And then, Wall-E's world is blown away by a large ship, and a small, sleek robot who calls herself Eva, and a cute, yet strangely moving romance between the two that will send you through every aspect of the emotional spectrum.<br/><br/>The movie takes a turn when we meet the humans traveling aboard large cruise-like spaceships. All of them are horribly obese, and thriving the laziest way that they can. They cannot walk, cook, play, or even think for themselves. This is where the message really begins to kick in.<br/><br/>While relevant, the dreary message often takes away from the spark (fuck it, pun intended) of the robot-romance between Wall-E and Eve, which is the real reason most of us came to see the movie.<br/><br/>But, do not let this stop you from seeing this movie. By far my personal favorite of the Pixar saga yet, Wall-E delivers everything we hoped it would and more, offering a meaty, heartfelt pleasure most ""family"" films just do not deliver."

","Its amazing how much humanity can be infused into a steel claw or a set of battered binoculars. But Lassiter and company do exactly that, and in ways never dreamed of by Disney, or Miyazaki for that matter.<br/><br/>The story is simple enough. A trash compacting robot stranded on earth for hundreds of years after mankind has literally trashed and abandoned the place meets a vastly updated robot who is exploring for signs of vegetation. The love story develops from there.<br/><br/>Yeah, I know...how can robots feel any emotions at all? Anyone who has seen Blade Runner, or 2001, A Space Odessey knows the possibility exists, even if it is far fetched.<br/><br/>While nods are given to 2001-A Space Odessey and Star Wars, this movie draws most of its inspiration from the best of Buster Keaton. WALL-E develops a futuristic tale of romance and slapstick, in which the passion and dedication of the loser finally wins the day. And it does it visually.<br/><br/>There is very little dialog in the movie, and what little dialog there is comes mostly from the humans who inhabit this mostly mechanized world. And that is what makes this movie all the more amazing. Just as the silent movies of old told so much of the story visually, so too this story is a visual story; and a lovely story it is.<br/><br/>That said, I must still say something about the soundtrack, which includes everything from Louis Armstrong to Peter Gabriel and a lot of ground in between. As I was watching the movie I often found myself marveling at how the music enhanced the things I was seeing on screen.<br/><br/>I'm giving this movie a 9 only because I'm sure Pixar will top itself again, and I think I will need the room for that higher rating later."

","When you are young and innocent, the world is usually a beautiful thing. OK, that would depend on your environment, but I hope children still have a little time to immerse themselves in the beauty of the world that they have been brought into. Old Disney films for intents and purposes were pristine, squeaky clean, beautiful. From day one, with Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, even dirty working environments looked clean; mud looked clean in Jungle book; even in the last release of Pixars ""Cars"", the rusty vehicles were touchable.<br/><br/>This has all changed in (If I have my numbers straight here) the 9th full length feature to come out of the chute at Pixars. Instead of beauty, they have given us gritty and ugly... and it's totally acceptable. Beautiful colors, deep and contrasting and charming characters fill this 103 minute film with pure delight. WALL-E has been left on Earth to do one thing: Clean up after humanity has desolated its resources. The science of this film tends to be a bit preachy at times, but the writers have actually created a somewhat believable future. In its desolation, we find WALL-E alone until some event brings a probe back to check on the clean-up progress. Without giving away too much, our little mechanical droid is not void of emotion, and what develops between the droid and the probe pave the way for the salvation of the planet.<br/><br/>As usual, the movie is laced with some great puns, but the vastness of the universe is ever present in the way Pixar defines it: Beautiful. Unfortunately, this movie should have special showings that don't allow children at all. True, it is rated G, but that only enforces that this movie is so multi-platformed for various generations, the addition of very young children can cause the experience from being truly appreciated. I don't know what the circumstances were for the man and his two young children were (2 girls, probably 3 and 5), but he got up and left them unattended to do who knows what. This action was disastrous: The three year old started howling for her dad three minutes after he left, making me want to move seats. Unfortunately it was a crowded theater and that really wasn't an inviting option. So I endured. Another observation was that this movie dragged at times, making the movie seem longer than it was. For children under 7, it was quite obvious it couldn't endure the test of time, and there was an increase in levels of impatiens by those children that were truly ready to start running up and down the stadium steps.<br/><br/>For those wanting to see this that are in their 20-something or better years, pay the full price and see it at night. Hopefully parents won't be silly enough to take children under 7 with them."
"diac228","9","1","3","28 June 2008"," Pixar is stirring the animation pot again, but not everyone will enjoy this recipe
","Pixar has been known for pushing the envelope not only for animation but for content within the films themselves. From the controversial storytelling elements of Ratatouille and The Incredibles to even the slow pacing of Cars, Pixar never follows the same formula twice (Even Toy Story 2 felt different from the original). While this adventurism is indeed good for the movie industry, it will have a tendency of missing the mark a few times. Wall-E is a defining example of risk taking to the maximum level. Blending no dialogue with slow pacing reminiscent of classic films, a bleak outlook on humans, and a space theme, this was recipe for financial disaster. Rarely do animated space films work, and even less when the content and plot is woven so deep that even most adults will miss the point. Wall-E is a beautiful, beautiful film, but an extremely tough pill to swallow. The movie-going audience of today would have trouble watching the works of Charlie Chaplin and even Stanley Kubrick for that matter. Our attention span has dropped in recent decades as a whole, and because of this, Wall-E forces us to let go of our usual methods in watching movies and makes us think, ponder, wonder, and perhaps even fear of what's becoming of our society.<br/><br/>This method of forced thinking can and will alienate people from this movie, and some will find this movie boring, dull, slow, and claim there's little going on. In actuality, the plot is extremely deep and rich, and full of morality and social commentary. So much goes on in Wall-E, that most of the movie's plot actually runs underneath the main story about a robot that develops curiosity and a love for another robot. Wall-E has stories about commercialism, technology, end-of-the-world moments, contamination, acceptance of life, change, and of course, love. Wall-E is a robot used to clean up the Earth in a time in which no humans are living in the planet. As the years pass and he continues to organize the trash, he develops a personality and it leaves him lonely and sometimes depressed. Eve, a feisty robot, comes in to Earth in search of something. Upon their meeting, it sets off a series of events that will span centuries, galaxies, and a running time of 103 minutes.<br/><br/>We can all question the quality of the pacing and the story itself, but to criticize the animation in any level should result in some lecturing of your peers. Wall-E is hands-down the best-looking animated film Pixar has created, and perhaps of all-time. The animation here is way up there with the likes of Sleeping Beauty, Beauty and the Beast, and of course Finding Nemo. Every last detail is spot-on, and adds a bit of irony to the movie as the more realistic-looking moments of Wall-E are the robots; and the more cartoonish feel of the movie comes during the witnessing of humans in the future. Helping the animation is the brilliant cinematography and sweeping movements of the camera that carries a hand-held feel throughout the first half of the movie.<br/><br/>The lack of dialogue isn't a problem as long as there is plenty going on. In Wall-E a lot happens, but you are placed with the job of piecing some of the parts together throughout the motion picture. Wall-E and Eve share excellent chemistry together, and they rarely exchange words. Wall-E himself is a very adorable character, among the best Pixar has invented. They even made a roach likable, and this takes a lot of effort. However, the movie's running time can still be shorter, and the pacing could have picked up at least a little in the second half. When the adventure shifts gears; so do the tone and the direction of the tale. Subtle cynicism is the best way to describe the setting of Wall-E's future, as it looks very bleak for a long period of time (like a loose mesh of the classic book 1984, and the roughly similar 2001: A Space Odyssey).<br/><br/>Wall-E runs into problems by swimming too deep into uncharted and dangerous territory in terms of presenting their story. Despite being a mere 103 minutes, it's a long 103 minutes, especially for children. While there is plenty of Wall-E in the beginning, he sort of disappears into the river of events that occurs later on. Even the adults may miss the big picture of Wall-E, and it's never good when nobody can truly grasp what is going on. For full enjoyment, you need a watchful eye, an open mind, a lot of patience, and a love for the idea of space being the final frontier. Otherwise, Wall-E will disappoint and bore you. Andrew Stanton of Finding Nemo fame tries blending substance for adults and kids to enjoy, but with the material it's tougher to accomplish just that especially when compared to Nemo and especially Toy Story. Deep down, it's a modern-day version of 2001, a tame rated-G movie with a lot more going for it than anyone could imagine. We can spend much more time truly dissecting the film, especially with the countdown towards a bleak future beginning at only one century past our time.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Despite the efforts, despite the amazing animation, despite the willingness to try something new, Wall-E falls into the category of a minor disappointment, especially by Pixar standards. It is a great movie, don't get me wrong, but it is a tough movie to watch, a tough movie to fully discuss, and nothing like anything you have seen within the past several years. Be prepared for a unique cinematic experience that boggles the mind and warms the heart. Unlike all the other Pixar movies, this is not going to be everyone's cup of tea. But if it is, what a tea you'll be drinking."
"shiftyeyeddog","9","1","3","27 June 2008"," Charlie Chaplin, Pixar-style
","Animation, especially CG animation, has found its success largely through making things talk that normally don't - animals, toys, cars, etc. So it's ironic to find that one of Wall-E's greatest strengths is that is practically a silent movie.<br/><br/>There are sound effects and (very) limited dialogue, of course, but this very well COULD have been a silent movie, and you wouldn't have missed a thing. Wall-E is like a Charlie Chaplin movie brought into the 21st... well, actually, 28th century. It has a definite Chaplin ""Little Tramp"" feel to it.<br/><br/>What sound it does have is extraordinary. The score is probably the best of the year, though I swear I heard music cues from all kinds of other films, from Indiana Jones to Star Wars to composer Thomas Newman's own American Beauty. Ben Burtt, Lucasfilm soundman extraordinaire, crafts the beautiful sounds that carry the film, so it's fitting that he also gets to provide the voice of Wall-E himself. It's easy to overlook the contribution and the pure beauty of the sound, as well as the outstanding animation. We've come to just expect greatness from Pixar, plus it's so perfect, you just don't even notice the technical stuff.<br/><br/>At its heart, though, in spite of its technical achievements, this is THE love story of the year. Wall-E is simply a thing of beauty."
"eekeeley","9","1","3","27 June 2008"," Another Great Pixar Film, if a Little Darker and More Introspective
","Wall-E may not be the best film for a very young kid or people with limited attention spans. The first half of the film has almost no dialogue at all, and watching Wall-E work through his tasks and his loneliness is at times made me a little misty. Who can't feel a tug when watching a robot rock himself to sleep? The G rating is also perhaps a little misleading. The movie isn't violent (except for some struggles with a robot), but it does have a sadness, and a darkness with destroyed Earth, that is perhaps a little much for a young audience.<br/><br/>But Wall-E is a beautiful film, wonderfully animated. The scenery, particularly in space, is gorgeous, and Wall-E's simple, sweet love story with Eve really is touching. His attempts to understand his world and his feelings for Eve, a somewhat temperamental and driven bot, are extremely touching, and there's something absolutely magical about his eyes, a life there I don't think Pixar even mastered with Finding Nemo.<br/><br/>Wall-E has plenty of slapstick humor, tons of cultural and Pixar-specific references to keep the trivia players happy, and the usual great animation, but I do think the most striking thing and the most memorable image of the movie is Space reflected in Wall-E's eyes. He really is an animation that inspires wonder."

","WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-class) is the last of a series of machines left to clean up humanity's mess. But this is a sponsored mess, courtesy of friendly-neighborhood planet-seizing corporate titan ""Buy 'N Large"", whose corporate logo nearly covers the waste-ridden landscape. WALL-E rather cheerfully goes about his ""directive"" to the tune of his favorite film, 1969 Technicolor bombast ""Hello, Dolly!"". His well-developed personality combined with repeat viewings of the musical practically set the stage for the entrance of EVE(an ""Environmental Vegetation Evaluator"", maybe?), who literally blasts her way into his environment, looking for signs of organic life. When WALL-E presents his houseplant to her, EVE hits a mission accomplished mode, and the road to fireworks is paved.<br/><br/>Your circuit board's dead if you don't get a spark from this one. As effective as the somewhat chilling views of the ravaged earth are, along with what the long space-borne human race has become, adventure and intrigue take a firm back seat to romance. Chick-flick? Sure it is. Proof? PIXAR has truly managed to forge new territory in getting women and teenage girls, like the ones in my showing, to weep over a couple of machines. I admit, this central love story is heart-felt, as even the survival of our species is less important to us than whether EVE and WALL-E will end up together. And will they? You'll just have to go see it. This is a very good time at your theater.<br/><br/>As much fun as the movie is, the opening short may very well be even better!

First: there was the fact that they had a cockroach as WALL*E's companion. I realize the joke was that cockroaches can survive a nuclear attack, but they still require food. This means that there was some sort of organic life on Earth. Second: If we keep up our trash output at 220 million tons of trash, we would only be able to fill 140 square miles and a volume of 210 square miles. That's not even the size of Rhode Island. The only reason we have to recycle is because we put tons of money into it and now it's a huge industry that brings in a ton of money that causes more harm than good.

"schafer100","7","2","11","2 July 2008"," What are you getting paid ... a 9.2 average???
","Let's get real here, and critique the film. I read many of these reviews before seeing it, so I had every intention of seeing a terrible film and ultimately tearing it to shreds in my review. Are you one of those people that go to the movies with bad reviews because those are usually the ""good"" ones? Well, that's me, but I cannot rip this film. Is it the next Casablanca? Of course not, unless your critique is based solely upon visual effects. This is no cartoon and I'm not sure a child will even retain interest throughout the film. Giving this film a ten leaves no room for a better film ... so you people are saying this is among the best films you have ever witnessed in your life? We might as well get rid of actors and actresses ... who needs them? Sorry, but please get realistic. I am being extremely generous with a 7. OK, that behind me, here goes ...<br/><br/>The characters are inanimate objects. The humans don't play much of a role, though they are pertinent to the film. This is not a spoiler, but watch carefully early on, to see what WALL-E stands for (I already forgot, and makes for good trivia - same goes for EVE). The plot has been around the block a few times, to say the least, nothing new there. The film does have a way of drawing you in and making the characters alive and believable. The high tech visual effects of today's day and age are partly responsible for that, but it's more. An excellent job is done through sound and vision to display feelings in these objects, at the right moment and with just the right touch. Yeah, that's right. A rusty old trash compactor does almost as good a job as Richard Gere in a love scene ... Don't worry Mom and Dad, there's no nudity or explicit sex scene. Use your own imagination.<br/><br/>A great film will pull you in and hold you on the edge of your seat right through to the end. You won't allow yourself to miss a single word spoken. You won't allow yourself to miss a single scene. You can watch a great film over and over and once again find yourself on the edge of your seat, as if it is the first time. How many films do that for you? I am 50 years old and have viewed many films, yet I can count the qualifying 10's on my fingers. This film has a way of pulling you in and then dropping you repeatedly. You will see what I mean. It's a very good film and I enjoyed it very much, but a classic of all time? A 10? Hardly.<br/><br/>For a fun time, for great visual effects, for a good all around film, it is a must see. I did walk out of the theater feeling good about the film, and that to me, is what movie viewing is all about."
"Turfseer","7","2","11","28 June 2008"," A feast for the eyes
","Wall-e has a great concept: Due to the toxic effects of unchecked consumerism, earth becomes a dead planet and humans find themselves in a giant pleasure ship run by robots. This is perhaps the first film I've seen in a long time that takes the politically incorrect position that obesity is not a good thing. In the future, people have all become obese. They sit in pleasure chairs and mindlessly move around the ship on a conveyor belt of sorts, eating junk food and slurping drinks you would find at any fast food outlet today. Giant electronic billboards broadcast news about the latest products and the people of tomorrow all are in a great stupor.<br/><br/>Meanwhile back on earth, Wall-e is the last functional robot, a waste compactor assigned to clean up the trash left behind. Earth is a dead planet and the people of earth have fled since nothing can grow there anymore. The mother ship sends out probes searching for signs of life. One such probe is ""Eve"" who Wall-e befriends and then falls in love with. Wall-e ends up finding a small plant which he gives to Eve as a gift. This is the 'evidence' that the humans have been looking for. Now earth is capable of supporting life again and the humans may return. Eve returns to the mother ship with the plant but Wall-e, love stricken, must follow her too. Eventually, the ship's computer confirms that earth can now support life again but not before the robot in charge of guiding the ship revolts at returning and struggles with the human captain for control. The Human Captain finally realizes how great it is to be on earth, gains control of the ship from the rebel robots and brings the mother ship back to earth. Wall-e, damaged from the fight with the rebel robots, is restored to his former self by Eve, who finds some replacement parts, and they live happily ever after. <br/><br/>One cannot describe the inventiveness of the animation here. It is truly phenomenal. The effects are dazzling. But one feels that after awhile, some of the scenes are a bit repetitious. For example, there is this small robot who is assigned to cleaning up all the 'foreign contaminants' it finds within the mother ship. The cleanup scenes by this robot are overdone. Similarly, Eve's penchant for blasting anything that gets in her way becomes a little tiresome. Instead of one of two blasting sessions, we get about ten. Act I goes on a little too long. We should have Wall-e get on his adventure sooner (i.e., when he attaches himself to the ship and finds himself in outer space). Another weakness of the script is that the antagonist is not identified clearly enough into much later in the film. Halfway through, the robot controlling the ship suddenly becomes malevolent. That should have been established earlier. In addition, it was a little too easy for the Human Captain to suddenly ""see the light"" and regain his humanity. <br/><br/>Wall-e is in the end, an enjoyable but somewhat sentimental love story between two robots. Its human characters are drawn more as comic relief. Had the screenwriters drawn the humans as a bit more multi-dimensional, this could have been a more compelling film. As a romance, Wall-e is cute and sweet. But the overall story will be favored more by comic book aficionados. Walle's dazzling special effects create on a visual level, a feast for the eyes which must be seen."

","OK well first of all I am a 21 yr old that is a die hard Pixar fan. I think their animation is absolutely incredible, they manage to bring inanimate objects to life, and they usually have great stories and conclusive ""take home"" messages with them that you should apply to real life. That being said, I feel Wall-e came up short and I will explain why.<br/><br/>The way I grade the score is in 4 parts: Animation: 2.5 Plot: .5 Characters: 2.5 Lasting appeal: .5 That adds up to a 6/10. I walked out of my first pixar movie not smiling or extremely excited and it left me sort of lingering. The problem I noticed *warning spoiler* was the whole cruise ship ordeal. It seems that they spent a lot of time just running around a cruise ship which took away tons of film time for an actual plot. To add to it, I feel that the ""cruise ship"" as they were trying to portray it as is in no stretch of the words an actual ""cruise ship."" They are just a bunch of overly obese mind-controlled individuals that fly around on a chair with only amenities like food, drink, and pools they never knew they had when they were controlled. I felt very puzzled and lost with the entire concept of this cruise ship and of course I had to wonder how stupid those people had to be to end up controlled as they were...it seemed a little to fake if you ask me. I think we all are starting to become programmed actually lol to love pixar movies. I think they had a very good plan in mind with this storyline with the corruption of planet earth and what we should do to protect it, but it seemed like they were trying to fill white space if you ask me.<br/><br/>Good side: I LOVED Walllllllllll-e and Eve! I actually wished they spent the entire 2 hrs of film time just doing a romantic movie with those two. Think about it...you have a simplistic robot that is programmed to do a garbage job on Earth, but is fascinated when he comes across new products (spoiler: Wall-e had my rotfl when he was putting the spork away and couldn't decide whether to put it with the spoon or fork section) found in the rubble plus he wishes he had a soul mate and ventured into other planets in space....and you have Eve that is a complete opposite...she is 700 yrs evolved robot with advanced targeting systems, she has no comprehension of what planets are like, etc. Two complete opposites, two robots (one with human feeling -Wall*e- and one that learns to feel -Eve-), joined by one kiss (the electric spark)...I mean how perfect.<br/><br/>Of course the animation was amazing...you have the best most brilliant minds working for Pixar and you don't expect anything less than pure perfection. At the end of the day, I could not see myself owning this movie...it was dull enough where seeing it once left me wanting more.<br/><br/>The irony of it all is that 'Presto', the short filmed played before the movie was FANTASTIC. I loved every second of it. Funny, creative, interesting, and the funniest bunny ever! Another note: Everyone knows that Dreamworks and Pixar are constantly in a battle with each other...they are the new coca-cola & pepsi....and here I thought Kung Fu Panda was going to be a joke from the previews...but I honestly thought that movie was incredible. Fantastic animation put together, very original & interesting storyline throughout the entire movie, characters you really could get into and attached, and action packed. I was very surprised...I thought it was strictly a kids movie, but I decided to give it a try and I give Dreamworks my vote for this years animation.<br/><br/>Care to talk about it...dogg2727@hotmail.com Enjoy everybody Eddie"

","WALL·E is a digitally animated film about the last functioning robot on Earth tasked with cleaning up the planet after mankind destroyed the environment and was drowned by consumerism. With garbage piling up and no where else to go, humanity abandoned the planet and programmed small robots to clean up the mess. In his isolation, WALL·E has developed a unique personality. He cleans up garbage by day and watches musicals on an old TV by night. Then everything changes when EVE arrives, another robot sent to scan for life on Earth in the hope that humanity can return to the planet they ruined. The film is an entertaining children's movie, but it's also overtly political with a strong critique not only of the wastefulness of consumerism, but also the self-destructive nature of capitalism itself. The fictitious corporation Buy-N-Large is featured throughout the film, and it's the only company shown in an obvious satire of the way corporations expand to destroy their competition (and the rest of the world in the process). WALL·E is filled with heart and ultimately hope, and it demonstrates the power of cinema to say something important without losing sight of entertainment."

These people are normally very narrow-minded. Don't listen to them. While the main characters rarely talk except for when they call out each other's names, there really is no need for dialog, if you think about it. The story is told through the well-orchestrated music, the characters' expressions, their actions, and the stunning visuals and landscapes. You don't need a ton of dialog to tell a story. Just look at the old silent films!<br/><br/>WALL-E is an incredible, beautiful movie. It has everything Hollywood should be striving for every time a movie is in production: great story, lovable characters, true emotions, and lovingly-crafted visuals.

Among his daily discoveries, the most important is a small plant. Wall-E's days of loneliness are over when he meets his new friend Eve (voice of Elissa Knight). Eve's one goal is to find signs of life on Earth. Hesitantly, she warms up to Wall-E, as he shows her everything Earth once was.

Wall-E sneaks aboard and follows her back. There he finds the creatures that created him, now obese and lazy.

People are beginning to rely on technology more and more each day. The consequences of this has lead to a more sedentary lifestyle. Until recently, people were not aware of how much pollution was taking place on a daily basis. Pollution is still taking place, but an effort has been made to start recycling. Reusable bags are now popular within grocery stores. Television and the internet give helpful tips on how to ""Go Green."""

","Another fine release in Pixars growing and already impressive collection of 3D generated movies. I have to say i liked the rat better, but this one starts superbly.

That computers here have personalities, therefore, isn't a problem ( and shouldn't be, more so then when animals talk or sing in other movies) because the filmmakers establishes it early on.<br/><br/>Its still probably wise to start the film of slowly to let us grow accumulated to this. And they do. He is quite adorable (""adorable"", did i just say that) The way the film creators make us feel for him, his world and his struggle. And when they introduce Eve things really starts to hit off. A love story between robots. A love story between two mute robots (more or less). A love story between two mute robots in children's film. I was sold. I though it was magical and gutsy.<br/><br/>Maybe that explains why i didn't fully engage in the rest of the film. I mean, i liked the rest, the parts in the spaceship with the humans. There are some nice thoughts here and anti-authority thinking that i guess are wort wile. And off course the part with Eve and Wall-E in space.

","This is a good movie. It's a movie you can watch with your kids or you can watch it alone. It has something the kids will enjoy and something adults will enjoy. Its funny without being crude. There is a positive storyline with a happy ending. It has enough action to keep your interest. There is enough originality to keep it fresh. <br/><br/>A couple of things to look for in the movie:<br/><br/>Look at the portraits of the Ship's Captains and note their change in size.<br/><br/>Look at the color of the Earth from space.<br/><br/>As usual the award winning Pixar animation is very good. The musical score is excellent. This is a movie I could see again.<br/><br/>I like it but I can see how some won't. Those that like Finding Nemo and Ratatouille will probably like Wall-E."

","I like many of the Disney Pixar films that have come out, so I couldn't resist this latest helping from the successful creators of Toy Story and Monsters, Inc., from director Andrew Stanton (Finding Nemo). In the distant future (and if we're not careful, possible to happen) mankind has left the Earth because of the planet being completely covered with trash from products of powerful multi-national Buy N Large corporation. Alone on this planet is little garbage collecting robot WALL·E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-class) (Ben Burtt) cleaning up the mess, a robot with a personality, fascinated with much of the human items in the pile of rubbish. One day, WALL·E finds a plant growing, and not too long after, a ship carrying EVE (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator) (Elissa Knight), a probe-droid, looking for signs of life shows up. It is when EVE sees the plant found by WALL·E that the ship comes back to collect ""her"", and out hero follows her all the way to the space cruise city ship with all humans evacuated 700 years ago. All humans by the way eat meals from a straw and are carried by hover chairs as they have become large with laziness, and losing bones, so they can barely move. EVE is determined to get the plant to the Captain (Jeff Garlin), who is fascinated by Earth after the brief good news, which comes to life again when he knows life on Earth can exist. The ship's computer AUTO (MacInTalk, a talking technology created by Apple), obviously inspired by HAL 9000 in 2001: A Space Odyssey, is determined to stop the Captain taking everyone back to Earth, so it is up to WALL·E and EVE to save the day. Also starring American Pie: The Wedding's Fred Willard (the real one) as Shelby Forthright - BnL CEO, John Ratzenberger as John, Kathy Najimy as Mary and Sigourney Weaver as Ship's Computer. The animation and effects of this film, including my favourite sight of space, are extraordinary, and of course WALL·E is a great robot who without speaking (like Dumbo) can be lovable, a great family film. It won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, and it was nominated the Oscar for Best Music for Thomas Newman, Best Song for ""Down to Earth"" (also nominated the Golden Globe), Best Sound, Best Sound Editing and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it won the BAFTA for Best Animated Film and the BAFTA Children's Award for Best Feature Film, and it was nominated for Best Music and Best Sound, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Animated Feature Film, and it was nominated for Best Original Song for ""Down to Earth"", and it won the National Movie Award for Best Family Film.

","""ROBOTS?! I mean, how lame is that? Pixar's definitely done it this time.""<br/><br/>That was my initial reaction when I heard about WALL-E, and reasonably so. Yet, being the faithful Pixar fan I was, I waited eagerly for its release and didn't let the skepticism totally get to me. <br/><br/>So it was with a lot of anticipation after hearing endless good reviews, and also with a grain of doubt that I sat to see the movie. The first few minutes were spent marveling at the breathtaking animation which made the lifeless and trash-laden earth look so real that it had me squirming in my seat out of guilt.<br/><br/>Beginning in the early 22nd century, the movie is about how BuynLarge, a huge corporation, guides the entire human population into outer space via the'Axiom', while leaving the planet covered in waste & garbage. Fast forward to 700 years later, and we first meet the cutest robot on earth - quite literally, since he is the only thing left on the planet, save for a few roaches - ""Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class"" or WALL-E. Enter EVE, or Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator, who, as the name suggests, is on the lookout for plant life outside the flagship. That's where the entire story actually takes off, though audiences aren't given the chance to get bored from the beginning of the movie.<br/><br/>Soon my attention shifted from going gaga over WALL-E's cuteness to enjoying the entire movie. From EVE's arrival to the journey to Axiom, from the Captain's first scene to the wonderful end, there was hardly a moment when the movie faltered. Animation - characteristically perfect. Story- Excellent. 'Acting' - Awesome. Rated G and family friendly. As for CF (or 'Cute' Factor),WALL-E's scooping away all the awards in that category hands down. What more can you ask for?<br/><br/>As always, the studio has outdone itself and made it almost impossible for moviegoers to declare just one Pixar animation masterpiece as their favorite. And, for some reason, I'm not surprised. <br/><br/>10/10 all the way<br/><br/>Can't wait for 'Up'!"

","Greetings again from the darkness. Never got around to seeing this one in the theatre, mostly because an auditorium full of kids makes it genetically impossible for me to relax and concentrate on a movie. Very disappointed now that I didn't make the risky trek.<br/><br/>Pixar, and director Andrew Stanton (Finding Nemo, A Bug's Life) have somehow taken another step forward in their remarkable animation process. This time we are treated to a warning about our consumptive lifestyle and, even better, a cute little love story.<br/><br/>Finding inspiration from an unlikely source - Hello Dolly! VHS tape, Wall-E interprets holding hands as the ultimate level of connection and intimacy. Guess that's what 700 years of picking up trash will do to you. Seriously, the point that a simple gesture is the ultimate connection between two people was once the standard.<br/><br/>Seeing the human race lounge around on hover-loungers while taking consumption to a whole new level was funny at first, but then very sad as you realize that's not such a big step from today's kids who eat fast food and play hours of video games, while playtime and physical activity is legislated out of schools.<br/><br/>Staying away from the lecture podium, I will say that this is a remarkable animation film, and beyond that a very fine film period. I am confused how kids in the 7-12 age group connect with the two leads, because they just aren't very vocal ... they communicate through emotions (not an easy thing for robots!). But for everyone over 12, the message and delivery are stunning."

","Wall·E tells the story of an intelligent robot called Wall·E who cleans all the rubbish on the earth in around 2800 when human beings have moved to a spaceship since the environment there is too severe and unpleasant to support them.After many years' lonely working, Wall·E meets a female robot sent to earth on a mission to find out a living thing. The interesting plot then unfolds.<br/><br/>At first, for roughly half an hour, there is no conversation. Therefore I felt so bored that was eager to stop watching it. However, since I hate to watch bloody or horrible or expected films and there were little choices, I struggled to go on. Luckily, the film attracted me immediately Eve---the female robot---appears.<br/><br/>What surprises me most is the love between these two robots. It is impossible between robots existing at present. Thus the extremely advanced technologies compel my admiration. In addition, Eve is so attractive that I am fond of her very much, not to mention Wall·E. Eve is also very neat while Wall·E seems to be too dirty. However it does not mean that Wall·E is a little disgusting. Maybe the old and dirty appearance can let his spirits be showed better. Anyway Eve is extremely clean and beautiful.<br/><br/>What also impresses me deeply with is the scene which is two-dimensional animation after the film. They are so creative that I admire the designer very much.<br/><br/>PS: I forgot to say how I were touched when I saw Wall·E tried to protect the green plant in spite of his life. Though this kind of plot is common is the films, I still believe this kind of spirit should let us reconsider our lives. In addition, when I watched the computer in the spaceship persisted regardless of the captain's will, I reckon a world full of intelligent machines will have some serious problems."
"bkimbrell0","10","1","4","9 January 2009"," WallE (2008)
","Every once in a while, a film comes along that has the power to dramatically change the lives of those who take it in, and it becomes a part of their being. These are films that transcend film to become something more; I call them masterpieces. Masterpieces do not come around every year; they can't, because that would defeat the purpose of the label. 2008 was blessed with one such film. It is called WALLE. WALLE is a story that I still find difficult to actually summarize, but here is my attempt. Set in the twenty-ninth century, planet Earth has become a literal garbage dump, a silent, desolate habitat with wind that seems to scream, and massive dust storms of undisclosed origin. For 700 years, one lone robot named WALLE has been staidly doing its job, unaware of the futility of it all, cleaning up the mess the human race left on the once-beautiful planet. The film's opening act, set on this desert planet, ironically ends up being its most beautiful, filled with simple elegance, and completely devoid of conventional dialogue. Enter EVE, a highly advanced robot of the far future on a classified and mysterious search mission, who captivates our human-like title character with her grace. Ultimately, as EVE finds what she is looking for and is prepared to blast off, leaving WALLE alone forever, he realizes that to allow her to leave unaccompanied would be to lose what is most important to him, a chance he will never again see for as long as he remains chained to the Earth.<br/><br/>WALLE is a story about redemption, humanity, love, and growth. In addition to its beautiful and haunting first act, the story continues as our main characters find themselves thrust unwittingly, and unknowingly, into a situation that decides the ultimate fate of the human race: Will the human race remain in a perpetual state of de-evolution until the last human being withers away and dies, or will the human-like robots ironically be the saviors of all mankind? The film tackles bold topics such as the dangers of apathy towards our planet, decline of interpersonal communication, overconsumption, governmental corruption, irresponsible big business, and the ultimate rebirth of civilization. WALLE ranks among the most genuine, human, important, and heartfelt films in the history of cinema. What it does it does passionately, with as much meticulous attention to detail as you will ever find in film. No other film this year came close to WALLE in terms of originality, boldness, innovativeness, character development, or intelligence. WALLE is never pretentious, never overstated, too esoteric, or too inaccessible; it remains a beautiful piece of cinema that will continue to captivate audiences for generations, and outlast every other film of 2008. And did I mention that it's animated? <br/><br/>10/10"

And since there was nothing to do at home and it was kind of sad to see only the two of them watching it, I decided to tag along. The first parts of the movie were dry, if you know what I mean, it was all dust and rust and I was about to get sick until Eve came to the scene.

","Even if you're not a typical Pixar fan, I urge you to see this masterpiece!<br/><br/>I've been watching and enjoying Pixar films since Toy Story. As a child, I loved the action and humor. But what is so impressive to me is Pixar's ability to create films appearing to be geared towards children, but also being geared towards the parents who take their kids to the movie.<br/><br/>At age 18, I saw WALL-E in theatres after being thoroughly impressed by the beautiful trailers. All I can saw is that I was blown away.<br/><br/>This has to be Pixar's most beautiful, touching film to date, as well as (what I think) to be one of the most poignant, honest stories in film this year. The first 20 minutes, while it contains no dialogue, is utterly endearing. I fell in love with the little robot in the first 5 minutes, finding myself saying ""Aww!"" at everything he did. And after the initial shock of his cute factor, I took the time to look at the environment around him. What BEAUTIFUL animation! This is not only a film, but art.<br/><br/>I will say this has to be the darkest of Pixar's films, but only if you dig a little while watching it. For a child, it will be entertaining. For adults, it has the ability to bring tears to your eyes.<br/><br/>I urge everyone to watch what I think is the most poignant, honest love stories to hit the theatre recently. It is truly a work of art."
"oscarfanatic","10","1","4","25 December 2008"," Wow-E!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","Wall-E is a breathtaking piece of art that still continues to amaze me after three views.<br/><br/>Being, I think, the most ambitious Pixar movie to date, Wall-E succeeds as a children's film, shot through with well-placed, sincerely funny comedy; it also succeeds on an adult level as well. Besides being one of the most gorgeous movies I have seen in a while, it gives such a good message, one that is clear and relevant today and will continue to be relevant.<br/><br/>Wall-E may go down in the history books as the cutest character ever to be imagined for the big screen. With his love of Hello Dolly! and all things quirky, he develops throughout the film such a rich personality and becomes a really and truly lovable character. Once Eve comes into the picture, Wall-E lights up with love. With the very funny experiences that Eve and Wall-E share together, they make for probably the most romantic screen coupling of 2008.<br/><br/>Such a very good voice cast as well, with extreme props going to John Ratzenberger, who has shown himself to be fantastically suited for the animated genre. Roger Deakins provided the cinematographic concepts for film, and I would say this has to be his best work this year. Each shot shows just exactly what it needs to, and does so beautifully. Deakins tops his previous work with every film he does, proving over and over again that absolutely no one can make a film look half as good as he can.<br/><br/>Thomas Newman is a musical genius, providing themes throughout that suit the story and work to entrance the viewer. Musical score adds so much richness to a film , and this one does so grandly. Peter Gabriel provides a lovely song, Down to Earth, at the end credits that I believe is very appropriate and well written.<br/><br/>As far as the Oscars go: I hope they can lose their reservations about nominating animated films in the best picture category and place this film where it rightfully belongs. The only animated film ever to be nominated in the best picture category was The Beauty and the Beast. It deserved it, but so many animated films have. The Lion King? Ratatouille? Really... please, Academy. Acknowledge that animation is quickly becoming the smartest, freshest, and most accessible genre! Easily a 10 out of 10 for an absolute symphony of a film!"

Thinking there is something more out there and that he is missing something. Then out of the blue a futuristic robot named E.V.E. resembles a crystal clean white IPod robot shows up with her own objectives. Which then leads to WallE going into space and beyond, and finds out he is more important then ever.<br/><br/>My Spiel: I really don't want to give this movie away. This actually is a touching story of how we might see are self's (Human Race) in the future, and how all might have been lost without the help of a little old robot to show us. From a animation/story stand point this movie is a step above about anything else Pixar has come out with. I really liked the position/style of how you honestly felt sorry for these robots with human emotions. Something the people at Pixar do a great job of making you fall in love with their characters (Cars, Monsters, and Fish). I truly urge any one to see this movie, but I honestly believe this story is set for the adult age, granted it has all the children elements, but there were 3 little girl's in the theater when I saw this and they spent most of the time running around and out of hearing distance, and obviously lost attention in this movie. But don't let that scare you away from seeing this, WallE is a great movie for a person like me if it makes children leave and not bother you is A's in my book! But fear not this movie really had a tremendous story that was much greater then just one character, which was truly amazing and had something I could completely get behind!

WallE (2008) Review: 9/10"
"winner55","7","1","4","7 December 2008"," half a great sci-fi film
","I had to think a while before writing this. There is a central problem to the film, just taken as a computer-graphic animation feature, that no one seems to have noticed - namely the animation in the second half of the film is nowhere near as good as that of the first half, and seems to have been accomplished with a lower budget and lowered aspirations on the part of the animators. The important visual cue here is the presentation of EVE who becomes virtually two-dimensional once inside of the mother-ship.<br/><br/>This odd division in quality seems to be directly connected to the two-part structure of the story (one part Earth, one part space-ship). The first half of the film is a complicated piece of science-fiction, similar to the best of the genre we remember from the 1960s golden age of The Twighlight Zone, of the original Planet of the Apes and maybe 2001, and the novels of Azimov and Phillip K. Dick. Wall-E, the garbage collecting robot, has not only survived all similar robots (who apparently failed from exhaustion), ""he"" has evolved, and now learns how to survive, and in the process develops a real personality - one capable of longing for something more, specifically contact with his own ""species."" That transits easily into a new narrative as Wall-E encounters another, newer model robot who is still on the lower end of the AI learning curve.<br/><br/>Once the story arrives at the space-ship, everything changes. For one thing, Wall-E himself gets displaced from the center of the story. EVE's AI evolution takes an inexplicable quantum leap, and she ends up behaving in a completely human way, which Wall-E to the last never does. The story then reduces to simple action-thriller in a fantasy mode and the element of character development - which is what really drives the first half - gets lost. The theme also degenerates. The implicit satire on the human race in the first half of the film is made explicit, but in this loses much of its bite. The humans vicious enough to destroy the Earth's eco-system are now simply silly in their pampered decay.<br/><br/>Still, the dynamism of the first half is strong enough to carry us through the second half. The story loses credibility, but we are too concerned for the fate of our heroes to care much about that. And that concern alerts us to the real strengths of the first half of the film. It's not easy to grow to love an expressionless box on tractor-treads, but that's what the first half of the film gets from us. If only the film makers had been wise enough and bold enough to recognize this and develop a stronger second half derived from this awareness."

This movie has everything and is a perfect family entertainer.<br/><br/>The way Disney-Pixar showcased Wall-E and Eve's personality, one can't help falling in love with the characters. They are just too cute (even the minor ones like Walle-E's pet Cockroach).<br/><br/>I personally believe that this movie is the best cartoon ever made by Disney-Pixar or anybody else for that matter.

"margo-wigmore","10","1","4","3 December 2008"," WALL-E is my favorite Disney/Pixar Animation to date!!
","Okay, so I agree with many other reviewers and also found WALL-E to be absolutely wonderful and the most adorable Disney/Pixar film to date! I've seen it about 3 times already and just rented it a week ago. WALL-E and EVE's interaction and with one of my other favorite characters, MO, is just priceless, not to mention WALL-E's personality all together! I LOVE that they've made him into such an adorable (as adorable as a 'robot trash compactor' can get), love-sick, 'toy/gaget collector, pack rat' in such a friendly and child-like way! It's so awesome how his 'daily' routine mimics how humans can be as well ~ like taking off his 'shoes (tread) )and putting them away and even picking out something from it because it annoys him that it's there, then being soo tired in the morning that he can't seem to function to put his 'shoes' back on! :D Also, it's wonderful to how he's compassionate and how he reacts to things such as when he thinks he's killed his pet bug (which he seems to treat like a pet dog. :D) but is happy when he survives.<br/><br/>I did recognize a bunch of other things in the movie that tie in to other movies or items such as the MAC boot up sound WALL-E makes when he's fully charged ~ the iPod he uses to watch his movie ~ in visual ways and in the sounds he makes, I am reminded of other characters like R2D2 from STAR WARS (sounds he makes), Robot from Short Circuit movie (visual), ET (sounds he makes), the way the ship tilts and all the people go sliding (visually of the TITANIC), the ways in which EVE discovers certain items that WALL-E has collected, but he never knew what they did or what they do (like the light bulb or Zippo lighter) ~ those couple aspects do help to reiterate the fact that he's more primitive and she's high-tech.<br/><br/>It's all just a very fun loving movie! It is great that I feel like a kid again watching it. :) Also, love the upbeat music, the ways in which WALL-E tries to show his affection for EVE (creating the 'sculpture' of her, for her), how he wants to hold hands with her all the time.<br/><br/>A few of my absolute favorite parts (other than what I've already mentioned ~ b/c in general I just ADORE this animation!) are when he first meets EVE and they are trying to communicate their names to one another, when MO first meets WALL-E and he tries to clean up the little tread marks he keeps leaving and when MO's cleaned the mark for like the 2nd time, WALL-E makes a mark on MO's forehead and MO doesn't know what to do about it! :D When MO realizes that there's a lot of tread to clean up, but it's off the 'direct' path that he's used to traveling on, I love that he 'rebels' and jumps off the track and then goes about his cleaning. It shows that he has a 'heart' too and he's not just a 'drone' like the other robots. Also, love the part when WALL-E and MO introduce themselves to one another. Then of course, adore the ending when EVE puts WALL-E back together and she does all she can to get him to 'remember'. Love how WALL-E is big into 'wavy' at everyone and how some of the robots learn to wave back. Cute, cute, cute!! Just the entire film. I could probably recite the whole thing after only seeing it 3 x! haha. Though, I'm sure that there's something new to discover each time. So, I intend to purchase the DVD for sure! This film really is one for ALL ages! It gets a 10 out of 10 from me! Yes, okay, maybe it seems little 'much', but it's just one of those 'fun' things....my boyfriend and I ended up getting the WALL-E interactive toy the other day. It's just something fun to have around...and we can share with those that come over.<br/><br/>Thank you Disney/Pixar for creating such a joyous film! :D"

Somehow the determined and dutiful Wall-E is left alone on this futuristic world. Monotony in his routine is broken when a sleek search robot named Eve(voiced by Elissa Knight)has Wall-E falling in love and joining her on a brisk journey across the universe.<br/><br/>Fantastic animation sustained by a strong score of original music from Thomas Newman. The cast also includes the voices of familiar stars like: John Ratzenberger, Sigourney Weaver, Kathy Najimy and Jeff Garlin. WALL-E is fun for all ages."
"beccad90","8","1","4","22 October 2008"," ""...Pixar May Have Very Well Outdid Itself This Time...""
","From the time Pixar debuted their first full-length animated film, ""Toy Story"" in 1995, a genre was born and technology began to pop up in the cinema. Almost Fifteen years and 9 films later, Pixar rules the roost of computer-animated films that it inspired. But, with it's latest film, Wall-E, Pixar has broken it's traditional mold, incorporating live action footage with state-of-the-art computer animation with objects and characters that look so realistic, you can touch them.<br/><br/>Onto the story. Wall-E, as everyone has said, is a romantic story at heart. Definitely true. The two main characters, who get most of the screen time (and use it wonderfully), are: Wall-E, a childlike robot that lives on Earth after all the humans left, making junk into priceless treasures; and EVE, a beautiful 'directive' that searches for signs of life and, instead, finds Wall-E. The two venture into space to discover a long-lost secret left on earth. (I'm not gonna give away too much of the plot).<br/><br/>The way that they used less dialogue and more visual appeal, they were able to convey emotional depth through expression, which I really like (Yes, I'm a sucker for visuals and art, I know).<br/><br/>To conclude, I must say that with all the hype that this movie has received, Pixar may very well have outdone itself this time around with this masterpiece."
"ed_two_o_nine","10","1","4","5 October 2008"," Pixar's Greatest Achievement
","This put simply is a stunning film. A triumph on every level imaginable. Animation to make your jaw drop (Pixar raising the bar once again) tied to a great story (ok the green message is a little preachy) with little to no wasted scenes and what we have here is arguably the greatest CG animated movie ever made and quite possibly one of the greatest animated movies of all times. It was very bold of Pixar to move away from their tried and trusted buddy movie formula, and even bolder to make a movie which is for the most part a silent film. The humans' only enter the third and weakest act of the movie and then probably draw away from the always captivating Wall-e and Eve. The simple premise of the movie is that of Wall-e a robot whose sole purpose is to clean up the mess of the earth they abandoned long ago. Wall-e has a fascination for all things human which we are not sure where this comes from? Is this the result of circuits malfunctioning of just a loneliness from apparently being the last working robot left on earth? All we see is Wall-e one relationship he has is with his pet cockroach. This in it's self could probably carry the movie, bit when you add the relationship Wall-e eventually strikes up with the Female robot sent on a mission to earth (Eve) you really do get cinema magic that captivated the whole of the cinema I saw the movie in, from adults to the full range of children. Andrew Stanton has at this point an impeccable record off delivering films of the highest quality and if he did not work under the Pixar umbrella would probably receive a more star billing that his output deserves. This is that one off. A movie for the ages pure brilliance. Oh and to top if of the short that accompanies is 'Presto' is brilliant as well. Pixar's homage to Loony Tunes reminds us of the crime that we get in not seeing those classics on TV anymore and have to put up with pony modern versions of them."
"marzzmanton","10","1","4","22 August 2008"," Cinema at its best; more emotion and subtle details than in any other motion picture!
","Where can I start describing this movie; maybe it's best to start with describing how incredibly impressive the emotional character set Wall-e possesses actually is. With so many gestures, slight facial movements, tones in his utterly genius voice (Ben Burtt) and postures it is so hard not to love him. The character completely swept me up and the entire audience in the cinema with me at that time.<br/><br/>The story is flawless as far as any animation film goes and really gives you a grim showing of what we are 'doing' to mother earth in a rather rapid and undesirable way. The intro is strong and some scenes with Wall-E and his cricket pet already give you a hint of what quality the story and scenario writers at Pixar possess. Let alone the incredible character set with robots like M-O & Auto to fill the gaps.<br/><br/>The balance between Eve and Wall-E is awesome, made me smile so so many times in such a heart warming way. Man I sound like a sob here; but this movie has so much to offer it makes you feel completely bound to Wall-E and his emotions and creates an understanding that enriches the film beyond so many others of its ilk. I think it straight out deserves a 10 as far as any animation goes - I have watched it two times in the cinema since then and it gives me an incredible happy and 'beautiful life' feeling every time I get up from my seat.<br/><br/>Pixar, I take my hat off to you - you really enriched my life with just a few hours of my time. Truly go and watch it, you'll love Wall-E for it."

","I had heard that this was a good film, but until i saw it myself i really didn't expect it to be as brilliant as it was. Without giving anything away, this is a film about a lonely robot who is looking for something to live for.<br/><br/>In a time when all we see and hear about on the news is hate and war, it is quite easy to forget how beautiful the world and life itself can be. This film is here to remind us all of that, and it does so in such a unique way.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film to absolutely anyone... It's funny, visually brilliant and something that will stay with you for years to come."
"MuchTooDutch","10","1","4","20 August 2008"," Robotic romance, one spark at a time.
","A Home and a Hobby by Bryce VanKooten Whenever it happens, I'm usually just staring. It usually comes right around midway through and I don't take my eyes off the screen till it's done  right on through the credits. It's only about once every decade or so that a film breaks out of its genre with the ferocity to be remembered as something more. Braveheart became one of the greatest romances of its generation. Saving Private Ryan, despite its violence, transcended its audience and brought highly charged drama  along with its bullets  to the big screen. It's becoming very rare for me to be able to sink into my seat, put a timer on the day's stress and just get lost in a film, let alone an animated one. It's easy to make the connection to animated characters  lovable, hilarious and colorful  but often difficult to transfer that connection to an everyday reality.<br/><br/>WALL-E changed all that.<br/><br/>Pixar's ninth feature film, WALL-E (spelled with a bullet) takes us to the future of Earth, circa the 22nd century, only to show us that our planet has become far too trashy to inhabit. The humans have left on the Axiom  a 'premier, space-cruising starliner' created as an alternative to the wasted existence left back on Earth by Buy-n-Large, the pre-apocalyptic, world-ruling, corporate juggernaut. And as the movie opens, we see the scope of their reach: Buy-n-Large is everywhere. Billboards and buildings, everything holds the Buy-n-Large name  even WALL-E himself. There's little  strike that  there's no dialog throughout the first half hour except for faint 'beeps' and 'blurps' from WALL-E and his best buddy: a nameless, happy-go-lucky Cockroach. Its not long before the theater follows suit  most children awestruck by Wall-E, most parents the same. He is a simple machine with complex emotions. WALL-E is the last of his kind. The sole survivor, programmed to clean up the mess that we left behind  left on Earth to figure it all out.<br/><br/>As the days move on and on (as if the silence wasn't daunting enough), we quickly realize that earth and all its advertisements are completely wasted, nothing worth more than the screens they're projected upon. But WALL-E cruises on, not a care in the world. We can almost hear him on his trek, 'Waste Allocation Load Lifting isn't that bad' as he sings his way from site to home  an abandoned trailer, smack in the middle of it all  surrounded by the waste around him and content with his toys: a spork, a Rubix Cube and a VHS copy of Hello Dolly!. WALL-E's content, that's what it boils down to. He's content with life as is, but can't help but think, like the rest of us, I wonder if there's something else As you can imagine, that something else comes in the form of a true beauty. A futuristic robot named EVE (Earth Vegetation Evaluator), sent to Earth to find plant life. Thus begins the wonderful love story that is WALL-E, the most recent animated creation and without a doubt, my favorite.<br/><br/>WALL-E and EVE's journey over the course of two hours shows us why film is different, why it's the exception to the rule. WALL-E is speechless to the world around him. He doesn't hold much of an opinion on life and the fast-living; he's content where he is. In the day and age we all live, this speak volumes to a discontented world and to me specifically. The silence we heard as WALL-E trampled from one dump to the other was as blissful as a Saturday afternoon  if we get it. Many of us experienced true silence, some of us for the very first time, during the space dance. All sound specifically filtered out of the theater, WALL-E and EVE danced the only way they knew how, leaving us to our own silent pursuits. We sat and stared. We sat and sighed while two robots, hopelessly in love, danced in silent space, while the humans both back on the ship and just off screen tried to learn all about it.<br/><br/>As I watched these robotic eyes and tractor toes, it sort of hit me all at once. I had worked at Disney for the past eight months  WALL-E was near and dear to my heart  while we created the children's books for his summer release. About midway through my third viewing, I realized the simplicity of it all. WALL-E had a home, a friend and a hobby  and he was happy. Truly joyful. How much more do we have? How much more do I need? WALL-E was ready for EVE. She came in his life and filled the only thing he had left: a heart for the taking. It was all cleaned out, ready to be stolen  he'd been preparing for her. He'd been cleaning it up for years."
"Dillypogo","10","1","4","19 August 2008"," Wall-E: Pixar does it again!
","Every so often there comes along an animated film that is both brilliant and funny and also strikes the hearts of millions. One of those is Pixar's Wall-E. Wall-E is a lonely, clumsy robot who spends his day cleaning up the trash that the now-in-space humans left behind and watching a video tape of ""Hello, Dolly."" However, his loneliness ends when he meets a more advanced robot called EVE and falls in love with her. Her arrival on Earth leads to a series of events that involve both her and Wall-E being blasted into space to the spaceship humans are now living in.<br/><br/>The film takes a huge risk by having very little dialogue throughout, but it most certainly manages to pull it off. Wall-E and other robots communicate through beeps created by Star Wars sound designer Ben Burtt. Each robot has its own personality like Wall-E is clumsy and provides most of the humour for the film while EVE is more serious.<br/><br/>There is a lot of humour in Wall-E and it genuinely had me laughing many times throughout. The (sadly HUGELY over-used on TV) clip of Wall-E searching through trash managed to get everyone in the audience laughing. Also, the scene in which Walle-E gets cleaned on the spaceship is absolutely hilarious. There are loads of comedies out there that can get a couple of laughs but are altogether not that funny, but Wall-E is amazingly funny and one of the funniest films I've seen.<br/><br/>I found myself getting emotionally involved with Wall-E right from the beginning of the film. It managed to make me feel sorry for Wall-E's loneliness and - I don't want to give it away - I was on the verge of tears near the end. Unlike many other movies, Wall-E doesn't fail to strike an emotional response from the audience.<br/><br/>Some people have said that Wall-E is the best film Pixar have produced. I can't really comment on this because I haven't seen Cars or Ratatouille, but from the ones I have seen it is for me. None of the other Pixar films got me so emotionally involved or made me laugh as much as Wall-E.<br/><br/>Wall-E is an animated masterpiece and incredibly funny. I give it 10/10."
"planetsurreal","8","1","4","4 August 2008"," Heavyweight Storytelling...Heavyweight Animation...Heavyweight People...
","I must say, I found the cute sincerity of this movie quite affecting. Not only does it manage to have a 'message', it does the really important thing of never seeming like it is preaching to you. A lot of the efforts of Hollywood recently have decided to treat the audience as complete and utter imbeciles who need instructions about whats good and bad shoved down their throats. For many people (e.g. movie goers who gave batman 9 or above) this is the case. Its nice to see that CHILDREN'S ANIMATIONS are now becoming less patronising. Or is it? I don't know.<br/><br/>AS a quick side note; Why is it that when ever you begin a conversation about this film, someone has to do an impression of how wall-e says his own name. It could just be me experiencing this, but its really irritating.<br/><br/>On with the review. This film was quite remarkable. I thought Pixar had lost their way a bit in other efforts that they had recently produced, but this is just fantastic.<br/><br/>The two main characters do not speak anything other than their names most of the time. This means everything is suggestion or body language(do robots have bodies?). I think the idea to limit dialogue and make everything this way really made the film superb. It reminded me of Keaton and Chaplin silent movie days - some of the expressions and body movements from the robots. The animation for this, making a robot seem real and have *body language* was really something else, something never really done in animation before. It was excellent.<br/><br/>The script, which is what Pixar impress me most with continually, was again top notch. I could have easily watched Wall-e doing his first five minutes alone for the remainder of the film, such was the pleasant comedy of the scripting. There wasn't much dialogue, but what there was, was well done.<br/><br/>There were some keenly observed jokes, which anyone of any age would enjoy. The cleaning robot's 'punch' line was fantastic. Really really good.<br/><br/>There was a nice reference to HAL from 2001 in the ships power hungry computer, which older audiences are likely to appreciate. <br/><br/>Overall a great great movie that will do what you want it to do. It wont live in your memory as an all time classic, but it is well worth the entry fee for the entertainment i got out of it. I'd definitely see it again.<br/><br/>8*10"
"pandora8","9","1","4","26 July 2008"," Endearing entertainment that actually has a brain.
","An enchanting movie, which paints the most disturbing view of the future that I have ever seen in a children's movie. It would be safe to say that it would have terrified me as a kid, despite the adorable robots. Even in my twenties parts of it were quite chilling. Not that it is violent or scary (this is after all Disney that we're talking about), it just shows a possible future for this increasingly apathetic culture, that sometimes was a little too close to the truth, but this is getting ahead of ourselves the fate of humanity is only a sub-plot, and doesn't feature until the second half.<br/><br/>The movie is in some ways quite audacious, though never too controversial (again this is Disney), but the Brave New Worldesque future of mankind is never as compelling as its hero, the intrepid little robot Walle who has been for the past 700 years or so been cleaning up the earth as the population has embarked on a ""five year"" pleasure cruise while he works. Once there were thousands of the little guys, but Walle was built of sterner stuff than the rest, and is resourceful enough to replace any parts showing wear and tear. The first and most successful risk of the film is to trust the first half of the movie to him. With expressive binocular eyes, and a cubic form he is as full a character as to ever grace the screen. In him and his movements the Pixar animators outdid themselves. Almost wordless the atmosphere of the first half though was put in the hands of sound engineering maestro Ben Burtt who completes the character using electronic and organic sounds, without a doubt Burtt is the best in the business, and is one of the three people who made Star Wars the masterpiece that it was (the other two being the infinitely more famous George Lucas and John Williams).<br/><br/>A movie could be made just of Walle's exploits on the deserted surface of the earth, and his budding romance with Eve, the beautiful robot probe who arrives in the first quarter. White, sleek, and self contained she reveals herself as the Apple product she is (Walle also seems to be running some sort of Mac software as he makes the start up sound familiar to all Apple users when he reboots, an endearing quirk that lands just on the right side of product placement (remember Pixar is in itself an Apple product)), she flies gracefully through the air and is armed and dangerous. Walle's never seen anything so beautiful, and his fascination is a mirror of anyone who has ever wanted someone out of their league.<br/><br/>This pairing is so lovely, so perfect and so captivating that the entire plot could have been dispensed with, but the movie isn't quite willing to go that far. The second half isn't as good as the first, but it manages to entertain while still having a brain in its head (something which most movies intended for adults these days can't manage). It shows us the best and the worst of ourselves, and has an endearingly quixotically hopeful ending, but who cares about all that when Eve offers Walle her hand?"
"AshokePrabha","10","1","4","26 July 2008"," Another Animation Classic...
","Lots of good things to talk about.<br/><br/>First of all, realistic images... that I could not believe this is an animation film. Andrew Stanton has done it well again, like his earlier ones starting from Bugs Life. The memorable one being Finding Nemo. Wall-e couldn't just be an entertainment; may be due to the reason the plot lies in our irresponsible environmental attitude.<br/><br/>The story. It's a love story and a science fiction told in animation. And it is beautifully told. It gets more interesting as the story unfolding with unexpected journeys into this endless universe. I wondered, in a century when even small kids turning into rigid hearts, this movie comes with a knock and says 'Hey..Think outside of you too'. <br/><br/>I saw many people here sulking about the 'environmental warning' in the reviews. This story does not take a lesson to you about 'global warning'. It just has the story evolved from it. Worth of romance is not more than the fact ""we can't live safely anymore"".<br/><br/>About the technique. It is very difficult to bring emotions like love, anger in a faceless, emotionless robot. In 'Cars' it was the headlights those make to eyes. Here Pixar guys found the way by drawing digital-eyes for Eva and robotic eyes for the face of Wall-e. Robots are made of metal faces; They don't change emotions. Here they overcome this restriction by changing the camera eyes of Wall-e and the eyes of Eva drawn in different digital shapes according to different emotions. My friend (an artiste) told they made the characters alive by giving jerks/bends and some flexibility in motion of the rigid robots. Tireless work behind this perfection is to be honoured. The robots talk with synthesized voice. How much emotion could be captured in a synthetic voice? The dialogs of the main characters are not much. They are simple sentences mostly single or double words. They made the emotions possible with these one or two word dialogs;poetically.<br/><br/>And Imagination. Behind each and every scene I could see the imagination of the director probing into all directions and making it perfect and more interesting. The junk yard images of the New york city, the space, the robotic parts, its choice of movements, the wheels, the axiom space ship, people's life style there, characterization of Eva as a modern girlish robot and Wall-e as a old-styled male robot who gets love-at-first-sight. The initial no-dialog moments of the movie gives some meaning into the lonely-dry life of the Wall-e. As I try to make meanings out of this movie I keep on stumbling into new meanings. Are we living like the Axiom ship's captain? <br/><br/>For kids, A definite watch. As the world nearing its end of prosperity and fertility, we let out such movies to at least have some awareness of where we are going. <br/><br/>My best wishes to Andrew Stanton; Plus the artists crew who just moved us to live 700 years after."
"spk07","10","1","4","25 July 2008"," What Disney films should be: superlative and accessible to all audiences
","Now this is what animated films should be about right here: engaging characters that draw you in, a strong storyline that doesn't try to pander to the lowest common denominator, and a real overall sense of craftsmanship and dedication.<br/><br/>WALL-E also serves as a touching love story between a lonely robot who must pick up the garbage of post-apocalyptic earth and another named EVE who is sent by the survivor to look for signs of plant life. It is incredible how you can get a feel of their personalities and inner feelings without them speaking any dialogue. It serves as a nod to silent film-making of the past in which actions and reaction definitely can speak louder than words. Pure brilliance. It is just so touching and cute watching them together.<br/><br/>Another great quality of WALL-E is that is has a strong backstory of a colony of humans who have been drifting in space for hundreds of years because the Earth is supposedly uninhabitable. Now I will not reveal what they it is like for them but definitely leaves a tried-but-true message about over-reliance on government and technology and the price of ""order."" Add to that the fact that this a love story between two characters who supposed to be emotionless and you got some pretty heady stuff for a Disney animated movie. I prefer to think of this as a work of science fiction up there with ""Metropolis"" and ""THX 1138."" There is also the fact that humor works so well in counterpointing the urgency of the storyline so you will not take it too seriously but just seriously enough. Finally, the 2:35.1 aspect ratio cinematography works well with its sense of scale and grandeur. The wider, the better.<br/><br/>So in the end you will be feeling delighted, inspired, roused, and entertained by this beautiful 97-minute package of film that you can take anyone you want to."

","WALLE - *****<br/><br/>Director: Andrew Stanton Certificate: U Duration: 98 minutes Best Bit: WALLE Worst Bit: Seeing WALLE sad If you like PIXAR films you'll love this.<br/><br/>This isn't my number 1 PIXAR film (Finding Nemo), but it does star my favourite PIXAR character which is obviously WALLE. He is overflowing with charm.<br/><br/>So the film follows WALLE (short for Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class) a curious robot who was left on earth to basically tidy it up, as we humans some time in the future make so much rubbish that it covers the land. So while we're up in space living a dream, WALLE is here saving the planet. WALLE was not the only WALLE left on earth, but the others all just weren't like the WALLE I adore. Anyway while WALLE is being his own curious self collecting knick-knacks here and there, a futuristic robot called EVE fly's down from space, and well WALLE bless his heart falls in love with her, and well I don't want to ruin the rest of the story<br/><br/>One thing I love about PIXAR is that it's not realistic, but its gritty, the reflection of lights are flawless, it's not always full of colour, and when it is its done well, there's no pointless colours, there's stupid multi colour stuff to entertain kids. PIXAR don't make children's animation films. They make Films.<br/><br/>It's always surprised me that PIXAR always make films with some of the most creative heartfelt stories ever put into film.<br/><br/>As for the voice acting well there isn't much at all. There's the good old John Ratzenberger in there, also there's a brief few words from Sigourney Weaver in there. That's about it.<br/><br/>As I have already said WALLE is fantastic, he is likable from the first time you see him. He's not colourful, or super in anyway. He is just likable. The way he does what he's told, but his curiosity makes him look at the world while he's doing it, is brilliantly thought of. You might actually feel sorry for him as he tries to care of EVE. As for the others, EVE is also likable who ends up being just as curious as WALLE (thanks to WALLE), and there relationship is often funny and heart-warming. As for the humans, well personally I thought they were brilliant, they way they're helpless without the help of the robots is great. I loved the part when they all for of they're chairs and flap about like fish out of water.<br/><br/>So my final verdict of this film is that it is simply brilliant, there are no flaws that I can real describe. The animation is the best I've ever seen. WALLE is one of the greatest characters ever created. The story is heartfelt and funny. Well done PIXAR for making a film for all ages that is funny, great to look at and contains one of the greatest character created. <br/><br/>This may seem strange to say but I've given this film 5 stars because I thought it deserved more than 4. It was special. The thing is my favourite films have that one moment where it just makes you go 'wow' films like Unbreakable and Prestige did this for me. WALLE just didn't seem to have one of those moments."

","Wall.E is a little robot that works on planet earth. The human population has left to move into the stars, after the damage done to the environment by humans have left the planet inhospitable. Wall.E is the last of a series of robots that were left on earth to clean up the mess humanity has made of it. Over the years, he's developed a personality, and a curiosity about the things he finds, including an obsession with the movie Hello Dolly! It's due to this, that he's feeling lonely. When a spaceship arrives carrying another robot, Eve, who is here to investigate the planet, Wall.E sees the chance to make a friend. However, on the discovery of a single plant, Eve is taking back by her ship to space, and Wall.E, determined not to lose his new friend, hitches a ride....<br/><br/>Pixar have hit a new high with this brilliant movie. The animation is absolutely stunning. However, as they've done in the past, Pixar have also carefully developed the story. Yes, the animation is brilliant, but Pixar have never lost sight of the fact that the story always come first. And here, while the story owes debts to 2001, and the movie Silent Running, it's well thought out and put together.<br/><br/>Key to this movie however, are Wall.E himself and Eve. As the characters don't speak only make sounds, you hope that the personality of the robots shines through. And it does brilliantly. Wall.E's obsession with humanities' waste is funny. And, it has to be said, the so-called 'cute' look works well on both children and adults. The same applies to Eve. Most of her expressions are from the eyes only, but it works so well. The two together are on of the best movie couples on screen in years! When the movie moves out into space, we meet other robots, who are showing to have their own personalities, and we meet the humans. Due to time and thanks to robots to do everything for them, they have all become overweight and lazy. But Wall.E manages to accidentally reawaken the human population's spirit, resulting a confrontation between humans, and robots carrying out their programmed message, which recalls to a degree 2001 - without the serious tone! If there is a criticism to be made of Wall.E, and it is a minor one, it is that I think the movie may be a little over the heads of children. It's message about being good to the environment and being healthy, may be lost on them, but will certainly be picked up by adults. Having said that, children will never be bored by the movie, again thanks to the character of Wall.E himself, who is funny.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful movie and personally my favourite Pixar movie so far. Oh and as a bonus, you get another wonderful short at the beginning. Get there early for it. It is fantastic!"

","Like most people, I'm not stranger to Pixar's brilliance at movie making. Great storytelling, pin sharp humour and stunning visuals are just some of the trademark qualities we could almost take for granted. However, it is the emotive qualities of their movies which stand out for me, bringing depth, soul and a human quality to their characters that is seemingly beyond the capability of many real-life actors.<br/><br/>So it is with Wall-E, which is quite simply Pixar's greatest work to date. Visually stunning, this is animation of such detail and beauty it's often hard to believe it's computer generated.<br/><br/>Yet, it's the humanity and emotion of the film's central (non-human) characters that elevates this above anything we have seen to date. The first 25 minutes, in which we are introduced to Wall-E and his soon to be 'love interest' EVE are simply perfect, flawless - the best 25 minutes of movie-making I have ever seen. Underlined by some outstanding sound effects by Ben Burtt and a beautifully intricate score, I was simply blown away by the experience.<br/><br/>That is not to say that the remainder of the movie is anything less than brilliant, but it's success is based upon the foundations of those early scenes. From there, the chemistry (yes chemistry!) of the film's two central characters becomes the emotional currency on which ultimately trades and trust me, you'll be sold."

","If I disagreed with the trend, I would say so. But I don't. This is a fine film, a worthy addition to Pixar's list of winners.<br/><br/>It always looks gorgeous, even when portraying the rubbishy desolation of the ruined Earth. There are moments of humour, suspense, romance (honestly!) and pathos as it tells a story which always holds your interest. The story carries a worthwhile message, and doesn't beat you over the head with it.<br/><br/>But most of all, this film is notable for the way the character of Wall-E is the most human character seen on the big screen this summer. A metal box with caterpillar tracks and a pair of binoculars on top almost instantly becomes someone you care for. I went with friends and, near the end - you know the place I mean - 6-year old Daisy started snuffling. And I'm not ashamed to say that I wasn't far off myself.<br/><br/>A lovely film."

After seeing that film, I was left skeptical that Pixar could make up for it. Then I caught a glimpse of Pixar's 2008 feature film, Wall-E. With just a few seconds of the trailer, I was once again stricken with anticipation for what Pixar studios would bring. I found myself counting down the weeks until Wall.E's theatric release. When it was finally near, I was afraid that all my anticipation and hype would be in vain. The movie far surpassed anything I imagined.<br/><br/>There's a gripping environmental message present in Wall-E, but this serves as a mere backdrop to the real center of the film, the love story. The love story, told from the perspective of two robots, is at once both timeless and new. It's especially moving because once again, Pixar has managed to imbue such human emotion in inhuman characters. There are times when you can practically see the emotions materialize on screen. Wall-E and EVE (the protagonists) are both ungodly cute, and their machine-made ""voices"" really add to that factor. This works so well in fact, that the various physical jokes in this film are actually... I didn't think it was possible... funny.<br/><br/>As always, Pixar delivers on the visuals. Certain scenes (you'll know them when you see them) will cause every mouth in the theater to hang open. The soundtrack, composed by Thomas Newman, is epic and powerful. I highly recommend seeing this in a theater with a decent sound system because nothing compares to it. There are also a few other numbers, among them a Wall-E inspired song by Peter Gabriel and a couple of songs from Hello Dolly that actually fit really well in the context of the film.<br/><br/>When Wall-E was over, I left the theater feeling fulfilled... at peace. It's now several weeks after seeing the film and it still lingers pleasantly in my mind. If Pixar keeps turning out masterpieces like this... I'll once again find myself counting down the weeks. I know I'm already excited about Up, Toy Story 3 and Newt."

","As a die- hard horror/ thriller fan, I surprised myself by wanting to see this the minute I saw the billboard. The film did not disappoint. Until this movie I'd never really been into Disney Pixar movies but Wall.E blew me away! The film capture's WALL.E's innocence and loneliness on earth perfectly, and even with his limited vocabulary of ""WALLLEEE"" and ""EVVAAA"" he is able to convey his feelings and form a beautiful friendship with co- star EVA, a feat even for the most eloquent of human actors!<br/><br/>I loved the use of Hello! Dolly footage and music, I felt it was a contrast back to how the planet was (full of people, sunlight etc) compared to the barren wasteland it had become, and WALL.E picks up on the human interaction in his videotape, as it shows him love and hand holding!!<br/><br/>The important ecological and social message of the film will not be lost on older viewers, but for me WALL.E is a film about pure uncomplicated innocent love and I think we could all learn a lesson from this little Robot.<br/><br/>Goes down as the best film I've ever watched- I hope it wins many Oscars!"
"joecunningham14","10","1","4","21 July 2008"," WALL-E Review from deusexmachinafilm.blogspot.com
","Please visit http://deusexmachinafilm.blogspot.com for more reviews! It would take a brave man to stand up and argue that there is a greater animation studio than Pixar, over the past 12 years they have delivered nine feature films and on every single occasion have delivered a gem. Even the weaker outputs in their repertoire (most notably 2006's 'Cars') still stand up as fantastic films in comparison with those of their competitors. Every single one of their films has delivered financially and been embraced critically, therefore you may forgive the company for resting on their laurels and playing it safe, but not Pixar, they are risk takers and innovators. WALL-E presents their biggest risk to date, a sci-fi epic with an ecological subtext which is essentially a love story between two robots who do not speak. This is not a film you would expect a major studio to make, in an industry driven by revenues you sense that for any other studio the risk would be too big, but thank you Pixar, for what you have created with WALL-E is pure inspiration.<br/><br/>Andrew Stanton is the man at the helm this time around, his CV reads extremely well with screenplay writing credits on 'Toy Story', 'A Bug's Life', 'Toy Story 2', 'Monsters, Inc.' and 'Finding Nemo', and fir all but 'Monsters, Inc.' he also came up with the story concept. To add to that he also directed 'Finding Nemo' (Pixar's best flick that didn't feature Woody and Buzz), so yes it is pretty impressive and you sense that WALL-E might struggle to be in safer hands. Stanton, again responsible for the concept, writing and direction, tells the story of WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth Class) who is the last of his kind cleaning up Earth's un-recycled waste in the year 2815, 700 years after the humans left on executive starliners as the planet became uninhabitable. Our hero WALL-E is left with only a cockroach for company until EVE (Extra-terrestrial Vegetation Evaluator) arrives and they embark on one of the greatest sci-fi/rom-com's ever told.<br/><br/>The film is at it's best when on Earth, the animation is spectacular for a start but the real joy is watching WALL-E go about his day-to-day tasks of cleaning and collecting with his little cockroach friend. It is fascinating that so much character and personality is created in a little rusty robot that can only manage two or three words, he is without a doubt the cutest character Pixar have created to date. He is a fantastic creation as a robot and the animators make sure they capture every single one of his features for great comic effect in the child-friendly slapstick routines. WALL-E is certainly Pixar's cutest creation and this is clear from the get-go, but when EVE is introduced and our little hero becomes infatuated by her you simultaneously fall in love with WALL-E and want one for yourself.<br/><br/>The lack of dialogue is barely noticeable - and what an achievement that is in a children's film - and furthermore when Fred Willard becomes the first live action actor in a Pixar film you barely bat an eyelid, such is the reality of the world Pixar has created. When things take an inter-galactic turn and heads towards the human spaceship, 'The Axiom', the film initially lulls slightly and you fear that the classic you were watching is gone for good. It never does really returns to the heights it was at on Earth until the very last scene but that is because the start is so good it's almost impossible to match. The introduction of the humans works well but they lack the charisma that the WALL-E does and only when we get past the transition stage in the narrative and the focus comes back to the robots does the film regain it's footing and delivers a fantastic adventure for Wall-E and his amore, complete with unadulterated excitement and heartbreaking emotion.<br/><br/>The environmental undertones are controversial and unexpected for a mainstream children's film. On the one hand you may commend it for teaching the young viewers of our responsibility to our planet to treat it well and the value of a good diet and exercise, on the other you may criticise it for scare-mongering and leftist ideas that are arguably too dark and cynical for children. The world that is portrayed is one in which a huge organisation (Buy 'N' Large) has taken over every service on the Earth and after the mess they have created becomes too much they abandon it for a luxurious life in space. In space humans have become obese de-generates who are too fat to walk or even eat anything that hasn't come from a straw. However, the deft touch that Stanton has applied to these topics is key - they are there for the audience if you want to take notice...if not just sit back and enjoy the cute little robot.<br/><br/>Whether you agree with the film's underlying message or not, it will not affect your enjoyment. WALL-E is a masterpiece which is not only a front runner for next year's Best Animated Feature at the Oscars but also for Best Picture - it really is that good. The piece possesses a fantastic charm throughout and successfully bridges the gap between entertaining children and entertaining adults. There are some hilarious moments, some touching moments and by the time you're done watching you won't have many aww's left in your system. It is tough to say whether this is Pixar's greatest film to date, it is certainly their greatest triumph in animation and innovation terms, but the behemoths that are the Toy Story films are still a force to be reckoned with. Regardless, it's my new favourite and a film which I plan to see again and again, the DVD is on my Christmas list already!"

","When sitting in the cinema and allowing the first parts of this film to wash over you there are a number of things that become apparent; the first is that if like me you are a bit of a people watcher then you will find great delight in the idiosyncrasy's and expressions of Wall-E as he goes about his daily chores. It seems a little odd to think of watching a robot building blocks of rubbish relentlessly into high rise towers as a thing of interest but the camera sticks by Wall-E and allows us to engage in the wonder of something very simple and human.<br/><br/>From here the texture of the story and the animation becomes ever more daring and expressive rarely endeavouring to introduce speech to forward the plot. I think this element of the animation is simply staggering and a quintessential part of the best kind of film making; the result is refreshing and gives Wall-E and Eve a freedom of movement that breaks through a number of boundaries. In the hands of lesser artists this expressive freedom could have easily have convoluted the story; ironically the lack of dialogue could also have made the story more restrictive, in the sense that natural progression as expressed in action and movement is usually aided by speech - without this the issues of where to go next and how to show us what Wall-E will do are no small problems to be solved and yet they are and with such seamless precision you won't even notice.<br/><br/>I have to say I was blown away by this animated work - which runs delightfully right up until the last credits! This is a film as entertaining as you could possibly hope and with a warm sense of human nature within the heart of it's mechanics. Hats off to Pixar for producing another piece of animation which is also a true piece of cinema."

","i thought that wall-e was a very cute movie. i enjoyed the beginning the most because normally a movie where the main character can't use a lot of words would be boring but wall-e isn't. i hope that everyone sees this movie especially kids because they will enjoy it. i liked this movie very much.i gave this movie a ten because unlike some movie the characters are not only cute but this is something that could happen in the future. it is very unlikely but anything's possible. i think wall-e is adorable and i like eve too. i hope they make a sequel, but if they do i hope that it is not as bad as the other seconds and thirds they make for most movies.if you like cute little robots then you will most definitely love wall-e."
"E-un","10","1","4","12 July 2008"," #1 movie of 2008
","To the 1,000 or so people who 'hated this movie.' I'm sitting here reeling. In fact I'm utterly bemused. How can so many people take time out of their lives to give bad 'reviews' for a movie they haven't seen, simply because they got the impression somewhere that it is an ecological screed (which it really isn't)? Do they really think they can disguise their 1 star votes by claiming, ""I really loved the movie but I have to mark it down to level the playing field."" Who do they think they are kidding? If you don't like the idea of this movie being in the IMDb Top 250, then too bad. It deserves its place and was put there by the people who enjoyed this movie. I mean, please stop politicking, it's just a movie! I'm also wondering how on Earth adding dialog (between who is quite another question?) to the first 40 minutes of the movie would do anything other than to devalue the story. If you really need language to explain a story then too bad. Not that words are necessary as the story explains itself anyway. And if your 4/5/6/7/8-year old was bored throughout then you should perhaps question your parenting methods, or figure out beforehand which movies are the dumb ones you can see with car chases and 1-dimensional plots so no thinking is ever necessary. I'm sure you'll agree that there are plenty of films like that to satisfy your simple needs. While you're about it, why not get a map out and see for yourself how far from Hollywood Pixar's offices are. Emeryville is in Silicon Valley, a stone's throw away from San Francisco. That's a 7-hour drive from Los Angeles.<br/><br/>I should point out at this juncture that I didn't want to see this. I thought it was going to be bland and silly; yet more terrible 'sci-fi'. I was so wrong...<br/><br/>This movie is simply beautiful from start to end. I can't wait to see the opening scenes again, they simply took my breath away. The images, the music, the simple but brilliant story. All of it is worth every penny we spent to watch this. Our 6-year old daughter loved the movie, and laughed throughout. Even if the elements in of themselves are not stunningly original, it's the way that everything was sewn together so perfectly. I was blown away by Thomas Newman's amazing score, simply beautiful, not 'ugly' as the 'Roach Warning' lady (who never saw the movie either) described it.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a great movie, and I will watch it again... two or three times perhaps. It deserves its placing in the Top 250 because it is that good.<br/><br/>So, to counter all the 'take it from me, don't watch this' folks, please consider watching this masterpiece. And then vote for it and give it a rating it deserves. We can all continue to destroy the planet after the movie.<br/><br/>Come Monday, I'll be recommending this to everyone I know. And they'll probably rate it highly too. Too bad for the 1,000 or so no-shows."
"msekandi1","10","1","4","12 July 2008"," A Brilliant movie
","Considering that the first 30 minutes of the film doesn't contain any dialogue and then the rest of the film is dominated by robot speech, certainly this must be one of the best animated films I've seen in years.<br/><br/>The animation is good. To be fair, you should expect the renderings to be at least at this level in any recent production, so I wont sit on this.<br/><br/>But what will take you, is the story. Great work guys! The story is as significant as in a silent movie. The amount of communication that is portrayed through the images is simply wonderful.<br/><br/>Yes it's a kids film where love is shown as a basic coming together of random individuals and all that jazz. But this one really has got a really good grip on a style to gently convince you of the simplicity of our emotions and desires.<br/><br/>Did I cry... a little, but I'm still a man!"

"megrvt","8","1","4","5 July 2008"," Adorable - good enough that you don't realize no one is talking at first.
","Like you didn't know WALL-E was going to be adorable. Pixar has taken a simple idea and built on it. As one crew member put it, ""what would happen if everyone left Earth and forgot to turn off the last robot?"" It's cute, it's fun. It also has some messages to it that you start to realize as it goes on. Consumption, lack of interaction, the importance of social bonding and interaction, environmental issues, etc. If you want to, you can read so much more into this movie. If you don't want to, you can sit back and enjoy a nice little family film. The animation is great. The team at Pixar has done a great job with the nuances of Wall-E's character. For those of you that know your personality quizzes, he's probably a Beaver. Hard-working, curious, organized, cautious. I was torn between a 7 and an 8 on this one. Why would I bust it down to a 7? Because it works off the same old story of lonely guy meeting hot chick and trying to win her love. Combine that with a rehash of love-the-robot Short Circuit-style and it could have been a mediocre to really bad movie. But Wall-E sells it. He raises the bar to an 8. You root for him. They've made him very likable and I'm gullible, so it works on me. The simple comic relief inside this cautionary tale keeps you chuckling at the very least. In fact, he's the only likable character in the movie. The reason I can't give it higher than an 8 is that they seem to have sunk all their energy into creating Wall-E. They didn't do anything to further develop supporting characters. There are other robots and people, but they don't cut it. If a robot can have depth, Wall-E has it. The rest are just cardboard cutouts."

"RainDogJr","9","1","4","4 July 2008"," Define Cinema... Beauty
","First I want to write something about Pixar movies. I have seen all those movies, with the little exception of ""Cars"" (John Lasseter, 2006), but I don't own anything of Pixar on DVD yet I have some of their old movies on VHS, well actually just three of them. Is obvious that I was a bigger fan of Pixar when I was very young but is also obvious that Pixar movies were and still are great. In this case, like ""Ratatouille"" (Brad Bird, 2007), ""WALL·E"" wasn't the summer movie with the biggest publicity, received terrific reviews but unlike ""Ratatouille"" this one was placed on the first 10 of IMDb top 250 (at one point I saw it on the number 6). Before all those praises I do wanted to watch this one on the big screen but I can't deny that when I saw its place on this site and all the great comments in its first week, I saved a time to watch it today, the day of its release in my country. <br/><br/>The main character of this one, the 2008 Pixar film, is alone in the planet Earth. It is a WALL·E (voice of Ben Burtt) but now we can say that HE is a WALL·E. His robot routine is simple but his curiosity is not and now he can recognize what is a dance and he knows and loves music. EVE (voice of Elissa Knight), the other main character, arrives and again it has a routine, its nature as a robot unit, but that insect, kind of WALL·E's unique friend/partner in Earth, proves that SHE can be different. The robots themselves are of course what the humans could produce but they are the humans of the movie, the ones that are exploring something new, something different and the ones that appreciate the things of the human race. The music plays a very important role for WALL·E and that is just unique and definitely is great for the movie. Here there is a romance and is funny to see the things that a romance can cause since she doesn't know what is WALL·E feeling. This two are like children exploring the world and if something unknown happens to one, the other will be worry. <br/><br/>The story moves with the descendants of the human race. In their ship they are living like kings, the robots make all the work and they can have any ""experience"" without even make a move so in consequence they just can't stand up. They are something new, they are not humans but when they finally have the option to return to the Earth, they finally know something about their ancestors and they see the human race like a legendary civilization that once has a truly beautiful life with beautiful things to do and with a beautiful planet. Now they want to be back in Earth and they can but soon they will realize that Earth is not any more like in the legends, no it was completely destroyed by the human race. Also they will know the plans of the antagonist of the story, AUTO, but still they have the concern of knowing that they can return to home and they will fight for that, of course with the little help of WALL·E and the big help of EVE, that meanwhile have their own story, a story of friendship. Back in home is a new beginning and those fat things will be finally humans. The only question may be the following: those persons learned the lesson or everything would be the same? In the end they are humans and destruction is there. <br/><br/>Conclusion: Then is easy to know why people love ""WALL·E"" and is easy to say that is a great picture since it is Pixar. After writing that, I mean Pixar, it is almost unnecessary to write something about the magnificent animation but there is also some live action that I found kind of strange since those ""real"" humans were from long time ago and now humans are only those -animated- fat ""things"". <br/><br/>Anyway, ""WALL·E"" was absolutely worth watching and I'm glad that a popular film is great. Just for the record, a lot of kids were crying in the theater and some others screaming the name of EVE so if that say to you something, well take your precautions but still this is a movie for everyone. To end, I really can't say that this is the best Pixar film ever, but damn ""WALL·E"" is really, really great."
"D_Burke","10","1","4","4 July 2008"," Pixar's Most Frank Movie . . . And Probably Their Best
","I loved WALL-E. I've reviewed a number of CGI films on IMDb before, and I always make it clear that an animated movie made with computers doesn't automatically make it good, let alone great. Having said that, Pixar, in my opinion, has yet to make a mediocre movie. The closest they have come to mediocrity is ""A Bug's Life"", and I would probably rate that movie with 8 out of 10 stars. It was a well animated film with witty dialogue and intriguing characters, but it didn't top either ""Toy Story"" movie or even movies that came after it like ""Finding Nemo"". WALL-E, on the other hand, has achieved the impossible by being so unique and original that it actually tops its animated predecessors by (dare I say it) boldly going where no family movie has gone before.<br/><br/>I use that Star Trek-based cliché reluctantly, since I consider myself the anti-Trekkie (i.e. I HATE Star Trek with a passion). However, it's appropriate not only because this is a science fiction film that takes place mostly in space, but because it paints a surprisingly bleaker picture of the future than you would expect from a Disney film. The future in this movie is not so bleak that it would depress younger viewers, but it serves as an appropriate cautionary tale in a lot of instances. More on that later.<br/><br/>The character of WALL-E is reminiscent of a lot of famous sci-fi characters including R2-D2, E.T., and Short Circuit, but is in no way a rip-off of any of them. I thought it was brilliant that WALL-E spoke volumes about his personality with his actions without actually speaking at all. He was a lovable character, and will undoubtedly be a true Disney icon for years to come. Some people called the love story between him and the more advanced robot EVA (or EVE. I can't remember which) was corny, but I thought it was a great starting point to an even broader storyline.<br/><br/>Of course, from watching the previews, everyone knew about the robot love story, and how WALL-E finally hitches a ride off of abandoned Earth. What was unexpected to me was the bleak vision of humanity in the future. I saw two of the passengers aboard the cruise ship upon WALL-E's arrival, and certainly didn't expect to see humans in that bad shape in a Disney film. The scenes showing the humans on the galactic cruise ship reminded me both of ""Idiocracy"" (2005), and ""Super Size Me"" (2004), both of which are cautionary movies not made for kids. However, as stated earlier, this movie could probably serve as a lesson for kids: don't over-consume, don't turn on, tune in and drop out, and get up and get out frequently. Coming from a major company which has been blamed by some for the obesity crisis in America today (especially in its historical ties to McDonald's), that's a bold message which I applaud.<br/><br/>I also liked the subplot showing the eventual struggle the ship's captain faced with the robot who ran everything on the ship. I was immediately reminded of HAL from ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968), although this movie was most definitely ""2001"" with a dash of hope. If Stanley Kubrick lived to see this movie, I'm not sure how he would like it. I know that Al Gore would probably love it, since this movie also borrows themes explored in ""An Inconvenient Truth"" (2006) as well.<br/><br/>But of course, in relation to that topic, this movie is pro-environmentalism without being too preachy, pro-humanity and pro-physical fitness without being too depressing, and pro-technology under the condition that it not control our lives too much. Through it all, it tells a great story while managing to have arguably the least dialogue of any full-length feature film, let alone those made by Disney and/or Pixar. Furthermore, although WALL-E takes inspiration from other great movies I listed above (i.e., ""2001: A Space Oddity"", ""E.T."", etc.), and perhaps even from Ray Bradbury's ""The Martian Chronicles"", it's still a very unique film that maintains its originality.<br/><br/>At the Academy Awards this next year, this movie should actually be nominated for Best Picture. I can't say enough good things about it. I highly recommend it, and will purchase it immediately upon its release on DVD. It is by far the best summer movie of the year, and I have no doubt it will be in the Top Ten for movies this year."

Pixar + Robot... could it go wrong? Absolutely not.<br/><br/>I have seen hundreds of movies in my lifetime and never once have I felt so emotionally connected with a character in a movie, let alone an animated one. The fact that Wall-E only really makes clicks and beeps keeps your intrigue in the character to a purely emotional level. Relating to his situation when something scares him or makes him happy, it causes you to feel the same.<br/><br/>The story in the movie is fantastic. A love connection between two robots, humans living in self-indulging lives, and a nice throw back to 2001 a Space Odyssey with crazy computers. This movie has everything! A love story, lots of things blowing up, chases, crashes, sci-fi, drama, A++++ animation... the list goes on! Do yourself a favor and see this movie. Don't compare it to Ratatouille, Cars, or Finding Nemo.... as honestly the only thing that any of them should be compared with, is their animation. Take Wall-E for what it is...

"majorfilmlover","10","1","4","2 July 2008"," Wonderfully Entertaining and Heart felt
","Let's begin with the opening animated short, ""Presto"", about a magician's rabbit that refuses to perform until he gets his carrot. This was honestly so funny that the whole theater was laughing up a storm. I know I must have missed some parts because I was laughing continuously during at least 2 minutes of it. This is one of many reasons why I'll surely buy this movie when it comes out on DVD.<br/><br/>Main feature: WALL-E You can't help but love this little guy. Everything from how he is meticulously animated with expressive goggles and cute noises makes you want to take him home with you. The first part of the movie opens with WALL-E doing what he does every day. Those activities are charge up in the morning sunlight, zoom over to another big trash pile, compress and stack trash blocks, and pick up some interesting souvenirs on the way to later investigate once he returns to his home at night. He's curious and so into his old ""Hello Dolly"" movie tape because of the scene where the main characters lovingly hold hands. He's absolutely fixated on holding hands and puts his little metal hand/fingers together to imitate what he is looking at on the screen. He comes across as lonely and longing for companionship  more than that of owner/pet type relationship he has with his little cockroach. When he puts himself to sleep at night with a soothing rocking motion your heart breaks a little and you wish you could give him a big hug. <br/><br/>Everything changes once EVE, another type of robot on a specific mission, is dropped off on Earth. Although there is a bit of ""hard to get"" going on between them you soon see that they become companions until that too is put on hold after her mission on Earth is accomplished. WALL-E can't bear to see her go so he sets off on an adventure to be with his love who is transported to the human ship floating out in space. Crazy adventure ensues on the human ship as WALL-E chases EVE and EVE tries to complete her last task. Humans - - - They have become gelatinous, lazy blobs in hover chairs. They do redeem themselves in the end once they ""see the light"" and take back control over their lives and their destiny. <br/><br/>Is there a happy ending for WALL-E and EVE after all this adventure? Well, you'll have to see the movie. I couldn't recommend enough that you see this. It is a gem."

","In a time when good news is hard to find, most entertainment has often reverted to fiction and fantasy to give people an escape from reality.<br/><br/>Wall-E, another sure knockout from Pixar, boldly challenges the misconception that we the viewers would rather ignore the truth than find hope in it.<br/><br/>A movie that addresses real issues and still provides the entertainment value everyone pays for needs a near-perfect blend of a poetic story combined with audio/visual mastery. Wall-E not only features a team that can deliver this, but pieced it together from a team of unsung heroes. The fluid animation of Pixar, the magical sounds of Ben Burtt & others, the always-perfect-fit music of Thomas Newman, and the knockout story from Andrew Stanton blend into a must-see movie everyone can enjoy."
"tracckman","10","1","4","1 July 2008"," WALL-E: One of Pixar's best - if not the best
","Unbelievable. Pixar Animation Studios are unbelievable. It is astounding that Pixar has the talent and resources to constantly be ahead of the game in every category each time they release a new movie. WALL-E is no exception. In fact, WALL-E is on many levels Pixar's greatest achievement.<br/><br/>For anyone who has watched any silent films or knows anything about the history of film and the silent era - they know the importance of a strong presence on the screen. The lead actor needs to be able to display the physical emotions that words can not. It wasn't until The Jazz Singer that audiences first heard an actor's voice.<br/><br/>It's 2008, and silent films are practically non-existent, outside of experimental and avant-garde. Yet, WALL-E is for all intensive purposes a silent film for the first 30 minutes. With breathtaking and vast landscaping views of a deteriorating planet Earth, the scene is set of an isolated Earth. No one is left, no plants, no animals, just our trash. That is until we meet WALL-E. WALL-E is the last of his kind - a robot whose only purpose is refuse compaction and organizing. Yet, WALL-E is different than your typical robot. WALL-E has a sense of purpose, yet he has all the emotions of a human. You have a real sense of his curiosity, his loneliness, desire for friendship (that he finds in a cockroach), and ultimately his love and heroism. Pixar's animators have given life to a non-human object like never before. WALL-E's eyes say it all.<br/><br/>When WALL-E first encounters a landing spacecraft and meets a far more advanced robot - EVE, WALL-E instantly falls in love. From here his adventure begins as he meets, courts and chases his love as EVE reverts to default mode and is taken away by her ship. As he clings to the ship and chases EVE, WALL-E is transported to space where his love is tested. In the end, WALL-E finds greater purpose than garbage collecting and helps the remaining human civilization restart their lives.<br/><br/>WALL-E works on a significantly deeper level than any previous Pixar film. With heavy thematic messages of human consumption, commercialism, laziness, and pollution, WALL-E the film is a home run. Pixar maintains its all audience appeal, but while kids will be dazzled by the humor and fun characters, adults will be wowed by the deeper meanings and power of the story.<br/><br/>WALL-E succeeds on every level and is now the summer reigning champ of the title ""if you see any movie this summer, this is it."""
"garlonuss","10","1","4","1 July 2008"," It's WALL-E With the Win!!
","This is an amazing movie. Despite the fact that a large portion of the film is spent without any dialogue at all, you never really feel that you are missing out on any of the story. The animators do such a great job breathing life into this little lunch box on wheels that you feel you can actually tell what he is thinking at all times.<br/><br/>The animation and rendering quality of the movie are just phenomenal. Very realistic aside from the decidedly cartoonish human characters. But that's just icing on the cake. Eye candy that draws you in for the full meal that the story puts forth.<br/><br/>There is a definite message here of caring for the earth and not letting technology taking over our lives, but you will find yourself simply longing for more story between Eve and Wall-e. Their relationship evolves slowly and realistically, with a rather heart wrenching scene toward the end.<br/><br/>Go see it. It's just a wonderful story that anyone can enjoy."
"tiiim","10","1","4","30 June 2008"," flawless..
","When i read other comments of how WALL E is ""unrealistic"" and ""boring"", those people convinced me that they do not possess an imagination. this movie goes beyond what it is capable of, and deals with every aspect of human life in a profoundly way. not only has Stanton created a film for young kids to enjoy, but has also created a mind-blowing masterpiece for adults. personally, its 2001 a space odyssey made for everyone.<br/><br/>The main character, Wall-e, could be one of the most likable characters any production company or person has brought on screen. The whole movie itself, is a perfect balance of romance and the unknown brought in a beautifully harmless way. Stanton never has Wall-e out of his curious/loving self, and makes the audience want to reach out and grab someone's hand that he/her loves. Bravo Pixar, Bravo Stanton. i was amazed that Pixar could out-do themselves with Finding Nemo, but my question is, how do they out-do this one?"
"drawls-2","10","1","4","30 June 2008"," Amazing Movie on so many levels.
","I've seen this movie three times to date and WALL-E just gets better every time I've seen it. The animation is flawless and the music produced by Thomas Newman just works so well with the movie. The one aspect of WALL-E that impressed me the most was the story. WALL-E brings human desires into a magical realm that will makes viewers inspired and become attached to the characters in the movie (most notably WALL-E, and EVE). The movie evokes human emotions throughout the movie and during the return to Earth, the movie just makes the viewer want to cry. Even though you may have seen it already, seeing WALL-E for the second time will be so much more emotional. Excellent Job Pixar!!!!!"
"paul-michels-2","10","1","4","28 June 2008"," Funny, romantic, adventurous, this little movie has it all.
","First off I'd like to say I give this movie a 9.5 out of 10. It's nearly flawless and its great to see robots with emotions. Not only is it a great story and wonderfully animated, it's great to look at too. Everything from the abandoned city, the space station, and the universe are all magnificent and wonderful. My favorite character besides Wall-e and EVE is the captain of the space station and I'm surprised John Ratzenburg didn't voice him (he got a fat guy that was thrown out of his car). I love how the animators and story goes into showing how robots will and can take over all our little duties making us extremely lazy. But how much is helping and how much should we give them to do? I loved this movie and it by far ranks as one of the best of the Pixar films."

","The thing here is something that I am not seeing on any other comments (yet, okay, I haven't read them all yet)... but does anyone recall Honey, I Shrunk The Kid? Fair enough film, good fun for the kiddies and the folks weren't insulted, but ... the reason we flocked to it was the oddity of something the parents remembered, but the kiddies had never seen before: an opening cartoon.<br/><br/>The short animated bits before Pixar's films are as good as, if not better than, the films they precede. While the opening short (Presto, as I recall) is not better than Wall-E, it is one of the funniest shorts I have seen since Duck Amok.<br/><br/>Seriously. When it was over, I looked to my wife and said ""Thank God it was short. If it was any longer, I'd probably have done myself an injury."" <br/><br/>Wall-E is another Pixar masterpiece. Sad, funny, touching, and even sometimes disturbing, it tells a tale with nearly no dialog. It is also a brutal assault on the state of things in terms of the environment, personal responsibility... it is the kind of film that parents need to watch carefully, as there are hours of conversations that one can start with the little ones."

","OK So I went and saw this movie expecting the standard Pixar magic. The studio did not fail to deliver on beautiful animations and environment. The film was visually stunning.<br/><br/>As for a study Pixar presents a bleak outlook for the human race, almost in the same frame as Idiocracy. The movie navigated through tones of globalization, consumerism and the ideal of the American way of life in a sarcastic manner that had not been seen in any of the other Pixar films.<br/><br/>I genuinely enjoyed the film and recommend it to any resident of Pangea, or planet Earth. It is really a film intended for adults, with slapstick comedy thrown in to appease the younger crowd."

"cshep","2","2","15","3 March 2010"," Garbage In, Garbage Out ! Pixar Falls Flat !
","In what can only be described as an almost complete waste of time, except for the expert artistry using CGI, the premise of Wall-E, a garbage robot who falls in love with another robot, stereotypes the future generations as bloated sloth slobs, with little or no ambition, other than to emaciate in a laying down position. The script centers on the voyage of spaceship,700 years removed from Earth as a way of protecting its' exodus , Wall-E hitchhikes a ride on, as his beloved Eve is snatched away. <br/><br/>Pretty much meaningless drivel, if you consider the moral of the story is that man is his greatest enemy , and he doesn't have enough sense of that of a robot and a cockroach. I am particularly offended by Pixars under-handed approach to indoctrinate our children with propaganda, and crap. So much for positive values. We should be more like robots and cockroaches. Thank you Pixar for showing us your true colors. Not since Monster vs. Aliens has a film disguised as ""Childrens"" entertainment , become so blatantly clear as to its' true secularist message.

Two minimally intelligent (childlike) robots who happen into a little romance. A romance between two pseudo-children... Ugh. Roughly 75% of the dialog in this film seems to be one of these child-robots plaintively calling the name of the other robot in its annoying little voice. Too many story elements are poorly thought out. <br/><br/>***spoilers follow*** <br/><br/>For example one of the little robots vaporizes the hell out of anything that moves -- while conducting a search for life. Now how the hell does that make any sense? Also there is an apparent attempt to show that the one robot is an ""old design"" while the other is a ""new design,"" but shouldn't they both be about the same age? Also the first major crisis occurs when one of the robots becomes deactivated -- but the deactivation makes no sense. Finally throw in an intelligent talking cockroach and the attempt at pseudo-realism goes out the window. I am a fan of Sci-Fi concepts but this movie just makes me gag."

","You know i commented on this film once already, but you know every time i see this film, it becomes more wonderful each time i do see it. Pixar has become the most influential animation studio on the planet to this date. Wall-e is absolutely mind boggling with camera sequences and lighting and brilliant special effects. The story is top notch on how we the people have or are becoming complacent in our daily lives and how we all depend on mechanical things to keep ourselves lazy in so many ways. In the film when we see earth nearly barren of all life except for one little plant that an eve robot had recovered from wall- e. The idea of seeing our world slowly drying up and dying is more profound than most of us realize. We are not in the position to go into space yet like in this film, but in the near future it is not far off from what we or scientists know because of all the global warming and such. Governments who are key in promotional exploration of oil do not care what the people think any more. We are not necessary to bring about the changes we need to keep ourselves from destruction, and the government knows this. Yet in this film even protocols can be broken to free the minds of individuals of oppressions or slavery to their own demises. And you know something?, not one government official would ever see this film on his or her own, because if they did, their conscience would ultimately change the way our lives have been. Yet military issues and others keep the oils at bay by force now, nobody can be free from the governments unless we become just as free as wall-e and eve. We can certainly learn from both of them."

","When it comes to movies, kid flicks aren't my cup of tea. For all the folks out there that love 'em, I generally loath them, and I particularly despise being immersed in an audience of hyperactive munchkins who can't sit still, much less remain quiet. So it comes as somewhat of a surprise that I found myself sitting in a theatre surrounded by antsy children waiting for WALL-E, the latest animated effort from Pixar, to begin.<br/><br/>Things weren't looking good as the trailers started to roll. Dancing hippos and super dogs failed to stifle the little monsters as promos for the latest Madagascar and Bolt movies rolled by. But then the main feature started to run, something magical happened. You could hear a pin drop. The munchkins had been wrapped in enchantment, and I found myself absorbed like never before in a movie designed for the sandbox set.<br/><br/>WALL-E, an acronym for Waste Allocation Load Lifter-Earth-Class, tells the story of a little garbage compacting robot who silently toils away fulfilling his programming of neatly piling up waste, long after Earth's inhabitants have abandoned the garbage-strewn planet for a life in space aboard the Axiom starliner.<br/><br/>His routine among the trash, accompanied by his lone friend, a cockroach, is suddenly broken one day by the arrival of EVE (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator), a space probe sent by the Axiom to periodically scour the Earth for vegetation, as a sign that life is returning to the planet.<br/><br/>Told with minimal dialogue (the robots don't say much beyond their names) and relying heavily on pantomime and the conveyance of expression through mechanical means, the folks at Pixar have truly created a gem that is as much a work of art as it is entertainment. Because much of the story is told through mime, even the youngest of kids can follow the story. As an adult, there's plenty of substance here too, as the film explores the consequences of human dependence upon all-serving technology. The animation is also something to behold. WALL-E's sequences on Earth have a hyper real look to them, breaking down the barrier between what appears natural and animated.<br/><br/>Thanks to WALL-E, my faith in kids flicks has been restored but you'll still have to drag me kicking and screaming to see Madagascar."

"GSmith9072","7","1","5","27 June 2008"," ""Wally"" is a charmer
","Pixar's latest animated romp doesn't fail to entertain with its consistent heart and warmth, being rather distinctive from Bird's projects. It's a film that I believe is easy to swallow, borrowing heavily from heartwarming films like City Lights but maintaining its expected Pixar sheen of dictating its emotion from pure human essence and experience. That goes strictly however for the construction of the unlikely relationship between the film's title hero and his romance with E.V.E, a very lively and interesting supporting character. Love will find a way, even if it has apparently left the human species, who have lost themselves amongst material consumerism. The film goes along this path, emphasizing touch, beauty and compassion as essential elements to living, and how the technological extensions of ourselves have come to embody our past nature. <br/><br/>The two main characters set off a series of events in a very strongly influenced by ""2001:A Space Odyssey"" setting. The references aren't exactly subtle, and perhaps the film's universe relied to heavily on this influence, as well as the storyline. The environment and animation however were expectedly beautiful to look at. In terms of the lack of dialogue in this film, it was rather a daring move, but the film is still expressively similar to its dialogue-ridden predecessors. The music and riveting 'computer-acting' substituting as the voicing was enough to pull the common film-viewer through, similar to DreamWorks's film Spirit: Stallion of the Cimmeron (without its narration) or even classic toons of the 50's and 60's. It was all executed well but not originally. The strength of the interaction scenes comes from the level of detail and care put into them; it's simple yet effective. This film speaks to adults in ways that aren't attainable in so-called mature cinema (films with overwhelming complexity and the inclusion of themes children shouldn't see). People see Pixar films as a way to escape and to laugh at curiosity and simplicity, somewhat of a trigger to what's left of their dwindling childhood memories. Wall-E incorporates this into a familiar sci-fi landscape that sparks even more enticement and gives the romance of the two characters whimsical interest, making for dazzling visuals and an all around pleasing adventure. So what held some of this back for me was the low-level satire. The fate of the humans was simply that of such in the film Idiocracy with the crude humor extracted. All the humans are proportionately hefty in red jumpsuits and flying chairs. For me, I found that imagery uninteresting, and I didn't even like looking at; not because of the proposed exaggerated fate, but because of the sheer lack of imagination. Wall-E does exercise a lot of established joking beliefs, such as machines taking over for us causing us to become fat and useless, and humans destroying the entire planet. Shockingly, the portrayals don't come of as overly cynical or smug, because it maintains a communication of our nature that everyone can appreciate. The film is special in that the environmental message didn't hijack the story such as in ""Happy Feet"" because it was essential to the story.<br/><br/>However, the film's greatness is held back strongly by a lot of these elements, mainly because their so elementary. The humans' emotion toward the end of the film are also tacked on, and although it may be part of the story that the humans are so vapid, they still play a strong part in the story of the little robot, yet they're severely reduced to the point of causing the film to lack scope. The film does a handsome job at crafting the relationships, but it shows considerable weakness in other areas that are made up for with the ever-so-pleasing cgi visuals and 'cutesy' humor that depends on how much and when the robots will exhibit a sweet little glistening of human emotion. It's all apparent from the title, Wall-E, in which we would prefer 'Wally', as he's a huggable and sympathetic character that personifies the sensation of longing and soul with just his character design alone. The film is essentially about spirit and oncoming banality, which could be easily related to much mass-produced animated films, and ""Ratatouille"" comes into mind here too with that theme. So while it delivers, I found it less then a masterpiece, but still a piece worth seeing for sure, and a great inspiring addition to animated cinema."
"rama-28","Null","1","5","26 June 2008"," A Masterpiece!
","Pixar has done it again! Writer/director mastermind genius Andrew Stanton and his creative crew have crafted yet another masterpiece. I can't even think of anything bad to say about WALL-E. This a movie for all ages, it's cute/adorable and it's got adventure written all over it. You will find yourself cheering for WALL-E. An Instant Classic! This is an achievement that will still be remembered and admired 700 years from now.<br/><br/>Let's start with the visual, shall we? Pixar is a brand name for great quality and this one will serve your eyesight perfectly. All the little details, they got 'em down to a T, I meanit's an animated movie, but some of the images appear so close to what they might look like. The desolate earth, the sand storm, the surface of the sun, even the buttons on the control board. I love how they make it seem like there's a camera following WALL-E. It captures certain views from difficult angles that would give you that theatrical feel. The guys who are in charge of the animation and the special effects have outdone themselves. Brilliant.<br/><br/>God, I love the music. Composer Thomas Newman (Finding Nemo, Road to Perdition) has been nominated 8 times. I think he deserves another one.<br/><br/>Legendary Sound designer Ben Burtt (Star Wars, Indiana Jones) is clearly the right man for the job. We should definitely thank him for every little thing that we hear in this movie. He definitely has the right stuff to assume what a robotic movement might sound like and the rest of other sounds that would take an imagination to create and enjoy ya know.. since those things only exist on the screen.<br/><br/>I respect how Pixar does not depend on big stars to voice their characters whereas Dreamworks and other studios' animated movies would depend solely on big A-list names as the voice stars so much so that they neglect the importance of visual, sound, and the story, which often comes off weak. Jeff Garlin is perfect as the Captain who seems incompetent at first but eventually knows exactly what he has to do. Comedian Fred Willard, though only shows up for a few scenes, is excellent as a man who owns a big corporation but he actually has no idea what he's doing.<br/><br/>Last but not least, the most powerful element of this movie is the Story. Yes, it's another environmental themed movie, but it's not a lecture, it's not a shove-it-in-your-face reality check.<br/><br/>It's a family movie about reminding ourselves what's important in life. We tend to come up with ways to make thing easier for ourselves, we forget that in the process.. not only are we ruining the very planet we live in, we even create distance between us and the very things that make life worth noticing.. the relationship, the firsthand experience, the joy of working and feeling the joy of reaping the fruits of our labor.<br/><br/>Let's not focus on surviving, let's focus on living. Why does Al Gore have to tell us that the earth is in trouble, when all we need to do to beware of it all is get off our lazy asses and look around."

","I first saw this movie the year it came out, and I could barely keep my eyes open throughout the whole thing. The story is simple and easy to follow, unfortunately the simple plot line is the movies downfall. Wall-E brings nothing new to the table, I felt like I was watching a documentary rather than a movie that was meant to entertain people of all ages, offering a timeless appeal. This film could be a lot more, but the potential was wasted. In order for this movie to be qualified as ""good"" I would have to say the plot line would need to be less predictable, create three dimensional characters, and go more in depth with the story. On the bright side, Wall-E has morals that people today can relate to, such as how humans need to start preserving the natural resources we have, or one day it could all be gone, but despite that nice point in the movie, Wall-E still fails to impress Me."

"Argemaluco","7","1","6","10 July 2008"," A good animation film but I expected more from it
","With The Incredibles,I think the excellent animation studio Pixar made an evolution.With evolution,I'm not talking about the technical aspect from the movie but about the narrative aspect.In The Incredibles,Pixar showed a more mature tone and some adult subjects.After The Incredibles,they had a little false move with Cars and,after that,they made Ratatouille which,as The Incredibles,had some subjects and messages which were not precisely for kids.With all this,I'm trying to explain why I consider Ratatouille and The Incredibles Pixar's best films : on that movies Pixar showed subjects which result very interesting for kids and adults and mature tones which are not common to see on animation movies.Wall-E,Pixar's new film,disappointed me a little bit.Do not misunderstand me : Wall-E is a good animation film with many positive elements but I could not find in here the narrative maturity which made The Incredibles and Ratatouille so special.First,let's see the negative elements from Wall-E.I appreciated the warning this film makes about the future of humanity but I honestly expected that screenwriters Jim Reardon and Andrew Stanton (the last one is also the director) was going to develop that message in a more sophisticated and deep way and not in the same way as all the constant ecological messages from recent years.Plus,I felt the romantic story on this movie a little bit forced.In other words : the love story does not flow naturally.I also found on this movie some irrelevant and redundant moments which result a little bit boring.I have the feeling that Wall-E has its origins as a Pixar short,so when they stretched it,they put some irrelevant moments to fill in the running time.Fortunately,this movie has many positive elements.With the exception of some boring moments,the movie is entertaining and sympathetic.Plus,the main character is very nice,so I could easily empathize with him.On the first 20 minutes,the movie is brilliant,but after that,it goes a little bit dawn.I also appreciated the references to sci-fi films,like 2001.Wall-E is a good animation film which entertained me for the most of the time.But it disappointed me a little bit that,after The Incredibles or Ratatouille,Pixar did not make something more mature and adult.In summary,I can recommend this movie but I certainly expected more from his film.<br/><br/>Rating:7.5"
"Red_Identity","Null","1","6","3 July 2008"," An animated, science-fiction Masterpiece that will go down as one of the best in history
","Let me start off by saying, that my experience while seeing WALL-E at the big screen was one of the most enjoyable I have ever had. Pixar created another amazing animated film.<br/><br/>First off, the way the film starts off, in this future Earth, this was a very dark and deep way to start a 'kids' film. I absolutely loved it though. I thought that it set its standards as a science fiction film well. Well, we are started off seeing how our planet has been trashed completely in the last 700 years. This 'Earth' that the filmmakers created is probably one of the most visually stunning and amazing set designs I have ever seen, both in animation and live-action. The first minutes, the way the music score sets off the mood, and the way we encounter WALL-E living, in his everyday life, is very well written. The next 20 minutes, as to when Eve comes into his planet, is amazing. It is simply spectacular, it works well as a silent film. The way we are able to care for both WALL-E and Eve, because of their actions, and the way they seem to have emotions, it is simply well done. I cannot simply describe the way it is done. Not just story-wise, but visually. It was so amazing to look at, we could even see the reflections clearly on Eve's surface. Amazing introduction<br/><br/>The second part of the film, when Eve is sent to her spacecraft, and WALL-E joins her, it transports us to another world, simply charming. The way space is reflected, with amazing colors and textures. The way the spacecraft is designed, very futuristic, and we are given a look at to what it really is. The story then transcends to what is a green plant, and how the plant might get all these overweight people to finally get to Earth. Throughout this portion, it is also very well done. There were absolutely no flaws, but a problem that some people might have, that I kinda had, was the change in the film itself. A lot of people simply really liked the first 20 minutes, on Earth, and the quick change to another plot in Space was a lot to handle. Yes, the human characters were not really given thought to, but that is because they weren't supposed to(although the Captain really was a great developed character for his screen time). I have heard some complaints, but really, it was not really a problem. The development to WALL-E and Eve keeps going here(like it is shown in a wonderful scene that the two laugh and play out of the spacecraft, out in Space with a fire hydrant). The way the plot changed, WALL-E and Eve trying to retrieve the plant so that the humans would get to Earth, and a little Autobot(which was done purposely to resemble a classic movie character/machine, HAL 9000 from 2001: A Space Odyssey) tries to stop them, well, it was all done with grace.<br/><br/>This film, as a comedy, really was an achievement. There were a lot of parts, parts that really were genuinely funny, scenes that really got to your heart, scenes that really made you laugh. This film, even though it does have a lot of kid scenes, is also very deep. For instance, the lesson it is trying to give, a lesson that I think it a classic one to learn(one that i also think it has similar to 2001: A Space Odyssey). This film managed us to look into how machines and technology can advance, and how because of that advancement, it might be bad to us(the fat, lazy people). It is also trying t give a simpler message, as in take care of Earth. It is not just talking about pollution and trash(it is the simplest way to tell kids)but also recent disasters that can make Earth worse, like all the inflictions we humans cause, particularly global warming. So, in that way, as a science-fiction film, it is also an achievement.<br/><br/>The music score is simply amazing. It is so wonderful, and adds to the delight of the film. I also couldn't believe the sound. The sound effects, mainly with the non-use of dialogue, and with WALL-E and Eve's voices, it was simply the best I have ever heard in an animated film, and truly deserves to win all the sound awards it can get.<br/><br/>This is a true Pixar masterpiece. I have to say, it tops with Ratatouille as my two favorite animated films. It clearly is one of the best animated films ever made, and is a huge joy to watch. It is perfect. It succeeds in story-telling, writing, and visually as one of the best film in years. I think it is time for the Academy Awards to recognize animated films as the best of the year(Ratatouille deserved the Best Picture nomination last year). This one, for sure, should stay on their minds. A perfect film for everyone. Not just one an high achievement in animation, but a high achievement in pure film-making period! A Masterpiece!<br/><br/>10/10"
"Mloca7","10","1","6","27 June 2008"," Surprisingly Intellectual!!!
","I went to the midnight premiere and was astonished at how much I enjoyed this film. This film has comedy, depth and heart all at once. You get so emotionally attached to characters that never actually speak. The movie is basically a silent film comprised of robot noises. There are humans in the film but the amount of dialogue they speak can probably be summed up to 15 minutes of the entire film. The rest is robots...and you know what? It didn't bother me one bit! U don't even notice that nobody has spoken! The robots personalities are so well fleshed out and emotional that you feel as if they were human. The movie is hilarious and it definitely teaches you a lot about our future society.<br/><br/>Without spoiling anything, I will tell you that the plot is contrived of this: WALL-E is a robot who assigned to clean up an abandoned Earth. Its 700 years into the future and mankind has completely trashed Earth and these robots were supposed to clean up Earth while mankind is on a 5 year Space ship cruise but the project is abandoned and therefore all the robots are turned off...except for WALL-E. Hes been cleaning up ever since with his only companion to be a cockroach (As you know, roaches survive everything!). Suddenly, a new high tech robot is sent down to Earth looking for signs of life. WALL-E takes a liking to EVE and even shows her his plant that he keeps....His plant?? That's exactly what she's looking for!! This ends up taking them on a whirlwind adventure in Space! With the rise of technology and laziness taking over our society I think WALL-E perfectly captures exactly what our society could very well turn into. Its a smart comedy for people that like to think and be intellectual while still enjoy some laughs. For a film to be silent almost in entirety it HAS to have a good story and let me tell you, I enjoyed EVERY second of this movie. It is a rare gem, and should not be missed. Its fun for the kids, but especially for adults."
"odegreen","7","1","7","4 July 2008"," An eye opening G rated movie, with groundbreaking technology
","Pixer was able to pull off another master piece. Any movie that you go into with high expectations that you can come out of saying wow that was neat is always an A in my book. This movie doesn't let you down. It uses a dull anxiety driven everyday problem that are facing in the future where a robot named Wall-E is programmed to consolidate a littered earth. Just like in many Pixer animated movies, this is no ordinary robot. Despite not having a vast vocabulary, the character Wall-E is able to express emotion. I think putting it at number 8 in the top 250 is a bit high, but this movie does create a solid imaginary universe that Disney is famous for. An easy one to take with your kids without falling asleep, and maybe having it touch your heart and want to make a change in your own personal life with friends, family and the environment."

In recent years I actually can't remember looking forward to any kid's movie and Wall-E was the closest thing to it and upon seeing it Wall-E surpassed every expectation that I had. Its far and away the most inventive and original kids movie in years (seriously a rat that cooks are you even trying anymore Disney?.....btw Wall-E proves that they are) with a story line that may in fact be something that only adults enjoy but also contains enough slapstick robot comedy and genuine ""AWWW"" moments to keep the kid-os plenty entertained as well. Go see it, you'll enjoy it, your kids will enjoy it... Guaranteed"
"OllieSuave-007","3","1","8","27 June 2015"," Bor-ing.
","A Pixar film about a robot named WALL-E , who collects small pieces of trash on uninhabitable Earth in the distant future, embarking to space with the only living plant on Earth to inform all the robots and humans living on a ship there that life has once again returned to Earth is an interesting concept. The animation is also very detailed and realistic-looking. However, as I know I'm in the minority in this, but I thought the film is painfully boring.<br/><br/>There is virtually no dialog for a good portion in the first part of the movie, just WALL-E roaming about looking for trash. When he meets space robot EVE, who is searching for any life forms on Earth, he falls in love with her but the only dialog between the two are them uttering each others names - quite annoying. When the plot finally takes us to the ship in space where all the humans are living, it's just more of the same - robots and people roaming around and doing virtually nothing. When WALL-E and EVE brings back the plant to the Captain, that is where things take a little turn. However, there is really no action or excitement until very late in the second half of the film.<br/><br/>The taking-care-of-the Earth plot element might be a good message, but this overall movie also sorely lacks any suspense or attention-grabbing moments. Children might not have the patience to sit through this entire film. Again, I may be the minority in this as I know this is one of the top films as rated on IMDb. But, I think this is one of the least captivating Pixar movies by far.<br/><br/>Grade D--"

I can't believe this film is rated so high by so many, it is disappointing to see it listed with other great classics in the IMDb top 250 movie list. It does not hold any water in comparison to the others. Any movie that claims that the Human Race is as a whole not good, should be thrown out. There are many good people in this world who do care for Mother Earth. This could have just been a fun movie about a Robot for kids, but instead Pixar once again is trying to indoctrinate my children with their own agenda. Please leave the teaching to the parents. The character portrayal of Wall-E was good, which is the only reason for more than 1 star."

"Vic_max","Null","1","10","29 June 2008"," Kids will love it ...
","I liked this movie, but it has a different feel from previous Pixar movies. It relies heavily on non-verbal expressiveness and visuals to tell the story - similar to the short ""cartoons"" that Pixar shows at the beginning of each of its big movies. As such, those who love those animated shorts will probably enjoy this movie a lot.<br/><br/>The movie had a very youthful feel to it so it will probably be fun for many kids. For example, there's a lot of time spent on ""cute"" fumbling movements and personality quirks. There are also a fair amount of bashful attempts at affection (like secretly following the ""girl robot"" around, or trying to hold her hand). And the people -- they look like fat potatoes! It's kind of amusing to watch, but I think you really have to like this style of movie to get the most from it. As for myself, it's not quite my favorite style so it didn't work well on me.<br/><br/>The basic story is about a small robot 700 years in the future that is alone on earth. His name is ""Wall-E"" and he is very slowly working to clean up a huge metropolis area that is now an abandoned wasteland. Then one day, a mysterious ship lands. A very high-tech robot, called ""EVE"", comes out and begins to perform a survey for a ""classified mission"" ... and the story progresses from there.<br/><br/>I won't go into details because the plot from that point on is kind of interesting. There are also some some beautiful animation scenes, like EVE's flying survey of the metropolis and their later dual ""dance"" in space. However, there weren't enough of them to make up for the kiddie-feel of this movie.<br/><br/>At this point in time, the name ""Pixar"" is strong enough to be 'the' reason that people will go to see this movie. My advice is to think about the cartoons that Pixar plays at the beginning of their movies ... if you really enjoy those, you'll probably love this movie."

"krational66","8","0","1","13 April 2020"," Wall E
","Although WALLE is a run-down robot that smells like dirt (and garbage) from a distant, rural planet, he has succeeded in wooing the goddess of his heart -- EWA, a masterpiece of the highest technology and a consummate showman. WALLE's success gives us valuable enlightenment:
1, even in the remote rural areas, you have to be a backbone, a small talent. Although WALLE doesn't look like much, as the last little cleaning robot on the planet, he can still walk around squelching around when everyone else is doing well. He knows how to repair themselves, know how to protect themselves, small life lonely but also full of fun. Too strong survival ability is the primary condition for the pursuit of high-quality women.
2. You'd better be an artistic youth or similar. Don't look at WALLE, who is clumsy, but has a curious nature and a wide range of hobbies. She is a compulsive collector (though not a very good one), enjoys watching movies and listening to music, has a pet (a cockroach), and dreams of romance (she takes her girlfriend boating, watches the sunrise, even makes her a robot doll and dances the cosmic tango with her). Women are generally romantic in nature, if you are more romantic than her, then not many people can resist you.
3, invincible zhengtai temperament. WALLE is very old, at least 700 years old. But he's not an uncle. Look at those eyes that can move up and down, how cute! When frightened like a small mouse, when the expression of their innocence sparkling, brave when desperate dedication (such as hanging in the spacecraft through the atmosphere to find a girlfriend, such as to protect the girlfriend burned to the brain)...... The most elite women. Many men are afraid of the Wolf before the tiger, fear the right, but also want to hold the beauty, that is wishful thinking.
4, make or wait for the hero to save the United States. Method is not afraid of the old, the most important and effective. Even the strongest woman has her weakness. Maybe she is in charge of a big company but can't make a light bulb, she is in charge of thousands of troops but it is difficult to get some beloved little thing. EWA has high-tech equipment and can make a mushroom cloud with her hand, but when the sandstorm comes, she can only rely on WALLE to hold her hand. . She's come to earth in search of green life, she's been walking on steel, and this thing is in WALLE's treasure chest. In short, you have to make the person you're pursuing want you.
5. You can also create situations where you are in the same boat. By accident, WALLE clumsily makes himself wanted and drags EWA into the water. This put two people on the same boat, contact of course also more, feelings are easy to cultivate.
Above all, be a good man -- even if you don't look like one. Kind-hearted, brave sacrifice, perseverance, adhere to the side of justice... This is the key to WALLE's ultimate success in winning over the beautiful. Of course, if you just enjoy the pursuit and don't want to be with the other person, then your character matters less."

The setting in space gives an opportunity to the PIXAR animators to try different color palette which is a refreshing change from the colors we are used to seeing. This is an unmissable animation film."

","The movie ""Walle"" is arguably the greatest animated film of all time, stuns us in every possible way, and simply proves that only the sky is the limit for Pixar's imagination. Visually astonishing and narratively satisfying, deeply heartfelt and profoundly thought-provoking, the film serves both as a touching romance between two robots and also as a cautionary sci-fi set in the future. It has been and will be relevant and significant by straightforwardly reminding us of humanity and love."

","This movie breaks the mold, and isn't afraid to point out problems in our society today. The characters are endering, the story is brilliant, and humorous, with plently of laugh out loud moments, and tear jerking scenes. WALL-E and EVE are very human and relatable characters. This movie sends a positive message about love and being considerate of the world. Easily one of my favorites."

","At one point of our life robots will be more wide-spread then trees and plants. But trash ? Can we really become so ignorant, covering the Earth in garbage ? Robots will be able to do everything for us, we'll become less aware about our environment and gradually we will be called human based just on the concept of breathing. They will also get vocabulary and sentiments. Robots having feelings will really be a shame for us, people ! Will we go so absorbed by our daily routine that we'll forget the so called concept ""emotion"" ? When was the last time when you hold hand of the beloved one ?.. because the machines in this animation are more profound in thoughts and feelings than we used to be in the last time, they are experimenting 'love'. This isn't a new story, we can get to a point of our progress where our ignorance will lead a power-solared robot named WALL-E and a little bug to 'conquer' our Earth - they are presented, more precisely as being the only remaining live forms.<br/><br/>What use will have this little planet when we can live in space, colonize and maybe destroy some other ball shaped grounds ? We are just consummers in fact... The 'auto-mode' it's our enemy, artificial intelligence will generate your routine, you'll become a little puppet being dressed, washed, feed, walked, scheduled, dependent by them.. Did you fell this face palm, you little cyborg ? How far can this 'evolution' go, hunting for 'green life' another concept that may be forgotten ? I've didn't seen any animal in this movie, i'll assume that they are already extincted. Living far away from our planet waiting it to sustain life again may seem as a backdoor, but will this way be the best ?"

","Wall-e is an extraordinary movie. It is not as much fun as Toy Story, but it is extremely well done and far deeper; the story is classic but the mode is quite unique. If you did not like the movie, I truly feel sorry for you. If your boy friend does not like the movie, dump him. It is a movie that you should see. It will make you feel good and think about the world we live in. I liked it much better than 2001; that film borrowed from many other films and so to criticize Wall-e for that is perhaps naive. It also borrows from Star Wars but it is more innocent and moving and the plot line is more boy meets girl; becomes hero. You really care about Wall-e. The movie does not have a lot of dialog and so it relies on visual humor and very well done animations by Pixar."

","Now, I presume the first thing that comes to mind in association with Pixar is whimsical characters, and family-friendly characters, and while this film also conforms to that, my God, the underlying setting is just incredible.<br/><br/>A sentient garbage disposal robot roaming around a vacant Earth after resources have been depleted and mass evacuation has occurred? A really poignant setting once you analyse it properly.<br/><br/>Once again Pixar have succeeded in anthropomorphizing non-human characters with each robot having a personality of their own. What I admire about this film is how much they rely on visuals rather than dialogue. For the most part, the robots take centre stage interacting with each other with minimal speech.<br/><br/>The second act focuses mainly on the human characters drifting in space on board what is essentially a space Ark. Accustomed to this self-gratifying lifestyle where they're literally being served everything they want by robots, the obese human race have succumbed to a world of distraction, as it were, where they're surrounded by distracting advertisements and screens, which is a scary visualization of the future.<br/><br/>WALL-E and EVE, the two robotic protagonists are very charming and the dynamic between them is adorable to watch.<br/><br/>Thomas Newman's score just fully captures the environment, making you feel the weight of the setting. There's one musical cue that affects me on an emotional level, as pathetic as that sounds.<br/><br/>Overall, this is one of Pixar's best films to date, despite the fact that the environmental message is a little heavy-handed."

","WALL-E knows to be many things, from a movie light, funny and cute - especially in the reactions of robots - up to a highly critical film our society today. And you have to learn to see all these aspects, but it is undeniable the absorption of all the criticism contained in it, which makes us reflect.<br/><br/>A plot that seems simple, the story of a robot who lives working with the rubbish left on Earth - and therefore was abandoned - but to see who was left a new robot on Earth, EVA, begins a mix of feelings fear and love for her, showing all this in pure form. Such feelings were to be common in-humans, but now who can have feelings are robots, after all, humans no longer seem to know what it is.<br/><br/>And the movie tries and can pass it. Maybe a robot does not have so many feelings in the future, but a human-being is quite capable of not having it, showing complete disregard for the environment and complete technological alienation, which is demonstrated repeatedly in the film, such as, for instance, the scenes of the ""discovery"" of the pool at Axiom. And all this proves to be very worrisome for our future, for our entire fauna and flora.<br/><br/>Despite the criticism contained high - which I liked very much - the movie still sins in some aspects of the plot, mainly to have a high repeatability scenes, both funny parts as parts in action. Staying at various times a certain sameness, but not on a sameness that makes you lose the desire to watch the movie - it does not. In addition to spatial failures, especially in impulse scenes of EVA and WALL-E with the extinguisher in space. But do not think this should be taken so seriously, after all is a very oriented film for children, but with a ""little critic""in its means.<br/><br/>WALL-E must be watched and appreciated, as much for its beauty as for its criticism for ourselves.

"ethanct86","9","0","1","16 October 2015"," Another good robot and Pixar movie
","There are two ways to view the future through sci-fi lenses: the mechanical wow-ness of a space world, or a dusty, human-less Earth. In Wall-E, another Pixar hit, the Earth is dusty and human-less, except that humans currently live in space and Earth is covered in garbage. The humans, after evacuating in a luxurious spaceship, christened the Axiom, leave behind tiny clean-up machines, Wall-Es (Waste Allocation Load Lifter - Earth-Class), to collect, compress and stack the garbage into skyscrapers. One big problem is that most of the Wall-Es have rusted and broken, but the bigger problem is that no human, who now live on hoverchairs and are made up of just fat and (almost) no bones, remembers them. But they are not entirely forgotten. After a long day at work for Wall-E, the humans send a reconnaissance robot named EVE to find evidence that there is life on Earth. After completing her ""directive,"" she is retrieved by the Axiom and a heartbroken and devastated Wall-E follows her onto the ship. This vital evidence, a tiny plant found in a worn-out shoe, balances the future of the lazy, fat humans. Oscar-winning director and writer Andrew Stanton gloriously adds another star to Pixar almost as valuable Toy Story. With dazzling colors and top- notch animation, Wall-E's intensity is far from severe but still demonstrates the teamwork and devotion of the captain, humans, Wall-E and EVE as they battle the mutinous autopilot of the Axiom. At times when it seems hopeless for Wall-E and EVE, Pixar shows us how friends stick up for each other, not just in sunny days, but also in rainy days."

","Wall*E (2008): Dir: Andrew Stanton / Featuring: Fred Willard / Voices: Ben Burtt, Elissa Knight, Jeff Garlin, John Ratzenberger: Another success from Pixar. This one represents everything we take for granted. Wall*E is a small compact robot left on earth when it is over run by waste. Wall*E has developed a personality that finds joy in the oddest objects. When robot Eve is dispatched to earth to find life they form a bond that eventually sends Wall*E into space to retrieve this new love. Watching robots attempt affection is a bit off, however the screenplay is both creative and inspiring. Director Andrew Stanton previously made the triumphant Finding Nemo as well as co-direct A Bug's Life. Fred Willard provides the only human character. He apparently led the evacuation of mankind into space after Earth became basically a toilet bowl. Where he is by film's end is not given, but other characters are voiced. Ben Burtt and Elissa Knight voice Wall*E and Eve but their whole discovery of emotion and love is difficult to comprehend. Jeff Garlin voices the ship captain who is among everyone who allowed themselves to get lazy and eventually too overweight to move. Finally, a Pixar film wouldn't be complete without the voice work of the ever refreshing John Ratzenberger. Visually the film is electrifying and curious. Theme regards love and affection resulting in a family film worth plugging into. Score: 9 / 10"

","We are closer to this reality than many know. This film does an excellent job in exposing the humanity of our actions and the effects they cause. The desolation of the planet is an example of our misgivings, and the unwillingness to support ourselves on a physical level also beams through. The movie itself contains an incredible story. It also demands the audience to take the time to watch and actually grow with the character. There is no instant gratification that we have become accustomed to and I do believe that may the whole point of the film. It shows evolution and devolution of mind and the growth of a human spirit, even if it's contained inside of a robot."

","Before I write this review I think its only fair that I explain a little about myself. I was born in 94, right in Disney's hay day. I grew up with things like Aladdin, lion king, beauty and the beast etc. because of this I've always had a resistance toward 3d animation. I felt it was lazy and commercialised and, in part, I still do. I also saw Wall.e when I was in my early teens. As a teen I was trying to be cool and was actively avoiding animated films as I felt they were for kids. Based on those facts I should hate Wall.e <br/><br/>What does it say about the movie that I instantly fell in love with it. <br/><br/>Let's talk about why? For a start its clever. The first half and hour is done with very little dialogue and yet you are instantly smitten with our hero. The expression Wall.e is able to show is unbelievable. Although Wall.e is cute and goes into the "" a-dork-able"" role, I think its really brave when the animators show other emotions with him. Sorrow, despair, love, pain it's all in there. <br/><br/>I also love the fact that they pull of the ""a-dork-able"" roll. It's always a fine line to tread because it either works or the hero comes across as really annoying. The last 10mins and the emotion surprise that this story gives is beautiful and if you don't like it your more of a robot then wall.e <br/><br/>I love eve as a character. It could have been so easy for Pixar to fall into the trap of making Wall.e the dashing hero but it's eve who does all the action stuff. Brilliant switch and it works. <br/><br/>As I said I've always had a resistance toward 3d animation. This is one of three films where I think it really works. Especially the space shots. Theses are gorgeous and well thought out and just sublime. <br/><br/>Do I have any issues with it? Yes but that's because there's no such thing as a perfect film. <br/><br/>Most of the minor characters with the exemption of MO are dull really dull. I suppose I was hoping for a jungle book or a Nero where the hero meets really quirky characters and it just doesn't happen. I also get annoyed with the choice of music although hello dolly does win when it comes to originality I kept wondering what they could have done with an orchestra. <br/><br/>But I'm nitpicking if you haven't seen wall.e you should. This is going to be a classic. A staple film for future generation. If you 5. If your 15. If your 50. Wall.e will melt your heart."

","The movie Wall-E is great for all ages. <br/><br/>The fact that Wall-E and Eva fall in love makes it romantic and kid friendly. It is also in the future which makes it interesting. The animation is incredibly flawless.<br/><br/>The movie really begins when Wall-E the robot sees Eva for the first time. Most of the movie you can't tell weather its animated or real. The humans on the other hand are visibly animated but I think its supposed to look that way. I think the reason they look like that is to show how we will look if we had what we call a ""perfect"" world. We would become fat, lazy, and depend on others for most of our life. Wall-E is such a space yet earth character. He has those qualities that show he's made for earth. Yet he has qualities for space. Eva and Wall-E have such a great connection. Even though they act and look nothing alike they fit so perfectly together. I wish they would make a second one to see what Wall-E and Eva do next.<br/><br/>Pixar makes amazing films but this is definitely one of their best. Only because its made for all ages. Even though there's not much dialog you get everything as if the creator's them selves were explaining it to you.<br/><br/>Thats why if you have not seen it yet you should as soon as possible to understand what I am talking about."

Like Kung Fu Panda, this movie too is a very thoughtful mix of perfectly designed animations and voices with a very charming and and yet so meaningful backdrop to it.<br/><br/>The design of WALL-E in particular, with only his mechanical eyes popping out is so good. He's able to convey his expressions with his eyes and body language and to add to that he has the sweetest robotic voice that I've heard. The animation is very realistic, hats off to Disney-Pixar for making this movie come alive.<br/><br/>The movie is also a very gentle message to the human race, both in terms of what we're making for us and our planet's future. Even with such depths in story, WALL-E remains an equally good choice for every age group.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes between WALL-E and his love interest EVE are so touching and there is this one scene, a figurative first date, where he gives her the most precious thing that he has, a plant as a present. :) In the movie's story, she gets the plant and shuts down.. what follows is simply a very teary and cute 4 mins where he keeps calling her name and trying to make her wake up again. Never thought I would cry watching 2 animated robots expressing emotions...

With lovable characters and subtle humor, this animation tugs on the heart strings of all generations.The hidden message of environmental awareness, and it's arguably accurate depiction of futuristic life, also make this movie so intriguing for contemporary audiences. Wall-E is so much more than just your average animated movie. It has a clear purpose, and is executed brilliantly. There is not a lot of dialogue used in the movie, especially during the beginning and between Wall-E and other non-human characters. However, the dialogue evident in the movie is used with utter precision and purpose. Not a single word is spoken in that movie unless necessary, and that is one of the features which sets Wall-E out from other Disney movies."

","After hundreds of lonely years of doing what he was built for, WALL-E (short for Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class) discovers a new purpose in life (besides collecting knick-knacks) when he meets a sleek search robot named EVE. EVE comes to realize that WALL-E has inadvertently stumbled upon the key to the planet's future, and races back to space to report her findings to the humans (who have been eagerly awaiting word that it is safe to return home). Meanwhile, WALL- E chases EVE across the galaxy and sets into motion one of the most exciting and imaginative comedy adventures ever brought to the big screen.

"StephenEdwardSeale","9","0","1","21 July 2014"," An Unexpected Treasure
","I watched this film when it first came out in theaters, expecting it to be okay, but average. What I found was that this film, about a robot named Wall-E left behind on Earth to clean up the trash, was an endearing, emotional masterpiece. For an animated G-rated film, it really packs an emotional punch. Without being preachy, it makes a statement about taking care of resources and a warning about the dangers of runaway consumerism, which is not something you might expect from a children's movie. Wall-E is definitely one of the best animated films ever made. While most films, even good ones, have some negative counter-balance to them, this is hard to find with Wall-E. I highly recommend this film."

","The movie is excellent. It very aptly gives vision to the very probable future of our planet. The characters are lovable and Wall-E is the cutest robot in any movie. His feeble efforts at connecting to the has-been world is endearing. And lately this is the most innocent love story seen by me. Eva is a classic tale of robots, originally hardwired to just perform tasks developing emotions. The animation is awesome! Very cute and cuddly. The story line is great too, it has all the elements of gradual build up, anticipation, chase scenes, climax and a sweet ending!! I was hoping for a sequel, any further development of the franchise, because of the superb animation but I guess this movie is complete in its own right."

","I have never watched an animation that opened my emotions to the sense that I just wanted to cry in satisfaction. This was not great... this was outstanding! The character Wall-E is very sweet, and actually displayed emotions no robot can ever. He treated Eve with such respect, and desired her truly, allowing the audience to acknowledge true love. The animation was incredibly well made, including texture, shaders, graphics, and movement of each character. The movie displays a very positive message about world crisis, including global warming and garbage disposal. It also showed us about obesity, which was actually kind of humorous in a nautical manner. It was action and adventure- packed, which made my heart race in suspense. Since i'm very technologically advanced, I found everything to actually be quite realistic, and i'm 96% certain that the future will be exactly like this movie, aside from the actual characters Wall-E, Eve, and the other gang. Overall, outstanding, and after 3 years having previously watched it, I chose to watch this all over again just so I wouldn't forget how amazing this movie is."

However, as a layman I loved the animation part. The physical evolution of human beings are so well animated.

The biggest difference I've noticed is that it describes a climate change as an immediate threat rather than something that might change our planet years down the line... <br/><br/>Although the plots are somewhat different, the concept is the same, and I was curious whether PIxar was inspired by the stories of climate change impacting islands all over the world, forcing its inhabitants to relocate due to rising sea levels."

"CinemaClown","Null","0","2","7 October 2013"," Even For Pixar, This Is A First!
","Even for Pixar, WALL·E is something that this animation studio has accomplished for the very first time & is quite possibly their most perfect film to date. Surpassing Pixar's very own genre-defining standards, pushing the boundaries of animation to an entirely new level & effortlessly transcending the conventions of its genre, WALL·E shows what animation is capable of when used as a medium to narrate a story & is one of the greatest achievements in the history of filmmaking.<br/><br/>Set in a distant future, WALL·E paints a very bleak portrait of our planet that has been abandoned by mankind after it became too unfit to sustain human life and chronicles the adventures of a robot that was designed to clean up the whole mess, has been alone on the waste-covered Earth for centuries & has developed sentience. When another robot named EVE arrives to survey the planet, WALL·E falls in love with her at first sight & follows her into outer space on a journey that would change the fate of mankind.<br/><br/>Co-written & directed by Andrew Stanton, WALL·E marks another impressive high for the very filmmaker who previously dazzled the world with his breathtaking underwater adventure, Finding Nemo & this time, presents him raising the bar for movies set in outer space. While the fabulously written screenplay touches on current world issues like pollution, mass consumerism, sedentary lifestyle & dependence on technology amongst other things, it's how these themes are presented that makes WALL·E an instant classic.<br/><br/>Opening with what isn't entirely an unrealistic view of our planet's future, the first act of WALL·E is also its strongest for the sequences set on Earth are an absolute marvel to look at & even the storyline in this act makes minimal use of dialogues, relying mostly on visuals. Humans do make their appearance from the second act onwards but it's the robots here in whom we invest our emotions with assured confidence, and they don't let us down for their arc is deftly written, carefully handled & confidently presented.<br/><br/>From the technical point of view, WALL·E is in a league of its own. Production design team makes expert use of real world entities for its sets, Cinematography is jaw-dropping for it blends live-action with 3D animation unlike anything seen or done before but as far as animation photography goes, it ends up setting new standards with its inventive use of lighting, colour palettes, camera placements & focus shots for this picture is the closest animation has ever come to replicating live-action cinema on the silver screen.<br/><br/>The computer animation has always been a state-of-the-art aspect in Pixar's features but in WALL·E, it opens up a wide range of possibilities for its medium unlike ever before & explores the new realms with sublime artistry. Editing exhibits a steady control over its pacing & every frame throughout its 98 minutes of runtime serves a meaningful purpose in the end product. And then there is Thomas Newman's heartwarming score that makes WALL·E a deeply intimate, beautiful, touching, innocent & soul-stirring experience.<br/><br/>The two adorable characters we have here in WALL·E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter – Earth- Class) & EVE (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator) are elegantly designed and express emotions so well that we are instantly connected to their thoughts without any requirement of verbal exposition. The entirety of WALL·E's expressions come from those binocular eyes & his rugged design fits the environment he works in while EVE presents a much advanced technology & her precision finish resembles the design aesthetics found exclusively in Apple products.<br/><br/>Also, ever since 2001: A Space Odyssey happened, almost every single feature film set in outer space has gone on to pay homage to that quintessential sci-fi classic yet of all the space operas out there, WALL·E is by far the best tribute to Kubrick's magnum opus in my opinion for it treats that masterpiece's legacy with utmost respect but is also able to carve its own identity by retaining its originality. The film also makes reference to the 1969 musical Hello, Dolly! and in many ways, is a wonderful ode to various products by Apple Inc. as well.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, WALL·E is an immensely fascinating science-fiction adventure, a whole-heartedly mesmerising love story & a groundbreaking feat of computer animation, all extraordinarily intermixed into one profoundly moving, delightfully entertaining & thoroughly rewarding cinema that effectively addresses the themes of love, loneliness & companionship, and has a lot to say about our degrading environment, inactive lifestyle, consumerism & over-reliance on technology, including where all this could lead us in the near-future unless we decide to act.<br/><br/>Whether you place it in the genre(s) of sci-fi, romance, adventure or comedy, WALL·E will manage to come out as a winner in all of them with effortless ease for it is a triumph in every filmmaking department & is a cinematic treasure that'll be cherished for decades to come. Watching it only once isn't enough for the story unravels more of its depths on multiple viewings. One of the best films of its year, one of the finest films of its decade, one of the prime examples of its genre(s) & definitely amongst the greatest films ever made, WALL·E is an unprecedented feat of animation filmmaking that simply works."

What Pixar do so well is to wring real emotion from the audience in a way that other studios or film-makers are afraid to do, in case they be thought of as sentimental.<br/><br/>I believe that if it hadn't have been for Wall-E, The Artist would never have found such success. Wall-E paved the way for silent films' return to the edges of mainstream Hollywood, as the first half takes place with no real dialogue at all.<br/><br/>The opening sequence is one of the best I've ever seen to boot.

The fact that there is a high possibility to end up like that,makes it even more realistic and motivational! Who wants to end up like that?! Being more robotic than the actual robots,living a lie? Unfortunately, most of us,human beings don't respect mother earth and don't think what we put through the next generations! It's frustrating,but when i watch Wall-e,i feel the need to be more active,i feel the need to say ""I don't want to survive,i want to LIVE!"",as the captain says in the movie. I can't believe that some people could dislike this movie. It makes me want to cry every single time and not only because of the sad,but too much real future it projects,but because Wall-e and Eva are adorable all the way through the movie and when you think all of Wall-e's memories are gone,you can't not feel sad and it's painful! They have more feelings than the people in this ship could ever master and do the right thing regardless! I hope we'll start treat the environment the right way,otherwise Wall-e's world will become ours and i don't think we'll have brave,emotional,romantic,cute robots to save the day in our case! Of course,10/10,because this movie is a big slap in the face combined with the true meaning of love and devotion,even if it is between two robots!

","While E.T. will always remain my favourite sci-fi film (despite not being a big fan of the genre), I rented 'Wall-E' about four years ago due to not seeing it at the cinema in the summer of 2008 because I spent a lot of time indoors to avoid stressful moments involving families with children. Another reason for seeing this film is because I love Pixar films, especially the 'Toy Story, franchise and I enjoyed 'Robots' that came out three years earlier.<br/><br/>The film's set-up that I heard about through its publicity is pretty straightforward in terms of involving WALL-E, a cute litter-compacting robot, doing what he was made for for 700 years and collecting interesting artifacts that he keeps in his home that he shares with his pet cockroach. Another robot, the sleek and attractive EVE, is sent to Earth to search for vegetation in order to bring the stunning ship Axiom back down to Earth. WALL-E falls for her and when he gives her a plant, she stores it inside her, goes into hibernation mode and is taken aboard the ship destined for Axiom. WALL-E clings onto the ship in a desperate attempt to rescue EVE. Upon seeing this film, there was more to the main plot such as seeing a plethora of obese people who hover aboard the Axiom and communicate via holographic screens, the captain learning more about Earth and live-action segments, particularly clips from 'Hello Dolly!' As for the music, I liked the uses of songs from 'Hello Dolly!' the '2001: A Space Odyssey' music and Peter Gabriel's closing song 'Down to Earth' to represent Axiom's return to Earth while the composition played during WALL-E and EVE flying in the starry sky is lovely. The colours are at their brightest aboard the Axiom and the impressionist art-style portion of the end-credits animations, although I liked the metallic textures used to reflect the film's sci-fi theme and the futuristic visuals. There are several heartwarming moments, especially those involving WALL-E trying to get EVE to hold hands, and a few funny moments such as WALL-E needing to recharge upon waking, the singing fish's brief rendition of 'Don't Worry, Be Happy' (the second connection between Bobby McFerrin and Pixar) and the 'beauty-bot' giving WALL-E a makeover, although the idea of growing pizza plants does not make sense because there's no such thing as pizza plants! Maybe it was included to illustrate the captain's misunderstanding of life on Earth. I found the minimal use of dialogue during the first 37 minutes effective since WALL-E and EVE could communicate with their emotions and the closing shot from Earth was just as phenomenal as the opening shot.<br/><br/>Overall, this is an engaging sci-fi animation that offers more than I initially expected. 9/10."

","f you were to look up ""charming"" in a thesaurus, you might see trash-compacting robot listed. At least, we will after seeing this movie. The movie beats you over the head with the fantasy that following the feelings that result from infatuation will eventually lead to happiness. It also tickles you aggressively with situations involving a bunch of obese, devolved humans. But you don't notice the bruises on your body after taking the beating because the film is so darn charming. Everyone wants to laugh at fat humans, and they also want to believe that they can be permanently happy with others that really tickle their fancy. So, if you want a dark, gritty film... this isn't it. But if you're looking for a pain-killer, this is good stuff. Now I feel like a drug addict for liking the movie."

","Wall-e is a great movie to rent/buy for your children to watch, it's that simple.<br/><br/>The animated tale follows many of the archetypes that made movies amazing. It's a love story. It's an adventure. It's a story about an underdog. But never before has these often used frames for a story been used more creatively. The first movie I ever saw in a they're was Toy Story. I remember this sort of light feeling I got when I saw it. I never had that feeling again until I saw Wall-e. It brought up what it was like to be a kid again. Wall-e is an amazing character. He strolls in perfectly formed, and unlike the protagonists of many movies, we are always behind him 100%. Not everyone will love this movie as much as I do, but I honestly can't find a single thing wrong with it. Most of the time it didn't even feel like a cartoon. This is Pixar and anyone involved at their best. See it. I can't say enough good things."

","What a film!! It's a enchanting robot romance, an exhilarating original view of the future, a tour-de-force in space animation and a fable about what could happen to the human race if we become too reliant on technology. Truly, a special motion picture. And it's taken me 5 years to see it again!!<br/><br/>Wall-E, the mechanical garbage compacter and Eve, the laser-toting, flying object of his affection, may only communicate by expressions and half-sentences, but they have more personality and identity than 99.9% of the also-rans that end up on our cinema screens these days. Seeing them interact with each other, and the beautifully designed world around them is a true joy, not to mention the other creatively constructed androids around them, big and small. Huge props to the makers for such an engaging cast of non-living characters.<br/><br/>Like with all the best Pixar films, it has at least one 'I have something in my eye' moments, in this case near the end... Just when you think the day has been saved, DISASTER. The way this conflict is resolved might be corny in a lesser movie, but here you want to cheer from the stands. It's just a wonderful mix of themes, sprinkled with humour and with a great big heart at it's centre. It also something that the latest Pixar features, which seem to veering towards sketch comedy and trite life-lessons, should learn from.<br/><br/>Leave that sort of thing to Dreamworks.... 8/10"

","Wall-E is one of the best movies of the decade. It is entertaining, emotional, meaningful and very funny. I liked the fact that there is little dialogue. As the later ""The Artist"" reminds us, movies were made without sound for decades, and still managed to convey the full range of emotions etc. The references to other movies were also amusing - I particularly liked the moment when the ship's captain rose to his feet for the first time, to the accompaniment of the theme from 2001 A Space Odyssey, for when the caveman stood for the first time. This is a truly great movie on a number of levels, and enormous fun, as well as being quite serious in its own way."

The year is 2700, and planet Earth has long been uninhabitable. For hundreds of years, WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class) has been taking out the trash, and collecting precious knick knacks in order to stave off the boredom of his dreary routine. Little does WALL-E realize that he has recently stumbled onto a secret that could save planet Earth, and once again make the ravaged planet safe for all humankind. When highly advanced search robot EVE makes friends with WALL-E and realizes the value of his remarkable discovery, she excitedly races back to let the humans know that there's hope for their home planet after all.

"bharat-wolverine","7","0","1","25 June 2013"," What wall-e told me
","Humans land a raw deal when it comes to animations. We upright, two- legged creatures regularly have to give way to the superior intelligence or endless fascination of a deer or a dog or a penguin. It's part of the bargain: we draw them, they make us look stupid. And so it is with 'Wall-E', except this time we have only ourselves to blame. Pixar has drawn inspiration for this bold, bleak and often very beautiful film from the worst approximations of the future we're shaping for our planet.<br/><br/>In Pixar's last film, 'Ratatouille', it was a sewer rat who brilliantly grabbed our attention and revolutionised French cuisine. For 'Wall-E', humans again take a back seat, and it's a robot with a cube for a belly and binoculars for eyes who's bleeping for our love. When we do, finally, encounter humans – living on a self-sufficient spaceship, waited on by robots, sucking on straws – they're fat, sedentary, greedy and unpleasant. <br/><br/>Plus ça change: from Cruella de Vil to our fellow folk in 'Happy Feet', cartoons have always held a mirror up to our selfish instincts.This time it's 2700, and we've polluted ourselves out of existence. The only humans left live a sterile, bloated life high above earth, where we decamp for the second, more frenetic and less inspired half of the film. But everything that comes before is magical. The only animate object left in the lifeless, rust-coloured, dusty landscape of urban desolation that we used to call earth is one tireless mechanical waste-collector called Wall-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter – Earth Class). He lives in a cluttered container and spends his days buzzing about, piling up junk to look like skyscrapers or Mayan temples and sucking up sun for his solar panels. His only company is a lonesome cockroach.<br/><br/>So that's one robot, a cockroach and a vision of earth gone to pot. This is a cartoon that offers an uncompromising, imaginative, angry portrait of the future. It's daring in its simplicity: for the first 40 minutes, we watch in wonder as Wall-E goes about his business in near silence; it's the sharp intelligence of the detail, always so painstakingly rendered, that most amazes. At one point, Wall-E finds an abandoned diamond ring in a jewellery box. What does he do with it? He throws away the ring and plays with the hinges of the container. Of course he does: hinges should fascinate more than precious minerals. Shame on us for not realising that before.<br/><br/>By rights, Wall-E shouldn't be cute in the Bambi or Dumbo sense of the word: he's battered and fading and the only noises he makes are computerised drawls not dissimilar to ET's limited lingo. But Wall-E is alluring, and not because he's got big eyes or dangling eyelashes but because he's smart, hard-working, with a romantic side, and is hopelessly addicted to watching clips of Michael Crawford and Barbra Streisand in Gene Kelly's 'Hello Dolly!' on a video screen. He's everything we should have been if we hadn't put all our energy into destroying the planet. But none of this is preachy or obvious. <br/><br/>Environmental destruction is only the breathtaking backdrop to the film and it's more the minimalism of Wall-E's existence that fascinates. By the time a sleeker, feminine robot called Eve – who looks like an iPod shaped into a pepper-pot – arrives, we're craving her company in sympathy with our mechanised friend. Pixar has done it again. I wonder a little what kids will make of the long silence of the first half followed by the disorienting mania of the second, but there's nothing here that's not wonderfully imagined and lovingly presented."

","There are a few major themes running through Wall-E. It's a film about the environment, it's a film about determination, but most of all, at its heart, Wall-E is a love story.<br/><br/>Everything that little robot does, he does because he is trying to impress, help or save Eve. He is lonely and Eve is the first person he's had to talk to in hundreds of years. She quickly becomes everything to him.<br/><br/>And despite the first half the film having virtually no speech, despite the fact that Wall-E and Eve don't so much talk as beep and squeak, there manages to be a real sense of warmth, affection and love between them. The film proves that animation can have tremendous depth, and the other messages are not preachy or in-your-face. This is a winner."
"gussle02","10","0","1","23 June 2013"," Wall-E and EVE, the greatest romance of the future
","The film WALL E is a Pixar animated film that takes place on planet the Earth. This film was released in 2008. The theme of the movie is paired with saving the earth and finding love. The two main characters of the film are WALL E, who is played/voice-over by the actor Ben Burtt and the other main character is EVE played by Elissa Knight(Morris, 2008). The film begins with showing that earth had been overrun by mountains of landfills. The human race vacated the planet hundreds of years ago because they could not sustain life in these conditions. While the human race retreated to a ship in outer space, little trash compacting robots were left to clean up all the garbage. After hundreds of years all but one robot broke down. This robot's name was WALL E. WALL E continued to do his job by going out every day gathering and compacting all the garbage. WALL E also enjoyed, collecting and organizing little trinkets such as rubber ducky's, lighters, and silverware. WALL E also enjoyed watching old classical musicals which made him long for love. One day a spaceship came down and dropped off a very sleek and high tech robot that went by the name EVE. Her job was to scan the earth for any living organisms. WALL E became very infatuated by EVE. Another animated movie that has shown this level of infatuation between the two main characters was The Nightmare Before Christmas. The love that WALL E carries for EVE is much like the longing that Sally felt for Jack. As a token of his love for her, he presented her with a plant that he had discovered. EVE was programmed to collect all plant life and when collected she must lock up until the spaceship returned for her. When the ship returned WALL E hitched a ride with the ship to save EVE so that he could be with her. They then arrived on the ship that housed the human race. For years the people on the ship never walked and drank their food through a straw. Anything these people wanted there was a robot to get it for them or do it for them. The ship tried to destroy the plant but WALL E and EVE teamed up with all the broken robots to beat the auto pilot and return everyone back to earth.<br/><br/>The use of outside in editing made it very clear that even in a large world, whether that world is earth or a floating robotic space ship, the importance of each person is immeasurable(Boggs & Petrie, 2008). The story between two robots would not have seemed very important, yet even these two little robots changed the course of a spaceship and opened the eyes of all the humans aboard. The effect of distorting time, slowing down the action sequences, shows the importance of EVE in WALL E's world(Boggs & Petrie, 2008). Every time that WALL E lays eyes on EVE, his world slows down. Overall WALL E shows that finding your love, whether that's another human or a robotic life-form, can save the world."

","This film never fails to make me happy. I get depressed easily and often and Wall-E is one of perhaps five films which can just instantly cheer me up. As such I ration this film as if it is the last hobnob in the packet for the times when I am feeling low.<br/><br/>The silent characterisation of the robots is just genius and it never fails to amaze me how well their traits and quirks always come across. Then there are the wide and ranging metaphors on social mores and cultural problems. The notion that in an autonomous, mindless society a single act of free-thinking independence can trigger spontaneous disobedience to the betterment of man- and robot -kind is beautiful. I honestly cannot fathom how this film has not singlehandedly reshaped the entire Islamic world to that of a peace loving utopia.<br/><br/>For me this aspect of the plot far overshadows the in-your-face warnings on rampant consumerism, global warming, space debris, waste management and just... modern America. I admit that at a couple points these issues may get a little preachy but then Wall-E will just crash into something and cause chaos so I can forgive them."

","I found Wall-E to be a job very well made by Pixar. <br/><br/>Even with very little use of real human voice overdubbing on the fantastic 3D art and animation they managed to create elaborated characters with a personality that really becomes touching.<br/><br/>The message behind the movie about the lack of care we give to things around us, to others and to our planet goes well within my ideology therefore I believe this is a very good addition to family picture entertainment helping at some point to create a generation where we stop pointlessly consuming things we don't need and start taking care of what we have, without looking for happiness in new things or external objects.<br/><br/>It is also not new for writer and director Andrew Stanton to create a hit in the market and all the same using metaphors to send and idea to his public, his last movie before this being Finding Nemo.<br/><br/>Even so for me the person who really took this to another level like so many times before was sound designer, Ben Burtt, mostly known for his work in Lucas Film, creator of the light-saber effects, and all the spaceships and droids sounds used in any all the Star Wars movie released to date, ET, Star Trek, Super 8, and many other space movies. In this case, he managed to make every character say so much with so little to no words at all nevertheless they gave us everything that we needed to know. Its a movie that show's what we've accomplished with technology in the Audio/Visual industry, and how with completely digital characters and almost nonexistent dialogs you can move the viewer to the point of really make them cry."

","'WALL-E' is widely regarded as one of the greatest animations of all time, if not the greatest however I respectfully disagree. To me, there are better Pixar classics such as Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc, Toy Story and better animations such as Spirited Away. That being said, WALL-E is an absolute masterpiece by Pixar and will go down in history as one of the greatest animation films of all time.<br/><br/>'WALL-E' is the story of a robot garbage cleaner named WALL-E who find the love and only bright thing about his life when EVE is dropped off at Earth to look for food and other remnants of Earth. When EVE is picked up by a spaceship, WALL-E chasing after it and manages to grab on and suddenly finds himself landing on at space. There he must re-locate the plant that he collected when he was down at Earth and send it to a machine platform on the ship in order for all humans boarding the ship to return to Earth.<br/><br/>*****THERE WILL BE SOME SPOILERS********<br/><br/>***CHARACTERS****<br/><br/>Although the main characters are really WALL-E and EVE, there were a few other funny characters, in particular the Captain of the ship. As a person, you always got the chance to feel for WALL-E as a hopeless, lone robot who has nothing good left in life. You also got the chance to connect with EVE as the story progressed as her personality changes from a snobby one to a more loving one. It was also great to see the Captain as someone who is not an obnoxious man portrayed as an abomination to mankind but more of a loving man who cares a bit for WALL-E.<br/><br/>***STORY*****<br/><br/>The story here is very simple, much like all PIXAR films, but at the very same time has great plot development. The story is an enjoyable and predictable story, yes, but its the perfect execution that makes the film so popular. <br/><br/>***VOICE ACTING***<br/><br/>Although the voice actors for WALL-E and EVE didn't do much at all, Jeff Garlin was once again, the stand-out, of all the voice actors. He made the film all the more enjoyable and he perfects the role of the Captain. <br/><br/>That being said, there is one MAJOR issue with me for this film and that is the pacing. The first one third of the film (30 minutes) was awfully and painfully slowly, dragging along at a snail pace. For goodness sake,all that happened in this time was that EVE was dropped off, she got the plant off WALL-E and was picked up by the ship once more. For a film that only goes for 30 minutes, this was awfully slow. Take examples such as Monsters Inc, where much of the story has now been told and same goes for other Pixar Films such as Finding Nemo, where Nemo has been kidnapped, her father has already well and truly set out on the journey with one thing left in his mind- To save Nemo. In this film, the pacing started off awfully slow and then sped up after arriving on at the ship.<br/><br/>One other minor problem for me with the film was WALL-E and EVE themselves. I expected both robots to be able to actually talk and at times it got a bit annoying, but that made the characters the more better and developed. It proves that even robots, who cannot talk and clearly express their feelings, have deep down, feelings.<br/><br/>Overall, a must see for anyone. Pixar Masterpiece."

","I've seen a lot of Pixar/Disney films and sci-fi in my time, and I'm proud to say that this is once again another great achievement on both counts and is another one of my favorite movies in general.<br/><br/>The CGI animation work is just at it's best from he background details to some of the robots themselves, they all looked believably real that it's easy to forget that your even watching an animated movie.<br/><br/>However the real power was in it's context and character we read it all mainly by what we see in the visuals since this film really doesn't have much dialog, so in a way it's almost like a silent movie but thats a great thing because form how it's handled we understand perfectly.<br/><br/>The setting for the whole film is very dark it feels like it could happen, it's sort of a mix in tomorrows world/post apocalyptic sci-fi both in a negative satirical light though a playful sensibility at the same time. From the first half we see the earth all ruined and polluted and practically lifeless except for WALL-E and is friend a jumping cockroach. We see sky scrapers crumpled down a little, monorail trains broken down, junk and scrap left and right, atmospheric imbalance no thanks to global warming just a lot of bad left and right.<br/><br/>To the other half of the film where of course we see all of the humans in some sort of Titanic like space craft, living there until Earth becomes habitable again; technology is most of the time running the show doing just about every little thing for them to make their lives easier. But that's the biggest problem with that ship their lives are too easy. All of the humans have simply became fat and lazy; they're all on hover chairs that do even the littlest things for them and they don't even have to movie much except press a button to give them what they want. None even eat solid food any more cause their too lazy to cook, the only way they do that is by simply drinking some sort of 711 Proteian Slurpee drink, yuck. They play sports but they don't participate in it because robots do that work for them; video game have more participation then that. But the worst part for me was seeing their mannerism where they have became somewhat docile and disconnected, yest they talk to one another but on a computer screen never directly face to face.<br/><br/>Film does have some important underling messages from eco ethics on why we need to take better care of our enviorment. But most of all an anti consumerism and anti obesity, simply we need to take better care of ourselves we shouldn't make life too easy or we stop becoming human.<br/><br/>However the film is a simply sweet love story/adventure. The two character WALL-E and Eve are great, I actually found myself care for them. WALL-E is sort of this mini garbage truck robot that compresses junk into cubes and stacks them like a Jenga puzzle every day to form sky scrapers. He's just such a cute and charming character from the way his body is shaped which makes him look like E.T. The way he interacts with things which has a naive childlike sensibility like with a ping pong or fire extinguisher, sounds he makes and just simple gestures which make him seem a little unsmooth but most importantly human.<br/><br/>Same with Eve whom is a beautiful sleek advanced egg shaped robot whose mission is to explore the earth for habitability and report it, but what truly makes her great is she has a mature personality about her.<br/><br/>The love story with the two is sweet both are sort of a strange Adam and Eve like couple since they have the earth to themselves hence the name of the robot for irony. It's actually believable because both these robots actually feel human, you can actually feel the emotion not so much from the words, both don't say much except one word their name most of the time or make certain noises which give the suggestion of certain interaction and emotion through their actions and body language. It reminds me of the Charlie Chaplin from ""City Lights"" which relied on actions but most of all was about an unlikely but beautiful pair.<br/><br/>Fromt he first interaction which is a little unsmooth, WALL-E we see is slowly trying to get a bit close to Eve to talk but it doesn't go right at first because else is focused on business right now or just things he's a bit of a dork. But of course she does eventually let him talk to her when she feels frustration and loneliness. And of course he does win her robot heart from his funny but warm personality and charm. From showing her all the great things the world has to offer like a Rubik cube she solves in one minute, and of course the musical ""Hello Dolly"" not my favorite musical though I like a song or two from their soundtrack. My favorite moment I found romantic was when both of them fly together in space. They both kiss in a way by simply touch their heads together exchanging a small static electricity bolt. All this was just romance at it's best because it's done perfectly, even though it's between two robots it was their feelings that made their love feel very human.<br/><br/>We saw into WALL-E and Eve's heart and soul but WALL-E and Eve saw into our own.<br/><br/>Rating: 4 stars"

People here show that they are rather ignorant of the Japanese tradition of animated films. Claiming this to be the best animated film of all time is like claiming that some European film is the best film of all time without seeing any American or Japanesre film: the simple fact is that Japan dominates animation to a greater degree that the US dominates live action films. Therefore, one should educate himself or herself before claiming that this film is the ""best ever made"", without even having the knowledge of films made outside his/her own country! That's simple stupid national chauvinism of the greatest degree.<br/><br/>The United States lacks animated cinema. Watch the work of Makoto Shinkai, Mamoru Hosoda, Satoshi Kon, Mamoru Oshii, Hayao Miyazaki (already mentioned), Isao Takahata and others to understand what animation can really do. The fact is that Wall-E lacks the complexity and depth of the top of the line of animation."

","The Earth is covered in garbage. Humans left for outer space. Wall-E, a waste allocation load lifter robot, is all that remains of the initial clean-up crew of robots. The movie opens with Wall-E collecting the garbage, compacting it into cubes, and stacking them in endless piles all over the desolate planet. The viewer is urged to really open their eyes to the environmental issues we face globally. The opening scene prophetically takes the viewer through a potential scenario of environmental destruction. The small robot also has a cockroach companion and works from dawn till dusk. Wall-E finds items in the garbage that interest him; he takes these items to a storage pod- home. The robot displays many human characteristics. His continuous routine stops when a rocket lands and leaves. The rocket deploys Eve, an extraterrestrial vegetation evaluator robot, to search the planet. Eve captures the attention of Wall-E immediately. He follows her around and observes her as she explores the bleak landscape for life. He demonstrates our need for companionship. She eventually notices him and introductions are made. Suddenly a dust storm arises, and Wall-E whisks Eve away to the storage pod-home. Once inside, he shows her items from his collection. Among those items, a clip from a musical on a VHS tape; they begin to dance. Then, he presents Eve with a plant, like a man would present a rose to a woman. Eve immediately stores the plant, goes into a sort-of hibernation mode, and sends a signal to be picked up. During this time, Wall-E takes Eve on a boat ride, sits on a bench to watch the sunset, and shelters her with an umbrella while it rains. This shows the need for companionship that reverberates in the deepest desires of the human race. Wall-E even attempts to hold Eve's hand several times throughout the movie. In my opinion, Wall-E is a truly great movie that has a message for viewers of all ages. Best of all, I have only described a small portion of the movie. There is much more to this beautiful animated film."

","WALL-E is amazing. While half of the movie is without talking, it shows the story of two robots, that how they fell in love with each other. One of the robots is a WALL-E, dirty robot that is male and the other one is a modern, clean robot that is female. When she comes to earth, she searches the place where she landed, and she meets WALL-E. WALL-E falls in love with her, and tries to enjoy her with his stuff. And then WALL-E gives her a special gift, a vase with a plant. Then there is a part when WALL-E is in a giant spaceship that meets humans, as they are really fat. So, when the captain of the spaceship saw that plant, he saves it, because that plant was the only way to find the way to earth. Wow, just wow, The plot is incredibly clever and beautifully written. 9.5"

","Here is why I love WALL-E, both the chunky robot and the marvelous film built around him. Because like a really feel-good and mushy rom-com Andrew Stanton's film does not merely touch us. It embraces us and wills us to believe in love at first sight and love that knows no language..<br/><br/>And yet, despite that overwhelming warmth, this is still a film full of ingenuity, nuance and emotion that it actually makes an everlasting impression on you. Not to mention, the film is an absolute triumph of filmmaking wonder.<br/><br/>Let's also not forget that it is most unusual romance we have seen in ages.<br/><br/>It is 2700 AD and humans have officially left an over-polluted Planet Earth. Defunct satellites cram up the atmosphere while land has become one huge dumping ground. Humans exist, or rather thrive, in a grandstanding utopia in the form of massive spaceships that are up away in open space- that is what the advertisements tell us. It is a bleak world, littered with our wastes but still striking. It is benign and calm but strikingly barren and empty. And for a hardworking robot cleaning and sorting out the trash, it is also pretty lonely.<br/><br/>Enter WALL-E. No, don't bother yourself with memorizing the full name. Shaped like a solid chunk of rusted and dirty metal with binocular eyes that light up with wide-eyed curiosity and wonder here is a hero to root for. WALL-E is self-aware and that is exactly why he has survived longer than his other monotonous counterparts. He is falling prey to the routine task of cleaning up the Earth, but a plucky roach ends up being a good buddy. But still our unlikely hero is a loner.<br/><br/>Until. The sky lights up and a massive rocket lands. And here enters a new robot. Eve is a sleek and shiny machine with a mission. She is alert, a bit paranoid but nevertheless charming. And you know the rest. WALL-E inevitably falls for her and vows to win her love, even if it takes him to the universe.<br/><br/>Sure, one may be thinking of this as regular rom-com stuff but once the plot actually kicks in, the viewer is swept of his feet. The screenplay by Stanton himself is one of the finest scripts we ever had in recent times. Stanton is best known so far as one of the minds behind the rapid-fire witty banter in films like 'Toy Story' and its sequels. But here, he keeps it silent throughout while wonderfully conjuring up the romance between WALL-E and EVE and the background behind them. It is a superb script packed with little touches of detail and nuance in the romance between the two. And as the story continues in the second half, whisking us away into the reaches of deep space utopia, the films remains solidly scripted and taut as ever, once again scoring in nuance and emotion.<br/><br/>This brings me to talk about the animation. Well, Pixar, I have got to hand it to you. The film sparkles thanks to Stanton's vision and how he and his team of artists, designers and illustrators bring to life a world that is downright spectacular yet utterly believable. The barren, trash-littered landscape of Earth, WALL-E's den inside a freight container with a rack full of the items that he has salvaged from rubbish and an improvised TV set, and finally, the space and the immense spaceship Axiom with its buzzing, futuristic cityscapes and hyperactive robots, all look truly spectacular and mesmerizing. And believe me, there is an urgent, immediate style to the film that lends it even credibility. The hand-held and urgent swipes and shots capture WALL-E's routine life with a fast pace while the textured animation and fluid character animation knock us off.<br/><br/>Like most Pixar films, the little visual touches are forever present and Stanton is admirably unafraid to make them work in the entire process of storytelling. Together with the meticulously detailed animation work and his nuanced writing, he gives us layer-cakes of moments. Just take this. WALL-E finds a ring from the trash. But, as much as he is a helpless romantic (yeah, he even watches a romantic clip from 'Hello Polly', oh, Wow!), he find the hinges of the box far more interesting. It is a classic revelation and Stanton drives it home with gutsy simplicity. Or in WALL-E and Eve's first rendezvous inside his container home, where he introduces her to his TV set and even hands her objects like a bubble film and a bulb! The film does dabble with themes of pollution and later, as the film takes off to space, there is a darkly comic vision of people driven to lethargy over centuries of easy living. But Stanton has smartly kept the themes in check while ensuring that we react to everything from the humor and romance to even the darker moments with wide-eyed (no, WALL-E-eyed) wonder. And boy, he delivers a miracle that grabs our eyeball till the end.<br/><br/>Much of WALL-E feels like as if Charlie Chaplin's comic and romantic misadventures are relocated to a Mad Max-like dystopia and later to deep space which has never looked so deep and wonderful since 2001 A Space Odyssey (some influences from that iconic film are present). But Stanton's film is eventually much more than an amalgamation of ideas. It is certainly not just an experiment, unlike 2001 and it is not just a heartfelt comedy. It is much more than any of these and this is why it is one of the best films of the last decade."

","Wall-e is a great movie, entertaining in every respect. I saw it by chance last week, and I was overwhelmed. Its one of those movies that everyone can enjoy - kids, grandparents, everyone. <br/><br/>I won't go into the details here as that would probably be a waste of time. But the best part for me is how the story unfolds and how you come to understand and see what is going on without any dialog to support it. That is the beauty of this film for me - the detective work that is required on the part of the viewer in lieu of any dialog (until later on in the movie). Us human beings are naturally curious creatures just as Wall-e is. Without dialog (which in most movies these days isn't worth squat anyway), that curiosity is intensified, and I for one really enjoyed the challenge here of deciphering messages encoded in body language, etc instead of being spoon fed a predictable plot. And it wasn't a predictable plot. By the time I started seeing the fat humans careening around the space station, I began to understand what was going on, and I knew the plant carried by Eve was an important part of the story. The rest of the plot then soon fell into place (along with some dialog now). When that happened, I smiled and felt very satisfied. <br/><br/>Cute movie. Very fast paced (almost to the point of being dizzying). There is that familiar twist sometimes where the robots come across as more human than the humans. But more than just acting like humans, Wall-E and Eve were childlike. Their muteness combined with curiosity made perfect sense then as a small child is also mute and curious. And also, just like children, their lives were full of discovery and mischief. Neither were particularly ""self-aware"" meaning we do not know if they knew or understood who they really were nor what their place in the universe was. But they did understand emotions - love in particular. That ruled and the big picture - man's role in all of this as their creator and all - was not of much concern to them. <br/><br/>So all of this I found refreshing and fun. I would really enjoy seeing this movie again. In addition to the story, we also had good music and some pretty cool visuals. And to anyone who would have rather replaced the ""too-cutsie"" love story with lots of action and violence - I say ""look, pal - take your pic among the hundreds of animated, fantasy and sci-fi movies that glorify action and violence, and then tell me we can't, FOR ONCE, focus instead on love and a positive message about mans place on this planet."" Thats all I gotta say -"

Even then, however, there were dialogue cards and such. This movie simply uses movement and context as expression.<br/><br/>I didn't find the plot to be TOO unique or amazing, but I did enjoy the plot. It wasn't too deep but had some worthwhile themes.<br/><br/>How Pixar managed to get me to CARE about the characters was pretty amazing, it truly manages to prove that actions speak louder than words.<br/><br/>I don't think this is a movie that I will watch over and over, but it was something that I enjoyed."

","Pixar has done it again! They created another beautiful, visual masterpiece with a great story for all ages. As of yet, I have not seen a Pixar movie I disliked.(I have not seen Cars 2 yet.) This movie shows probably the best robot romance in the history of films. This romance is somewhat believable as well.<br/><br/>This film is about a worker robot who seems to be the only remaining moving thing left on Earth. However, a ship drops off a robot looking for signs of life. When the worker robot, Wall-E, lay eyes on her for the first time, that is when the magic begins.<br/><br/>This is one of the best Pixar films I have seen better than all of them with the exception of the Toy Story trilogy.

"StephenBurg","8","0","1","3 June 2012"," ""2001 Rip-Off"" is Great
","WALL-E is another movie from the emotional ""geniuses"" at PIXAR. The movie is about a lonely trash compactor in the future (who coincidentally looks like the robot from Short Circuit) who sees a female robot and falls in love with. He shows her a plant, then she goes into a deep sleep and is taken into space, where WALL-E follows her and meets dim-witted, obese humans. From then on, the movie pretty much goes down the same way as Stanely Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" does with an environmental message. The opening sequence is great, opening with a song from ""Hello, Dolly"" and setting up the story with little dialogue, which could be boring for some. The animation is great, like PIXAR has a knack for. There is an emotional appeal in this movie. It's not as sad as ""Up"" or the ""Toy Story"" movies or ""Finding Nemo,"" though. If you like animated movies, you might want to watch this. ****/*****"

","Wall-E is Pixar's best work, and my favorite movie of all time. The plot is clever and original, the characters are amazing, and everything about it is amazing. In my opinion, all the Pixar movies are good if not amazing, but this one is definitely the best. I cannot understand how someone couldn't love this. Also, the movie is funny. The short film about Wall-E, Burn-E, was short, but hilarious. A movie better than this would be really hard to make, but I can see how Pixar could manage it because all their movies are funny, adventurous, and touching. You can also never know in this movie what's gonna happen next. I really can't think of any reason why I don't like this movie. 10/10."

It's all downhill from here. WALL-E ends up helping the human inhabitants of the Axiom return to re-colonize the Earth, although the 'evil' ship's computer tries to stop the return. These super obese human slugs are the mindless descendants of those who wrecked Earth's environment and then abandoned it. They now live in 'blissful' ignorance, entirely dependent on the ship that has been their home for centuries now. These are the last beings that have any business being allowed to settle on a still fragile and barely recovering Earth. WALL-E, however, makes it possible and effectively facilitates the final destruction of Earth's environment.

","WALL-E is the love story everyone needs to see and feel. Pixar have made one of the most brilliant love stories ever... with robots. The first major pull is the difference in WALL-E's and EVE's looks and actions. WALL-E is a small rusty robot, almost like the little nerds John Hughes liked to have in his 80s teen movies: he's nervous, with a slight hunch in his personality, and he's quite depressed, because there actually isn't anyone on Earth for him to be with (bar a small cricket he briefly befriends). EVE is the popular girl at school, the one everyone looks up to, except there's only WALL-E to look up to her. She's an Apple-esque machine, floating through the air so fluently. Earth's landscape in this film is astounding; a vast space covered in dusty orange landscapes and filled with metallic cubes of waste. But the big shock is the humans of the future. They're confined to hovering chairs and are so fat that they look like they could explode at any moment. But they're lovable characters and they show a lot of compassion. OTTO is one of 2008's greatest villains, alongside The Dark Knight's Joker. His control over the ship shows how computers could take over our future. He is SCARY. And, as with any good story, there's a moral for people young and old: be nice to the planet; Pick up your rubbish; And keep your loved ones close."
"hays-chantal","9","0","1","1 March 2012"," Deeper Meaning
","The 2008 Disney Pixar animation, WALL-E (Andrew Stanton) reaches towards children's interest, as WALL-E, a cute and friendly waste collecting robot, offers a hungry and curious personality. Within this century, mankind abandons earth to rid from the over production of garbage, leaving zero biological life on earth.so they think. EVE, a newly upgraded robot is sent to earth to search for any source of life to prove that the earth can still sustain life. Throughout her time on earth, Eve discovers a plant and eventually, the two robots interact and fall deeply in love. However, EVE returns to the ""New Human World"", a highly advanced space ship floating in space, separating from her new friend. WALL-E decides he doesn't want to be lonely, therefore follows his love. On the space shuttle, humans are extremely obese and unhealthy as robots are working for them. However, in the end the humans realize earth is their true home and eventually return. Long story short, by protecting our world, we are protecting ourselves. This message is represented through this kid friendly animation. Personally, this is brilliant as this provides young minds to learn about the importance of a clean environment and allows children to become excited for Reduce, Reuse and Recycle, as they too can become a good role model like WALL-E. The animation technology found within this Pixar film is extremely clear and over time begins to feel like reality. This film is for all ages, and contains an important deeper meaning that today all humans should recognize and listen too."
"J_Charles","Null","0","1","10 November 2011"," Wow. A very deep film yet entertaining for the kids
","How does Pixar do it? Their animation is first rate. The way they can bring life to characters is absolutely unparalleled. That feat is made all the more remarkable here because there is actually very little dialog - at least not between the main characters. All the emotions, communication, and 'humanization' of the robots happens with their eyes, their body language, and their tonal vocalizations. It's stunning to behold.<br/><br/>And yet that's not their greatest achievement here. How does Pixar find the best stories time and time again? It's amazing how you can watch all the futuristic sci-fi out there and yet Wall-E may be the most accurately prophetic one out there. Can you not see us in an era where people are so enamored with their smart-phones where they are constantly bumping into each other because they don't see the people around themselves? Even the sports they engage in are virtual - rendering the people into milk-shake eating babies who do as they're told This incredible achievement doesn't just stop there. It's an entertaining tale for the kids as well. They'll like the action scenes. They'll love the robots and how they can interact without words. And the film, dealing with such bleak material, somehow finds a way to have a hopeful ending.<br/><br/>10/10"

","WALLE Rating: A <br/><br/>So let me just start by saying that after 13 years and 9 movies Pixar has not had a single failure yet, movie after movie have been wonderful movies with memorable characters and great stories and WALLE is no exception. Andrew Stanton (director of Finding Nemo) has created another success for the Pixar library as well as a cast of characters who you can't help but fall in love with. <br/><br/>From the opening credits until the final shot this movie grabs a hold of you and immerses you into it's world to a point where you are no longer watching a movie you are living an experience. The animation visuals are breathtaking with backgrounds that feel almost real and characters that never once feel anything short of alive. <br/><br/>This movie illustrates very clearly that animators are in fact the primary actors in these type of movies; here there is almost no traditional dialogue and a voice cast of only 5 actors (most of which are extras) yet these characters all still feel completely real. The animators put on great performances in this movie and the movie is, in my opinion, even more powerful with the lack of spoken words. <br/><br/>There is some credit to be given to the sound department as well. Ben Burtt (sound designer for Star Wars and Indiana Jones) did a masterful job at filling this universe with believable sounds as well as being the ""voice"" of WALLE and most of the other robots (that is by manipulating sound effects to create a voice). Most people don't think about this but in animated pictures there are no on set microphones so every sound you hear has to be created by hand, recorded, and synced with the picture, and Ben Burtt's wonderful sound design added a layer of depth and realism that makes this picture that much better. <br/><br/>WALLE is so far my favorite movie of the summer (with Iron Man holding second place). It is not only a spectacular feat in animation, but also a wonderful love story with amazing characters, great laughs, and a powerful message. Andrew Stanton and the rest of the folks at Pixar have truly created a beautiful masterpiece for the art of animation. <br/><br/>NERD STUFF: As per Pixar tradition there are several ""inside jokes"" to spot, as you're watching WALLE look for Rex (the Dinosaur from Toy Story), the Pizza Planet Truck (also from Toy Story), and A113. There are also several nods to Apple Computers and I think I may have spotted a Jungle Cruise boat from Disneyland but it's hard to say, I'll have to wait until it comes out Blu-ray to know for sure. Also there is a little something after the credits, it's not much, but it is something."
"Boba_Fett1138","8","0","1","19 June 2011"," It does a lot with as minimal stuff as possible.
","This sounds like a very unlikely movie, even- or perhaps even more so for an animated one. Its main character can't speak and for part of the movie he is the only one on screen, rolling the Earth, which has been abandoned and turned into one big garbage wasteland.<br/><br/>It makes ""WALL·E"" an original movie and a bit of a gamble from Disney and the Pixar studios as well. It's a movie that so easily could not had worked out or would had been one that totally got ignored by the younger audiences, due to its main premise. But in both ways the movie worked out, beyond expectations. Not only did ""WALL·E"" became a critically acclaimed movie and also won an Oscar, it also became an huge box office hit worldwide and one of the most talked about and popular movies of the year.<br/><br/>It's simply a very cute movie to watch, with a cute simple story and some very likable characters, that are given some distinctive personalities through their fine animation. It makes this an absolutely captivating movie! You just can't keep your eyes of the screen and also really don't want it to end.<br/><br/>But the movie also has more story in it than you might think. It never really got advertised that way but the movie also does feature an adventurous and even a romantic plot-line in it, consistent with the style of Disney. <br/><br/>I love how they integrated old Earth stuff with a post-apocalyptic future, as well as the clash of WALL-E with even more advanced modern and futuristic stuff. All of these elements are where mostly the movie its comedy comes from.<br/><br/>I think it's also really a nice touch that they let science-fiction sound legend Ben Burtt voice the WALL·E character. Not that is was a very demanding role or anything and his voice got also heavily altered and distorted but a nice gesture nevertheless. Also a nice touch that Sigourney Weaver voices the ship's computer, someone she herself often had to deal with in the 'Alien' movies. Other than that, there aren't any big name actors involved with this movie. And there is no reason why there should. Really the foremost and at times only reason why some big name actors get signed on for a big animated movie is to be able to put his/her name on the posters and advertise with it. ""WALL·E"" simply doesn't need this.<br/><br/>Visually it really is an amazing movie. We have come a long way since the introduction of computer animated movies. Pixar keeps pushing to envelop with basically each of their movies but ""WALL·E"" still remains one of their visual most impressive once, perhaps because of the reason that it's being a science-fiction movie.<br/><br/>Simply a perfectly fun, clean, entertaining movie to watch, for all ages really.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","As I may have mentioned before, I'm quite a big fan of animated films. I have some friends who will only watch anime, but I have a much broader palate. I wasn't going to watch this today when it came up on TV as I had seen it before, but I got enchanted by it all over again and ended up sitting all the way through it (again).<br/><br/>All life has left the Earth, it sounds pretty bleak, but it's not really, they've gone on a big space ship while an army of robots cleans up the place. And now, some 800 years later, there's only one robot left, Wall-e. He spends his days collecting and compacting the garbage and making enormous towers out of it. He's not alone though, and insect, probably a cockroach, is his companion. Wall-e lives in the back of an old truck, where, apart from a bunch of spare parts, he also has a collection of interesting things he's found over the years. Amongst these is a video of an old musical that he plays every night, and a plant that he found.<br/><br/>One day he's going about his business when a spacecraft arrives and drops off another robot, EVE. After a bit of a sticky start, they begin to talk and Wall-e shows EVE around. She has spent most of her time going around scanning everything she sees, looking for something. Later, with a big storm brewing, Wall-e takes EVE to his 'house'; he shows her some of the things he's collected. When she sees the plant she immediately puts it inside her chest and shuts down. Wall-e is dumbfounded and tries to revive her, but fails. All he can do is wait with her until the spacecraft returns, which eventually it does. As it takes off, Wall-e stows away and he is taken to another, much larger ship, the Axiom where the humans are. This is where things start to get interesting, so I'll leave it here.<br/><br/>This is a very well made film with some great comic touches, particularly in the opening scenes. The first third of the film was really engaging and very enjoyable, however, as soon as Wall-e and EVE make it to the Axiom it becomes slightly more predictable, which is a shame. There isn't a great deal of dialogue, but it was all done well, honourable mentions go to the voice talents of, Ben Burtt as Wall-e & M-O, Elissa Knight as EVE and Jeff Garlin as Captain McCrea.<br/><br/>This is the second time I've seen this film and I can say I enjoyed it much more second time around. The filmmakers are great at giving characters to the robots, even though they cannot really talk properly. I found the opening scenes particularly good, although I didn't much care for the song from the musical that they kept playing. I guess Wall-e is so appealing because he looks a little like the iconic alien, E.T. As I said, the latter scenes when they make it to the Axiom do get a little predictable, but I still found it very enjoyable Recommended.<br/><br/>My score: 8.7/10"

","Pixar has raised the modern animation to new highs in the last decade with hits like Toy Story (and its amazing sequels), Monsters inc., Finding Nemo and Ratatouille, among others, that can be considered now as animated classics.<br/><br/>However, their success lies not only in achieving first-class entertainment with some of the most advanced technology in order to achieve the most outstanding animation, but also in telling stories that adults can relate to easily (like parenthood, childhood fears or the pains of becoming adult): in other words, animation stops being seen as entertainment for children WALL*E, a curious story that goes from science fiction to romantic comedy as it used to be done in the silent era of cinema (and whose biggest influence is Chaplin) is one of Pixar's most remarkable achievements so far.<br/><br/>The year is 2116 and the earth has been abandoned by humanity as a result of excessive levels of pollution. The powerful company Buy N Large (which is given to understand is the one that rules the Earth at that time) has a cleaning program with thousands of robots programmed to collect debris. This program failed and only one robot remains standing after 700 years. This little robot called WALL*E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth) develops a great sense of curiosity for the material things humans ever enjoyed on earth. However, one day he meets EVE, a mysterious search unit sent by the human for which WALL*E develops an attraction that will take them even to the very space and it decide the destiny of the human race.<br/><br/>Thus, it unfolds a very captivating and genuine love story that in the wrong hands could have been absolutely ridiculous or misplaced, but thanks to the ability of Andrew Stanton (the director of the movie) and his team the audience creates a total empathy for WALL*E and his curiosity to know more about the world (and EVE, of course).<br/><br/>In addition, the environmental reading that gives the film fits perfectly for this times when is required to create environmental awareness.

That unlikely hero was WALL-E; and his adventure, when it burst onto the big screen that summer resulted in an enormous box office windfall for Disney/Pixar totaling close to $600 million, plus a well-deserved Oscar for Best Animated Film.<br/><br/>The titular character of the piece is, for all intents and purposes, a squat trash compactor, whose name WALL-E stands for Waste Allocation Load Lifter-Earth Class. His job, as has been the case for 700 years, is to clean up the mess that humanity left behind on Earth, compacting various bits of trash into cubes, and whiling away his spare time with a cockroach and a surviving VHS copy of the 1968 film musical HELLO DOLLY. Wall-E, however, has also gained a sense of of self-awareness and insatiable human curiosity, as can be seen by his consistently wan expression; and when he sees a small sprout of a plant poking up from underneath an otherwise polluted ground, he senses a change in the air. He is then visited upon by a female robot called EVE (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator, who), upon learning of the existence of the plant in Wall-E's possession, takes both it and Wall-E up to the intergalactic cruise ship ""Axiom"", now in its 700th year of existence, to prove that life on Earth is coming back.<br/><br/>All of this, of course, is new to Wall-E, as are some fairly disturbing things, like the non-stop consumption of the passengers, fed to them by the same mega-conglomerate, Buy N Large (BNL) that fatally polluted Earth, and their morbid obesity; and the conflict between the ship's captain and the on-board computer named Auto, whose red eye is so much like HAL in director Stanley Kubrick's 1968 sci-fi masterpiece 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. With Eve's help, however, and after many wacky misadventures, Wall-E helps the captain retake control of the ship, and steer it back towards Earth once the existence of the little plant becomes fact. In the meantime, Eve and Wall-E begin an electronic love affair that has been building from that first portentous meeting.<br/><br/>The swath of digital animation films to come from Disney/Pixar has been nothing short of amazing, but they definitely outdid themselves with WALL-E. Apart from the genuine likability of Wall-E himself (as engaging a non-human character as any since E.T.), there are numerous homages to films as varied as SILENNT RUNNING (the 1972 ecological cult classic), George Lucas' low budget 1971 feature debut THX 1138; the Oscar-winning 2006 documentary AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH; Spielberg's A.I.: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE and MINORITY REPORT; and even Ridley Scott's 1982 sci-fi/film-noir masterpiece BLADE RUNNER. And one must also congratulate director and co-writer Andrew Stanton for slipping in the homages to ""2001"", with the AUTO/HAL connection and the uses of Richard Strauss' ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" and Johann Strauss' ""The Blue Danube"", even if most children viewing WALL-E likely haven't seen that masterpiece or the other films this one references...at least not yet.<br/><br/>There are also several ironic comments about human consumption and greed, personified by BNL's CEO Shelby Forthright, amusingly played by Fred Willard, and whose rhetoric of ""stay the course"" should sound vaguely familiar to any adult viewer. The messages, however, are never delivered in a heavy-handed fashion; and the focus remains on the relationships that Wall-E develops throughout the film, both with his fellow robots, especially Eve, and with the humans on-board the ""Axiom""; and all of this is aided by Newman's fantastic and futuristic original score.<br/><br/>The end result in WALL-E is a three-pronged success: a typically successful animated comedy; a science fiction voyage; and a reminder of how we can change our planet for the better while there is still time left to do so."

","I think that it was obvious that this almost perfect animated feature would win the Academy Award. The competition that year was Bolt and Kung Fu Panda. Many were probably amazed that Panda didn't win, but I thought that that particular movie was a little too much premise (Panda doing Kung Fu) and not enough story.<br/><br/>Everything is near perfect here, the story, the animation, yes, even the voices. Don't be fooled by the marketing. This is not a silent film, although much of the first half have very little dialogue.<br/><br/>Since everybody is familiar with the plot at this point, it would be a serious waste of time to recap it. Wall-E, though an almost silent character, is perhaps the richest, most expressive character in years, in animated or live-action films.<br/><br/>Props also to Jeff Garlin, the human who discovers the truth about Earth's atmosphere. He has always been one of my favorite actors, although most of his work has been in lousy sitcoms.<br/><br/>The way the humans are designed is of course brilliant and fits nicely into the story. What else could you do if you were stuck in a situation like this? It is not grotesque and it shouldn't offend anybody.<br/><br/>So, after a couple of years of being screwed out of awards, (Happy Feet? Winner of 2007? What the hell was that?) Pixar is finally recognised as no. 1 once again. Don't get me wrong. There is enormous talent in all the other studios, PDI, Sony and even Disney themselves, but nobody has reached Pixar's level of sheer masterful blending of all elements that make animated features so enjoyable."

","I was won over by the creativity and the feel good effect of the movie. It was, when last I checked, number 49 in the top rated movies of all times in IMDb and was the number one animation. I liked the lessons the movie so subtly delivers to the targeted audience (don't think it's my generation). There are more lessons than I initially thought, and they are about caring for a friend, caring for life, how fragile and precious life is and that it takes will and a certain amount of courage to do the right thing when all is working to deny us that momentum. <br/><br/>I would like to think parents and teachers can make good use of this movie. The thought that went into this project, the attention to details and the keen sense of what stimulates and captivates the interest of the audience makes the movie very deserving of its high rating. If you have watched the special features of the DVD-Blue Ray disc, you appreciate all that went into the production. I have but only two animation movies; this one is the second but my favourite one.

","For a film consisting of an animated cast of a junk collecting and compressing robot with the vocabulary consisting of three to five words and his best friend the shy of words cockroach this excels. Pixar have produced a beautiful version of a broken down abandoned, rubbish infested planet earth that does have visually stunning backdrops which wall-e wiz's around tidying and collecting fun human memorabilia. The film starts in amusing fashion and continues to impress when eve a device that looks like it was created by apple is sent down to earth to scan for signs of life by the remains of human life that live on a super ship unaware of what life on earth was once like, and hope to find signs that life us now sustainable so they can return. Wall-E falls for eve and trys in many comic scenes to win her attention. Once wall-e returns with eve to the space station uninvited with proof of life on earth the film suffers for the first time as characters get a little lost and Disney and Pixar try to teach us some moral lessons in that we need to take more responsibility for our own existence. The film ends really well in typical Pixar fashion robots teaming together fighting against an auto pilot and various other robots that don't want the humans to return to earth. This is a brilliant heartwarming film by Pixar that sits well with the likes of toy story in terms of trying new things and continuing to make us laugh in different ways."

","Rating: +5 <br/><br/>Humans left the uninhabitable earth 700 years ago to live in luxury aboard a huge space ship. Left alone on the planet was Wall-E, a little robot who endlessly collects trash, compacts it, and neatly stacks the cubes in sky-high stacks. He finds many interesting things in his job, but every night as he watches the romantic songs from his video of ""Hello, Dolly!"" he sighs wistfully and wishes he could find someone to love.<br/><br/>I wasn't prepared for how moving this wonderful movie would be. The early scenes showing Wall-E painfully alone and longing for love are absolutely heartbreaking. Happily, love does come in the form of a robot named EVE, sent to earth to detect plant life.

""WALL-EEEEE!!!""<br/><br/>There's lots of fun and high-speed action aboard the huge spaceship and some guilty insights into the future of mankind (fat, lazy slobs catered to by robots).

","While other animation studios are still digging into the same generic type of stories and characters that brought them to the dance years ago, Pixar continues to re-imagine the landscape of their craft.<br/><br/>The best evidence for this lies in their latest offering, ""Wall-E."" In short, it's beautiful, even breathtaking in parts. In terms of animation, this is Pixar at the top of their game.<br/><br/>When audiences aren't wooing over the latest technical achievements of the studio, they will be poignantly immersed in one of the finest love stories Disney has ever produced.<br/><br/>Wall-E, Waste Allocation Load Lifter, Earth-Class, is designed to clean up planet Earth from the enormous amount of material waste covering land once home to life. More than just a robot, Wall-E has developed the most powerful emotion of all: love.<br/><br/>When humans in space send another robot, Eve, to detect whether there is still life on Earth or not, Wall-E finds himself in love with a sleek white messenger sent on a mission.<br/><br/>Many will point to the environmental messages found in ""Wall-E,"" and they are abundant. The idea that our consumerist society could get to a point where there was more human waste on our planet than actual life is daunting to say the least.<br/><br/>There's also a warning that such a society built on this concept will become increasingly lazy and ultimately despondent to raw emotion which Wall-E craves. These themes should be commended more than anything else because Disney and Pixar actually had a will strong enough to put these ideas into perhaps their most mainstream film of the year.<br/><br/>To label Wall-E as a part of some environmentally sound movement would be to undermine the core of the film. More than a message film or an animated one, ""Wall-E"" is a romantic comedy, plain and simple.<br/><br/>One can go on and on about the beautiful effects and flawless character design, but when all is said and done, ""Wall-E's"" quest is to gain the love and affection of Eve; saving the world, ironically, is an objective that just kind of happens in the middle of his journey.<br/><br/>The cinematic nods to previous works are endearing. One can clearly see the influence of ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" but even more influential works seem to be the early efforts of famous silent film comics Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin.<br/><br/>In fact, immediately after my initial ""Wall-E"" viewing, I couldn't help but think of the film as a space version of ""City Lights,"" Chaplin's greatest work, which just happened to be a silent one.<br/><br/>The robots, the world, even the universe, tend to remain silent, but love speaks for them. In the current world of film, it's easy for a critic to declare a film an instant classic or a new masterpiece; such words easily flow out of our mouths after seeing a great work.<br/><br/>However, it remains difficult for us to gush over a film with such affection and admiration as I have done for this one. ""Wall-E's"" not perfect, but no heart truly is. It can only do its best, and that's what this film does."
"filmsbythefire","9","0","1","14 April 2010"," Thank you! Proof that good kids films are still possible
","Amidst the Disney takeover, it's so refreshing to know that companies like Pixar are still ploughing valiantly on to make good children's films, which can also be enjoyed by the rest of the family. I am at least a few years above the target age range, yet I'd still class this movie in my top twenty, perhaps top ten. It really is a wonderful movie that children of all ages will adore. It shows that not everything has to be about sex, money and violence, and even the slightly stereotypical 'male character gets the female character' scenario is so much sweeter when applied to two beings which shouldn't have emotions at all. The concept of the film - about robots ultimately teaching humans how to be human again, is pulled off spectacularly, with surprisingly endearing robotic stars. The humans, fat and lazy after 700 years on a luxury space-liner, have their eyes opened to their pathetic existence by the innocent little Wall-e. The humans are not one-dimensional, helpless creatures - they evolve over the course of the film, particularly the captain, as they are slowly re-awoken to their old way of life back home. This is one thing a good film must do; develop its characters, in order to let the audience relate to them, and feel for them. Many live-action 'adult' movies no longer achieve this, so Wall-e truly is remarkable for doing it so well. The conclusion is good too - a happy ending, but one which has to be worked for, and there are tense moments when we wonder if everything really is going to work out. Again, this is an example of how a happy ending should be done - it should never be obvious from the start that everything will be fine, because it will be much sweeter if it feels like the characters have earned it. I had almost no problems with this film - the scenery is beautifully rendered; some scenes look so real that it's very easy to forget this is animation (until the humans appear at least). The use of live-action footage for the earlier humans was clever; I was less-impressed with the more cartoon-ish appearance of the new generation of blubbery humans, though I appreciate this was done deliberately to emphasise their soft, colourful lifestyle in contrast to Wall-e's harsh, derelict world back on Earth. Overall, an absolutely amazing film, which will certainly give the kids something to talk about, and will hopefully restore all you elder's faith in the children's film industry, as it did for mine. It can still be done, people. And Wall-e shows us that."

WALL-E showed me that we have to appreciate what we have and be thankful for that. Every moment in that movie sends a message of love and peace. Even thou, I was watching movie at home; I was so amazed that I bought the whole collection of toys from WALL-E. There are movies that I can see only once and there are movies that I can watch again and again; WALL-E is one of those movies that I watch at least once a week, and every time there is something new, that I did not notice before. There are a lot of details in the movie that make the perfect combination. There is no point for me trying to explain how great the movie WALL-E is, you have to see it yourself."

To be inside the IMDb top 50 with the likes of such cinema classics like Saving Private Ryan, Apocalypse Now, Goodfellas, Star Wars, Pulp Fiction etc etc - I'm sorry but it's just not that worthy. I think the world has fallen in love with WALL.E the character not WALL.E the movie which is fair enough as he is a wonderfully adorable little guy but as a whole the story (involving the humans) going on behind WALL.E and EVE is pretty ridiculous.

It's several hundred years into the future and Earth is void of all human life. As the world became more devastating by pollution, what remained of human-kind left Earth on an intergalactic cruise ship. For hundreds of years Wall-e has been cleaning up waiting for the day that his curious mind can be settled. He watches old videos and musicals which gets him to think about something more, love. Then a probe named Eve comes down from the ship looking for something and then they both meet. As Wall-e shows Eve how fun it is to be a free spirit she leaves. As Wall-e follows her into space they both go on an adventure that could change the fate of mankind forever.<br/><br/>Seeing this movie is almost like seeing a modern day silent film. The main characters in the movie don't talk (except for the noises they make) which makes the movie even more fun to watch. The Wall-e character is so funny and adorable you just can't help yourself but to say ah from how cute he is.

I loved how he followed another, more sophisticated, robot that was from a ship that floated in space. In the end he eventually said the other robots name which was really touching.

"nomad-54","10","0","1","2 December 2009"," The cream will rise to the top!
","I had no intention of watching WALL-E at all. The only reason I decided to watch this was because I was testing my new DVD recorder and WALL-E was as good a title as any to test the recording function.<br/><br/>To say I was blown away by this stunning masterpiece is a massive understatement. From the opening song and graphics, through the animation (including the imagery of the main title - 'WALL-E'), I was constantly impressed by this movie. I call it a movie because I believe it devalues it to call it purely 'animation'.<br/><br/>The story it tells is both epic and multi-faceted. A love story and an allegorical musing by the Pixar team. Well done! The opening 30 minutes is stunning and touching at the same time. The landscape is so recognisable as being Earth. I've seen so many movies that present a visually anarchic surreal landscape of Earth as they attempt to put their vision on the screen. They generally make me scoff at how rubbish and over-the-top they are. Not this film. The landscape is gorgeous and wholly fits in with the vision the filmmakers are trying to convey.<br/><br/>One thing I believe is that the filmmakers deliberately tried to make WALL-E mimic the emotions of the viewer, and pulled it off almost too well for words. The introduction of EVE when WALL-E goes ""wooo!"" as she spirals up to blast (sonic boom? you're jazzing me!) around the landscape. His ""woah!"" as she takes the plant and hibernates unexpectedly. Another ""woah!"" as he enters the majestic AXIOM for the first time. His cocked head as the AXIOM robots tend to the ship on landing, and the ""oh!"" as he and the captain are told ""it's that easy"" by the BNL president after the video presentation on how to return to Earth. All I can say is that they were my emotions as well! I won't say the film is perfect. The first 30 minutes, including his ride to the AXIOM is as good a piece of cinema as I've ever seen but the rest of the movie, though brilliant in concept, is not as thrilling. I did like the immediacy of the return. The change of all billboards to green and an immediate 10 second countdown once all is confirmed.<br/><br/>I must admit that it never occurred to me that I was meant to shed a tear at the end. I only know this from reading some of the comments here, but I will say that it's been one of the most satisfying films to watch and TRULY gives me hope for the future, NOT for the human race, but for the fact that it's still possible to see well-made mass market films with abstract story lines. Maybe I'll start going back to the cinema to watch movies (but then again, maybe not!).<br/><br/>If you do watch this film make sure you stay to the end of the credits to see WALL-E and EVE possibly hundreds of years in the future admiring the small sapling that's grown into a massive tree.<br/><br/>There's lot's of animated movies being released these days. All I can say IMHO is that when the dust settles in years to come, WALL-E will emerge as the pick of the current lot. Film students will do lectures and write papers on this film. Trust me on that. Pixar cannot better this film. The best they can do is to produce another concept that will be just as brilliant and well-realised.<br/><br/>Finally (aren't you glad, eh), IMHO WALL-E is a Pixar movie in it's purest form. It's basically a full length movie of the bouncing lamp in the Pixar logo. They've changed it's look and called it WALL-E, but anyone can see that he's imbued with that bouncing lamp's personality!<br/><br/>MAGICAL STUFF!"
"Ostrumation","Null","0","1","1 December 2009"," Probably one of Pixar's most daring and ambitious films
","""WALL-E"" is what I'd call a modern day animated masterpiece. Pixar, after all these years, continues to make great films. When I saw this film on its opening weekend back in 2008, I was literally stunned by how good it was.<br/><br/>The film opens with Earth, in the year 2805. Earth is a lonely wasteland, covered in trash. We are introduced to WALL-E (Waste Allocator Load Lifter Earth-Class), a small trash-collecting robot. He turns the trash into cubes that he picks up and stacks, and eventually makes buildings and different structures out of them. He's be doing this for 700 years. He is accompanied by a small cricket. He is only one WALL-E unit functioning. We eventually learn that a mega corporation named Buy N' Large pretty much governed Earth, thus there was mass consumerism and then Earth was covered in trash. The entire population of the planet evacuated in massive BnL ships, while the WALL-E's were built to collect the trash. But it didn't work, and thus humanity stayed in space. All the WALL-E's no longer except one.<br/><br/>WALL-E develops a personality (this can be seen through his massive collection of unique things found within mountains of trash, his interest in ""Hello Dolly"" and his cricket companion) and and feels very lonely. All that changes when a shiny white probe robot named EVE (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evulator) comes down to Earth, searching for plant life. The other day, WALL-E happens to find a growing plant. WALL-E falls in love, and attempts to get her attention, while she acts very hostile at first. Eventually they get to know each other, and she sees the plant that WALL-E has. She remains dormant until a ship collects her and take her to the Axiom, the flagship BnL ship.<br/><br/>All of this is told in probably the most genius 30 minutes in a film. There is no dialogue (with the exception of the BnL advertisements and WALL-E and EVE saying their names), and it was done beautifully. I knew Pixar could do this, and yet they pulled it off, magnificently.<br/><br/>WALL-E and EVE arrive on the Axiom, and we soon find out that humans had relied on technology for years and have had severe bone less and have now become morbidly obese. Pretty soon, the story from there turns into an epic adventure to save the Earth, all leading up to an exciting climax.<br/><br/>Aside from ""WALL-E""'s amazing story and characters, the score composed by Thomas Newman was spectacular. Since he did so well on ""Finding Nemo"", he did extremely well here. The film is a bit of everything: A love story, a sci-fi fantasy and an action-adventure. Like all other Pixar films, the animation is stunning. After all, this is the most expensive animated film ($180 million!). It used some live-action, a first for a Pixar film (on the scenes with a historic BnL CEO Shelby Forthright).<br/><br/>Once again, another Pixar home-run hitter. ""WALL-E"" shows that Pixar is willing to do something very ambitious, and I hope they keep making ambitious films. It's like the days when Walt Disney was at the top of his game. One of the greatest animated films of all-time.<br/><br/>10 out of 10."

This movie lack of conversation can take you to another whole world, even if it is about our own one. The emotions of the feelings are greatly expressed in three principal characters: Wall-E, Eve and the cockroach. Maybe this movie shows what could happen if we do not take care of a our planet, and of course, ourselves. It seems to happen in 700 years from now, but I think we are not so far from that Armageddon. The wrenching part comes when watching Wall-E's actions (because he does not have heart) come up when he finally has the opportunity to hang out with another being; take the risk to be near of the object of his affection; the way he uses all his tenderness to make the humankind have a destiny they would not believe it existed. Like I wrote at the beginning. So far, the best movie I have ever watched. Enjoy it!"
"TheEmulator23","9","0","1","23 May 2009"," It's now great & keeps getting better w/time.
","This is a very good movie but 10's across the board, c'mon now. ""Toy Story & Toy Story 2"" smoke this. I'm sorry but this is just totally overrated just as ""Star Trek"" is being rated right now. They are both good, but great films... no. Pixar has never made a bad film, ever and no other studio can come close to saying that. Granted they have only made 10 films ever but still that is amazing, not to mention they're huge Box office record. Maybe seeing this again someday will spark something in order for me to think it's a perfect film, but I doubt it. I can definitely see why think this is good, it's just not perfect. It shouldn't be in the top 250 that is for sure. Especially since it's above ""Toy Story"" on the list and ""Toy Story 2"" isn't even there at all. Well we shall see which films hold up better in the long run. It didn't help that they just had to stick an environmental message permeating throughout it too. It would be fine if it was a sub-plot not completely smacking you in the face over and over again. We get it we are becoming fat and becoming less and less personal w/each other, check got it, move on. Here's hoping that the new film ""UP"" is better than this & in all likelihood it will be as the ad's alone are fantastically funny. No matter what I think of ""Wall-E,"" Pixar is a legendary studio already which is amazing in it's own right considering it's 1st movie came out less than 16 years ago (""Toy Story"") & it's Box office will surpass $5 billion worldwide not counting merchandising in only 11 films. *UPDATE* 9/16/09.<br/><br/>Watched it again for the 2nd time (love the Streaming Netflix) & it is better the second time around. It is better than the 1st time I saw it. This is one of those movies that I will enjoy watching w/my kids if &/or when I have them. There is almost zero talking until about 25 minutes in, & it manages to tell an excellent story. The Pixar guys would have done just as well in the Silent movie era. It's brilliant complicated yet simple at the same time & it is in moved up in my head as one of the best Animated films ever made. I don't think anything could top ""The Lion King"" w/the great script, voice cast, & one of the best most beautiful music ever done specifically for a movie."

","When I first saw the movie preview for this movie, I knew it was going to be good.<br/><br/>My wife and I went to the theater to watch it, and it was so much better than I thought. The storyline was basic, kids could follow it, great spurts of comedy using what they had. I thought they did a great job on the sound for movie, decent job on the cinematography, great for a simple watch when you want an emotional end.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie for moviegoers and kids.

","Nice wide shots. About time for proper US sci-fi animation with some good selection of wides.<br/><br/>Other then the humans 1/2 way through and some intentional gags with the laser beam... it's fairly well made. Especially the first 15min of silence. It's a risk.. but when combined with the rest it is not.\ And Wall-e looks too much like Short Circuit thingy with a bit of a homage to ET. And I guess they can't afford not to pick a musical, and not some old movie with another angle... like tricolor trilogy, or Wings of Desire, or the raining scene of In Cold Blood.<br/><br/>It's better than Kung-Fu Panda .. on par with Rattatoulle(sp)..but have you seen the animation of Desperaux? that's different (not the logic of the story though)"
"rasilverstorm","10","0","1","12 May 2009"," Wall-E puts a smile on your face
","Whizzing along the galaxy with a huge smile on your face. That is what Wall-E in short is.<br/><br/>For real of course it's a lot more. Next to an amazing piece of animation, which Pixar can be damn proud of, it's mostly the story that makes Wall-E great for young and old.<br/><br/>The music is fantastic, the way they did the voices great. But most of all you will love Wall-E, find him amusing and endearing at the same time. These robot's show it doesn't matter if your made of metal to have a heart.<br/><br/>I recommend anyone who loves humor, animations, love stories and a good message to watch this movie. It'll steal your heart."

","In a sense, WALLE reminded me of 1999's The Iron Giant. Both are about two individuals whom share a mutual appreciation for one another, one agent is a relatively weak and unspectacular subject, alone and living a quiet and unspectacular life – finding companionship in the most oddball of ways be it through insects or small rodents in The Iron Giant's protagonist's case. One day they happen to stumble across another being, something not immediately attached to the 'world' they've been living in – an agent from the 'outside' that comes down, shrouded in mystery but also danger. In the respective films' case, it is The Giant itself and EVE in this particular film. What follows is an appreciation but more importantly, an understanding between the two as they get up to adventures and defend what they believe is right. Those being, The Giant's 'right' to stay on Earth with the boy and mankind's 'right' to return to Earth following evidence of growth.<br/><br/>It was equally refreshing to see a film clearly addressing issues that surround contemporary living, looking at the environmental problem and the consumer driven issues that have acted as a bane of recent living. But WALLE is, apart from these things, a cracking adventure; a chase film of sorts; a film with some very funny and very touching moments in equal measure played out with the best of buddy intentions. The character of WALLE is voiced by a sound designer named Ben Burtt. He voices WALLE with a series of bleeps and electronic noises as this quaint little robot rolls around a desolate Earth. Earth has become a deserted wasteland; a relic of times gone by as heaps of trash have been formed into solid looking structures by robots designed to clean up. Prior life on Earth, it would seem, were encouraged to 'buy large' and look where it got them.<br/><br/>The actions of WALLE himself echo the human's past lives: he is a slave to the system, stuck in the same process of doing what he's programmed to do. Every day he takes his little lunch box out with him; constructs what he's told to do and takes home stuff he doesn't really need for sake of display. The film cleverly humanises WALLE in this way, having him 'wake up' like human beings only his requirement is sunlight rather than exposure to a cold bathroom and a good shower to get things going. But WALLE is more like a human in the feelings department, despite being of the robotic variety. EVE, whose voice artist Elissa Knight brings said robot to life with a similar string of bleeps and electronic voices, is a female droid sent down from a yet unknown location to look for life specimens. EVE's role brings about a certain biblical meaning. If we presume the world has undergone a flood and the ship from whence EVE has come is something that resembles Noah's Ark, then EVE herself is a brilliant white dove, sent out from yonder to discover life and prove that it is safe to return or that the 'flood' has ended.<br/><br/>As a character, EVE carries this smooth and finished post-modern look. Whilst modelled on an Apple Computer from a few years ago, she is initially hostile, destroying anything that moves and actually quite threatening. WALLE 's build of withered, worn and running on caterpillar tracks looks quite inferior, establishing a sense of superiority as to EVE's character and wherever she came from. The event that kicks the film into gear is the offering of a plant to EVE, one that WALLE himself found and plucked. EVE's mission is complete but we are all unaware of the importance just now and her protective shut down sequence allows WALLE to manoeuvre around her whilst eventually come to love her.<br/><br/>Then we discover where EVE came from when the ship comes back for her and the gears change once again. A sense of adventure arises and a new 'space' becomes visible. The ship itself is a disenchronian space, in which people relax and are free to do as they wish with virtual golf and tennis readily available, but with consequence. In amidst this sea of supposed tranquility lies mankind, a drastically overweight and increasingly reliant on machines mankind. Behind the scenes is AUTO, a machine actually voiced by a machine through Apple Computers programme 'MacInTalk'. If he had a fist, it'd be made of iron and if he were in charge, he'd be ruling with it. Inferior or 'broken' robots are rounded up and set off somewhere while when the human's threaten to feel emotion or break away from their 'slumber', it angers AUTO. <br/><br/>But he stands beside incompetent Captain McCrea (Garlin), with an eye always on the bigger picture: eternity in space in which the machines dominate the humans and mankind are unable to learn from their consumer driven mistakes of the past. WALLE director Andrew Stanton even brings a touch of the HAL 9000 to AUTO and moulds him into the shape of a steering mechanism, the kind found on ships of yester-century.<br/><br/>Sewn in amongst all this is a chase to get the MacGuffin mentioned, the development of WALLE and EVE's fondness for one another the general threat that all will be lost, during which rather a lot rests on certain individuals against the odds. The best bit of the love story is when EVE recounts her surveillance tapes and witnesses WALLE truly caring. The film looks great, sounds great and taps into contemporary issues whilst piling on some harmless pop culture for kicks. What more could you ask for from a 21st Century feature animation?"
"CandidlyCandid","Null","0","2","10 April 2009"," High Expectations, Good Results
","When Wall-E was released into cinemas the hype and reviews were all very positive. Everywhere I went, and anyone I talked to mentioned how great Wall-E was, finally I got to sit down and watch it. To start off the movie was good, it was a great ordinary Pixar tale with very detailed animation and a educated look into the future, but despite it's accurate animation and such the movie never really did bring the high enjoyment for me. The characters were great, Wall-E and Eve was lovely but all seriousness I can't see why this movie got raged so many positive reviews when it felt like another Pixar animated movie but with better animation and a realistic look into the future. No doubt it deserved Best Animated Feature at the Academy Awards, it was the best animation of the year by far but I expected something more magical and touching in Wall-E. Critics call it the Best Animated Movie Ever Made, that's a quote I strong disagree on. It just felt like another Pixar Movie. Sorry Wall-E fans but it's nothing that special."
"stuart_copeland","10","0","2","10 April 2009"," Probably the best animated feature of all time
","I've just seen ""WALL-E"" at a pay-per-view channel. I did not have great expectations on this, but when I finally watched it, I was pretty amazed. Pixar Studios, whose films always kicks ass (sorry for that, I couldn't explain it better), does it better the more films they make. I've seen a lot of animated movies, but this one is the very best I've seen so far (and it will be very difficult for upcoming animations to beat ""WALL-E"" down). There has never been a movie that carries a great love story combined with elements of science fiction, comedy and drama. And all that with 50 per cent of the film without dialog. What Pixar shows us here, is a truly masterpiece and a refreshing alternative to the mass of animated movies nowadays. I really enjoyed watching this and I'm sure I will even if I watch it a hundred times. Because this is a film that survives the time. And such movies are pretty rare in times like these. So I count ""WALL-E"" without any doubt to one of the best movies of all time.<br/><br/>10/10"
"I_am_Jacks_Revenge","10","0","1","30 March 2009"," Oh, Pixar....
","I can understand why the 1-star people may not like this movie so much. The first half-hour shows not much progression in plot, there is practically no dialogue for the first part, and the ""voices"" from WALL-E and EVE may repel some. But I find that this stuff helps WALL-E, and I feel that no dialogue enhances the movie because it gives you time to understand WALL-E without anyone talking.<br/><br/>It's the early 29th-ish century. 700 years prior, a certain superbusiness (Buy n' Large) has bought out everything, becoming the only store that people can get stuff. The world has become filled up with so much garbage, everyone has been evacuated from Earth onto a ship (the Axiom) in space. World, this is a warning. They were supposed to be in space for only 5 years, while the Waste Allocation Load Lifters - Earth-Class (or WALL-E, for short) clean up the mess. However, toxicity levels rose, and all units were shut down. The people of Earth were to stay in space for an indefinite amount of time. However, one WALL-E unit (our lovable main character) still was functioning and continued to clean for those 700 years. WALL-E is a small, curious, and all-around caring robot who one can't help but find likable. Over the years, he has collected many fascinating objects--replacement parts, cutlery (including a spork, which he can't decide is a spoon or a fork), Rubik's Cube, etc. He has befriended a cockroach, and watches ""Hello, Dolly!"" every night. He has become curious of love (you seem him often trying to interlock his 'hands' together).<br/><br/>One day, while continuing to do what he was functioned to do, he sees this red dot and tries to follow and catch it. He realizes that a ship is coming down, and tries to bury himself in the dirt. I find his attempt very funny. He sees what the ship is dispatching, an Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator (EVE). He instantly becomes attracted to her (gender is kind of assumed), and tries to win her over. Though she doesn't think much of him, EVE grows to like WALL-E and befriends him. When he shows her a plant that he found earlier, she analyzes it and her system takes it and she goes into standby, you could say. While she is in this mode, WALL-E shows much care towards EVE by watching out for her throughout the days, getting struck by lightning while holding an umbrella over her, and trying to take her on a date. Throughout the movie, we see WALL-E try to hold her 'hand', but with no success. When the ship arrives to take EVE, WALL-E gets on as well, and the adventure really begins.<br/><br/>On the ship, we see that humans have become very overweight from eating Buy n' Large food, no exercise, and have hovering chairs to move their hunks of fat around. They've even gone so far as to being oblivious to their own surroundings. This is another warning, world. Eventually, they will learn in the film what they have become and what they can do to change it.<br/><br/>A heartwarming film with amazing computer-animation, a lesson within it all, and wonderful characters, WALL-E is a animated film that will definitely become a classic. There is a reason that Pixar has won 4 of the Best Animated Picture Oscars since 2001, including this one. I don't know if there will be another like WALL-E."

","This brand-new Oscar winner for Best Animated Feature is an unusual and generally successful Pixar offering (marred by a sag in the middle). The amiable titular character is a robot entrusted with the clean-up of a decimated Earth; typically humanized, he falls for the female probe sent to determine the habitable condition of life on our planet. The design of the film (both the Earth wasteland  familiar architectural landscapes have been replaced by scraps of garbage  and the spaceship to which Wall-E follows his beloved  presciently peopled by laid-back, overweight non-entities) are interesting and quite sophisticated for this type of fare. The eclectic score includes original material (notably Peter Gabriel's Oscar-nominated song ""Down To Earth"") but also a couple of numbers from the musical ""Hello, Dolly!""  seen via an old VHS copy of the 1969 film version which Wall-E is continuously playing.<br/><br/>BURN-E (Angus MacLane, 2008) **1/2 <br/><br/>This slight but harmless short is a made-for-video spin-off of the theatrical animated feature WALL-E (2008) highlighting a very minor character from it and has appropriately been included on that film's DVD edition; it feels like a deleted scene from the main feature, but actually involved a different director. The titular figure this time around is an accident-prone robot  getting to grips with a mischievous signpost  on the spaceship seen in WALL-E (the character  and his mate  even makes a cameo here via scenes lifted from his own vehicle!)."

","This movie really gets off on the right foot - it's tale of inter-robot courtship and conflict amid the ruins of planet Earth is full of character, nuance and charm. I sure don't scoff at the skill that goes in to the characterization of these guys, especially given the initial absence of real verbal content, and there are great visual ideas everywhere. Their exploits remain charming and funny as the action moves up to the space station, where machine fed human-blobs await salvation. But I find the blob-people annoying and TOO cute up against the robots. Worse than this, though, is the machine-tooling of the moral. Listen, kids: Hollywood's sentimental narratives of human progress used to depict change which was led, however unconvincingly, from below. Here it's down to the blob ship captain to save humanity for his underlings. So, for all the explicit urgency of the environmental-catastrophe messaging - and in spite of the identification young viewers are obviously meant to feel with the consciousness-raising robots - the net effect is to reassure the viewer not to worry, that Big Daddy will take care of everything if we just bleep truth to power. I guess Junior will just have to figure out the rest for him/herself..."
"voxhumana","10","0","1","16 March 2009"," A true masterpiece, possibly unparalleled.
","OK I'm not going to actually discuss the film very much, as other reviewers have already done a fine job. Suffice it to see you MUST see this film if you have not done so already. <br/><br/>Instead I'm going to make three very big calls:<br/><br/>Call #1 - *Wall-E is Pixar's best film.* Of course Pixar is the golden child company, responsible for Toy Story and Finding Nemo. (IMHO Pixar's worst effort to date is Ratatouille, which is merely ""truly excellent"".) Now Wall-E is clearly the best film technologically, but this is no surprise as every Pixar film surpasses its predecessors due to the relentless improvement of Pixar's software. However Wall-E also surpasses its siblings in its absolute artistic brilliance, emotional depth, storytelling vision, sublime music and visual language.<br/><br/>Call #2 - *Wall-E is the finest animated film of the ""modern"" (post 1980) era.* A slightly braver call, as I'm now rating Wall-E as superior to the many masterpieces from Otomo, Miyazaki and their peers. (I'm not dismissing Disney here, but I wouldn't put ""Beauty and the Beast"" or ""Lion King"" up for ""best modern era animation"" despite their being very,very good films.)<br/><br/>Call #3 - *Wall-E is the finest animated feature film, ever.* My bravest call but I'm sticking to it. There is a tendency for film fans to not embrace the new. But I just spent a weekend watching many classics - Fantasia, Snow White, Lady and the Tramp, Barefoot Gen, Akira, Spirited Away, etc. And at the end, Wall-E stands triumphant. It really is THAT GOOD.<br/><br/>Sure it's only my opinion, but I know I'm not alone. And if you have yet to see the film, go watch it and decide for yourself. <br/><br/>(PS - While I am throwing around my opinions like they actually matter, let me say that Thomas Newman was absolutely robbed when it came to the Oscar for the score.)"
"wda779","10","0","2","4 March 2009"," Citizen Kane? Gone with the Wind? This movie destroys them all!
","This might be be the best movie ever made. I will leave this question to posterity.

I love Schwarzenegger, Willis, Stallone, Eastwood, etc. Let me tell you that I haven't cried during a movie in my life.......until I saw Wall E. If any movie ever had its' heart in the right place, it is this one. <br/><br/>It is so sad to me that a a hunk of nuts and bolts (Wall E) could draw more emotion from me than any other actual human actor that I wonder why I ever thought Tom Hanks was a great thespian. I cried like a baby throughout this film and my girlfriend had to hold my hand so I wouldn't have a nervous breakdown. Of course, she was in tears also. Maybe it tells us how low we have sunk as a species when a machine has more humanity and heart than we do. God bless the people who made this film for reminding us all of why we have a divine spark within us. <br/><br/>Forget about the fact that the graphics and animation are first rate-this movie is universally meaningful- which is more than I can say for every other movie I have seen. Don't go on living without seeing Wall E. Especially now, when we all need to be reminded of what is most important in life-companionship and love. Eleven out of Ten stars. Trust me."

","Whenever one thinks of animation, one always thinks of the legendary Walt Disney Company. It was Walt who first introduced animation into the fascinating world of cinema with his world renowned landmark masterpiece 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' (1937.) This timeless classic was followed by over thirty more delightful pencil animation creations throughout the rest of the twentieth century. But after the death of the big man in 1966 and their last decent offering 'The Emperor's New Groove' (2000) it seemed that the king had run out of fresh ideas and so  in order to maintain their reputation  clung to the newly formed Pixar for dear life.<br/><br/>Pixar's first full-length CGI motion picture 'Toy Story' (1995)  like Snow White  revolutionised the world of animation and was incredibly well-received by both critics and audiences world-wide. Most of the other creations that we have seen in the last decade have been just as enjoyable, but the more recent releases such as  'Cars' (2006) and 'Ratatouille' (2007)  indicated that the new ruler was starting to decline just as the mouse company had.<br/><br/>However, in the sci-fi romance Wall-E we can certainly see a vast improvement and a new hope. The animation is stunning  no surprises there  and the plot is both original and diverting. However most notably, the characters are much simpler than those of the previous Pixar films and yet they captivate you like no poignant adult drama hero or heroine could ever do. The title character  the last of the Waste Allocation Lift Loader, Earth-Class robots who were sent down to Earth to clean up the huge overload of human waste  is a sweet, tender little thing who will surely touch your heart. His shiny, high-tech girlfriend Eve startles poor Wall-E when on their first meeting, but as the story progresses the two form a beautiful friendship and she begins to feel as deeply for him as we do. The third-most-important character is the slightly imbecilic captain of the space ship built to house the humans until the Earth is once again inhabitable and they can return. The humans of this time  which is roughly seven hundred years from now  live in an artificial, ultra-modern simulation of Earth and are heavily reliant on technology to do just about everything for them. After centuries of living this way the humans have evolved into fat, lazy monsters that can't even walk anymore.<br/><br/>The latest Pixar flick might only barely shine a light on the likes of 'Monsters Inc.' (2001) and 'Finding Nemo' (2003)  the main flaw of this film is that Wall-E keeps almost dying, we all know they wouldn't have the heart to kill him off - but otherwise it is an excellent recovery and a delight to watch. But who do we have to thank for it? Obviously the director Andrew Stanton, the story creator Pete Doctor and the screenplay writer Jim Reardon for coming up with the general imaginative concept of man's dominance leading to such a disaster  but who else? We do have Ben Burtt and Elissa Knight providing the occasional ""Wall-E!"" and ""Eve!"" from the two main characters, Jeff Garlin as the voice of the Captain and the celebrity voices Kathy Najimy, Sigourney Weaver, John Ratzenberger, Fred Willard and Macln Talk in brief cameos. But the real power behind the mesmerising characters  who are the main life source of this film  is definitely the animators, who usually don't get nearly as much credit as they deserve."

","WALL-E has been nominated for Best Original Screenplay, Best Animated Feature, Best Original Score, Best Original Song, Sound Editing, and Sound Mixing at the Academy Awards. Walt Disney Pictures sent WALL-E, alongside Bolt as their entries in the category for Best Animated Feature, but they also pushed for an Academy Award for Best Picture nomination; chairman Dick Cook felt ""If we didn't do it, I don't think we'd be giving the movie its due."" It was not nominated for Best Picture. Only one animated film, 1991's Beauty and the Beast, has been nominated for that award. A reflective Stanton stated he was not disappointed the film was restricted to the Best Animated Film nomination because he was overwhelmed by the film's positive reception, and eventually ""The line is just getting so blurry that I think with each proceeding year, it's going to be tougher and tougher to say what's an animated movie and what's not an animated movie."" WALL-E made a healthy appearance at the various 2008 end of the year awards circles, particularly in the Best Picture category, where animated films are often overlooked. It has won the award, or the equivalent of it, from the Boston Society of Film Critics (tied with Slumdog Millionaire), the Chicago Film Critics Association, the Central Ohio Film Critics awards, the Online Film Critics Society, and most notably the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, where it became the first animated feature to win the prestigious award. It was named as one of 2008's ten best films by the American Film Institute and the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures.<br/><br/>It won Best Animated Feature Film at the 66th Golden Globe Awards and the Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards 2008.

","Something amazing is always expected from the next Pixar project. Coming on the heals of the enormous success of Ratatouille and The Incredibles, comes the team's adventure into space with WALL-E. Perhaps this film is their attempt at minimalism or a what if R2-D2 was alone without his golden companion as a straight man. The story is set some 700 years ahead and WALL-E, alone in a polluted city collects debris from the human age while jokes abound around him that would only be appreciated by humans. That's where we, the audience, come in. Not to worry, humans do come back into the picture and we all know it is darkest before the dawn.<br/><br/>There isn't much chance to not like this film. Like I said in the beginning, it's Pixar. Of course everything in the movie has a fantastic look about it and the animation, if that's what we can still call it, is flawless or perhaps even better than that. The story is a bit dull around the edges and it really is the visuals that keep bringing you back. I just don't think that Pixar is hurting so much for scripts these days and a better choice of material is the only thing that I missed. **/****.  As for the poster design, I expected a lot more considering that Pixar started their days as a design studio. There are a couple of different versions of the poster and with so many images to choose from, well let's just say that the animators probably weren't involved in that choice."

","Only Pixar could create a robot this lovable. Wall-e is not only the most endearing robot since R2D2, he's the most enchanting animated creation in years. He's an actual character. This might sound obvious, but when you sonsider that Wall-e only speaks a couple words during the entire film, you really begin to appreciate the genius of it.<br/><br/>Wall-e is a robot created to compress the trash that has rendered the Earth uninhabitable. He spends his days recycling material he deems interesting but mostly just crushing refuse into little cubes. One day an alien space craft arrives and the Wall-e discovers a playmate/playdate in the form of Eve, a more advanced flying robot. But this is only the beginning of this wonderful film. It shortly becomes apparent that Pixar has bigger things on its mind.<br/><br/>Don't come with preconceptions.

","This is the first time I post a movie review on IMDb, and it's not so much about the movie as about the overall tone of the comments on WALL-E.<br/><br/>First of all, I give this film 8 stars for several reasons. Animation: breathtakingly real and beautiful. Sound: marvelous. Main Characters: well written and lovely. The first half hour of this film is just wonderful, close to real art. No doubt, Pixar is King in animation movies.<br/><br/>As an animation movie, it's just flawless, as a science fiction movie it works, but by no means a great achievement, and the love story: cheesy and childish, typical formula that creates emotion, implanted in childhood.<br/><br/>What really makes me writing this comment are the comments of so many, obviously adult people, who consider this a piece of art and a portrait of deep and timeless love. This film seems to work very effectively in triggering the emotional strings, which by the way is no prove for great art ( every good TV advertisement works that way ).<br/><br/>The portrayal of the people in the future shows them/us as a dumb, 24h-consuming fat mindless bunch of beings, that lay back in their seats and suck nutrition like babies. Ironically, that's exactly the way the cinema-visitors are consuming this kind of entertainment: slurping coke, eating popcorn and get entertained by something on blinking screens. The emotions of the movie-characters do work, but no mature person can consider them as an expression of real human feelings or even love. But that's exactly what great movies can do - and beyond that, they can have the power to inspire you.<br/><br/>Wall-E is great entertainment for all ages, but calling it a masterpiece of film-making is a disgrace to all real artwork on celluloid or other mediums of film. I am simply irritated by the brainwashing power of Wall-E, a movie that seems to make adult people mistake flat and formulaic expressions of emotions with a deep feeling of real emotions (that last longer than 138 minutes) - or even with love.<br/><br/>Summary: those who consider this a masterpiece of film-making are like those lazy human beings 700 years in the future - sucking emotions through a straw in their seats, but are too frightened and lazy for the real thing. They will be the first on the Axiom Mothership, replacing life with what is delivered on a transparent screen.<br/><br/>Have a good flight - and please do never return to Earth."

The first 30 minutes feature almost no dialogs, and yet it is fun enough to make people smile; and captivating enough to make people keep watching. The next hour is a captivating adventure.

Yet, there are thought provoking messages for adults too. It makes a clear statement about pollution, obesity and wasting time doing nothing. The mechanically hedonistic lifestyle on the Axiom is sarcastic, and yet almost strangely resembles modern day lives.

Wall-E took my breath away, from the beautiful animation, to the simple yet perfect soundtrack to Hello Dolly! to the heartwarming love story between a simple robot whose daily routine consists of gathering garbage into little cubes and stacking them neatly aside.<br/><br/>Wall-E tells the story of a lonely robot who longs for the love he sees in his favorite movie, Hello Dolly. His life is dull, lonely and repetitive until the beautiful Eve enters the picture. Wall-E is at first frightened and intrigued by Eve, but as their friendship progresses, he finally begins to experience the love he has always longed for.<br/><br/>For starters, the visuals were breathtaking. From the bright colours of outer space to the dull grays of a planet overrun with garbage to the green of the one bit of vegetation to survive are astounding. There is little dialogue in the beginning except ""Wall-eeeee..."" and ""Ev-a!"" but the viewer doesn't seem to notice or care, the story is just that amazing.<br/><br/>And then there is the story itself. A lonely robot obsessed with the Broadway musical Hello Dolly finds his own true love, and goes as far as outer space to bring her home, it is quite romantic! I love the concept of love among the ruins of what used to be Earth.

"TxMike","Null","0","2","28 November 2008"," Much, much better than I thought it would be, a superb animated story.
","The movie begins with a ""fly-over"" shot of a large metropolis with tall buildings, but right away we notice something strange about some of them. They have a rather rough form, and eventually we realize that they are very neat piles of compacted rubbish. Each little cube is carefully place to eventually create a tall, tapering building with a flat track spiraling up it.<br/><br/>Then we notice a solitary dual-track, solar-powered machine traveling quickly among the buildings and the rubbish. The front of the machine has the inscription ""WALL-E"" which is an acronym relating to waste management, Earth version. We can also see, among the rubble, that there once were many WALL-E machines in operation but this is the only one still functioning. We wonder what happened.<br/><br/>This little WALL-E is not just a diligent worker, but he has excellent intelligence. He probably made his compacted trash cubes into tall buildings by mimicking what he observed around him. At the end of the day, he retires to the safety of a larger machine which we observe is his home, stocked with interesting things he has pulled out of the rubbish, and spare parts salvaged from broken down machines.<br/><br/>He also has a non-talking sidekick, a curious Cockroach that interacts with WALL-E playfully. But there isn't much else alive in this future version of Earth, where our over-use of consumables has made our world uninhabitable.<br/><br/>The set-up is done so well that during the first few minutes we view WALL-E not so much as a curious machine, but an interesting character with a unique personality. So in everything that transpires afterward we find ourselves pulling for WALL-E. How did our world get this way, and what is going to happen?<br/><br/>State-of-the-art digital animation and a killer surround track, this DVD is not only fun to watch, it is a superb, interesting 90-minute movie. One of the best I have seen in a long time.<br/><br/>Edit: Dec 2016 - Watched it again, the first and final segments on Earth are the best, all the stuff on the Mothership is not as interesting.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: When we piece together all we see, including some select flashbacks, we learn that it is the year 2775. About 700 years earlier, around 2075, a very large space ""cruise ship"" left on a 5-year cruise of the universe, but was told not to return, the Earth was not inhabitable. So presumably WALL-E has been compacting trash and building tall structures for about 700 years, initially with others like him, but now alone. The cruise ship, now commanded by an ancestor of the original commander, sends survey pods out periodically to measure if Earth is safe to return to. One pod is EVE, and ""she"" and WALL-E make friends. They are watching ""Hello Dolly"" together on an old VHS tape and sort of fall in love. But when EVE finds the small green plant that WALL-E brought home, she confiscated it and went into electronic hibernation, eventually picked up by an explorer craft and brought back to the large mothership. WALL-E, being a machine and unhurt, hitched a ride on the outside. The green plant was a sign they could return to Earth, but the ship's computer did not want to allow it. So the rest of the story is the struggle to take back the ship and get it back to Earth. And of course for EVE and WALL-E to remain together."

","This will just be a quickie review since I only watched this film during a plane ride (but I was seated rather far from the screen). In the beginning, there were long stretches without dialogue when Wall-E was still on the barren earth. The action and my attention only picked up when the human form was finally seen on screen. And when we see the humans of that time, we see lazy obese creatures who could not even get up from their automatic car beds. This was really a funny yet disturbing view of a future where the computer all but takes over human thoughts and actions. I can clearly see the homage to ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" with the Master Computer and all. The message in the end to take care of our planet is universal and encouraging. The excellent quality of the film is very apparent despite the less than ideal way I was watching it. The romance between Wall-E and Eve, while obviously there, I must admit I did not really get all the nuances in this viewing. After all the plaudits I have read about Wall-E on this site, I really should get a DVD and watch this more carefully soon."
"megafakinkul","9","0","3","27 November 2008"," Another great Pixar animation
","I've just seen ""WALL-E"" and I'm once more amazed at the guys working at Pixar Animation Studios. I'm a huge fan of their movies and ""WALL-E"" is just another example of the magic they create in their studios.<br/><br/>Wall-e is a small and lovable robot programmed to clean up Earth after people have left tons of waste on the planet. He leads a rather monotonous life but finds joy in every day when he rummages through the debris. He collects small tokens of human civilisation, e.g. an electric bulbs, a Rubik's cube. At the end of each day he returns to his shack and watches ""Hello, Dolly"", a musical that he probably found on a VHS cassette. His life totally changes when one day a space probe looking for signs of life on Eart lands near his ""home"". It just happened that Wall-e found a small living plant on the previous day, so the probe, called EVE, is naturally interested in his finding. Such is the beginning of Wall-e's great journey that will bring him to outer space, to a huge spacecraft filled with people who left Earth because of the waste problem. There will be moments of happiness, sadness, terror, threat and sacrifice on his journey.<br/><br/>The job the guys at Pixar do with their computers is just incredible. I was afraid how they would cope with animating a bunch of robots but now I'm sure they can do pretty much anything and there are no limits for them. Even the sky is no longer a limit for them since they moved to outer space with ""WALL-E"". The animation is simply outstanding, it is a top-notch performance in terms of skill and craft. But the most important thing is that Pixar remains true to the movie-making guidelines they started with ""A BUG'S LIFE"" - the technical aspect of a movie is not as important as the emotions they want to transmit through their movies. Love and friendship are the most important feelings a person can experience. It doesn't matter if he is an ant, a talking toy, a car, a rat or a robot. Pixar animations are just magical and they cannot be matched by any other animations company currently operating. Pure genius!"
"dreaujyc","10","0","3","24 November 2008"," Great masterpiece of Pixar
","It is a warm film, although it happens nearly a thousand years from today, and on the planet filled with trashes and wastes (One might ask who did this to the earth, the answer is clear) . I feel a little uncomfortable at the beginning because it is easily accepted that romance occurs between man and women with beautiful faces. Two robots are hardly imagined to be together. Soon I was touched by the infatuated affection of WALL E, and affected when the deserted planet was once our homeland. It is beautiful when the two danced out of the spaceship under a nebular, and more exited as the fainted offspring finally fly back to their home. Pixar did great job that combine a Sci-fiction story with humanity and fantasy of robot-romance. Children are definitely like it and adults also take fancy of the animation. The final pictures that demonstrate the whole evolution of human culture are brilliant. Pixar presents an excellent piece in 2008."
"mrtimlarabee","10","0","2","23 November 2008"," Pixar proves they're infallible, once again
","One of the greatest assets of Pixar besides always raising the bar on animation is storytelling. Beyond that, they have the ability to take characters or basic plots that sound okay at best and make them first class entertainment, both on a commercial and artistic level. This was the case with Cars, as talking cars seemed to not be on par with the humanity of Pixar's prior scripts. But they pulled it off, making a highly enjoyable film. Wall-E does the same.<br/><br/>Admittedly, I was not immediately attracted to the idea, as robots in computer animated fare is hardly anything new, as numerous shorts and a whole film had come earlier. There was also the early head's up that a good portion of this film didn't have dialogue, leading one to believe that Pixar would shed its storytelling in favor of fantastic visuals. Not so.<br/><br/>The marvel of Wall-E is the ability to tell a story with little to no dialogue. Pixar's people know that the visual's serve to enhance the story, not replace it. The film begins on a deserted earth, with Wall-E, a robot designed to clean up earth while everyone is away in space. He's alone. He collects knick knacks and as we can see from his collection, has developed heart. He's attracted to a love scene and dance number in ""Hello Dolly."" The brilliant animation conveys so much emotion in Wall-E's robotic face. Besides some advertisements for the ""Buy N' Large"" corporation and the Hello Dolly clip, the first third of the film is spent with little to no words. The rich landscape and our attraction to Wall-E's little gestures are all we need to tell the story.<br/><br/>The rest of the film is focused Wall-E and Eve, a robot sent to find life on earth, and their attempts to save the one bit of plant life found on earth, as well as themselves and the rest of mankind. It's a cute story and it has a lot of heart. But the film also has more depth in terms of its message. It shows a society becoming dependent on technology, thus becoming overweight and unable to care for themselves or even appreciate what exists beyond TV, shopping, and consumerism. And the obvious message about protecting earth from over pollution, or it won't be able to sustain life.<br/><br/>If kids don't get the message, that's fine. However, the gifted folks at Pixar told the story so well, that I wouldn't be surprise if the message does sink into children, as the vivid pictures clearly convey the story's message. It doesn't really have any political slant either (those on the far right think otherwise), as it's a simple message to clean up. There is some satire criticizing our current administration and consumer culture that may not reach the little ones, but is no less enjoyable to them because it's there.<br/><br/>So can Pixar do any wrong? If Wall-E demonstrates the caliber these guys are capable of now, probably not. They don't have a bad film and they demonstrate that animation is real, honest film making. Outside of Japan and Studio Ghibli maybe, there are no real contenders in the field of animation who have been able to mix groundbreaking animation and rich storytelling. Wall-E has raised the bar, as it's one of Pixar's best to date."

WALL-E contains vast amounts of metaphors and insinuations that portray our, man's that is, fears without coming right out and saying it.

Considering that every single one of them has been the greatest animated movie of any given year, that's quite an achievement. Wall-E is able to convey emotions in a way very few human actors can do - an incredible feat. The world he lives in is so real, at times I had to wonder which parts were computer animation and which ones were not. Camera-work is incredibly lifelike - at no time at all I felt I was watching an animated movie.<br/><br/>But the thing that Pixar does best, the thing that no other animation company has ever been able to replicate (in my opinion), is the way they infuse everything they do with a healthy dose of love, respect, empathy and affection. The emotional rush you get from watching every one of their movies is one of the reasons why I believe they are the best movie studio out there right now."

Animation is just about flawless and left me awestruck; who would have guessed it would be even possible to make such a vivid animation of space? A lot of the space effects (stars, sparkles, etc) must have taken a lot of time and detail - and I congratulate them for it. The audio was brilliant - even if there's hardly any dialog you won't feel at a loss without it - the music had the perfect nuance and the sound effects were perfection.<br/><br/>The storyline, even though it was cheesy at sometimes (but there's almost always some sort of cheesy part in every movie) the storyline was touching and had really caught me, so the little kids can laugh at all of the kid's jokes while teens or adults can appreciate the depth and emotion that is conveyed in the movie.

","This is a Pixar film and usually they animate animals/insects or toys and then they let them behave human. And the story often isn't stronger than what it has been in cartoons when I was little back in the 60's.<br/><br/>This movie is about a little robot left behind on earth to clean up our mess while we are gone and he is given the same human mind as in all previous Pixar movies, only this movie is ... I would not say deeper, but broader. Touching on more subjects and emotions and even some philosophy, psychology and wisdom. Maybe I should say the movie is ""Richer"" than the other Pixar movies I've seen.<br/><br/>And the first part of the movie is graphically top notch.<br/><br/>WALL-E is one of the few functioning Wall-E's left on Earth after 700 years, probably the only one. To solve their task while humans are away they have been made curious and inventive, and I would say 700 years is enough for WALL-E's neural-net to grow, and during this time he's been going through our trash and slowly like a detective gathering information and rehashing it and sorting it and has started to become a bit human by looking around him and learning from what we have constructed, small things and large things, especially video tapes are valuable.<br/><br/>WALL-E is completely lonely going to work everyday and resting every night when there is no sunshine for his solar panels. But after 700 years something happens that will turn his ""life"" upside down.<br/><br/>First half of the movie is a 10 in score, but the second half is not so hysterically funny just funny. :) So I have to give the movie as little as 9 points.<br/><br/>****** spoiler alert! spoiler alert! *********** On the ship there are two robots I like especially. First, the little cleaning robot, and then especially when his neural net is telling him to follow a dirt track made by WALL-E that is not along those red white or blue lines robots always follows, so it takes him about 10 seconds or so to stop following the lines but after he taken the first step then there is no problem just following WALL-E's dirt track.<br/><br/>Second, is that other little robot that smashes down an entire robot-police-squad and after that hovers in the air all pumped up .... just like a boxer dancing in the corner of a ring between rounds .<br/><br/>Some of the robots I thought was real funny.<br/><br/>Most of the fun watching movies like these is recognize patterns and faces from our real world, behavior, faces, or movies made. You recognize bits here and there, and get a kick out of that. So the recipe is pretty simple, but I think WALL-E is a bit more than that. <br/><br/>Now I know a present to give to someone that are tired of movies, something that might wake them up and make them smile."

","I thought it was a beautiful piece of animation. And that's about it. The creators clearly inspired themselves from Short Circuit (the robot is practically the same design and the cute comic relief robot is called Mo, although it might be a coincidence) and made a love story between two robots in a time where humans are only fat blobs waiting to be served and completely dependent on machines.<br/><br/>How believable was it? Zero. Did it matter? No. But it bothered me that behind the nice animation all the story was an emotional ""aaaaaah, so cute"" extended to movie length. The few moralistic conclusions of the whole humans-become-vegetables idea were lost in an avalanche of positive (and meaningless) hope.<br/><br/>Bottom line: great for kids, I guess. Funny for adults. You'll forget about it the next day."

There's little to no speaking between the two main characters, making the film all the easier to follow for the smaller children and the most scary part is a robot that can be best qualified as a toned down HAL2000.<br/><br/>All in all, good fun and able to bring some good smiles to the faces of the most of them.<br/><br/>8 out of 10 cleaner worlds"

","Pixar has always delivered trumps when it comes to quality animation. What sets them apart from other big time studios creating animated films is that they dare to be different. More importantly they understand that story plot will always win audiences more than simply casting Hollywood celebrities voicing animated characters. Admittedly Pixar are not impartial to using celebrity voices themselves but at the core of a Pixar film is the story and that's what captures our imagination.<br/><br/>With Wall-E, they have produced a full-length animated feature that goes to a new level. Why? Because for normal big budget animated features, the formula has always gone down the path of hiring celebrities to voice the characters but in Wall-E, dialogue is kept to a minimum. The emphasis is on the animation but more so on the sequence of events that shows the personality of an environmentally focused robot who's artificial intelligence has allowed it to evolve. The lack of dialogue may not be to everyone's tastes but if you allow yourself to be open to the film, Wall-E will capture your imagination.<br/><br/>Equally important is that I found myself caring for this little guy's plight and the fact that the film offers both laughter and tears shows to me the strength of the story and the ability for Pixar's gorgeous ""eye candy"" to be more than just something sweet but actually evoke emotions in the viewer. The only other animated films I can think of that go as deep into characters' souls is Hayao Miyazaki's but Pixar goes one step further by creating an inanimate object (in Wall-E) with a soul. The most poignant moments are when there is no speech and to take a term from an equally fantastic Pixar film of the past (The Incredibles), Wall-E shows you don't have to be ""super"" to be special."

","In the future, Earth is a dry and dusty shell, having long since been over-polluted and ruined by mankind. Wall-E is a little cleanup robot who has somehow kept working the long ages, but is all alone; the other machines having broken down and the people left for a space station long ago. When he is visited by Eve, a reconnaissance robot looking for signs of life, Wall-E falls in love <br/><br/>This gorgeous-looking Pixar/Disney fable typifies the high quality of their work - the animation is outstanding, the story and characters are all terrific, and the environmental subtext is profound without every being dull or overbearing. It's not a very original tale - it reminded me very much of a cross between Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within and that old Dr Who story The Ark In Space, but Wall-E and Eve are completely unique. More importantly, the movie is beautifully cinematic; the slow, arid landscapes of Earth in the first half contrasting fantastically with the hyperactive blue steel vistas of the Axiom. Better yet, there is very little dialogue - our heroes don't really speak, they just beep at each other - and so the story is told entirely with pictures and emotions, just the way good cinema should be. The sound design by veteran Ben Burtt (he created all the Star Wars sounds) is fabulous, and there is a brilliant score by Thomas Newman which sweeps us through all the humour, action and intrigue. It never ceases to amaze me how strong and how moving a film can be when it focuses on sound and pictures, without talking, and this is a great example. Filled with plenty of sly references to science-fiction classics, the two most amusing being the HAL-esquire eye of the autopilot and Weaver's wonderful voice as the Axiom computer. Opens with a terrific animated short by Doug Sweetland about a magician and his hungry rabbit called Presto, and concludes with a great song by Newman and Peter Gabriel called Down To Earth. Heartwarming."

","What a great thing happened here. Once again a Pixar film brings something different from what they'd done before, and which exploits with intelligence interesting and important aspects of film creation.<br/><br/>Three things made this film to me. Two of them where interesting and had class, the third thing may, in the future depending on other films after this one, be regarded as the beginning of something new.<br/><br/>-The ""animation"" in its pure form is world-class in a minimalistic point of view. Wall.E, the character, is a master-piece of taking a lot out of very few elements. After all it's a box, with associated gadgets, there is not the expressive possibilities of something like a skin. Everything is made out of small movements, expression details, things that analyze to a great extent the limits of what it takes to make something expressive. It was not so successful with the female white robot or with any other character, namely humans.<br/><br/>-The self-ironic commentary. Pixar has the same roots of Apple (Steve Jobs), and it's interesting and self mocking that in a time when Apple is trying to revolutionize to a global extent the concepts of interface, that they criticize the very ""white world"" they propose, by bringing out the potential negative effects of its dissemination at a global scale. The ""whitness"" of feelings, the world where humans are taught where to look at, taught by the gadgets, and by the computers, like the one which emulates Kubrick/Clarke's 2001. In this film, people see the film they are told to see. That's much more remarkable to me than the so talked about ecological concerns.<br/><br/>-For last, and more important to me is the bold statement that it is possible to inject the fluids of the most deep kinds of visual meditation in the content of a commercial ""family"" film. The boldness of creating a product such as this with hardly any dialog, and the capacity to elevate the quality of a fully artificial image to a level which allows our visual imagination to work emotionally. Something Tarkovsky or Antonioni taught us how to do. This film was bold and it is important for that, but it still isn't a masterpiece in those concerns. I want to see more. I hope this thread will be followed.<br/><br/>My opinion: 4/5 See it.<br/><br/>http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com"

It is one of the few animation movies that make you think, a thing that the Japanese have long done with their animation, but Hollywood rarely ventured to attempt. Yet it is not a serious ho-hum affair at all, it's sweet, it's endearing & it gives you that same fuzzy feeling that you got after you watched, say Amelie?

"imdb-12718","7","0","2","22 September 2008"," Wonderful, but uneven
","Anybody at the other studios who believes they are catching up with Pixar in the realm of computer animated movies will watch Wall-E and weep. The visuals are just staggering: almost photographically super-real, and packed with breathtaking detail. The opening half hour of the movie is absolutely stunning, not least for the way in which character and emotion is conveyed by the robot protagonists.<br/><br/>However, halfway through, the movie undergoes a radical change in direction, look and feel. As soon as the humans enter the story, things take a turn for the worse. The visuals become more cartoonlike, and the plot can't seem to make up its mind whether it is focusing on Wall-E's quest for Eve, or getting the humans back to Earth. More fundamentally, however, the human characters are just not as well drawn, in any sense of the words, as the robots, failing to make any impression on an emotional level. Not only was it hard to care whether they made it back to Earth or not, but the total disregard of the fact that they would have both starved and collapsed under their own weight was just a bit too much of a strain on the willing suspension of disbelief.<br/><br/>Take the plot elements concerning only the robots, and you have one of the greatest short films ever made. Take the movie as a whole, and you have a good but ultimately disappointing mishmash.<br/><br/>The movie also epitomised a recent and very unfortunate trend of giving far too much away in the trailers (Kung Fu Panda being another egregious recent example of this). The first teaser trailer, a year ago or more, with Wall-E looking up at the stars, was surely all this film needed. The more recent trailers, including large chunks of the plot line with Eve, just lessened the impact of the film itself."
"Christopher_Reid","10","0","2","21 September 2008"," A few minor weaknesses, but otherwise an inspirational masterpiece!
","The first half is pure movie magic. Thought provoking, funny, touching, hilarious, romantic, etc. WALL·E is a truly lovable character. The way he and his environment are introduced to us is just beautiful. It's immediately clear how much thought and hard work PIXAR have put into this film, just like all their others, except somehow they still manage to do the ""impossible"", which is to get better every time.<br/><br/>Possibly a slight weakness with these otherwise marvellous scenes is that at times they actually feel a little rushed. This may sound unlikely for a film with virtually no dialogue and so few characters for about the first hour but at times, Andrew Stanton seems to doubt himself just the tiniest bit. There are more than a few successions of short panning shots from various angles that seem to function solely as awe-inspiring (which they are) and to show off the location. They aren't bad per se, but they don't seem very original in style or in the way that they fit into the movie. It becomes a bit of a pattern and it feels not like Stanton's running out of ideas, but that he's afraid people will lose interest if he doesn't artificially keep up the pace. Possibly it's just his personal style in which case time will tell whether his approach is ""right"" or if this is indeed a weakness that (because he works at PIXAR) he'll soon fix up.<br/><br/>The best moments have an exquisite timing to them and come across as effortless. They are more than the sum of their parts because they're so inspiring and original; it was almost disappointing for me once I got to find out more about the characters and wider situation. It ended up being much more limited than what I'd had in mind; what the first half had triggered. I don't think this is because the second half is weak so much as that the first half is great and that perhaps the second doesn't quite match up to it.<br/><br/>I can't go much further without mentioning what is for me the biggest flaw of the movie: Thomas Newman's score. Without exaggerating, I felt that the film would have been substantially better if his score was replaced by silence. I thought the use of music and footage from ""Hello, Dolly!"" was inspired (although I haven't yet seen it). It's just some musical, right? But WALL·E sees and hears something in it and so do we. Also, the times when silence *was* used were very effective, especially because they add to the sense of isolation and encourage one to listen more carefully (rather than covering one's ears).<br/><br/>But Newman's score was far too often intrusive, distracting and obvious. What made the first half of the film so incredibly touching was it's simplicity and sense of wonder. A large part of that is achieved by suggesting things rather than explicitly showing them. Newman underplays the action and emotions too linearly (and ineptly or at least unimaginatively) much of the time and this hinders the film's potential (even destroying some of it). This is especially the case towards the end where some slightly more derivative and even clichéd elements appear in the movie (Finding Nemo had some similar issues I thought). John Williams' score for E.T. The Extra-terrestrial (which does bear some comparison to WALL·E, having the common theme(s) of being alone in the universe, childlike wonder and the need to connect, etc) is full of unexpected tension and surprises which keeps the audience guessing, looking closer.<br/><br/>Overall, I think the story itself is incredibly original and yet with universal appeal. For the most part, it is transparantly and passionately expressed but especially in the second half, the moments of more clichéd and forgettable material become more and more frequent. Luckily, they are always very brief and don't intrude upon every aspect of the movie. For example, the visual style and sound design are consistently awesome. In any case, the plot is always very easy to follow and the audience is constantly engaged and entertained. PIXAR are so far ahead of virtually everyone else in this area and yet they make it look so easy, the bastards ;)<br/><br/>So, taking all that into account, WALL·E is a just about a masterpiece in my opinion. Andrew Stanton's possible weaknesses as a director (which are very slight indeed and only really noticeable because the overall technique is so transparent) aren't much of a problem because this is clearly his personal vision and I guess without the ""flaws"" we couldn't rightfully ask for all the other wonderful aspects of his humanity. As for the music... It's as if PIXAR have mastered the art of storytelling and animation and all the other aspects of film-making except for music (which isn't what they do anyway) and all they need is someone of similar ability and imagination. Don't get me wrong. *Randy* Newman's scores are awesome. But if they'd considered and then convinced, say, John Williams to do WALL·E, I reckon it might've probably've been the greatest film ever made. So far, that is."
"hanbertchen","9","0","1","16 September 2008"," Technological marvel with questionable plot development
","I have to admit that just by watching the film I was enthralled by the sheer beauty and imagination that must have went in to create robots that had such a believable yet futuristic look. However, more effort should have been channeled to making the plot believable, too. It was okay to temporarily suspend my disbelief (after all it's a scifi movie) however there were points where I just couldn't help but think that some things were a bit of a stretch. It felt like the movie should have been much longer if all the background to make it believable was introduced and because of time constraints the studio just decided not to include them. <br/><br/>For example: why would the Axiom, a ship of vast power and technology and an apparent FTL drive, not simply cruise to a habitable planet and reintroduce what's left of humanity there? Why would the captain decide that he suddenly likes a barren wasteland that he's never been to better than the infinite resources of his ship for no apparent reason? Homesickness could have been the reason but it requires the captain to at least know his home personally, but instead he was just getting acquainted with things (like dancing) that humanity has lost not because of leaving Earth, but because of having grown sessile and obese over the years on the ship. The premise of the film is based on the darker side of human nature such as reckless pollution and laziness, but why are all the people in the film portrayed as environmentally conscious and ever ready for action? These inconsistencies do not make the film any less aesthetically pleasing, but it is a slippery slope to let plot take second priority after graphics."

","While I have heard mostly great comments on this film from people I know, a few have brought up the fact that there is little dialogue in the film overall. While I would I agree with that, it truly did not affect my enjoyment of the film. ""WALL-E"" is actually a brilliant little film, easily the best Pixar film made since ""The Incredibles"" (""Cars"" and ""Ratatouille"" were okay but definitely lacked what some of the earlier films had). Watching WALL-E (the last remaining robot on earth sent to clean up the trash and rubble after all of mankind has evacuated) collect artifacts such as toys and videotapes (""Hello Dolly"") was fascinating for me. This is truly a culturally-relevant film, commenting on our society and where we could end up (fat) if we don't change our ways. There are little funny moments that made the film enjoyable for me, such as the captain of a spaceship assuming that seeds on earth grow pizza. The romance between the two robots was not as annoying or corny as I would have thought, and I found myself truly hoping they would be happy together. Not an absolutely perfect film, but manages to entertain in a unique way most of us do not expect. Not Pixar's best, but certainly the best we've seen from them in several years. A worthwhile, fun, impressive film, good for families and adults. This looks like a future classic.<br/><br/>*** out of ****"
"pheluda","10","0","2","8 September 2008"," Eeeevaa!
","To begin with, let's get it over with the now-usual accolades  a brilliant Pixar film (whoever expected anything else), WALLE raises the bar among animation films to such an extent that it can only be reached by a yet-unmade Pixar 'product' (it's almost an insult to call it that). Irresistibly sweet and heart-warming, it's an achievement of visual storytelling, and even with two robots as its principal characters, it's a greater testament to the beauty of holding hands than any other 'human' movie made in recent years.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the central point of this piece  every time I watch a new Pixar film, I get the impression that, while these guys busily go about their daily jobs of redefining the very principles (and art) of creating moving images, they somehow manage to keep in touch with the foundations of 'cinema' as an entertaining medium to a far greater degree than most other offerings of contemporary 'popular' film-making. While mainstream Hollywood still reels under the 'shock-n-awe' effect and 'big bang' theories of its major production houses, Pixar seems to understand the arresting impact and lasting memories that the simplest of images can create in the human mind. Note the scene where Walle and Eve perform a 'Space Ballet' as they wheel around the mother spaceship  a breath-taking symphony of light and colours, given great company by a sweet background score. <br/><br/>Much of the film comprises little or no dialogues, and to my mind, these are the superlative portions of the film. I can't remember the last movie that I had seen with such little words and yet so much to say  from contemporary diet issues to inefficient waste disposal, from the excesses of 'social networking' to our increasing dependency on machines, nothing escapes their attention. The only bit that disappointed me  I only wish they'd had the courage to pull off what could have been that perfect ending to a fittingly perfect movie  call me a sadist, but Walle would have stayed with me forever, if only he could have forgotten 'Eva'."

","Wall-E is a love story of two robots. That, along the way, they resurrect the human race and the planet earth is something they might not have even realized.<br/><br/>Wall-E is easily the best film of the year so far. It is amazing how a soiled old piece of metallic equipment can keep you engaged for an entire duration of a film, and even tug at your heart at times. Wall-E is a robot who collects trash and compresses them into cubes. He stacks these cubes to build skyscrapers. Apparently he is the only one left on planet earth, other than his pet cockroach. But Wall-E is not a dumb robot. He has his stash of variety of stuff collected from the garbage he works on. Of these is an i-pod that plays an oldie for him. I'd never know for sure what Wall-E feels on watching that video. The best guess is he is reminded of his loneliness. Then one day, Eve appears and Wall-E's tranquil old world is sent into a twirl. It is about at half-time that 'humans' appear. It was then that I realized that all I was hearing till now was clanking of metals.<br/><br/>Wall-E is great animation and brilliant sound engineering. There are many ways to interpret this film but a simple love story, between two unlikely candidates - robots, suits just as good. The way Wall-E and Eve call out each other's names, I guess it is the first time that just names have had that impact on the viewers since Marlon Brando called out Stella in 'A Streetcar Named Desire'.<br/><br/>A must-see."

","Pixar's peerless filmography is nothing short of amazing, undefeated their armor shines in full giddy glory by 2008's WALL-E, another brilliant animation-movie. Always developing, they hand us two main characters who barely speak and who after all are robots, so any facial expression or emotional moment are created by R2D2-ish sounds or a small wink by the hand - it's minimal, but it's perfect. The atmosphere of WALL-E's astonishing tale of love and rebooting the now fatty-society-of-the-galaxy of 2800 showcases storytelling at its best. WALL-E is an amazingly well crafted creation, his longing-for-company is heartbreaking as well as hilarious - and what seems to be a lonely-robot tale transforms into a somewhat exhilarating story of breaking free from chains and freeing mankind from a computer-steered-world-of-politics-and-society. In one brilliant scene we see one of the fatty-girl's swapping free from ""computer land"" and actually realizing where she is, and she also comes in contact with a man - the flirting seems alien to them, as they're in reality not doing anything except talking gossip and eating/drinking, because they're only sitting on their bloody arse!

What i find odd about ""Wall-E"" is mixing live-action characters (Including old musicals classics and made up News Footage with the Fred Willard character) with CGI ones are certainly weird. That's the only aspect in ""Wall-E"" doesn't quite work. Why having real human characters in the film but then later placing it with human CGI characters in the movie ? That's the only thing, i truly hated in the ""Wall-E"" movie.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Wall-E"" is a good movie, it has many funny scenes and as well for visual moments. There's an enjoyable vocal performance by Jeff Garlin as the Ship's Captain. I meet some people, who seen ""Wall-E"" an mixed experience or they find it... an truly dreadful experience. Fans of Science Fiction movies will enjoy this Ambitious film at best. Sigourney Weaver's voice appears throughout the second half of the feature as the Ship's Computer. Don't miss it. Digital Widescreen. (****/*****)."

","Yes cybernetic, electronic, mechanical prodigy. Images mathematically reproduced of movements of robots, computers and various almost supernatural machines that will leave you bewildered, amazed and astonished. Behind that there is a bit of history of the planet Earth that has been abandoned by the Human Race and is now only a pile of garbage, litter and polluted waste where a small nice robot itself made of scrap iron, tries to put some order into it and cleaning a bit. What remains of mankind now lives in a huge spatial vessel having become a very fat species lying down on some kind of chair beds, attended upon by a legion of robots of any kind. However a probe feminine robot is sent to earth to estimate conditions there and a romance starts between her and the poor little robot called Wall-E which leads to a series of proper that turns down in the end on a much more human finale. The philosophy of this movie after all goes against the usual trend of these computer animated movies which privilege mechanical values instead of human ones. Here the human and nature values finish by bearing the palm over the artificial cold mechanical ones. If you have the habit of leaving your chair as soon as the movie ends I strongly advise you not to do so with this movie and stay seated till the technical data scroll down completely because they are accompanied by very nice images and a beautiful music."

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>Many years from now, Earth has become a desolate wasteland, teeming with junk on piles of scrapheaps. In amongst all this, WALL-E (a Waste Allocation...thingee) roams around, pressing bits of junk into boxes. He has to encounter the occasional earth-storm and, after the latest, runs into EVE-A, a female robot who he forms a crush on (wonder how they'll go about having kids?!? Twisted or what???) and gets taken away with after the latest storm. But as well as falling in love, WALL-E's also going to learn the sinister truth about why the earth's in the state it's in now, leading to a magical adventure to the end.<br/><br/>As a work of animation and movement, WALL-E is, of course, as spectacular an achievement as any of the other Disney/Pixar works from their now rather extensive back catalogue. But one thing sets it apart from most of the others: the largely dialogue free nature of it all, with most of the picture filmed in total silence, with WALL-E just peddling around, doing what he does and what he gets himself into. Indeed, as I sat in the cinema and watched it, one thought couldn't stop running through my mind: I have got to see There Will Be Blood pretty soon (noted for the dialogue free first thirty minutes, I think!!!) This different approach is a bit of a gamble for the film-makers, as not only will the lack of speech and intonation be confusing for the still largely child audience but may also put off some of the older members, looking forward to some of the sparkling, witty writing from The Incredibles and Toy Story. Yet in spite of this, WALL-E, simply as a work of animation and wonder, does manage to work and not malfunction like a bust robot.<br/><br/>The adult angle (which D/P are renowned for working wonders with) here is less with the dialogue and humour and instead using any intelligence and subtlety on display to make a clever comment on the way the earth is headed if mankind does not change it's attitude to the environment and protecting our planet, as well as how the greedy consumerist society will turn everyone into disgustingly lazy, fat slobs, too used to ordering everything and receiving everything from pressing buttons and clicking on keyboards without getting up and moving to do things for themselves. While the animation and effects are bedazzling everyone, kids and some of the more sensitive members of the audience can derive some 'aaah's from the titular character himself, the cutest robot since Johnny 5 from Short Circuit.<br/><br/>Some might say it's just for kids, but they'd be total Wall-ies. ****"

It definitely makes you want to join a gym and get in shape.<br/><br/>It's almost like a scared strait way to motivate you into losing weight.

","First of all, I thought that this is just another movie that will make you sit for hours and take pleasure in watching a rundown and humorless movie. Well, I'm dead wrong. This movie is really cool, romantic and fun. WALL-E offers a perfect blend of comedy, action, romance and suspense. It's a perfect story! Here's a little synopsis: WALL-E is a robot left on Earth to sanitize it up while the human race waits in space. In spite of being a machine, however, WALL-E has urbanized a sense of awareness - he is curious and naive as a child. Of course, being what seems like the only operational robot left, he also longs for companionship (...someone besides his pet, cockroach).<br/><br/>That's where EVE comes in. She's a robot probe sent from the humans in space to check if the Earth can sustain life again. Once WALL-E sees EVE, he becomes love-struck and will literally follow her anywhere on Earth... or even space.<br/><br/>One can sympathize with WALL-E, as he has been alone for 700 years with no one to bone err talk to. He's toiling away at work with nothing but the comforts of his makeshift home to give him some small pleasures and distractions in life (although his morning sluggishness is due to his depleted power, we can't help but relate with those mornings WALL-E finds hard to get out of bed). When he sees the sleek, powerful EVE, it's quite understandable that he is captivated by her. Well, that's all I'm going to say. Just watch it for yourself and let the movie speak for itself ("",)"

","Part cutesy kids story, part serious sci-fi tale, WallE is a love story with robots, an indictment of man's appalling treatment of Earth, and a warning to the human race about what may be waiting for us in the near future. It's also a very entertaining movie, and one of Pixar's finest to date.<br/><br/>WallE is a small robot who is left on a trash-covered Earth as part of a clean-up team, whilst the human population takes a five year sojourn in space. The problem is that five years eventually becomes seven hundred years, Earth is still messy, and WallE is now alone (save for a cockroach who keeps him company).<br/><br/>The little robot's lonely existence comes to an end, however, when a human spacecraft lands on Earth and drops off a high-tech probe to search for plant-life. The little metal guy falls for the shiny white machinenamed Eveand the two form a friendship. But when Eve discovers a small plant, she must obey her programming, and alert her masters of her discovery.<br/><br/>When the ship returns to collect Eve and her precious find and return them to the Axiom, the huge holiday craft that is still cruising through space, WallE decides to hitch along for the ridean action that results in the ultimate human re-population of Earth.<br/><br/>With almost no dialogue in its first half, Pixar's latest triumph begins like a silent movie: with narrative and character development achieved primarily through clever use of 'body' language. WallE, who is part ET and part Johnny 5, is wonderfully expressive, and director Andrew Stanton works miracles with his character, masterfully manipulating his audience into caring for the lump of rusty metal. Likewise, Eve, who is basically a white egg with blue eyes, is just as endearing thanks to the expertise of the Pixar animators and Stanton's faultless direction.<br/><br/>The second half of the film is a wake up call to the human race, showing what will become of us if we become lazy and over-reliant on technology. It's also a pretty nifty action/adventure, with WallE braving space travel to find true love, and helping the overweight humans find their feet again and overthrow the power-mad computer who secretly controls the Axiom.<br/><br/>Although it is perhaps occasionally too sophisticated for younger children, and some of the science could be picked apart by pedants, WallE is nevertheless a brilliantly crafted piece of entertainment which combines an enchanting tale with superb CGI, wonderful comedy and, most importantly, a real sense of fun.<br/><br/>8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb."
"TomCruiseFan99","10","0","2","21 August 2008"," An animation film that rates as one of this year's best!
","After a spate of disappointing animated features in recent years, I went into this film expecting something at-least halfway decent since it's a Pixar release. What I did not expect was to enjoy this as much as I did. Wow! I still can't get over it, this was extremely funny with just the right amount of sweet and tender moments mixed in as well.<br/><br/>The film was highly enjoyable, even though there's only dialogue from about the halfway mark only, but don't let that put you off. The first half of the movie is carried by the title character and his daily routines as we see how WALL-E is alone on the planet doing the job he was built for 700 years ago. There are no humans around, and his only company is a cockroach. They might not understand each other, but they realise the idea of 'friendship'. Where the humans have gone is a mystery which actually adds proportionate weight to this tale, and where they are is something I won't spoil for you.<br/><br/>Even though not much seems to be happening at first glance, you can't help but be dazzled by the splendid visuals and simply charming story. And once another robot arrives on the planet, the story really starts picking up speed and hardly ever slows down. Can WALL-E befriend this new being? The answer to that question is one of the most fantastic adventures I've seen in a long time."
"jemps918","9","0","3","17 August 2008"," Special
","It's uncanny: no words surface for the better part of Wall-E and similarly, no words can describe what a brilliant piece of animation it is. Even more amazing is how Oscar-winning director and writer Andrew Stanton (Finding Nemo, Monster's Inc., A Bug's Life) can keep churning out one awesome full-length animation after another.<br/><br/>It's quite a risk to return to the realm of silent movies, offering it to an increasingly skeptical, harder-to-please audience with short attention spans. And, as if that wasn't challenging enough, make its success heavily reliant on a story that's verbalized by the personalization of robots that are able to communicate only by weird sounds and awkward body language.<br/><br/>But this is Pixar's gift; the ability to bring legitimate human experiences in animated form. I didn't particularly like Cars, so I'm glad they've finally humanized inanimate objects better in Wall-E, enough for the audience to actually feel for the characters. It hearkens back to Disney's Lady and the Tramp, with the scruffy boy Wall-E who goes out on a limb for a girl way out of his league (Eve). Even the supporting cast is memorable; I especially like the little super OC cleaner robot and Wall-E's survivor of a pal the cockroach! It's at once ridiculous and magical, really, and even more special is when you find yourself spontaneously bursting with laughter in unguarded moments because that is indeed a rarity."

","I only managed to get to the cinema to see Wall-E very recently and therefore, had a lot of time to build up the hype after seeing so many positive reviews for it. I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>The animation was simply superb, from the first glimpse of the now ruined planet to Wall-E and Eve's flight around the Axiom in the second half of the film Pixar didn't disappoint.<br/><br/>The story mainly centres around Wall-E's love for Eve the moment she lands on earth the day after he discovers a plant {the first vegetation that he's ever seen in his lonely 700 year existence}. The fact that Wall-E's love for Eve being the reason for at least two humans aboard the Axiom beginning to realise that they have no idea about the world around them is superb story telling. The very fact that the robots seem to have more humanity than the humans is very telling of the dangers of allowing ourselves to become so immersed in the current trend of consumerism and instant electronic communication to the point of not even knowing about the most simple pleasures in life. Maybe it's time we broke away from our own 'directive' as it were and took the time to simply enjoy living.<br/><br/>Many people have complained about the messages in the film being overbearing or hitting you over the head with it, I don't quite agree with those sentiments. Yes they could have been more subtle, but Pixar caters to everyone and this includes people and younger children who might not pick up on the underlying messages otherwise. Those who are overweight and take offence to the way humanity is depicted in the film need to take into consideration that living in space for so long does have effects on the human body, just like every other environmental effect, add in the fact that the humans are able to be waited on hand and foot for the better part of 700 years without having to do a thing and you get people with a rather limited bone structure and rather rounded bodies.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, though, the film does show that there is hope if we just take the time to learn about our surroundings and ourselves, even if we do have to have two smitten robots show us the error of our ways."

"mr_popcorn","10","0","2","16 August 2008"," McCheesy's take on ""Wall-E""
","In a distant, but not so unrealistic future, where mankind has abandoned earth because it has become covered with trash from products sold by the powerful multi-national Buy N Large corporation, WALL-E, a garbage collecting robot has been left to clean up the mess. Mesmerized with trinkets of earth's history and show tunes, WALL-E is alone on Earth except for a sprightly pet cockroach. One day, Eve, a sleek (and dangerous) reconnaissance robot, is sent to earth to find proof that life is once again sustainable. WALL-E falls in love with Eve. WALL-E rescues Eve from a dust storm and shows her a living plant he found amongst the rubble. Consistent with her ""directive"" Eve takes the plant and automatically enters a deactivated state except for a blinking green beacon. WALL-E, doesn't understand what has happened to his new friend, but true to his love, he protects her from wind, rain, and lightning, even as she is unresponsive. One day a massive ship comes to reclaim Eve, but WALL-E, out of love or loneliness hitches a ride on the outside of the ship to rescue Eve. The ship arrives back at a large space cruise ship, which is carrying all of the humans who evacuated earth 700 years earlier. The people of earth ride around this space resort on hovering chairs which give them a constant feed of TV and video chatting. They drink all of their meals through a straw out of laziness and/or bone loss, and are all so fat that they can barely move. When the auto-pilot computer, acting on hastily given instructions sent many centuries before, tries to prevent the people of earth from returning, by stealing the plant, WALL-E, Eve, the portly captain, and a band of broken robots stage a mutiny.<br/><br/>I consider this the Godfather of animated films. Not only was it just a breakthrough when it comes to animated films, it also brought the genre of animation into a whole new another level.<br/><br/>Wall-E is where science fiction meets romance meets comedy meets the heart and soul of every movie going audience who've seen the film. I'm not sure about the other people but this film captured me hook, line and sinker. Believe it or not this is by far the most romantic film I have seen this year. Going into the theaters I immediately expected greatness seeing as its a Pixar film but goddamn it the romance angle just came out of nowhere. And I got hooked. And here I thought I'd never see the day where I'd cheer for two metallic pieces of junk falling in love.<br/><br/>The story of the film is beyond greatness. In fact, the undertone message it delivered was more fun and enjoyable than Al Gore's sleepfest docu ""An Inconvenient Truth"". After I saw the film, I was thinking what if this could happen in the future? Well, not in the literal term but what if every little thing we do, even the basic things in life, we're gonna have to need the assistance of a machine? Right now maybe you're thinking its impossible but if you observe the modern society today, with technology rapidly evolving and growing, I'm starting to think we're heading to Wall-E's world already. Just think about it."

","Java Man Reviews WALL-E (Rated G) Directed by Andrew Stanton. Written by Stanton & Jim Reardon. With Fred Willard and the voices of Ben Burtt, Elissa Knight, Jeff Garlin, John Ratzenberger, Kathy Najimy & Sigourney Weaver. Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com August, 2008.<br/><br/>OVERVIEW:<br/><br/>Earth has been abandoned for centuries and all that remains is a robot and his sidekick cockroach (you knew nothing could kill them). WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter: Earth-class) is a mobile trash compactor who continues to do his job decades after his inventors have lifted off for outer space. The humans, now obese and obtuse, live on Axiom, a continuously orbiting spaceship run by computers and machines who cater to their every need. The humans just sit around with drinks and watch video screens . . . like now.<br/><br/>WALL-E doesn't compact everything. He keeps a collection of human artifacts, including his own spare parts, an old VHS of Hello Dolly (1969), and a little green plant. It's that little green plant that sets the plot in motion and attracts the attention of EVE, the Extra-terrestrial Vegetation Evaluator who comes to Earth to see if there are signs of life that may enable the floating humans to return to terra firma. WALL-E falls in love with EVE, having been programmed in the art of romance by thousands of viewings of Dolly. Meanwhile, competing powers aboard Axiom threaten the little green life form, and a battle begins for the survival of humankind.<br/><br/>REVIEW: 4 out of 4 Java Mugs!<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) was the first film to marry film-making technique with computer technology. That was 40 years ago and technology has come a long way . . . yet the narratives of the two films are remarkably similar: They each take us on a journey far into outer space, only to discover that the meaning of existence lies in simple concepts: a newborn baby or a budding sprout. ""It's not in our stars, but in ourselves.""<br/><br/>While these may be serious themes for a G-rated movie, you don't have to be an existential philosopher or a Shakespeare scholar to enjoy this film. Kid's will love it, and so will you.<br/><br/>In addition to Kubrick's masterpiece, WALL-E alludes to other great moments in cinema history. The first 40-minutes contains no dialogue and calls to mind the touching and poetic work of silent film geniuses Chaplin and Keaton. The Alien sci-fi series is also evoked, complete with a Sigourney Weaver voice cameo.<br/><br/>Though it pays homage to other great movies, WALL-E is one of the most original films ever made, with an originality that is expressed in its inventive look, resourceful sound and vibrant characterization. An example is the creation of the lead robots. They speak precious few words but each character's ingenious visual design is combined with the amusing sounds they give off to express a range of emotions so wide that many human actors might feel upstaged.<br/><br/>In his 2008 documentary, Encounters at the End of the World, Werner Herzog comments that ""the human presence on this planet is not really sustainable,"" an idea not totally hidden behind WALL-E's optimistic sheen. According to New York Times critic A. O. Scott, ""When the whimsical techies at Pixar and a moody German auteur are sending out the same message, it may be time to pay attention.""<br/><br/>Pay attention, but enjoy it too."

","I watched Wall-E on the opening day, and I was surprised to see many adults with there fully grown sons there. I was surprised that I was there. I'm not a big fan of today's animated flicks, but after this movie, I recognized these kinds of film's beauty. I enjoyed watching this movie. It was smart, funny, complex in a away, and it was visually amazing. The scenery of an empty and dirty,(literally speaking), I was stunned. Wall-E is a machine that cleans up garbage by putting a big chunk of garbage into it's little microwave thing, and makes it into a box. People thought that was cute. Not cute to me, but cool. While watching this I really wouldn't have minded to start criticizing the Asian fobs next to me, who were really Asian boyfriends and girlfriends, both disturbingly were sharing their calls of ""awwwwwwwwwwww"" and ""AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW""! That was one thing I didn't enjoy about watching this movie, but it wasn't the movie's fault. Another thing was the robot love and robotic tension in the movie between Wall-E and Eve, who is another robot who is dangerously violent and catastrophic, yet dangerously ""pretty"" to Wall-E. That's when the ""awwwwwwwwwwwwww""!'s started to really annoy me. I don't get any kind of love except human. Animal love, I don't get. Robot love, I still don't get. It's like something in my brain isn't accepting this standard or event.

"looneylizard9","10","0","2","14 August 2008"," How do they do it?!?!
","Upon seeing the first trailer for WALL-E I felt that this would be a Pixar failure. During the next few months this feeling continued. How interesting could a movie about robots, that don't talk I might add, be? So when it came out I decided I wouldn't go watch it. I mean with all the other movies coming out, why waste money on a movie I wouldn't enjoy. I remained in this frame of mind until my inbox was filled with emails from friends and family telling me I HAD to watch it. So one raining day I headed to the theater, if only to get my friends and family off my back. I went into to movie with my notepad and pen to deliver a pointless review. I was surprised by the opening short story; it made me laugh and relax. This was Pixar. Then the opening scene started and it rolled me away with it. I found myself ""oohing"" and ""awwwing"" with the rest of the crowd. I must say of all the Pixar movies, this one made me concentrate the most. With no talking one had to watch closely or one would miss the joke, or the emotion of the moment. Wall-e was cute and had a sense of humor I didn't know robots had. By the end I was quite jealous of Eve. And Eve, what can I say, she reminds me of a lot of women, very fickle and feisty. The rest of the crew of robots made me laugh like I hadn't laughed in awhile. I cheered with the rest when the Captain made the right choice. And cried when I thought Wall-e couldn't remember Eve. All in all I feel ashamed of my thinking that Pixar would disappoint, and I will eagerly awaiting their next movie. Thank you Pixar, for making our lives brighter. Also thanks to my friends and family, who convinced me to go watch this movie, I appreciate it."

","First of all, it's all about its godly animation, music, and humorous story, though not the story itself. I should say the last few parts does not really sounds like a wall e movie, perhaps its title should have been changed to ""robots"" (only for those parts only) even though a movie with that title has already existed. It pretty much changed into a story all about eve, though eve might not sits well as the title though. Due to the fantasy and graceful moments wanted-to-be-involved, it has some weaknesses in the storyline. Remember the plant was not dead though wasn't able to breath in the outer space, or the humans don't realize earth was all dead even though there have been no positive (and that eve or some other robots said plant)result so far, so probably they should have known what plant is and there are none left on earth therefore they wont be confused knowing the definition of ""earth"" and the fact that there's no more grass.I don't think wall e lacks the part though, but too much was told through eves viewpoint since the time they left earth, and there are too much mistakes in the movie, even monotonous one (now i say too much). Though, i wont state such unimportant ones like the rocket sign moved away from wall e, or there are no Americans in the axiom and it landed on the same place where wall e first depart without anyone pointing the way etc (i just spell it though). Somebody even talks about the impossible condition of people slipping around as the gravitation in the axiom was made-up. Simply say, just look at the one mistake you see really monotonously during your first watch of the movie, then judge (the feel-good feeling will last after a week or two mine was just an hour). Does it deserves the glory it has? Really loved the first earth part though, kind of remind me of i am legend, don't know how to say it though. Makes everybody pity wall e."
"honorhorror","10","0","2","14 August 2008"," Wall E is one of the kind cartoon movie.
","To date, this is the most unique movie produced by Pixar so far. Unlike the more hyped Brad Bird's two movies(Incredibles and Rattatoule), this one really delivers a new classic. <br/><br/>I think it's a one-of-the-kind cartoon because: 1, it's so hilarious fun to watch the most impossible event happening on the big screen: robots' romance, which naturally leads to the conclusion that Wall E has a really good script, a script that is so freely written that it ignores all the common senses and scientific notions. It's virtually a futuristic comedy version of Romeo and Juliet, presenting the forbidden love between robots(supposedly forbidden). Prepare to have some revolution in your mind if you are going to see this one because this is the most romantic sci-fi so far.<br/><br/>2, concerning the script, you can argue there are plot holes: for example, if Eva's mission to the earth is to search for any life form on the earth rather than destroy them, why would she have such a mass-destructive weapon, which detonates so many times when she sees something moving around? Secondly, if she was searching for any form of life, why would she ignore the cockroach? Furthermore, Eva's spaceship, which traveled through several galaxy systems to reach the colony ship, didn't perform a super-space jump, which means it was traveling very fast. But Wall-E was able to hang on it all through the process, how did it happen? Well, I still want to argue...But stop! Nobody would spoil the fun when watching this movie because they are all caught up in the lovely characters and obsessed with this greatest inhuman love ever presented. This is how Pixar writes a screenplay, we should all bow and learn from them.<br/><br/>3, The technical perspective: easily flawless. The abandoned earth is so beautifully decorated that you would believe it's real, which reminds me of I Am Legend. The physics, mechanics of robots are all convincing enough, and have been a carnival for eyes. <br/><br/>Wow, there are so many great things to say about the movie, really can't say them one by one.

I just really loved when Wall-E said Eve.... It was really cute and touched my heart...... <br/><br/>I think its about time that human beings get up their lazy bums and start to look into the future...

","As usual, Pixar has made another masterpiece. As a Pixar fan since Toy Story and as a Sci Fi fan, this movie made me smile every step of the way. The story line was beautiful and has the Pixar stamp of quality approval all over it, the plot was wonderful yet humorous, (especially the fact that humankind has turned into a lazy, obese, ignorant society), and the characters are probably the most charming characters you'll ever see on an animated movie. <br/><br/>My favorite part of the movie was probably the first 30 minutes of the movie when there was no dialog whatsoever, yet it gets the audience closer to Wall-E than they'll ever be to any other character in any other movie. And then there is EVE, a robot which looks like the most beautiful white acrylic iPod i've ever seen. After they met, they will start on a beautiful, charming, warm, and an absolutely magical journey (which i won't spoil).<br/><br/>To sum up, Wall-e is an enchanting movie that will probably make any children dream, and make older audiences like me feel that Disney magic in my tummy again. <br/><br/>My only fear now is my high bar of expectations towards Pixar. Because all these incredible movies are hard to top off one after the other."

","Hollywood is full of imaginations. It has shown us the romance of Human, Horses, Dogs and many other. And now, it has now taken the case of Robots and the love in them. Yet another hit by Pixar Studios.. This story is about a robot named Wall-E, the last robot left on the earth as the whole human race is shifted in space. The time is 2812 AD, hence it is clear that Human has developed a lot and devastated the earth completely. Wall-E remains in the earth and cleans up all the junk, feeling lonely in the whole planet. Comes Eve with a mission and they fall in love. And hence starts the journey of Wall-E to attract Eve towards itself. Pixar has proved that animation is as real as the actual world, and film after film, it is narrowing the gap between the two. The emotions of the robot, their voice and the perfect picturisation of the future human race are the main look outs of the movie. Not only that, it has again kept the point correct that even if machines are powerful, they don't have their own mind, and hence loose out to us."
"pc95","8","0","3","7 August 2008"," Outstanding lack of dialog and Visually Spectacular
","I don't think one Pixar movie has ever fallen into even mediocre rating. Every time I see a new production I'm blown away. Wall-E is no different. This movie really makes a great choice in cutting away dialog and letting soothing music and visuals delight us. It reaches for the stars and never stops aspiring. This is the first time Pixar has mixed in live action video too - not sure I liked it but it's novel nonetheless. I most especially liked the first 30 min of the movie set on Earth where we meet Wall-E and live sort of his daily life of wonder. Surely some of the reviewers here will remember Short Circuit - whose Johnny 5 had the same sorts of humor. In that movie the warnings and theme's dealt with the military, here of course it's the environment. This sort of message was shrewdly placed and a little bit overdone but diluted with some humor as well. Wall-E brings a fresh experience without a lot of the camaraderie of past productions, and may be the most majestic Pixar Production to date. It captures wonderful detail, music, feelings, and humor with a minimalist simplicity."
"sati_84","9","0","2","1 August 2008"," The perfect way how not to make this movie perfect
","I loved almost all the Pixar movies, I rated several of them 10/10, and I still have hopes that they will make another perfect movie after Finding Nemo. But I have to wait, because Wall-E wasn't the movie I was waiting for 5 years. It could have been, but it wasn't.<br/><br/>The premise is somewhat similar to I am Legend, but in a cute way. So I can totally forgive this. In the first 20 minutes, the creativity of the Pixar guys shines on the screen: you see gags after gags after gags. These jokes make you interested in the title character, but I still think the exposition was too short. And here it is, the first appearance of the movie's fundamental problem: the creators didn't fully build up the characters. Something is missing. Something, which is so important for us to be fully involved in a movie, and it's not here. Therefore when the first plot-development happens (the arrival of EVE) you are a little off. Not much. Just a little.<br/><br/>We get yet another exposition, this time with more gags. It sounds repetitive, but it isn't. Actually, it's good. Not brilliant, but pretty good. But something is missing again: we don't get enough character-buildup to REALLY care about them. I wrote the keyword in caps, because both characters are involving, so of course I care about them, most of all because I have a heart.<br/><br/>This movie tries to play with your heart. That's why the missing element is so obvious: if you're watching a thought-provoking movie, if it's slightly flawed, you still can be pretty involved in it - but no one can deceive your heart. And Wall-E is an emotional movie, not an intellectual one. That's why I can't really tell you what's missing. Because I don't KNOW what it is, (the character-buildup thing is the closest thing I can mention)I just FEEL it...<br/><br/>Then another 20 minutes pass, and another plot development occurs. This time, this puts you in a completely new environment. The creativity of the Pixar guys shows yet again, it's entertaining, clever, a little blatant (basically they shouting ""MORAL MESSAGE!"" right into your ear in every scene involving humans from now on...), but you can forgive that. After all, it's a nearly perfect movie. Nearly...<br/><br/>You get the idea: the initial flaw never disappears, and when the credits rolled, I still wanted something more. I was waiting for something that never happened. I was waiting for the moment, when the movie totally sucks you into itself. The moment, when you can't escape. The moment, I get teary eyes. On this movie, I never did...<br/><br/>I admit, that I'm a guy and I got teary eyes while watching Monsters, Inc. (several times!), and that movie grabbed me by my heart in the first 2 minutes. The Toy Story movies were perfect too, so was Finding Nemo.<br/><br/>On to the plot twist of this review: because we're talking about feelings, you don't have to take what I say for granted. Something was missing from this movie, but you're not me. You're you, with different feelings and different views. And a different heart. So even if I couldn't fully identify with this movie, you still have all the chance to do so. I strongly recommend you to watch it, because it certainly has the potential of a masterpiece. It wasn't one for me, but if this movie hits you, you will be amazed and enchanted. Just like I was when I first watched Monsters, Inc.<br/><br/>9/10"

The love story was cute and enjoyable.

The animation is incredible and gives a great message in every way while at the same time being humorous and, forgive me, but ""cute."" Children will enjoy it and certain adults will gain something from it. I hope it doesn't get a bad rep from those who feel guilty after watching. Disney/PIXAR is sending a strong message in a pretty direct way which some people may dislike. You love Wall-E by the end of the movie and wish it wasn't as short as it was. For sci-fi fans, notice the few references to 2001: A Space Odyssey. The music is the same in a few scene and the captain's robot reminded me of HAL.

","It's not yet a finished review because I haven't seen this movie with a full theatrical experience, which I think will get me a whole new (read: far more wonderful) image about the overall performance of the movie.<br/><br/>Well, from my point of view, WALL-E is wonderfully cute. It extends human feelings to the deepest. But expecting it will be a completely cute movie, I was rather alienated cause actually not the whole movie seems to be like that. The theme is darker than previous Pixar's movie and in some parts or another, I had myself hard to relate with the robotic/future theme and the sound effects, etc. Watching WALL-E is more like watching The Incredibles, rather than watching Ratatouille or Finding Nemo.<br/><br/>Despite my difficulty to relate with the theme, WALL-E is really breathtaking in many aspects and I cried many times throughout the whole story because I just feel that it's so wonderful to watch such a drawing of a simple yet deep feeling between two robots. And it's what is really strong in the movie, i.e. the message of love. LoL. It's cliché, but it is LOV-E. :D Yes, I had a great experience watching WALL-E although not in a theatrical experience. WALL-E and Eve are just so adorable. But afterall, I kinda expected the ending would be longer or as great or greater or as exciting as/than Ratatouille's finest ending, but it seem that I didn't get it. Absolutely 10/10, but only the second best yet, for me as Ratatouille has the more complete package to offer and more beautiful and concluded ending.

","In my opinion , this is one of Pixar's weakest movies. It was too simple and way too dark for children. They used a cute robot in love which made cute noises and says EVA every single minute. But hey, the love story is much more credible than most romantic comedies or dramas ever made. Just a few words describe 100 emotions. An incredible character development and a good adventure.<br/><br/>First 30 minutes are amazing, after that its just OK. An entertaining adventure in space. Somehow, Wall-e breaks my mind in two. One part of me thinks it's the best animation movie of all time, the other thinks is a good movie but one of Pixar's weakest. Even though, Pixar is the best animation studio out there.<br/><br/>So therefore i'll give Wall-e: First 30 minutes: 10/10 Rest of the movie: 7.5/10 Total : 8.3/10"

","So far Pixar has made 10 hits already including this one.<br/><br/>Wall-E takes place 700 years into the future where the people of Earth have left due to a landfill issue. So the Wall-E unit was made to clean up Earth. The Wall-E we see throughout the film has spent so many centuries on Earth that he's developed a personality of his own. There's cleaning and finding old artifacts on Wall-E's daily schedule. But one day, he encounters something from outer space, where a highly advance egg shape robot name EVE. Who is program to be female. It was love at first site, and Wall-E tries everything he could to show his feelings towards EVE and that he cares about her.<br/><br/>No doubt, Pixar always succeeds in making a well received animated film. That's because the writers and producers spend a lot of time in making the story good and giving us viewers what we like to see.<br/><br/>The plot and story is very well made. It's the first Pixar film to include actual live action scenes which are seen on the hologram screens and the first one to only include 1/2 of voice dialog while the rest is partly silent with the robot only making sound o fix to talk.<br/><br/>The visual effects and animation are superb. The details on the abandon earth and space are all solid grade A work. There's so much detail, it's one of those movies where you'd have to re-watch it to see what you over looked.<br/><br/>Parodies, including the usual Pixar in-jokes from their other films. This one includes a good number of parodies from various Sci-Fi films next to some original stuff. Also you'll be seeing a musical scene form an actual old movie throughout the film cause it plays an important part for the Wall-E character.<br/><br/>Overrall, I recommend this movie to anyone including Pixar and animation fans a like.

"johcafra","7","0","3","6 July 2008"," Piiiiiiiiiixar Iiiiiiiiiin Spaaaaaaaaaace!!!
","I'll admit my primary motive for viewing this flick was to see what Pixar would do with a genre for which I'd thought it eminently suited from the get-go. In this regard I wasn't disappointed, and noted that ""live-action"" was seamlessly integrated into the animation. I suspect Industrial Light and Magic had more than its customary input into the production.<br/><br/>I'll also admit surprise at, of all things, the choice of music. One result was a spooky introduction, and even Peter Gabriel complemented the estimable end credit sequence. There's one piece of Thomas Newman's score I'll have to listen to again, involving, I would think, ""looped"" guitars, and you don't hear that every day.<br/><br/>The story is direct and for the most part unencumbered, and perhaps best regarded in two discrete parts. To run for as long with nothing more said than Ben Burtt's electronic warbling and Fred Willard's Presidential impression is a gutsy move. The overall action is not conducive to blinking.<br/><br/>Face it, if you try to entertain everyone and Say Something in the same breath you'll walk a tightrope no matter the message or choice of delivery. ""The Art Of"" book depicts what this flick could've been, and I think that would've sent audience members scurrying.<br/><br/>But to those who think this a ""green"" manifesto or propaganda, I suggest they read more science fiction, starting with Jonathan Swift and H. G. Wells. Or perhaps just read more.<br/><br/>It's a fable, friends, plain and simple, and if the viewer recognizes anything, even him- or herself, for the briefest of moments, then--it all works."

But never before has these often used frames for a story been used more creatively. The first movie I ever saw in a they're was Toy Story. I remember this sort of light feeling I got when I saw it. I never had that feeling again until I saw Wall-e. It brought up what it was like to be a kid again. Wall-e is an amazing character. He strolls in perfectly formed, and unlike the protagonists of many movies, we are always behind him 100%. Not everyone will love this movie as much as I do, but I honestly can't find a single thing wrong with it. Most of the time it didn't even feel like a cartoon.

","I just saw Disney Pixar's newest computer animated film, and honestly I was blown away. Because of the kind of movie it is (children's animated summer film), I was expecting something funny, entertaining, and some adult humor thrown in for the adults. I've enjoyed all of Pixar's previous movies, and count them all as very good films, not just family films.<br/><br/>What I wasn't expecting was Wall E. Despite being Pixar, I would by NO MEANS call Wall E a 'Children's Film'. A family-friendly movie, yes, but the over all theme and moral of the film, I believe, are above the heads of most viewers under the age of 9. Unlike most modern children's films that use slightly sexual humor or other adult jokes, Wall E is simply a great movie. There are no sex jokes, no overly feminine or masculine characters, and no cynical sarcasm.<br/><br/>Wall E is, essentially, an environmental movie. But, unlike other movies this summer (cough/ The Happening /cough), the moral is not shoved in your face, and while it's still there, the story of Wall E far overshadows any possible preachiness.<br/><br/>Basically, Go See Wall E.

The story of WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter  Earth class), a robot whose sole purpose is to gather up the forsaken Earth's rubble and compile it in an organized fashion, is a blatant reminder that we ultimately need to get our (keep it G-rated) act together.<br/><br/>And of course Wall-E is not without it's special treat, an animated short that precedes the main feature.

Disagree and enjoy the film! Everything is NOT a left wing plot to twist minds, you have the ability to listen, watch, enjoy, and disagree if you chose.<br/><br/>This is a great achievement in film making, especially in animated film. With very little dialog, the film manages to discuss a current issue, develop a cute love story, and really slam the typical American who just sits around and cannot function without our electronics...this issue I agree with.<br/><br/>I can see how small children may not like this as you need the ability to follow a story without the dialog walking us through, a tough skill for many small kids (and too many adults).<br/><br/>the animation is amazing and this really is a good SciFi movie, not just a good animated film. Plus, the little short about the magician before the flick is good too."

","Wall-E is something rare for me to find anymore as a parent ... a film that is easy to watch, starkly non-commercial, true to its promoted values and (most importantly) not drenched in adult humor (you know, the kind that we pretend go over our children's heads even if they see it in virtually everything that Hollywood produces).<br/><br/>Wall-E was highly reminiscent in viewing of a Chaplin-esquire silent film. The lead character is sincere, quaint, clumsy, loving, lonely and true of character all at once to such a degree that makes him impossible to not find incredibly endearing throughout. Although the dialogue is limited, the emotional conveyances are so clear that the children in the audience will likely pay little notice. The effect that our protagonist has on both the other characters in film and the audience is truly heart-warming. In fact, the dialogue present in the movie could almost be termed a distraction.<br/><br/>There are two main messages in the film, both of which are made in no uncertain terms. The first (which will most likely be mistaken as primary) is an environmental one suggesting our need to care and put effort into our world to maintain it. The second is more of a classic ""love conquers all"". Although the first of these can certainly be considered more relevant to our times, the second is what makes the film truly appealing to a broad audience and immediately accessible to even the 4-6 year old crowd.<br/><br/>In closing, this is a film that I can easily recommend for child and adults, and not because of the reason that type of recommendation is typically made. This is a wonderful film that will be praised for its technology, but ultimately success for its heart."
