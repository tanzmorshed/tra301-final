","This is an entertaining film version of The Runaways story. I say version because there is another film on this band called ""Edgeplay,"" which complements this movie perfectly. Essentially, ""The Runaways"" is Joan Jett's and Cherie Currie's version of things. In ""Edgeplay,"" which is a documentary, the rest of the band has its say.<br/><br/>But let's discuss ""The Runaways."" <br/><br/>Kristen Stewart's portrayal of Jett is phenomenal. She's got the slouchy guitar playing, the gum chewing, the swagger and the foggy voice nailed. Jett is all girl and quite pretty, but she's always had the manner of a boy. Stewart gets it right. She is not just twitchy Bella, for sure.<br/><br/>If you've ever seen the real Kim Fowley (you can on YouTube), you will see that Michael's Shannon's portrayal of him is not at all over the top. In fact, many who knew him would probably say this depiction is too forgiving to the bizarre monster Fowley really was.<br/><br/>Dakota Fanning acquits herself well as Currie, the band's sexpot singer. The movie gives Currie the only family backstory, probably because the movie is based on her memoir ""Neon Angel."" It would have been interesting to see Jett's back story depicted. The movie might leave you thinking she's a native Californian, but she didn't move there with her family until she was a teenager. She was born in Philadelphia and spent her childhood in Maryland.<br/><br/>Some may question things that happen in this movie. Did they really write ""Cherry Bomb"" on the spot for Currie's audition? Did Fowley really teach the girls to dodge garbage thrown at them on stage? Did the Japanese really go THAT apesh*t over the band? <br/><br/>Yes to all. Watch ""Edgeplay,"" where these and other facts about the band are discussed by the girls (now women in their forties) themselves in 2004. (The doc is available for instant viewing on Netflix.) This movie was made by Vicki Blue, one of the band's bass players (the actual band went through five bassists, which is why the bass player in ""The Runaways"" is a fictional creation called ""Robin"").<br/><br/>I have my gripes with ""Edgeplay,"" mostly about the jittery camera-work, which I guess is supposed to be edgy, but is just pretentious and annoying. But it is the truth behind the ""truth."" ""The Runaways"" makes no mention of Currie's abortion while in the band or bass player Jackie Fox's suicide attempt. In ""Edgeplay,"" Fox, now a lawyer, even displays the scar on her wrist. ""The Runaways"" makes clear that these teenage girls fought. ""Edgeplay"" gets into why. In the doc, it is also stated openly that some of them were having sex with each other (and it wasn't just Jett and Currie). Hey, it was the Seventies.<br/><br/>Joan Jett declined to participate in ""Edgeplay,"" despite the fact she is portrayed in a mostly positive light as perhaps the most ambitious, talented and level-headed member of the band. I was a bit shocked that at the end of ""The Runaways"" when you get the obligatory ""what happened to them"" text on the screen, only Jett, Currie and Fowley are mentioned.<br/><br/>The most shameful omission here is the tragic Sandy West, the band's doggedly devoted drummer and perhaps the best female drummer in the history of rock (well, maybe until the Go Go's Gina Schock arrived). She and Jett essentially started the band, as shown in ""The Runaways."" Her history after the band broke up is sad. She was reduced to construction work. Her post-band life was one of drug using, drug dealing, guns and jail. She died of cancer in 2006, but in ""Edgeplay"" you can see her two years before her death discussing the breakup of the band, which clearly broke her heart. She never recovered.<br/><br/>It is also wrong to ignore Lita Ford's post-Runaways modest success as a solo rock artist. She's also the most entertaining interviewee in ""Edgeplay."" <br/><br/>All in all, I have praise for both movies. Both are candid portrayals of the first all-girl band in rock history, paving the way for the Go Go's, L7, Bikini Kill and, perhaps the most talented of all, Sleater-Kinney, a band that has also broken up, but in a much more friendly way.<br/><br/>You go, girl rockers!"
"lewiskendell","8","64","81","20 July 2010"," Inappropriate and in your face. The way any movie about The Runaways should be.
","""You hear that? That's the sound of hormones raging.""<br/><br/>The Runaways is at the opposite end of the spectrum from most recent music biopics. Where movies like Ray and Walk the Line aim for emotional resonance and creating a connection between an iconic figure and the audience, The Runaways is about style, dramatics, and looking good. Which is pretty in line with what the band was about. The sobriety of those movies I previously mentioned wouldn't have worked for such a hyper- kinetic story as this one. Sure, the movie slows down a bit when the crash and burn sets in, but the focus on style, sound and imagery is never really replaced by anything else. And I mean that as a compliment. <br/><br/>Michael Shannon didn't really work for me as Kim Fowley, but the movie wasn't really about him, anyway. The five girls playing the group seemed to have an inappropriate amount of fun with their roles, and who wouldn't? You can't help but be impressed by their performances, they play and act like a real band. But no doubt about it, this is Kristin Stewart's (Joan Jett) and and Dakota Fanning's (Cherie Currie) show. They don't let you forget it. Not many actresses their age would have the talent and the balls to take something like this on. They do it, and do it right. I left the movie with a healthy amount of respect for both of them.     <br/><br/>The entire movie plays out like a music video about all the things you would be mortified of seeing your teenage daughter doing, but of course, would make her cool to do. Which makes sense, as the director (Floria Sigismondi) is best known for directing music videos. The cinematography gleefully sells the same excess, ego, and intoxication that the Runaways' image did. All the band's songs that are woven throughout the movie keep it moving at a super-charged pace. <br/><br/>You have to tailor the tone of a film to its subject matter, in order for it to be successful. The Runaways is the true(ish), female version of sex, drugs, and rock & roll, and I couldn't help but really enjoy every bawdy and inappropriate minute of it. Get in a Runaways frame of mind, or don't even bother with this one."

","I became a huge fan of Joan Jett with her first #1 single, I LOVE ROCK N ROLL, back in 1982. For years I remained a devoted follower of her albums, saw her in concert up close at small venues, and even got to meet her in person on a few occasions including getting to go backstage after a gig in 1985. It was only once she'd become popular that I discovered that she was originally in an all-girl rock band called The Runaways. Thus I found myself going back and collecting Runaways records too. So for me, this film was something to look forward to.<br/><br/>As Jett has confirmed in interviews, THE RUNAWAYS is mainly true, but there are some artistic liberties taken. The now-51, black-haired rock veteran stayed on the set so young Kristen Stewart (who portrays a teenaged Joan) could observe her movements and ticks, and also to make sure the story stayed somewhat in the right ballpark. The movie begins in 1975 and chronicles Joan's early years as a die-hard rock and roll chick with a rebellious nature who learns to play guitar and wants to form a hardcore, all-girl rock band (""No guys!"" she insists). She stumbles upon the eccentric record producer Kim Fowley (a faithful rendering by Michael Shannon) who likes Jett's cool spunk and determination, but is more struck with the seedy possibilities of exploiting an orgasmic teenage girl band with guitars (""Jail-F'ing-Bait!"" he exclaims with glee, pumping his fist). Together, Jett and Fowley seek out other band members. They comb the dark nightclubs where loud vintage '70s music by artists like David Bowie plays, for a blonde girl with just the right look to function as the lead singer for their group. It's there that they discover 15-year-old Cherie Currie (Dakota Fanning), who's not far removed from her first period and who is desperate to become a singer. The Runaways are formed with Cherie up front possessing no strong rock chops, but getting pushed by Fowley and Jett to vocalize and gyrate like a slut having an orgasm. The girls practice enough to eventually get signed by Mercury Records and take off on a trip to Japan by 1977, which was the only place they struck it big, almost becoming as huge as The Beatles there. As many familiar rock and roll stories go, Currie becomes absorbed in the drug world and ultimately tensions mount within the group.<br/><br/>THE RUNAWAYS was partly based on Currie's autobiography, and in a way she is the focal point of the story. Dakota Fanning does a pretty decent job handling this type of slimy material, considering she was only 15 herself during filming. It's too bad though that her character is just not that interesting and, for me, young Dakota never quite captured the presence of the real Cherie onstage. I'm admittedly more biased toward Joan Jett, but it's Jett's driving persona which is the most compelling ingredient of the film. I was concerned Kristen Stewart might think that sporting a dyed black haircut would be enough to become Joan Jett, but she actually nailed the aggressive nuances of Jett perfectly. Joan is portrayed as the one member in the film who treats the band seriously, loves and breathes the experience, is committed and tireless. It's a small wonder she had such a successful and long-running solo career after the group disbanded. And Kristen's singing just blew me away -- both Stewart and Fanning sang for the movie -- and Stewart sounds exactly like Jett as she belts out part of one of Joan's original early songs, ""I Love Playin With Fire"". Unfortunately, the movie only gets to see one song rendered in its entirety: ""Cherry Bomb"" (sung by Dakota), which was considered the band's only ""hit"", and was co-written by Fowley and Jett, specifically for Cherie to learn and sing. The rest of the soundtrack is pretty good, with background songs by Bowie, Iggy Pop, the Sex Pistols, and even the real Runaways themselves. As someone familiar with the original Runaways recordings, it was fun for me to pick them out in snippets here and there.<br/><br/>The problems I had which kept me from giving the film three stars were that this isn't really anything we haven't seen before, and it's something of a typical cookie cutter rock screenplay with no soul other than the determined presence of Jett. Really unfortunate was that the other three female band members were largely ignored. Not so much drummer Sandy West (who died of lung cancer in 2006); she gets a few lines and respectful moments. But lead guitarist Lita Ford (who had some fleeting success of her own in the '80s) was strategically left out of the action because in real life she and Joan Jett's camp have undergone some personal problems (Ford says Jett's longtime manager Kenny Laguna ""disgustingly"" offered to buy Ford's life story for a thousand bucks). Reportedly, Lita has threatened to sue if not portrayed accurately in the film. While she is largely disregarded, there are moments in the movie in which Ford (played by Scout Taylor-Compton of Rob Zombie's HALLOWEEN) completely comes off as a whining bitch. Most outlandish is that real-life bass player Jackie Fox was completely written out and is now replaced by a totally fictitious character called ""Robin"" (Fox is a lawyer today, so one may assume the filmmakers weren't taking any chances). In 2004, one-time Runaway Vicki Blue made a documentary called EDGEPLAY which is worth seeking out for the real dirt about The Runaways. Joan Jett refused to participate in that project, but it's got recollections from Lita Ford, Jackie Fox, and Sandy West. It makes a good companion piece to this film, and doesn't pull punches. I had some fun with THE RUNAWAYS, but it's something of a watered down version of what actually happened and could have been a bit tougher and more dramatic. **1/2 out of ****"

","I've been a Runaways fan since 1976, so I had been anticipating this film for a long time. Having read Cherie Currie's book, Neon Angel, on which the film is very loosely based, I was pretty familiar with the broad outlines of the story. As with any film adaptation of a book, I knew they would leave some things out and streamline other things, and I also suspected the film wouldn't be as dark as the book, which turned out to be true.<br/><br/>What the film really nailed was the relationship between the Runaways and their sleazy manager/producer Kim Fowley. Michael Shannon does a fabulous job playing this over-the-top character. His expletive-filled rants are simultaneously hilarious and cringe-worthy.<br/><br/>The stars, Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning, are both excellent as Joan Jett and Cherie Currie, respectively. Stewart displays Jett's consuming passion for rock and roll and her desire to work hard to be a star. Fanning does a very good job balancing Currie's conflicting desires (to be a rock star and be with her family). It's no secret that the film doesn't spend much time with the other three members of the band. I have no problem with that, since Jett and Currie are, for me, the most interesting and most talented members.<br/><br/>The film does a great job showing the band performing. Stewart and Fanning clearly worked hard to be believable as rockers, and it paid off. You see the progression of both characters from neophytes to seasoned performers, and it works. Another aspect is the struggle by the Runaways to be taken seriously. There were very few hard-rocking ladies in 1976, so they faced a lot of skepticism. The film shows this very well.<br/><br/>The music is very good. The new versions of Runaways songs are good, although Fanning sounds nothing like Currie. The period songs are a nice selection, from David Bowie to Gary Glitter to the Stooges. The filmmakers nailed the look of the period as well. The clothes, hair, furniture, etc., are just right.<br/><br/>Overall, this is an excellent film. I highly recommend it."
"JimBeam49","4","8","9","22 February 2011"," Entertaining, but overall disappointing.
","Let me start by saying that I was in my early 20's when the Runaways first came on the music scene back in the mid 70's. I've enjoyed their music all these years and as a fan have always wanted to know their story. There are two movies about the Runaways, this movie ""The Runaways"" and a documentary called ""Edgeplay - A Film About The Runaways"" from 2004. Unfortunately, neither film was made with the support and cooperation of all of the band members. This film was produced by Joan Jett and is focused on her and Cheri Curry. Lita Ford and Jackie Fox didn't get on board, so in my opinion a huge part of the story isn't being told. The bio Edgeplay has the same type problem, Joan Jett didn't get on board with that project, so again, a huge part of the story is missing. The bottom line for me then is this, was the moving entertaining and worth watching. I'd say yes with some reservations. First of all this isn't a documentary by any means. A movie based on true events maybe? Well, based on Joan Jetts and Cheri Curries rendition of events that they chose to portray. I believe Joan's ego got squarely in the way of how things really were back then. Perhaps why all the members didn't participate? Also, I wasn't really impressed with Dakota Fanning's performance. I couldn't quite buy into her character portrayal. I just kept seeing Dakota, not Cherie and this was quite distracting. Maybe someday, someone will make the truly definitive biography of the band with all the legal squabbles left behind, but I doubt it. So watch both films, and you'll be getting the best representation possible of what the Runaways were and went through all those years ago. One thing is for sure, the music was great back then and still is today."
"rosco29","3","8","9","1 August 2010"," Disappointing
","I really wanted to like this movie. Grew up with the Runaways, love Joan Jett & Lita Ford, was hoping for so much more. Kudos for costumes & music, not to mention Stewart nailing Joan Jett's look. But the director confuses shock value with ""deep meaning,"" and the editing leaves you with a very distorted picture of the Runaways' career. No mention of touring with the Ramones? Or the fact that they played with Van Halen, Cheap Trick, etc? I guess that's the price you pay for being based on Cherie Curie's book.<br/><br/>The ""where are they now"" section at the end just hammers home how spotty this film is. I know Jett & Ford have their differences, but come on, how do not mention that Lita was essentially Metal's reigning goddess of the '80s? Or that Vickie Blue was in ""This is Spinal Tap"" and became a director. Or the cancer-related death of Sandy West?<br/><br/>Bottom line: watch the far superior Edgeplay: A Film About The Runaways (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0216731/) if you really want a coherent picture of this seminal American rock band."
"airguitarprincess","8","44","68","21 February 2010"," Artistic but in a good way
","SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT! I saw this movie in January at a Sundance event in Madison Wisconsin with Cherie Currie actually in attendance. There's a lot of two things in The Runaways, drugs and sexual references but really what can you expect from a movie about a 70s rock band. For those of you who have read the script in advance only small details change for instance Joan doesn't actually steal the leather jacket in the beginning nothing bigger then that really. The music is amazing of course even if you're not a Runaways fan it's a pretty catchy and weaves itself easily into the story line. You don't see even a glimpse of Bella in Kristen's portrayal of Joan Jett, having seen Joan Jett live, Kristen really captured her essence. Dakota Fanning was noticeably a better actress then Kristen Stewart, Dakota was Cherie and stole the show hands down. When the real Cherie Currie did a Q and A after the movie was over I got to see just how perfectly Dakota mastered even her personality. The movie it did drag at parts but the highlights definitely made up for it. The scene where Joan walks out of her first guitar lesson and Cherie at the talent show are two of my favourite movie moments. I don't know the actual filming lingo for the artistic angels and blurriness for the lack of a better word but it was all used very effectively creating an artistic feel not just another high budget Hollywood film. This movie may bring up a lot of questions about Cherie and Joan's possible romantic relationship during their time in the Runaways but when asked at the Q and A Cherie said it was nothing more than friends experimenting. To address the debate over the whole Kristen Stewart-Twilight audience this movie will attract all I can say as a Twilight fan who was a Runaways fan before Twilight was invented, I think some of the content in the movie will disturb the stereotypical Twilight fan. There's a lot of drug and sexual references made that I think a younger audience like that might not understand for instance Cherie masturbating in the shower to images of Farrha Fawcett (behind a shower curtain of course) or I believe it was Joan pissing on a guitar. Overall it's a good movie not my favourite but still solid, some parts dragged but with all the star power, great music, a pretty crazy story and a lot of heart I think this movie has the potential to top the box office in March."
"jickweez-1","10","58","94","16 March 2010"," Engrossing tale of innocence lost ... with great music!
","Just caught a special screening of The Runaways last night at the Laemmle on Sunset, and it more than exceeded expectations. The leads (Kristen Stewart, Michael Shannon and Dakota Fanning) do an admirable job playing the sullen budding rock star, whacked-out manager and reluctant front girl. At first, it looked as though Stewart was going to fall back on her woe-is-me (woe-is-us who have to suffer through it) Bella character in Twilight, but her performance as Joan Jett soon showed a shyness and vulnerability that made the role three dimensional and overall enjoyable. Shannon gives a wonderful turn as Kim Fowley, The Runaways' too-brilliant-for-his-own-good manager and has some of the best lines in the movie (my friend and I were giddy every time he opened his mouth). But the real star here is Fanning as the innocent Cherie Curie, who didn't ask to be a star but was thrust into the spotlight nevertheless. Watching her downward spiral from innocent young woman (the film opens with her getting her first period) to trying to buy a jug of vodka for breakfast is where this movie soars above others of its ilk. With her big baby blues (wow, those eyes), Fanning portrays innocence lost more effectively than any other actress I can remember. She should be considered for many awards for her performance. Did I mention those eyes?<br/><br/>All in all, The Runaways is a fantastic movie. The direction, though ""arty"" at times, fits in well with the rock 'n' roll themes. The script is nearly pitch perfect without being preachy or excessive. The performances great. The soundtrack genius (from Bowie to The Stooges to The Sex Pistols - and even a few Runaways songs). But what really adds to the authenticity of the 70's period piece are the costumes and set design, which transport the audience back into a time when women rockers were practically unheard of. Some of the fashion (where did they find all those platform heels?) even takes on a life of its own. Looking forward to watching this little gem again."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Getting dragged back to the mid-70's can be quite fun, especially when the topic is rock 'n roll. Based on lead singer Cherie Currie's autobiography, this film provides an overview of the formation, sudden fame, and equally sudden dismantling of the first all-girl's rock band, The Runaways.<br/><br/>Joan Jett was the heart of the band, but it took oddball music producer Kim Fowley to put the band together and get the recording deal. Fowley may be the most interesting character in this story. Here he is played with force by the very talented Michael Shannon (Revolutionary Road).<br/><br/>Instead, the story focuses on Cherie Currie and Joan Jett, mostly Currie, since it is her book! Dakota Fanning plays Cherie Currie as a confused 15 year old with a messed up family life. The family includes a mom, played by Tatum O'Neal, who announces she is getting married and moving to Indonesia. Currie's dad is a very sick alcoholic, so she is an easy recruit for Fowley and Jett. Jett is played balls-out by Kristen Stewart. Yes, Kristen Stewart from Twilight. Here she shows much more of the talent we saw prior to the Twilight series. She captures the fire and spirit of Joan Jett and leaves little doubt she will pursue her dreams despite all obstacles.<br/><br/>Overall, the script comes up short and provides us little more than headlines and a quick glimpse. Would have expected much more on talented guitarist Lita Ford, who continues to work today. For a quick intro to the story of The Runaways, this one is fine. Just don't expect much depth."
"shattenjager777","3","21","32","18 July 2010"," Doesn't live up to the real-life Runaways
","Musician biopics are, with very few exceptions, all the same movie: Musician works hard and becomes star. Musician's life falls apart because of drugs, sex, ego, or some combination thereof. Musician finds sudden professional and personal fulfillment and everything is rosy.<br/><br/>The Runaways in real life have the potential to tell a number of different stories: There's the story of the band's relationship with Svengali-like producer Kim Fowley as his marketing tactics drive the band to stardom but also help to stand in the way of the band's credibility. There's the story of Joan Jett as her band falls apart while on the verge of a breakthrough and she responds by forming her own band that made her a bigger star than she could have imagined just a few years later. There's the story of Joan Jett and Kim Fowley's vision that an all-female rock band could work and Jett's incredible perseverance to make it happen. And any of these stories could be told without too many changes to the facts.<br/><br/>Yet, ""The Runaways"" tells none of these stories. Instead, it tells the normal musician biopic story about Cherie Currie with the added ""attraction"" of a drawn-out build up to a bizarre sort of lesbian sex scene (if it can even be called that) between its two stars and plays fast and loose with the facts to allow that story to be the center of everything. It adds in pieces of the Kim Fowley relationship with the band and references Joan Jett's later success, but the heart of the film is Cherie Currie's story. The film also makes the odd choice of pushing Lita Ford way into the background when the truth is that her undeniable abilities as a guitarist were the band's only real element that added credibility.<br/><br/>The characters are so dull that little can be said of the acting, but Dakota Fanning handles the toughest role of Cherie Currie quite well, even if she is nowhere near sexy enough for Currie as written (which I think is an exaggeration of reality). Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for Kristen Stewart, whose performance as Joan Jett leaves much to be desired. She spends the entire movie with the same half-drugged-out look on her face and walks too stiffly and hunched, like someone self-conscious and unsure of herself while her dialogue and the story instead give the impression of someone who has guts and confidence (as is true of Joan Jett in real life). Michael Shannon's performance as Kim Fowley is bordering on over the top, but that also seems appropriate given the character. No one else really has a role to speak of.<br/><br/>The film doesn't really have a continuous visual style other than its love of short shots, often cutting between two or three shots in a scene that would probably be better served by being done in one shot. The real problem with this editing is that it seems as though it is done for the sole purpose of increasing Stewart's and Fanning's screen time, as anytime someone else starts to appear on screen we get a cut to a new angle so that it's again focused on only one of them, often with no logic as to why. The settings lead to a number of scenes with unusual lighting, filled with high contrasts and bright colors, but it never seems to have any dramatic purpose (save the oddly well-lit bathroom in the middle of the dark club where Jett first sees Currie).<br/><br/>All told, it's a pretty poor film that squanders a rich subject matter. It almost feels like the work of a fan who thinks every element is so interesting that it has to be mentioned but picks the wrong thing to say is the central element. There are a number of ways this could have been an interesting film, but none of them really got followed, which is a shame."
"brando647","7","10","14","20 September 2010"," Rock-N-Roll Biopic Has Nothing New to Offer
","THE RUNAWAYS chronicles the run of one of the most successful all-girl rock bands of all time. The film is based on ""Neon Angel"", the autobiography of the band's original lead singer Cherie Currie, and it gives us a glimpse into the world of rock and roll as seen from the perspective of a group of teenage girls on their way to super-stardom. I had heard some good things about the film when it was first making the festival circuit, but I wasn't as impressed when I finally got a chance to see it myself. The cast did an amazing job in their roles but the film wasn't as great as it probably could have been.<br/><br/>The problem with music biopics, particularly for rock stars, is that most rock stars seem to encounter the same problems: sex, drugs, booze, addiction, conflicting personalities, etc. So we get a lot of repetition with each rock star film and RUNAWAYS is no different. Cherie's decline into addiction, the in-band conflicts, the initial excitement of success and the eventual succumbing to the stress and strain of maintaining the lifestyle. It's nothing we haven't seen before in other films, it's just happening to younger characters. It's fine though because the performances are strong enough that it's easy to forget that the material's nothing new. My main problem with the film was that it came across as unstructured. It felt as if the filmmakers had just strung along random interesting events in the Runaways history and it made it feel like the movie was just wandering along. As a result, the movie loses it's momentum after their first major gig and drags through the last half. It begins around the time Cherie begins to lose control which is a shame; I should be concerned for her character, not bored by the meandering storyline.<br/><br/>The film's saving grace is the cast. Kristen Stewart, Dakota Fanning, and Michael Shannon did an amazing job. Kristen Stewart has earned some major credibility with me thanks to this film. I was concerned that a girl famous for her role in the TWILIGHT saga would ruin such an iconic role (Joan Jett) but she did a fantastic job and seemed to embody her perfectly. Dakota Fanning is Cherie and I've always thought of Fanning as one of the most talented young stars in Hollywood. She provides an innocence in Cherie's character at the start that makes the film interesting to watch when her stardom warps and destroys it. Shannon is the group's manager Kim Fowley. Fowley is apparently infamous for his aggressive style, and his training sessions with the Runaways are the best parts of the film.<br/><br/>You can't have a music film without the music that inspired it and the soundtrack to the film is awesome. It's loaded with music from the Runaways and Joan's later solo run. The filmmaker's transport you back to the late 70s with their dedication to the style, from the clothes to the music and the fads. The movie has all the ingredients to make a great bio movie, but the execution prevents it from rising to what it could've been."

","Oh yes, 'The Runaways' is a good movie. Also for those who aren't aware that it's about the first all-female group in history of rock.<br/><br/>The plot narrows itself down to Kim Fowley (manager), Cherie Currie (lead singer) and Joan Jett (rythm-guitarist). Which is not wrong, but makes that you miss out on a lot of other interesting historical facts about this great Californian rock-band.<br/><br/>About lead-guitarist Lita Ford, for instance. She and Jett were the only band-members able to continue their career in rock-music after the Runaways split up.<br/><br/>About bass-player Jackie Fox, who left the band out of frustration for getting badly paid. Fox became a lawyer in the American music business instead.<br/><br/>The great thing about the Runaways is the magnificent cooperation between their two renowned guitarists Joan Jett and Lita Ford. Between Jett's earsplitting rhythms and Ford's virtuoso lead. This cooperation really earned 'The Runaways' a place in rock history.<br/><br/>Further 'The Runaways' were the first all-female rock-group at a time when people didn't even think about such a thing. And they also played their rock in a period when pop-music's trend was very soft, greatly influenced by 'The Eagles'.<br/><br/>By the way, this film hardly contains any 'Runaways'-music. For this you'd better turn to internet or to a CD. To 'The Runaways live in Japan', for instance, a CD recording their live-concert from 1977 in Japan. At that time 'The Runaways' peaked in a country where they were hugely popular."

","On occasion, the atmosphere of watching a movie at a theater in a certain circumstance adds to the ambiance. Case in point, The Runaways: I saw it at my local cineplex, where, unbeknownst to me since I last ventured into a particular screen, the one where The Runaways played on (good old theater 8), the sound had gotten a little worse. It was crackly, though one could still hear voices and sound fx and music reasonably well, and on the side of the frames of the 2:35:1 aspect ratio, there was some black fizzle or something. For a more prestige picture or big blockbuster, it might have been a hindrance. For the case of The Runaways, it was just about perfect. This mid-1970's trip through a kick-you-in-the-ball girl rock group complimented the flaws in the stereo-sound and the picture, and it was like listening/watching a worn vinyl LP. This coupled with the attitude of the performances, and some of the songs featured, made it like a near Grindhouse event.<br/><br/>That the movie itself is less than great was to be expected. This is one of those rise-fall rock and roll band stories, one you know well if you've seen at least two or three by now (pick your delicious poison, be it The Doors or even Dreamgirls - 'The Fabulous Stains' from the early 80's wouldn't be far off either). And it also has a distinction of being a rise-fall story for a band that was around for only a few years, a less-than-revolutionary girl version of The Sex Pistols, who all wanted to rock but came from different backgrounds and were beat down before they could fully develop rock star egos by a grubby manager/producer.<br/><br/>For the Runaways, we mostly get the stories of Cheri Currie (Dakota Fanning) and Joan Jett (Kirsten Steward). Many will know the latter, since she's made several big hit rock singles, but some in the audience (unless you're already a big Runaway fan or fan of the movie Foxes) won't know who Cheri Currie was. Perhaps that was the appeal for the director, first-timer Flori Sigismondi, that we get a view into the lead singer and how she's actually got a family and a place she's coming from, as opposed to Joan Jett who (by the appearance from the film) just came off the streets and immediately had to play guitar or die or go to prison. Certainly that, too, has a bit of the cliché to it (un-attentive mother, alcoholic father, same old same old), but the filmmaker is able to straddle the line between Currie, Jett and producer Kim Fowley (unmistakably hammy Michael Shannon, maybe too hammy in some scenes).<br/><br/>Here's the thing that works for the film though: as a real gritty rock movie, as a saga of characters rolling around LA (sometimes right under the Hollywood sign), getting wasted, trashing hotel rooms, getting into madness, being rockers who can stand up to those ""men"" that Fowley says don't want to see girls on stage. Subsequently in the story in the film, he exploits them for all he can, usually when they aren't noticing until it really affects their appearance as rock and rollers as opposed to beauty queens (or, of course, Currie as one). Again, some of these story elements are familiar, but this is not what makes the film so appealing - I didn't go to the Runaways to get a super-insightful script, save for a few little nuggets (i.e. they trained in a trailer!).<br/><br/>I went to the Runaways to see rock and roll and rock as it blasted away without care back in the 1970's, albeit shown here as a brew of glam (Bowie) and punk (Pistols) and eventually with Jett and the Blackhearts as a straight up rock and roll band, and that's what I got. I was heavily impressed by the performances of Fanning- who can be legitimately sexy and make it both right for her character and uncomfortable for an audience member to see it in the flesh (and boy it is fleshy!)- and Stewart, who flexes her chops while on leave from the Twilight camp. As mentioned, Shannon is a little too over the top, as he was in Revolutionary Road, but that in and of itself is kind of a marvel, as he isn't taking it seriously, but still has a good time. And the music... ah, for the right fan at the right time, it's blissful to hear and the be blown away by even a movie version of The Runaways, who make one want to rush out and buy any song they recorded. Who knew a revealing, raw-cum-conventional bio-pic would be their best advertisement in years?"
"jsole-152-875117","Null","5","6","5 September 2011"," Good Portrayal of Joan Jett / But What About Lita ?
","I thought the movie was a good portrayal of Joan Jetts early days. I will give Joan all the credit in the world, she is still making music and performing to this day. What about Lita Ford ?? I mean, when I think of Joan Jett...I think of ""I Love Rock and Roll"" ...When I think of Lita Ford, I think of songs like ""Kiss me Deadly"" & ""Close My Eyes Forever"" which were both huge hits in the 80's. The movie hardly mentioned her. The Movie did not even mention her at the the end when it was giving the updates on where Joan, Sherie & Kim...I think Lita should of at least been mentioned...she is still considered by many to be the Queen of Metal still to this day."
"jingster666","1","22","39","4 April 2010"," This movie is a stupid travesty! Where's Lita?
","I was a HUGE fan of the Runaways and followed them during the entirety of their tenure as a rock band. I saw them live and up-close on many, many occasions, possibly as many as thirty to forty shows. I saw them throughout the two personnel changes on bass (Vicki Blue and Laurie McAllister). Then after the demise of the band, I followed the solo careers of Joan Jett, Lita Ford, and Cherie Currie. So, being a first-hand, real-time, expert on the Runaways, it is inconceivable to me that a movie entitled, ""The Runaways"" could possibly be made with so little mention of lead guitarist, Lita Ford. It doesn't really matter to me that Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning look SO MUCH like Joan and Cherie, and that they do their own singing while sounding SO MUCH like the real thing. Also, who cares how much the story captures the ""essence"" of the band and the times in which they operated. For this movie to marginalize and almost completely leave out Lita Ford is not only a TRAVESTY but should be considered CRIMINAL! Everybody concerned should be arrested and sent to prison at hard labor. And I'm NOT exaggerating in the least here! It's a rock and roll crime! <br/><br/>If not for Lita Ford's lead guitar work affording the band almost immediate rock and roll credibility, the Runaways would never have even gotten off the ground, much less be able to fill venues and issue multiple albums of kick-ass rock music. There's no doubt that Joan Jett was a powerful presence on stage and contributed much with her rhythm guitar work and vocals. Also, Sandy's drumming was exceptional. But it was Lita who allowed the Runaways to soar and be taken seriously. For those of you who aren't familiar with Lita's brilliant guitar work, vocals, and her total command of the stage, all you'd have to do is view the DVD entitled, ""Lita Ford - The Complete Video Collection"" (still available from Amazon). There's seven live songs on this collection taken from a concert at Wembley Stadium in London in 1989 that will blow your mind and demonstrate Lita's true greatness. Neither Joan Jett nor Cherie Currie has ever - nor will they ever - even come close to attaining Lita's level of rock and roll prowess. <br/><br/>I consider the movie, ""The Runaways,"" to be a total joke and a rather tawdry ripoff. It's based on the updated version of Cherie Currie's autobiography, ""Neon Angel."" The introduction to the book is by none other than Joan Jett herself! Yep, these two pretenders to Lita Ford's throne are just out there making some heavy and undeserved trash-cash and obviously couldn't care less about the truth or the facts. And just to demonstrate how contrived the book is, Currie states in the book that her identical twin sister, Marie, bailed out on their joint-venture album, ""Messin' With The Boys,"" and left Cherie high and dry to go it alone, and that Marie refused to go on the road with a rock band to support the album. This a total fabrication because I saw the two of them, on the road, with a rock band, in concert, in 1980. <br/><br/>This whole Runaways movie just makes me sick to my stomach, and if I was a billionaire, I'd buy up all the prints to this stupid movie and destroy them immediately, never allowing them to see the light of day again! <br/><br/>Cherie Currie and Joan Jett: You should be ashamed of yourselves! And I feel certain that Sandy (RIP) would never approve of this mess!"
"trippsta_3185","10","25","46","12 November 2010"," Great Movie
","Great movie. It's told from Cherie's point of view. As most of you know, Kristen Stewart plays Joan Jett. A lot of people hang sh*t on her acting because of the Twilight Movies... Twilight was made for young teens. Plus, the movies are made so close together, she hasn't got the time to really get a feel of the character in each movie... Don't overlook this movie because of Kristen Stewart and say ""Oh no she's the chick from Twilight"" Hire the movie. Don't get put off. That said, I think Kristen Stewart done a fantastic job playing Joan Jett. Excellent in fact... She's caught my eye, and I will be looking out for her in the future... Dakota Fanning plays Cherie Currie. She also done a fantastic job. If your a fan of The Runaways or Joan Jett and The Blackhearts, you will enjoy this movie. For those who aren't fans, get the movie, because most of you will end up being one. Since the movie, I can't get Cherry Bomb out of my head."

","Like most good rock biopics The Runaways thrust the audience into the artists shoes by giving you a first person account of their rise & fall. Sometimes its two members of the band who burned the brightest like Lennon & Mccartney.Often it is one like Morrison or Wilson. Well this generation Twilight version hones in on Jett & Cherie played by Dakota Fanning & Kristen Stewart. Stewart steals the show as Jett & Fanning moves ever so closer to becoming a legitimate actor. I cant say that im a huge fan of the band only that I went to see this purely to be entertained & that I was. Until the last 1/2 when it felt like they had to wrap it all up neat & quick.Something feels missing like they just jumped ahead too suddenly too fast. Michael Shannon as Kim Foley is right on par with Stewart. Then again I've yet to see him in something where I didn't like his performance. Floria Sigismondi is better known for her surreal & abstract videos & photography.Being that this is her first movie i'd say she did an exceptional job. I will be looking forward to see what she does next.<br/><br/>Now the reason im really writing this is because of what happens in the pre credits follow up. We are told about Jett & Cheries post Runaways life then fade to black. It was literally a WTF moment for me.<br/><br/>Ummmm what about Sandy West drummer & founder who died of cancer in 06? Or Lita Ford who went on to record a number of solo records in the 80's? The only exception here is bassist Jackie Fox who refused to give them the rights to her likeness.<br/><br/>Shame on you Joan Jett. Preaching about unity in the face of abandonment by your family only to steal credit away from the women you claimed to be your only family. I can understand a little mystique & hyperbole to enhance the experience but not hypocrisy.Not when the message is so clearly laid out & draped over all the nonsense. Am I being too picky maybe but this is called The Runaways. If Jett & Cherie wanted all the credit why not call it what is, Neon Angel: A Memoir of a Runaway?!?!?!?!?<br/><br/>There's a doc out there about The Runaways called Edgeplay look for it. I haven't seen it but im on the hunt for it."

","The Runaways is a biographical film about the 1970s all-girl rock band of the same name. The film was written and directed by Floria Sigismondi, who based the screenplay on the book Neon Angel: A Memoir of a Runaway by the band's original lead vocalist Cherie Currie. It stars Dakota Fanning as Currie, Kristen Stewart as guitarist and vocalist Joan Jett, and Michael Shannon plays record producer and band manager Kim Fowley. The film charts the formation of the band in 1975, their rise in a male dominated music world, and their subsequent implosion.<br/><br/>For a few short years The Runaways kicked butt, breaking down the barriers in front of them, put up in a male dominated rock world, they paved the way for girl power to actually mean just that; some decades before the term became popular. However, as good as it is to see some recognition of the band on celluloid, Floria Sigismondi's movie is hardly an effective or enlightening piece. Choosing to focus mainly on the relationship between Jett & Currie, Sigismondi's intentions are perhaps understandable given the film is based on Currie's own book. But not only are the rest of the band passed over (so not really a Runaways film then), but Jett has next to no back story for us to work off. Which given that the time afforded Currie's burn out has been diluted (the powerful stuff in the book is absent), means the story isn't all that interesting. It may snapshot the era well, but this is no history of the band at all.<br/><br/>The film also suffers greatly for its by the numbers formula. Band gets together, find their musical mojo, become big, take drugs, have sex, fall out and split up. OK this is a gender reversal piece, that lends it a certain historical value, but aside from some fun anarchic moments along the way, this is about as rebel yell as throwing litter on the floor. The constant sense of there being so much more hangs heavy and further brings to light how shallow and bereft of characterisations the script is. On the plus side, Sigismondi gets great performances out of Stewart and Shannon, the latter is suitably manic and weasel like. But even this is offset a touch by Fanning, who works hard to make the script work, but she never once convinces in the way that Stewart does. The soundtrack is top notch, with music from Iggy & The Stooges, David Bowie, Suzi Quatro, Sex Pistols and of course The Runaways themselves (including work from Fanning & Stewart). While the costuming and Benoît Debie's cinematography bring visual treats as the mid to late 70s comes alive.<br/><br/>But for a film that opens with a splat of menstrual blood on the floor, and one that is about an important and in your face all girl rock band, The Runaways is sadly a disappointment and unable to shake any trees. It's like going to see your favourite band to then find out it's actually the tribute band on instead. 5/10"

","I've read sentences longer than the scenes in this movie. It starts off at a sprint and keeps going and going and going. It's all about hair, shoes, uppers and downers, teenage angst, loneliness and heartache, and it all feels true. Rather than father hatred there's father longing, the sex is raw but not exploitative, and the performances are sensational. Riley Keough (Cherie's sister) and Michael Shannon are terrific, and Tatum O'Neal nails the very small role of Cherie's mother. ""It seems that two qualities are necessary if a great artist is to remain creative to the end of a long life; he must on the one hand retain an abnormally keen awareness of life, must always demand the impossible and when he cannot have it, must despair. The burden of the mystery must be with him day and night. He must be shaken by the naked truths that will not be comforted. This divine discontent, this disequilibrium, this state of inner tension is the source of artistic energy."" That was written about Goethe a long time ago, and could be written about Joan Jett today. Cool movie."
"IcyRoses","1","12","22","17 June 2010"," Why Did I Force Myself Through This?
","Well, I can answer my own question: Lita Ford. Being a huge Lita fan, you can imagine my shock when the movie barely even mentions her. I mean, seriously. She is merely reduced to the background, and when she does get to speak up it's complaining and whiny. And I just urge people not to think Lita was anything like this. I do have to say the young actress, Scout Taylor Compton did impress me as Lita, as she does resemble her.<br/><br/>So, the movie. Well, it's incredibly fast paced for the Twilight generation who can't take a scene lasting more then a minute. Michael Shannon is incredibly over the top. Kristen Stewart needs to take up another profession, as her performance here really shows the girl has zippo talent. Dakota Fanning is very good, but most her acting relays on how much she can look blind sighted. But, mostly the movie wants us to look at two teenage actresses naked or looking provocative for 2 hours. I mean, was the scene where Jett is naked in the tub reading a book really necessary? So, I may be a bit biased since the woman I consider to be one of the best singers/guitarists of all time was completely shunned out of a story that was somewhat about her, but Lita didn't want to be apart of such a project anyways. And can you blame her? After watching this trash, I can't."

Joan teams up with a music producer and they find other players for the band and eventually hire Cherie to be lead singer. The band's big gimmick is they are still teens. Next thing you know, they are touring overseas, which I don't see how since they didn't have parents with them. They start the drug use, but nothing to wild. Cherie gets a big ego and gets more attention, leading to tension in the band.

"itszombietime","5","2","2","3 March 2011"," Slow, dull, tedious film. A disappointing effort.
","The story (or legend) of the Runaways is fertile ground for screenwriters and filmmakers. It has all the requisite elements that a good, wild, invigorating drama needs -- LA in the late 70's, some of the sleaziest characters the music industry can conjure up, the ""boy band"" prototype (in this case, ""girl band"") taking a new tack and opening up new musical territory, disaffected and angry teen girls from the Valley trying to make their mark in the world, young starry-eyed teens gaining a flittering slice of fame and living the alluring rock and roll life.<br/><br/>This film, unfortunately, follows a self-indulgent, ponderous, ""explorative"" path that focuses less on the invigorating pace and action of the creative, high energy world of rock and roll in the late 70s, and more (far, far more) on the feelings, conflicts, attitudes and sentiments of the principal characters. It doesn't work. In fact, it fails quite badly.<br/><br/>It's a slow, dull, tedious film that reeks of amateur, quasi-artistic production tones. A character tone piece is a tricky thing to tackle as a director and/or writer. It requires astute artistic instinct and sensibility, the ability to develop and promote scene and setting as principal (and interesting) elements that guide the film, mainly the characters, through the expository journey.<br/><br/>This production failed, and what we get are a bunch of miscast young actors forced to overact and drag out both passive and active dramatic elements, ad nauseum. Again, it's tedious and amateurish, and it completely misses the artistic mark, which is to convey the look, feel, excitement and angst of the music industry in that era.<br/><br/>I couldn't wait for the film to finally, mercifully end."

","The Runaways was honestly one of the first rock and roll movie's I have seen where I didn't know much about the band it was talking about. I only really heard of Joan Jett because of her song 'I Love Rock 'N Roll'. I didn't even know she was in a band, thats how rock and roll challenged I was. But from the love of Kristen Stewart I really wanted to find out about the band. I've loved Joan Jett for a very long time but I didn't know much about her, just her music. Now I got an inside look at who she was and how badass she was. All the other Kristen Stewart fans out there, especially on Twitter, showed me what an amazing movie this was going to do. <br/><br/>The Runaways were and still are such an inspiration. They defied what the ""norm"" was back when they started their band and they broke molds. This movie did the same thing. No one is producing movies like this. Especially important to say is this is Women's History Month and this movie really brought to light how amazing women can be with they fight for their rights and what the love. The Runaways believed in rock and roll, they wanted to be something new and bold and a figure in music no one has ever seen before. They did that. Unfortunatelytheir stardom was short lived, but they left a lasting impression on the world. <br/><br/>Luckily my generate born in the 80s will get to hear about how amazing and influential they really were from this movie. Even though it is not a bio-pic, it still gives you a closer look to exactly what it took to get that band started back then. Woman were NOT equal to men in those days and we as women should be honored to share this earth with women who fought for our civil liberties. <br/><br/>So yes this movie changed my life, it has made me a rocker and I LOVE IT...all the actresses and actors did amazing. I will never forget seeing this movie at the Advanced Screening in NYC on 19th street. It was the highlight of my spring break and this WAS Kristen Stewarts best performance. I support her and most importantly I support Joan Jett and The Runaways. <br/><br/>AMAZING MOVIE. WILL SEE IT AGAIN AND AGAIN!!!"

The best musicians in the band were Lita Ford, Jackie Fox, and Sandy West, and they are barely mentioned or shown. The movie ends up being a very self serving Joan Jett and Cherie curry promo and it is clear their egos and self interest got the best of them.<br/><br/>For those of you who are unaware, ""I Love Rock and Roll"", ""Crimson and Clover"" and ""Love Hurts"" were all covers. Joan didn't write any of those songs. There is nothing wrong with that... I'm just stating that to enforce the fact that while Joan is very famous, she is famous for her covers, not really for her own music. She is a great performer and understands the attitude and ""look"" to entertain a crowd. Those skills are very important. I just take offense at how she ignored the other members of the band... especially when the other members were the REAL MUSICIANS who made the backbone of the band.<br/><br/>If you are going to make an entire movie about the troubled family of Cherie Curry and her friendship with Joan, then don't title the movie ""The Runaways."""

","The long awaited movie the runaways has finally been released in Aussie this week..being a runaways fan from the tender age of 12! (yes 12)to following the careers of Joan Jett and Lita Ford right through to present day I was looking forward to this! hell yeah<br/><br/>Having read both versions of neon angels by Cherie Currie (the first one is quite watered down) the more recent version contains a better portrayal of what these girls experienced under the guidance of Kim Fowley.<br/><br/>Was the film accurate? No, a lot was eliminated.I would think because of the Jett/Laguana camp which is one point I cannot understand,Why Joan would allow herself to be portrayed as a rampant lesbian.For yrs the deal of her sexuality has been ignored/denied.As for the others, they offered Lita Ford a thousand dollar for her life story and she told them where to get off!<br/><br/>There was no mention of Sandy West (rip) at the end of the movie only Joan,Cherie and Kim.. Jackie Fox original bassist was going to sue if they mentioned her as she thought it was crap too! <br/><br/>Kari Krome wrote cherry bomb with Jett for Cherie's audition. there was no mention of her?? Kim was abusive and controlling . I feel the movie portrayed him as an eccentric guy with a caring heart. would I have allowed my daughter to go with him,NO! it shows a shot of him going to see Sandy West, her mum answers the door to him in horror.True,but he was wearing a bright orange jump suit and heavy makeup,it didn't show that, only his reflection in the mirror.<br/><br/>the audition for dodging trash was accurate.<br/><br/>On the road?/ he made Joan in charge?mm don't think so. Scott the tour manager was seducing Cherie Currie who fell pregnant and had an abortion which was not covered.It wasn't made clear how Kim drove a wedge within the band, he pimped Cherie off with well known singer of the day whilst it was that time of the month in the book he uses her up and spits her out out. The corset? she didn't buy in japan,she saw it in a shop window before one of their earlier gigs and changed out of her jumpsuit in a cramped toilet/come dressing room before jumping on stage to the horror of the other girls.<br/><br/>As for the tour of Japan Jackie fox left when her bass was broken and she hurt herself with a broken bottle.<br/><br/>I felt when Cherie character said no, to recording and walked out they made this the end of the band but they went on a further two?more years with albums released but this was not mentioned. or the fact that the girls went in different directions, Sandy and Lita toward metal and Joan a more punk edge. It basically said Joan was ""lost"" til I love Rock and Roll became a hit.?<br/><br/>According to Cherie's book she worked in a linen store not cake supply shop for less than minimum wage. The scene were you see her trying to buy booze was when she lived with a drug dealer who supplied her in cocaine . Also the scene were she rings her sister to come get her is very close to the phone box scene from the Rose I thought.She was a drug addict but had the support of a loving family til her sister became pregnant and refused to help her anymore. <br/><br/>I feel Dakota did not portray the real Cherie,she is too young and pure.thats not a bad thing!! Kirsten Stewart got Joan's mannerisms down pat but,all we could see was Bella. I think she will be type cast for ever. If you want a true portrayal of life in the Runaways Edge-play by Victory Tisler Blue is the one to watch. She was the replacement bass player to Jackie fox, who has gone on to be a film maker. There are heartfelt and truthful interviews with Cherie, Lita,Jackie, and Sandy Joan was asked to contribute and her and manager wanted to see product and put an injunction on it banning runaways music being used, amongst other things so she wasn't included in the final product. Would I see this movie again?? I don't think so, would recommend you see it? <br/><br/>Not really pay your money take your choice. the runaways music is brilliant, it has always stood out for me, the girls were only 16/17 years old at the time of the runaways first album but they sounded like pros.<br/><br/>There were so many other things in the movie that was wrong, but hey, I didn't live it.! So if you want to listen to great music by a teenage girl band, forget the Donna's, forget Avril Lavigne, the Runaways kicked down the door that led the way for woman rockers!!! well for all girl band that is.. because of them we have Girlschool, L7, Rock Goddess and all the other fine metal woman of today.so kudos to you Joan for having the dream. Lita ford for being the rock goddess you are, Cherie for having the balls to release your story, Jackie fox for being a great bass player, Vicki Blue for replacing her, and RIP Sandy West a girl who only wanted to play rock and roll!!!"

"estebangonzalez10","9","9","19","21 July 2010"," Here Comes the Cherry Bomb
","The Runaways is a biopic about the first all-girl rock band from the 70's with Cherie Currie as the lead singer and Joan Jett as the second voice and guitarist. The movie is directed by Floria Sigismondi, who is mostly known for directing music videos. Floria also adapted the screenplay for this film from Cherie Currie's autobiographical book Neon Angel: The Cherrie Currie Story. What makes this an interesting movie is that Joan Jett actually produced this film so we have both views from the main stars of The Runaways that paved the way for other female rock bands in the future. I really enjoyed this biopic and found it one of the most entertaining films of the year so far thanks to a good screenplay and some great performances from the entire cast. The music in the film is also great and Dakota Fanning surprised me with her good vocals. I was not familiar with The Runaways before watching this movie, but I did recognize some of their songs. Cherie Currie might have received all the praise during those early years, but who later rose to fame was Joan Jett, and anyone familiar with the rock industry has heard of her. This is the story of the band she first played for before reaching true fame with Joan Jett and the Blackhearts. Whether you enjoy rock music or you don't the movie still is worth your time because it has some great performances and is really well produced, and I guarantee you that by the end of the film you will want to read more about their story.<br/><br/>From a very young age Joan Jett (Kristen Stewart) had a dream of one day making history by forming the first all-girl rock band. Rock and roll was her life and it was a way to get away from all her troubles back home (which aren't developed in this movie). One day she runs into the legendary music producer, Kim Fowley (Michael Shannon) who is seduced by her idea and introduces her to drummer Sandy West (Stella Maeve) so that they can start playing together. All the band really needs now according to Kim is a hot lead singer and they find in Cherie Currie (Dakota Fanning) the perfect one because of her David Bowie and Bridget Bardot look. Or as Fowley puts it: ¨I like your style. A little Bowie, a little Bardot, and a look on your face that says I could kick the sh&t out of a truck driver.¨ Since the film is based on Currie's autobiography we do get some background about her family. She basically lives alone with her teenage sister, Marie (Riley Keough) because their mom has left with another man to Indonesia and their dad is an alcoholic. Cherie finds the perfect opportunity to pursue her dreams and joins the band. The movie begins exploring the early years of The Runaways and their rise to fame, along with some of the issues the band faced from arguments to drug addiction. Of course there are a lot of things that are left out in a two hour movie and the film doesn't delve too much into the character's past, but it works nonetheless as a biopic about the band.<br/><br/>Dakota Fanning and Kristen Stewart prove that they can act in more serious and independent roles and don't have to rely on their star power or act only in blockbuster movies. They give really good performances in this film and are a major reason why this movie was so successful. It would not be fair to ignore Michael Shannon in this film, because his role as Kim Fowley was excellent. It was a supporting role, but he shines in every scene and is also a major reason why this movie worked so well. Yes, the movie does have its flaws because there isn't enough time to delve in the characters past nor perhaps the real struggles that the band faced, but it is a great movie that will leave you wanting to learn more about their story. The Runaways has a pretty realistic and raw feeling to it and I think Floria Sigismondi did a great job as a first time full length director in this film and with the screenplay as well. I think this is a movie worth seeing whether you are a fan of rock or not. It reminded me a lot of Sam Raimi's Control (a biopic about the 80's band Joy Division) which a lot of people haven't seen either."
"Miakmynov","6","9","19","21 June 2010"," Authentic but unoriginal film-making
","Truth may often be stranger than fiction, but that doesn't mean it makes an interesting film, and this is a classic case in point. Having hit the music scene at the very end of the 70's and been immediately hooked by Siouxsie & The Banshees and their contemporaries, I was vaguely aware of Joan Jett, but not much more than that. Despite what I thought was an excellent central performance by Kristen Stewart, I didn't come out of the cinema after this film feeling that I'd learnt a whole lot more about Joan Jett, or her place in history. There was no doubt that The Runaways gave tradition a good kick in the teeth, and hacked a fearsome swathe through a stale, male-dominated industry – but the sense of how difficult and cutting edge it must have been to form an all-girl teenage band at that time felt underplayed.<br/><br/>Instead, we are treated to a formulaic and generic sex'n'drugs'rock'n'roll story that applies to so many bands, concentrating on the interplay between the 2 leads and their producer/manager, egos over-inflated by sudden success and nihilistic burn-out. Whilst The Runaways may have been one of the first to go through this process in real life, in terms of rock biopics, they're very late to the party, and it just felt like a clichéd resume offering nothing that we hadn't already seen before in other, better genre movies – for example, both 'Breaking Glass' and the outstanding 'Almost Famous' are more accomplished, satisfying and engaging pieces of film-making, albeit largely works of fiction. <br/><br/>So, a standard, angry rebel rock bio-pick that is well-made and thumps along nicely, but what it offered in authenticity (apart from the rubbish plastic dogshit) it lacked in originality. 6.5/10"

","What, only 15 reviews so far? O.K., I'll play! *SPOILERS FOLLOW* ""The Runaways"" plays out like a series of ""scenes"", rather than a coherent movie. This not totally a bad thing- many of the scenes are quite compelling. Stuff I liked: <br/><br/><ul><li>The sense of time and place. There is a total lack of anachronisms. The period detail is so convincing, you'd swear this film was SHOT in 1975. Hair, clothes, speech idioms, cars, cityscape, all perfect. The Valley looks flat, hot, smoggy, and seedy. Pup 'n Fries? Hell no! Pup 'n Taco!</li></ul><br/><br/>Hollywood looks hilly, hot, smoggy and seedy- right down to the missing ""O"" in the battered old, pre-restoration Hollywood sign, where the kids gather to drink, huff, smoke, and share war stories about their messed-up families.<br/><br/><ul><li>The performances. These are teens playing teens. All are excellent. Stewart's Joan is a study in cool, raw, intelligent ambition and contained rage. Her family life is a cypher, but we can fill in the blanks. Fanning conveys Cherie's pain,confusion,and inner moxie, a false front of courage behind her saucer eyes. She is an abandoned child, but she's ready to try to break out. All the girls do drugs, but the drugs do Cherie. She is ""lost in hell without a map"". Joan is in hell too, but she's got the tourist's map, folded up in the hip pocket of her leather pants. You just know that, come what may, she's going to make it.</li></ul><br/><br/>-The girl-centric focus. The only real male of any consequence in the film is Shannon's Fowley, and he is sexually indeterminate. Joan has guys hanging around her, but she kicks them to the curb (literally) when she doesn't need them. Cherie bags a couple of the roadies, but, again, the boys serve a purpose, and it isn't as mentors or soul mates. The closest thing to a romance is what passes between Joan and Cherie. But, in the end, given a choice, Joan chooses rock 'n roll over her messed-up young band mate. Good choice- ""Look me up when you get your act together, honey. Meanwhile, I got work to do"" <br/><br/><ul><li>Random nude scenes. None involve the principles, but what a welcome and unexpected delight in our Age of Hypocritical Hang-Ups! It's a flashback to the time when movies earned their R's the honorable way- with SEX, not blood and gore. Yeah, we ARE back in the '70s! </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Rockin' soundtrack. And, yes, the girls do fine. The climactic performance of ""Cherrybomb"" in Japan was great, but my favorite was the early days house party scene, with the band blasting out ""California Paradise"" in someone's living room, taking crap and dishing it out with the unruly crowd, till the cops come and break everything up. Ah, nostalgia!</li></ul><br/><br/>Won't see it again in the theater- no need really, it's an intimate movie, not an epic. But, definitely a DVD to buy.<br/><br/>7/10"
"jerrycoliver","3","5","9","24 July 2010"," Floria Sigismondi and Joan Jett
","This movie is a perfect example of why celebrities should not produce movies about themselves. Kritsin Stewart does a very good job, and I was pretty pleased with Dakota Fanning. And Michael Shannon again does a fantastic job. But after those compliments, there really isn't much good to say about the movie.<br/><br/>The book by Cherie Currie is a decent read, but clearly the starved for attention Joan Jett wanted the movie to be more about her. I love the music of the Runaways and I love Joan Jett and the Blackhearts, but in the last 10 years every time I've seen or read anything about about Joan Jett I just think ""Man, she is not aging well emotionally"". Worse yet, she attacks people who try to help her and when they stand up to her she plays the victim. She's the executive producer of the movie yet she spends most of the commentary pointing out what was wrong and complaining ""I never wore leather pants"".<br/><br/>But I'm not going to defend Floria Sigismondi. She isn't ready to direct feature length movies yet...or maybe she is, if she learned from all the mistakes on this one (and lets remember, the best directors usually flopped their first movie). In her defense, it was probably difficult to deal with Joan. The screenplay is bad. But I can't say its completely her fault, because again, Joan was obviously trying to change things, but the end product is flaccid and superficial. Its not super sleek, but it's not gritty like the ""scene"" was made out to be. Things are just too clean. Most specifically the opening shot. Where it could have been a powerful introduction into the story we're about to see, I spent several seconds thinking ""Okay, somebody's painting something red"" It's clearly paint, and then the rest of the movie is devoid of anything even close this gritty. Further more, there are moments that have great potential for emotional development, unfortunately the director choose ""style"" over ""story"" which is never a good idea.<br/><br/>You'll laugh when you're not suppose to, and you'll yawn during most of it. If you're a fan of the Runaways or Joan Jett (or Cherie Currie) you've probably seen the movie. If you're a movie person and don't care about the music, it's not for you. It's basically ""Rockstar"" with a smaller budget and characters with the same names as real people. By the way, if you're a Lita Ford fan, do not watch this movie."
"istara","9","9","20","11 June 2010"," Surreal, fast-paced band biopic
","I saw The Runaways at the Sydney Film Festival and loved it. It captures the look and feel of a bygone music era that is fascinating even if you didn't live through it and even if you're not much of a rock music fan.<br/><br/>Possibly because most of the real-life characters are still alive, the story isn't as gritty nor the characters as flawed as they probably were. There's a sense of glossing over certain areas, and never travelling very deep below the surface. We get barely any backstory on the characters, and their motivations are not always clear. But in some ways this shallowness is an advantage, along with the visual sequences used to convey drug-taking and breakdowns. They give the film a mystery and a music-video quality. At times I was even reminded of Twin Peaks.<br/><br/>Michael Sheen's performance as Kim Fowley is outstanding. It's been claimed in many reviews that he's portrayed as the ""bad guy"", and certainly many people in the audience appeared to react to him like a pantomime villain. (It was surprising how shockable the Sydney audience seemed in parts). To me Fowley came across as a good guy: a brilliant producer who knew his craft, knew how to train a music act, knew his audience, knew his media and promotions. Yes: he knows that jailbait is a big part of the appeal of a young, all-girl rockband. But his interest is portrayed as purely commercial, not personal. He's surprisingly stand-off and arms-length with the band, he doesn't even travel with them on tour.<br/><br/>Dakota Fanning is brilliant as Cherie Curry: I recently watched a video of the actual Cherry Bomb performance in Japan and the costumes and routine are almost identical. Fanning has that rare acting quality of absolute stillness - even vacancy - at times, which is gripping. Riley Keough as her twin sister Marie is very well cast: the two girls look eerily alike in many scenes. Kristen Stewart is also impressive as Joan Jett, though her character doesn't get quite the same focus, given the film is based on Curry's autobiography. Other than the drummer Sandy West, played by Stella Maeve, the other bandmates are rarely heard from. Which is a shame, because Scout Taylor-Compton as Lita West puts in one great scene near the end.<br/><br/>You may leave with the impression that there's a place for ""The Joan Jett Story"" and that it would be a more interesting, and probably more honest, film. Joan Jett certainly comes across as a really amazing woman, ahead of her years and time, in The Runaways."
"BaltimoreColtsForLife","7","7","15","20 March 2010"," Superb acting.
","First of all, let me just say that these are the kinds of movies that make me wish I was alive during a different time period. But as it stands this is as close as one will get.<br/><br/>The acting made this movie. Kristen really transformed into Joan for this movie, you look at her and you don't see Kristen you see Joan. She had Joan down to the t, from her mannerisms to the attitude, you were watching Joan. Shannon was a scene stealer, you hate him at first but that's the point, that's how well he played Fowley. Dakota, seemed like she was holding back at first, but I feel like that's how she was supposed to play it, especially considering what kind of life Cherie had before The Runaways. And it definitely picks up as the movie goes along especially in her more dramatic scenes, one in particular that stands out is towards the end in a grocery store. She really shined in this film, she stood out, probably because we're used to seeing her as 'little' Dakota. Suffice it to say that Dakota proved she has what it takes for mature roles, she handled this role amazingly, and she brought a lot of depth to it. I think this was her and Kristen's best work by far. Bottome line the acting as a whole was superb, a solid A in my book. And yes, that 'A' includes Scout and Stella who did very well with what few moments they were given to work with.<br/><br/>Also I thought the way they stylized it was great, with the grain, the lighting, the way shots were framed. There were a number of very well shot, well edited scenes. The entire roller rink scene was actually done very well in my opinion, another very well shot/well done scene was when they performed Cherry Bomb in Japan, I think that was my favorite scene.<br/><br/>The only flaw was it's continuity, it sort of rushed through the different time periods, some scenes were rushed as well, I wish they would've shown a little more about how the band all got put together, also the roller rink scene. They didn't show enough of their road gigs, and Cherie's departure/Joan's 'tantrum' seemed rushed as well. But even with that, the film as a whole didn't suffer much at all, besides you really don't have much time to dwell on it because before you know it you're on to the next thing. Hopefully they'll include some extra scenes when it's released on DVD because I remember reading some stuff in the script that wasn't in the film.<br/><br/>So I give this film about a 7.6, as far as biopics of this kind go this was textbook, it was nothing revolutionary or epic, but the acting is what I think will make it stand out from the rest of that group. That said, it was very interesting to see what these girls went through as the first all girl band to play with such attitude and in that particular genre. Even as a guy I really get the message and feel it is inspiring.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this film, and I have to admit Dakota was my favorite thing about the movie, I still think Kristen played her role the best, but it was just really something to see what Dakota was capable of in this film and how much depth she was able to bring to the role. Both performance blew me away to be honest, the acting really made this film, really. I definitely recommend it."
"benjweil","7","9","22","19 March 2010"," seductive cautionary tale
","I am rarely interested in seeing new movies, but I knew I would have to see this one when I heard about it. I remember The Runaways, though I was a little too young to really understand or appreciate them. My older sister was wild about them. Thirty-five years later I still know the words to ""Cherry Bomb."" The film version of the Runaways phenomenon was not disappointing. It was extremely evocative of the heady, edgy years that were the mid-seventies, and the huge splash that The Runaways made in those years. All of the performances were very convincing, including Kristen Stewart as Joan Jett and Dakota Fanning as Cherie Currie. I have to say, though, it really disturbed me to see Dakota Fanning, who may still have been 14 when the movie was made, simulating sex, smoking, drinking, and taking massive quantities of drugs, not to mention recreating Cherie Currie's lewd and sexually sophisticated gestures while performing. I really hope, for her sake, that Dakota is NOT as sophisticated as she appears in this film. I am far from a prude, but I would never let my 14-year-old daughter play a role like this. The implications are really frightening. I hope that Tatum O'Neal, playing Cherie's mother in the film, warned Dakota about the dangers of living fast and hard at such a young age.<br/><br/>Interestingly, the real Cherie Currie is and was quite a good singer and performer, and her Runaways performances were much more raw and electric that what Dakota Fanning delivered in an otherwise excellent performance. Maybe, hopefully, Miss Fanning really isn't sophisticated enough to inhabit such a chilling role. As graphic as the movie was, I'm sure it didn't show the half of what the real Runaways experienced as 15 and 16 year-olds. Anyway, the film is very effective and pretty original. It's good to see a movie where women get to break out of the mold, which is almost as rare today as it was in the 70s. Just one of the many reasons why I usually don't bother seeing new movies..."

","I love rock biopics, but initially avoided this because it starred Kristen Stewart, star of films where no acting, or plot, or character depth are involved. So it was with some trepidation that I eventually watched it, hoping it wasn't all that bad. <br/><br/>Sadly, it is. Kristen Stewart is indeed talentless. What could have been an edgy and intriguing look at one of rock's more controversial bands turns into a fairly lacklustre join-the-dots docu-drama. Much of this is the fault of the director, Floria Sigismondi. However, Kristen Stewart's lack of ability to play anything beyond one-dimensional characters doesn't help, especially as she plays the main character, Joan Jett.<br/><br/>Stewart is aided and abetted by Michael Shannon, who, as Kim Fowley, tries too hard to be dark, quirky and edgy and comes off as over- acting.<br/><br/>Dakota Fanning makes up for this, to a degree, by putting in an excellent performance as Cherie Currie. <br/><br/>There are some other pluses: the music is great, of course. The history of The Runaways is covered fairly well."

","""When you stop to let 'em know you got it down...it's just another town along the road"" <br/><br/>--Jackson Browne<br/><br/>The sole intention of The Runaways (as a film) is to get inside the heads of the five girls who rocked the world in 1975. The film comes close to, and sometimes does hit the mark, but its general sense of drama is inconsistent. A large portion of the Runaways is too choppy, and many scenes feel like they are several minutes too short. I have a feeling that plenty of good material got lost in the editing room.<br/><br/>I'm a little dubious about Kristen Stewart's future career as an actress. Though definitely more admireable than Twilight, her performance is torpid, and doesn't earn my sympathy. Dakota Fanning, is much better, perhaps because the camera is on her more, but she does a much better job of acting with her face.<br/><br/>Their ability to portray rock stars on stage is impressive, but the music numbers are too brief. The Runaways left me a little frustrated, but it's still a film worth checking out, just take a moment before you go see it and ask yourself, what do you expect from it. <br/><br/>(If it's actual music you want maybe the Runaways isn't the film for you)"
"Bieterman-3","3","4","8","5 February 2011"," Juvenile
","This movie is hokey and feels juvenile. So many cliché characters and techniques used, from Dakota's 'daddy doesn't love me' teeny-bopper character and the sexified older sister with a d-bag boyfriend, to Joan buying her leather jacket in change, huffing paint and being told girls can't play electric guitar. Regardless of the validity or truthfulness to these occurrences, they look bad on film. The character development was painful and uninspired. I'm insulted for the people this is depicting. Poor acting from all parties. I don't mind Kristen Stewart as an actress, but she looks bored in most of her scenes. Dakota Fanning still doesn't grasp her roles. Big gay Bill Hader as their manager / producer is stupid. The scenes throughout the first half of the movie are choppy, and it makes it feel as if this band was just thrown together. Which, in all honesty, it probably was. I did a quick youtube search for ""the runaways, cherry bomb"" and it sucked too."

","A music video director with a stunning visual eye (Marilyn Manson's 'The Beautiful People' being a standout), Floria Sigismondi brings a fitting, drug-hazed 1970s aesthetic to ""The Runaways,"" a pseudo-biopic of the the titular, Joan Jett-founded band. Now: I like Dakota Fanning and Kristen Stewart, and it was their presence (as Cherie Currie and Jett, respectively) that attracted me to this film; and while I appreciate their willingness to add some shades of gray to their resumes, ""The Runaways"" doesn't give us much reason to care about these young rock icons who grew up way too fast. Currie is presented as a sweet suburban girl who eventually succumbs to the allure of sex, drugs, and rock n'roll; Jett is brash tomboy with a grizzled edge, and the film's central problem is that these people aren't very likable. Some filmmakers can pull off feats of cinematic gold via the use of morally corrupt and/or apathetic characters (Alex Cox attempted something similar with ""Sid & Nancy""), but Sigismondi's adherence to the lowlights of Currie and Jett renders ""The Runaways"" a niche curio that might attain cult status, but never mainstream acceptance (which, come to think of it, is essentially Jett's mantra throughout the film). Also problematic is the film's slavish reliance on generic rock-biopic tropes: we get the disorienting, drugged-out transitions; the moral quandary of Currie's suburban life; the token bi-curious make-out scenes; the obligatory ""break-up"" where Jett goes berserk in a recording studio; and a resolution of bittersweet drama, followed by a textual ""Where are they now?"" before the credits roll. It's something of a shame: for long stretches, ""The Runaways"" had me engaged and visually awestruck (not to mention amused by a wildly over-the-top performance from Michael Shannon), but the nagging notion that I'd been down this road before, and better, left me cold."

I am a fan of K Stew but if she chooses these kinds of movies she could damage her career and image. She wasn't really right for the role anyway. Dakota looked exploited and uncomfortable. There are other ways to demonstrate range as an actress instead of acting drugged out and drunk and skanky. The plot really amounts to very little its not worth your time.

"Wuchakk","6","2","3","22 January 2016"," ""That's what you do—you sing and you strut around in your underwear""
","Released in 2010, ""The Runaways"" chronicles the quick rise and fall of all-girl rock band The Runaways who released four albums from 1976-1978. I mean ""girl"" literally since they WERE girls at the time; for instance, when the band was formed in late 1975 singer Cherie Currie just turned 16 years-old. The movie is lightly based on Currie's book Neon Angel: A Memoir of a Runaway and therefore focuses on the friendship of Cherie (Dakota Fanning) and Joan Jett (Kristen Stewart) and their relationship with their eccentric manager Kim Fowley (Michael Shannon). Riley Keough plays Cherie's ""better looking"" sister while Scout Taylor-Compton and Stella Maeve play band members Lita Ford and Sandy West.<br/><br/>The Runaways had some brief success in the late 70s, but they quickly nosedived because they were teenagers and simply couldn't handle the pressures and temptations of the 70's rock 'n' roll lifestyle, particularly Cherie. The movie successfully illustrates this. Of course ""Cherry Bomb"" was a fairly well known song but, beyond this, they just weren't that popular. They were a here-today-gone-tomorrow act; a minor blip in rock history. You could say they were a good ""farm band"" for the more popular Joan Jett and Lita Ford. Speaking of the latter, Scout Taylor-Compton looks uncannily like her, but the character is given short shrift in favor of Jett and Currie. While this is understandable given that the movie was based on Currie's book and the short 96-minute runtime, there's no excuse for ignoring Lita at the end when the movie cites what the characters went on to accomplish. Since Ford was the second most successful Runaway in the music business, second only to Jett, this is inexcusable.<br/><br/>Despite this grave transgression, the movie works because of the great performances of the principle actors. Shannon is particularly effective as the freakish Fowley (who passed away in 2015 at the age of 75). Unfortunately, with a movie that's only an hour and a half long they can only tell so much of the story. Currie described the real story as epic and that the movie is just a ""lighter kind of flash"" of what The Runaways were for two and a half years. Being a 70's rock biopic of teenage girls you can expect the sex & drugs elements with profanity, crudeness and a dismal pall. Like 1991's ""The Doors,"" the movie doesn't show much of the fun side of rock 'n' roll.<br/><br/>If you can look beyond the vulgarity and ugliness, however, the movie has (some) heart. For instance, the genuine friendship of Jett and Currie, which can be observed in the phone call at the end; and the loving relationship of Cherie and her sister Marie. The sisters went on to record a couple albums together – 1978's BEAUTY'S ONLY SKIN DEEP and 1980's MESSIN' WITH THE BOYS – but their music career failed to go further due to Cherie's problems with drug dependency.<br/><br/>I liked this movie better the second time I watched it. It's too crude and dreary for my tastes and it lags here and there, but it makes up for it with effective performances and the warm relationships noted above. Plus it has a rockin' soundtrack. If you watch recent interviews, you'll observe that Lita and Cherie grew up to be palpably honorable, beautiful women. Joan's cool too, of course; she's just not my cup of java, although I like some of her songs. <br/><br/>The film was shot in the Los Angeles area.<br/><br/>GRADE: B- (6.5/10)"

Moreover, and this is really the most important aspect of the story – it successfully informs the importance of these womens' role in breaking down barriers and expectations of women in rock music and really paved the way for the female rock musicians that came after. And let's not forget Kim Fowley's insight and vision that played a big part in that. Rogue perhaps but this guy had a feel for true grit.<br/><br/>This movie made me remember why I fell in love with Lita, Joan and Cherie in the first place.

","So here we have a potentially very interesting, very gripping story, helmed by some very talented young performers, backed by some of the coolest, most influential music ever made --- it seems ahead of its time even now. That it was written in the mid-'70s makes it even more unbelievable.<br/><br/>What a tragedy to hand all of this gold over to a relatively inexperienced music video director who has crafted a movie so completely void of honest emotion and meaningful, non-clichéd, dialog that it is almost staggering in its basic ineptitude.<br/><br/>What's really amazing about this movie is that it doesn't show us ANYTHING but standard made-for-TV-tabloid-BS. And perhaps some of that comes from the source material, but guess what? It's the screenwriter and director's job to turn that into something interesting, to find something of a soul in it, and Sigismondi fails completely at this.<br/><br/>We have the Bad Homelife scene, the Trial By Fire bust-out gig, the Sink or Swim audition, the Drug Crackup Scene. It's really a shame that Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning are so completely wasted here. They do their best but there is nothing but scene after scene with little or no expository dialog, leaving nothing but trite scenarios to flounder in.<br/><br/>Sigismondi even kind of fails at presenting the band in concert footage (isn't that what she know how to do?). It's hard to tell many times if the performers are really engaged in what's happening on stage or if they're having any fun. The camaraderie seems noticeably missing except between Stewart and Fanning who again, have few meaningful exchanges.<br/><br/>The many-talented Michael Shannon even comes off like a cardboard cut-out of a the Nazi Producer. I mean, we've all heard the stories about Kim Fowley, but even he couldn't have been this one-dimensional and boring.<br/><br/>It's very ironic because The Runaways were anything but the same old stereotypical crap --- especially in 1975! Why? A) There were no hard rocking all-girl bands, really, before them, that were commercially successful; B) There were no girl bands that blatantly sold their sexuality while still maintaining a solid artistic integrity (solid playing and songwriting).<br/><br/>That's what really stinks about The Runaways (which I admit I'm overrating at 4) --- you're damn sure there's more to this story than the same surface eye candy you've always known about. And not getting it is just infuriating."

I am also very impressed with Dakota Fanning; she has always been such a good actress, and she will not fail your expectations in this film. It was very entertaining to watch the True Story of how the Runaways started and ended. This movie did a great job portraying the events of what happened, making it flow well, and very entertaining to watch. If interested in further learning more about this band, there is a great documentary called ""Edgeplay"", with the real band members talking about what happened."

","Ahhh, the 70s. For me, in middle America, it was a time of 3/4 length sleeve baseball t-shirts and bell bottoms, polyester and frustration that my hair wouldn't fall into a straight smooth wedge cut. I was listening to pop music and dancing to Soul Train.<br/><br/>On the west coast, things were more glam, with platforms and straight leg jeans. Watching the new movie, The Runaways is fun, because they do capture the essence of that time. Girls were taking this idea of women's liberation and pushing the envelope. An unsupervised teen named Joanie Larkin held on to a guitar that her Dad gave her and pursued big dreams of an all-girl rock band. Her story, along with Cherie Currie's memoir, Neon Angel, are combined to form The Runaways, which is the name of Joanie's band. She became Joan Jett, who teamed up with dodgey producer and promoter, Kim Fowley. They recruited Cherie and the other girls and shot to fame. But, this success story is also a cautionary tale, with 15 year old girls on their own, with raging hormones, unscrupulous adults and lots of drugs and booze available. I got to talk to Cherie Currie about those days, but I wish I could talk to her again, now, after the movie. There are so many more things I'd like to know. The book, Neon Angel, is compelling, but painful to read. The move, The Runaways, is compelling, but painful to watch. If you didn't know that much of what happens is true, you'd say it's unbelievable. I was interested in the story. The performances are excellent. I've never been a huge fan of Kristen Stewart, because she seems to play the same character, over and over. But here, it's almost as if she's channeling Joan Jett, and the portrayal is uncanny. Dakota Fanning is almost unrecognizable as Cherie Currie. Michael Shannon is creepy to the extreme as Kim Fowley. This trio elevates the movie above After School Special dialogue. It's the quiet scenes that stay with you: the band, in the back of a limo, after a long tour, looking old beyond their years; Joan, in the bathtub, crafting lyrics. Great story, some great performances, but the script and the storytelling fall short. I give The Runaways a 7 out of 10."

","The Runaways were a wicked rock'n'roll experience. An excitement generated live, but never transferred onto their recording. Hence their popularity was short lived. Joan Jett was able to capture a trace of what they were aiming for on her bubblegum hits of the 80s. But the high point of the Runaways experience wasn't musical. It occurred in Cherie Currie's autobiography published long after the break-up. Her vivid and insightful writing ranks among the best celebrity bios ever. As entertaining in its own way as Errol Flynn's ""My Wicked Wicked Ways"". <br/><br/>Twenty years after publication, Jett and Currie let the movie industry have a go at their story, knocking the Runaways back to square one - their story a mess, the Runaways experience again transferred poorly for the masses. The chief element missing is rock'n'roll spirit. There's nothing cool like that here. A lot of pretentious posing by Hollywood types aping MTV videos from the 90s, smarmy camera-work and all. There's nothing of a punk or 70s rock aesthetic in the art direction. It had an alleged $10 mil budget, which pulls it way out of the ""Independent Cinema"" category. It looks and feels like 100% prefab Hollywood mainstream media junk. No unique vision compels the camera.<br/><br/>The only point to the story is the climactic neon lesbian scene between Stewart and Fanning. It's the one spot in the narrative that starts to sprout wings. But, like every other intriguing element of Currie's book, writer/director Sigismondi flushes it down the toilet to nowheresville. No emotional relationship is formed between the characters. Cherie's book is about real characters, their complex relationships interrelationships and their reactions under pressure. Sigismondi's cliff notes version shows that she hasn't a clue about what needs to be done to put this on the screen. Human relationships no longer translate in the plastic one-dimensional 21st century Hollywood mind. Organic narrative strands do not compute. <br/><br/>Her camera shows us a handful of generic washed-out characters, none of whom care about any of the other generic washed-out characters and nobody appears to be minding the music. Where Currie's book presents situations with a sarcastic tongue-in-cheek, Sigismondi extends a disconnected grimness. Where Currie planted her anger and wit, Sigismondi reaps incoherent navel gazing. What were the Runaways ""rebelling""against? The boredom of suburbia? A male dominated music industry? That isn't clear. The slight adversity they meet is set up by Sigismondi like so many straw men. <br/><br/>Kristen Stewart is OK – it looks like she watched a few episodes of Happy Days and channeled Jett through The Fonze. Better than Dakota Fanning who is hopelessly out of her league. She doesn't have any idea of what to do with the character. In her own movie, Cherie ends up being a big unsympathetic blah – and this is probably pretty close to what Lita Ford thought of her. I guess they don't teach techniques like Projection and Communication in Hollywood acting schools anymore.<br/><br/>Michael Shannon plays Fowley as if he were the Mad Hatter in a Batman episode, except not as terrifying. Sigismondi obviously needed to create a Hollywood villain and pegged the stencil on Fowley. What she and Shannon fail to understand is that villains don't think they are villains. If an actor plays Richard The Third believing he is a Bad Guy what audience wants to sink their teeth into a moldy stereotype like that? It's not just historically incorrect, it's boring.<br/><br/>Hopefully the movie industry will never get interested in pimping The Shaggs story – a far more talented band and one that had a much deeper impact on rock'n'roll than Joan Jett and the Runaways ever dreamed. If you want to see a good movie about The Runaways check out ""The Fabulous Stains"". It's more accurate and contains authentically scurrilous rock'n'roll aberrations."

","When I heard that the movie was telling the story of one of the bands in which Joan Jett played, I wanted to see it. Expecting a deluge of estrogenic hormonal music and pure rock and roll, I was a bit taken aback by the artsy, silent, character oriented take of the film, but in the end I liked it.<br/><br/>The movie is about The Runaways, an all girl rock band which reached cult status in 1975, but the real story is more of the young and lost teens that were part of it. All the actresses play well, Dakota Fanning again showing a lot of skill, and one of the executive producers in the movie is Joan Jett herself, so the story must be close to the truth.<br/><br/>Unfortunately there is too little focus on the actual music and the pained silences of the characters turn this more into a drama than a band movie. The start is boring, the pace gets a little better towards the end, but I guess you have to be in the mood to like it."

","Okay i have to say this up front, yes, there is a kiss between Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning, in fact there's a few but it has VERY little to do with this story. Its about a 2 minute sequence that not even the characters in the movie care about. Its not raunchy, the sequence is mostly blurry (cause they're high), and its HARDLY the worst things that happens in the film. If this tiny moment in a 1-hour and 45 minute movie is what you're only concern is, either don't bother seeing it or GET OVER IT! Now that I've got that over with, lets start the review, shall we? ""Hello daddy, Hello mom, I'm your ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-cherry bomb! Hello world, I'm your wild girl, I'm your ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-cherry bomb!"" SEX, DRUGS AND ROCK N' ROLL! This movie is all about the iconic, but sadly short-lived, 1970's first all-girls rock band, The Runaways. In a time where ""girls don't play the electric guitar"", five teenage girls show the world that women, can rock out with the best of themand sometimes better. The story focuses on Cherrie Currie (Dakota Fanning) and the legendary, Joan Jett (Kristen Stewart) and their beginnings in The Runaways, their inseparable friendship, Cherries unfortunate departure from the band, Kim Fowley and his frightening tactics, and all the unchaperoned craziness they the got into. (yeah, it gets pretty bad) Most of all though, it shows what women that rock can really do, and they can do it all by themselves. If you don't want to see this movie because of the people casted in it, rethink that. Kristen Stewart is AMAZING as Joan Jett. Period. She shows all kinds of layers to the iconic rockstar and doesn't over do it, not for a second. She was perfectly cast for this so don't shake it ""just because she's Bella"". Trust me, if you've ever seen her in other movies, you'll see shes a lot more talented then she's given credit for. When shes plays a character, she basically becomes that person, she did that here. If you don't want to this movie because of Dakota Fanning, you've basically got the same lecture coming. You don't even think of her as Dakota, you see her as Cherrie Currie for every moment. She also shows you the many different layers this character has and is brilliant from start to finish. And yes shes young, but The Runaways got started when Cherrie was 15, Dakota made this movie when she was 15.Clearly, she's fearless.. And everybody loves Scout Taylor-Compton, even if shes a jerk throughout the entire movie. (Seen ""Halloween 2"" the 2009 version? then nothing she does in this film will bother you.) This movie has easily become one of my ALL TIME FAVORITE movies. I'd suggest it to anybody who can watch it without judging it before hand. I've taken four completely different people with different movie tastes to this film and each one has told me they love it!! So if your willing take give it shot and all that scary rock n' roll life style doesn't scare you, this movie is so worth the $10. (and the $25 dollars I'll spend on the DVD the moment it comes out) (It also has an amazing soundtrack, with songs by The Runaways, Joan Jett (solo), the stooges, Suzi Quatro, David Bowie, Nick Gilder, the Sex Pistols, and MC5. Even some songs sung by Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning themselves)"

","I've never been completely sold on Kristen Stewart as an actress – she impressed everyone in Panic Room back in 2002 but has since been overshadowed by her own franchise, Twilight. But now, with the release of The Runaways, people might see the great actress that's been buried underneath three vampire movies' worth of pap.<br/><br/>Chronicling the rise and inevitable fall of 70s all-girl rock band The Runaways, Kristen Stewart plays Suzie Quatro-a-like Joan Jett, a young guitarist whose rock and roll aspirations see her paired with 15-year-old Bardot bombshell, Cherie Currie (Dakota Fanning). The two are brought together by crazed musical impresario Kim Fowley (Michael Shannon) whose tactics for pushing the girls to their limit include screaming, 'Now, buckle up and get ready for boot camp, babies – you're gonna be trained like the Viet f**king Cong.' But with such success comes the classic trappings of fame including drugs, sex, booze and tension between band mates as Cherie's star rises higher than her cohort's. The more famous she becomes, the more she is tortured by the family she left behind including her put-upon sister Marie (Riley Keough) who cares for their alcoholic father.<br/><br/>Director/photographer Floria Sigismondi has an expert eye which captures the wild 70s haze that surrounds the band as they perform throughout the movie. Fanning's portrayal of Currie is very engaging as she teeters between rock goddess and the little girl lost, struggling to decide where her loyalties lie – with her band or her real family. She almost nails it but she lacks the passion that drives Currie to join the band in the first place.<br/><br/>Stewart on the other hand has Joan Jett down pat and is utterly believable as the dykey guitarist/songwriter whose occasionally Sapphic relationship with Currie is tested by drug use and Fowley's manipulation. Michael Shannon proves himself to be an absolute wonder as the maniacal Fowley whose eyes flash with dollar signs when he realises that he can market the girls as jail-bait. Hey, sex sells.<br/><br/>The film is based on Currie's book Neon Angel: A Memoir of a Runaway so it's more than a little biased towards Currie's personal journey yet still manages to provide Stewart with enough material to shine as Jett. It's wild, sexy and filled with pumped up rock and roll performances that make for an enjoyable dose of 70s nostalgia."

No. Instead it opened quietly on a few art house screens where it died a quick death usually within 2 weeks. Hmmm!

","Based on the book ""Neon Angels"", by Cherie Currie, ex-sex symbol and lead singer of the 70's all-girl punk rock band, The Runaways, the movie doesn't disappoint. Apart from the experiences of the band itself, it touches on the subjects of sex and drugs, inevitable in the lives of rock musicians, especially in the 70's. Feminism receives its fair share too, the opening scene being that of Cherie's first period; somewhat icky, yet meaningful and symbolic of The Runaway's propulsion into a male-dominated industry.(""Girls don't play electric guitar!""- Joan Jett's guitar teacher)<br/><br/>As a fan of the band, I was a curious to watch the movie,a bit annoyed by the fact that Kristen Stewart, whose main claim-to-fame was her bland, forgettable portrayal of Bella Swann in the tedious Twilight movies, was cast as Joan Jett. However, one really can't blame her for that, considering that the character itself was bland and forgettable, and there really wasn't much she could do with it. But I'll expound my anti-Twilight sentiments someplace else. At the end of the movie, I was left feeling sheepish about my judgmental thoughts that she was going to bomb,and was floored by her performance. Stewart's depiction of the female rock legend is near-perfect, from her manner of talking to her tomboyish body language. <br/><br/>Michael Shannon (from Revolutionary Road) does a commendable job as Kim Fowley, the eccentric record producer/ songwriter, who managed the band. However, the true star of the movie is the immensely-talented Dakota Fanning. Her fantastic performance as Cherie Currie is guaranteed to leave gaping mouths and widened eyes, proving that she is definitely one of the most talented actresses of this generation. And, that she has clearly grown-up! It was startling to watch the same little girl from ""I Am Sam"", all grown-up, dazzling on-screen in skimpy outfits, sparkly platform shoes and heavy make-up, with the ""jail bait"" sex appeal and demeanor of the 'Cherry Bomb'. Not to mention the steamy shower scene and girl-on-girl action involving her and Twilight co-star, Kristen Stewart. Which, to be honest,I was somewhat scandalized by. It is eerie watching ex(just barely)-child actresses passionately make-out! <br/><br/>It may not be a deeply moving biopic, but the incredible performances, great direction, and kick-ass music (From David Bowie to the Sex Pistols) makes ""The Runaways"" a more than enjoyable watch. Oh, and did I mention that The Runaways' songs in the movie weren't lip-synced to, rather, actually sung by the leading women? Some people just have all the talent. Hmmph."

","Credit IMDb.<br/><br/>In 1975, San Fernando Valley teen Joan Larkin reinvents herself as Joan Jett, a guitarist who wants to form an all-girl punk band. She pitches the idea to a sleazy manager, Kim Fowley, who pairs her with a drummer and then searches for a face: he finds Cherie Currie, at 15 the perfect jailbait image for his purpose; by luck, she can sing. Two others round out the band, ""The Runaways."" Fowley books a tour, signs them to Mercury Records, and packs them off to crowds in Japan. Seeds of conflict sprout early: Fowley puts Cherie front and center in the publicity, she's soon strung out on pills and vodka, and jealousies arise. Without adult supervision, where can Joan and Cherie end up?<br/><br/>Even though I have a huge crush on Kristen and think she's a tremendous talent, I didn't have much hope for this movie. Joan Jett was such a dynamic individual, a one of a kind, and the fact that Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning were slated to play Joan and Cherrie worried me. Luckily the two were up to the task. The story was very engrossing, and I loved how it unfolded. This a prime example of how you should do a Biography.<br/><br/>Performances. Kristen Stewart does her own variation of Joan Jett and I was utterly engaged by it. As I said, I am a big fan of hers, but I questioned the casting decision, wondering if she had been miscast. Turns out I was pleasantly wrong, and she delivered a great performance. She looks great with the Rocker hair too. Dakota Fanning also delivered a great show as Cherrie. She's clearly growing up, and if what I saw is a testament to the future, the future holds bright things for her. Michael Shannon steals every scene he's in with his performance. He was awesome. Scout Taylor-Compton's role isn't as big as Kristen's and Dakota's, but she did fine as Lita Ford.<br/><br/>Bottom line. The Runaways is a great movie, it's as simple as that.

","The Runaways is a culmination of everything I was hoping to observe and understand with this mini-series of reviews. It is the first great performance I've seen of Kristen Stewart. The film itself isn't remarkable in its story. The band it summarizes begins, has a degree of success, and ends in overindulgence of alcohol and drugs. It is a movie made because the principal actors were of age to play their parts, and the band had unique historical importance.<br/><br/>The real Runaways were a concept band organized by Kim Fowley in mid '70's. He had an idea of creating a teenage female-only hard rock group. He would promote their sex appeal to male audiences and contribute to a few of their songs. Many contemporary vocal groups have a debt of gratitude to the Runaways for ripping the rock and roll door off its hinges so they could enter. Fowley shouldn't be seen as a champion of women's rights, unlike you might think. He inadvertently became one out of his own curiosity. This didn't stop him from arranging striptease photo shoots for the girls or making unreasonable sexual demands of them. Now nearly four decades since his experiment, artists like Lady Gaga are able to utilize their sexuality into more experimental songwriting. The Runaways made this possible.<br/><br/>The movie begins with Joan Jett (Stewart) and Cherie Currie (Fanning) lazing away as outcast teens stuck in lives they aren't capable of living. Jett sees Fowley at a night club and introduces herself as an electric guitarist. He thinks, maybe, he can get a girl rock group together, since his dwarf band idea didn't work. He wanders around the club until he finds a hot, blonde girl to lead the band. Currie happens to be there and decides to audition. At the first practice, Jett and Fowley write an ad-lib song called ""Cherry Bomb"" about Currie's body (the boys wish they could have). Soon the band records an album and begins playing in hotels and other cheap venues.<br/><br/>The film doesn't forget that its players are still children. There are moments where they run up hills or drink stolen booze. They start to touch each other and take a cornucopia of drugs. After touring in Japan, the band begins to grow uneasy due to Currie's excessive personality and addictions. Currie finally leaves in '77 and the band dissolves a few years later.<br/><br/>This is the first time Stewart has appeared expertly cast in a film that I've seen. She is not able to play the traditionally feminine role of doting girlfriend. The Runaways liberates her of this restrictive requirement and let's her ruggedness come out of hibernation.<br/><br/>Through Fanning's Cherie, we see Stewart's surprisingly genuine vulnerability. You know what I mean. In many of her other films (even the better ones like Adventureland), she is forced to make herself appear more emotionally unstable than she looks to be. Finally, there is no requirement that she pander to some boy's need for her to be his girlfriend. And Fanning makes it all possible for Stewart. She is the most talented actor of either gender from my generation that I've had the pleasure of seeing. She has a Meryl Streep-like ability of blending into roles seamlessly. Recommended"

","""The Runaways"" is an amazing slice of the 1970s and depicts the unexpected rise of an all- girl rock and roll band. This was in a time when women weren't really considered or allowed to be rockers.<br/><br/>The main three actors: Kristen Stewart, Dakota Fanning, and Michael Shannon are each excellent in their portrayals as Joan Jett, Cherie Currie, and Kim Fowley. Stewart encapsulates the tension, edge, and desperation that was a teenage Jett during the time she was frantically trying to make her career happen. Jett lives for the music, whereas Currie did not and that came across beautifully. Shannon acted as the eccentric and off-the-wall, and often vulgar legendary record producer to a tee. Stewart and Fanning have that electric and elusive ""chemistry"" that Hollywood always seeks for. Their relationship in the film is poignant, and well past believable. The roller rink kissing scene, in particular, where they shotgun a joint is thick with sexual tension. The casting director got this one right.<br/><br/>The supporting cast: Tatum O'Neal, Scout Taylor-Compton, and Riley Keough to name a few were each outstanding in their small roles as family members and for Taylor-Compton portraying metal legend Lita Ford.<br/><br/>However, the music is naturally the driving force behind this film. Stewart, Fanning, and Co. all sang and played very well and very accurately. The ""Cherry Bomb"" performance is on point and Stewart's roller rink performance of ""I Love Playin' With Fire"" is the epitome of Joan Jett. The ""Dead End Justice"" performance is equally well done. No bones about it. The rest of the soundtrack is great. Suzie Quatro's ""The Wild One,"" Bowie's ""Rebel Rebel,"" Nick Gilder's ""Roxy Roller,"" and The Stooge's ""I Wanna Be Your Dog"" and ""Gimme Danger"" are all excellently placed and suit the scene very well. The inclusion of Jett's post-Runaways songs, ""I Want You,"" and ""Crimson & Clover"" and ""I Love Rock N Roll"" are great too."

","The Runaways is an entertaining story of the rise and fall of the eponymous band, with good lead performances by Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning as the mainstays of the group, Joan Jett and Cherie Currie. The story itself is a familiar one, no less so because it is probably largely true of the arc of many rock bands, an arc lampooned brilliantly by This is... Spinal Tap, and you will see comparisons between this film and that comic fiction, but what Christopher Guest did not stretch the limits of his fiction to are the wild-eyed antics of crack-pot impresario Kim Fowley, brilliantly played by Michael Shannon. Among the many fresh faces on show is an older one who was the child protégé of her day, Tatum O'Neal (ask your mum), daughter of Ryan O'Neal (ask your gran), as Cherie's mother.

","When I was looking at the two main movie magazines in the UK (Total Film and Empire)I noticed that both of them gave good reviews to a film that was coming out in a few weeks called The Runaways.As I went to find out more about the film on IMDb,I noticed that there was a side-bar on the front page,with a heading saying ""This weeks new DVDs"".As I read down the list,I was stunned to see that the film,which was just about to come out to cinemas in the UK,was coming out on disc in the US!.I decided after seeing this,that I would skip waiting for the next few months for it to come out on DVD here at the end of the year,and to just import it right away.<br/><br/>The plot:<br/><br/>A guitar-playing teenage girl (Joan Jett) decides,that she wants to start an all girl band,that will play the hard-rock proto-punk that she loves listening to.Her first stop on the road to setting up a band,is meeting infamous manager Kim Fowley.Fowlry introduces Jett to budding drummer Sandy West.Whilst the practise sessions go very well for both of them,everyone realise that they need to find a singer.As Joan and Kim spend there time in the local rock,Kim spots a girl (Cheerie Currie) who he thinks is a perfect match for the image that the band is going for.<br/><br/>With the rest of the band all set,the only problem that they have to deal with is having Cheerie being terrified about singing on stage.Thankfully for the group,the bands manager Kim Fowley gives Currie a very ""different"" way to perform a song that him and Joan Jett have written called Cherry Bomb.A time goes on,Cheerie starts to REALLY enjoy being a rock star.One of the side-effects of her starting to enjoy the fame,is that she jumps head-first into a deep drug addiction.Which,along with doing some very controversies erotic pictures,without telling the rest of the group.All of these things,unsurprisingly,cause each of the band members to get very alienated from each other...<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>For a movie that is named after its subject,I was disappointed that the screenplay by writer/director Flora Sigismondi seemed to be trying to make it look as if their were only two band members in The Runaways.Even though the film has two pretty good actress's to play Lita Ford and Sandy West,the total amount of screen time that they each have in the film,is about ten minutes!(and sadly,the only big scene that Ford is in,is her causing the band to have a huge argument with each other.)With the direction,Flora makes the look of the film really match the pace of the story.With the first half having a sandy sun- set California look,and the second half being very grey and faded,which helps to show the isolation that each of the band members are experiencing.<br/><br/>Due to the film,mostly focusing on the relationship between Chrerie Curry and Joan Jett,(something that seems to have really annoyed the real Joan Jett,is how much Chrerie revealed about the ""private"" relationship that they had,in the book which the film is based on.)both actress gave excellent performances.Kristen Stewart brushes a lot of the romantic side that she has become known for aside,by giving Joan Jett a huge amount of determination and confidence in her desire for people to be fans of the band for their music,and not for their looks. Dakota Fanning makes Curries transition in the film from sweet-and-innocent to ""jailbait"" look very natural,Fanning also does well at showing how dependent the character is on drugs in the second half of the film.<br/><br/>Final view on the film:<br/><br/>An extremely entertaining bio-pic,with very good performances and fantastic songs performed by the whole cast."

","I can't say that I've been a fan of The Runaways for a long time, but when I saw the trailer for this I liked their sound so I researched them a bit, found out more about them. Now I think I can say that I am a fan of The Runaways. Having never read Cherie Currie's book, I didn't know exactly what to expect, but from internet research I had a rough idea of how relationships should go- between the girls, between the girls and Kim Fowley, and between Cherie and her family.<br/><br/>From my point of view, it was spot on. Dakota, though she didn't remind me at all of Cherie, did a wonderful job of showing her steady downhill spiral into drugs and her strained relationship with her family. Kristen Stewart, as far as I'm concerned, nailed the role of Joan Jett right down the the ""cool hunch."" It was a delight to get to see her play such a different role than the ones she has played in the past- she should play more like this. I especially loved the part where she was yelling at Lita and trashing the recording studio- fierce! All in all, it was a good movie and I would recommend it to anyone over the age of fifteen."
"thefalleninc","7","3","8","16 June 2010"," Fairly pedestrian narrative, great performances
","OK, so the Twilight films aren't exactly masterpieces, and the second isn't really even good, but only the most churlish will deny that Kristen Stewart carries them pretty well. And again here we see just how strong her acting bone might actually be. There are a few people throughout the history of popular culture who just ooze cool, and for me Joan Jett is one of those people. Kristen Stewart captures her presence and her charisma beautifully. And then of course there's Dakota Fanning. Much touted for her acting ability since I Am Sam, but hasn't really made the type of film since in which she can truly show off her acting chops. Here she does it. As Cherie Currie she captures the plight of the exploited young woman brilliantly, at first going along for the ride, then active participation in her own exploitation, and finally the crash. These two performances really do carry this film. The narrative is fairly predictable and without the strengths of these two actresses would be in danger of being relatively uninteresting. We've all seen the sex, drugs, rock n roll film before and this doesn't really say or do anything new. Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning make it worth the watch, and Michael Shannon is also very good as sleaze radiating arse-clown Kim Fowley. I recommend, just don't expect to learn anything or be hit with profound ham."

","Arguably, the funniest moment on the much-missed NBC sitcom ""Arrested Development"" was when Jason Bateman and Alia Shawkat(playing uncle and niece) performed a karaoke version of the Starland Vocal Band's ""Afternoon Delight"" at an office party without realizing how suggestive the lyrics were until it's too late(""the thought of lovin' you is so exciting""). The scene works because there's nothing labored about this ill-fated song selection; it's an easy mistake to make, since aurally, the female-half of the Washington D.C. quartet sounds so innocuous, they could be singing about their love for God, or horses, or just about anything, but sex. Vocalists Taffy Danoff and Margot Chapman warbled come-ons like Stepford Wives, in deference to the men, the ones who were supposed to enjoy sex, while they, the ABBA fem-bots, give vocal performances that suggest they feel nothing. That's why a song like ""Cherry Bomb"" must have been so shocking to people not used to women, children actually, being aggressors with carnal knowledge, in which lead vocalist Cherie Curie(Dakota Fanning) leaves little to the imagination when she shouts ""have you, grab you, 'til you're sore,"" like a proto-Liz Phair, or riot grrl of your choice. Despite the country being liberated by the sexual revolution, Curie's on-stage antics, by rock and roll standards, was still considered a ""guy's move"", as was Lita Ford's competent guitar solos. But true female empowerment would have to wait awhile, in which the foregrounding of a woman's musicianship over her sex appeal had never occurred to producer Kim Fowley(Michael Shannon), who had no qualms about arranging a softcore porn shoot for Currie with the Japanese press in her backyard. (Similarly, at the bequest of Malcolm McLaren, Annabelle Lwin would pose topless for the cover of the Bow Wow Wow album ""Wild in the Country"". And lest not we forget Brooke Shield's (still-)shocking nude scenes in Louis Malle's ""Pretty Baby"") Initially, Currie, who, the film suggests, lacks the rock and roll authority of a Joan Jett(Kristen Stewart), demurs at the impresario's blunt lyrics. Currie played the role of lolita, reluctantly, but grew into it once she got a real taste of rock and roll hedonism. ""The Runaways"", based on the Cherie Curie memoir ""Neon Angel: A Memoir of a Runaway"", portrays the lead singer as being exploited by an industry predicated on putting women, just like the infamous Hustler magazine cover, through a meat grinder.<br/><br/>Appropriately enough, Cherie is compared to Linda Lovelace, the star of ""Deep Throat"", the 1972 adult film that borough pornography into the mainstream, which in all likelihood, paved the way for The Runaways to record on a major label(Mercury Records). (The film makes a case for the ""porn-ification"" of America taking place well-before Britney Spears was born.) Lita is furious with Cherie, referencing Lovelace in relation to her bandmate's photo spread, just before the band hits the stage for a stirring version of ""Cherry Bomb"", in which the lead guitarist reprimands the 16-year-old girl for undermining their music by flaunting her crotch around her west coast backyard. (The Runaways, even by today's standards, would cause a commotion.) But it's no wonder that The Runaways were big in Japan, a country whose women are infantilized by a culture that promotes a hyper-femininity that at times encourages a prolonged girlhood well into their late-twenties and beyond. In 1980, Lovelace wrote a national bestseller memoir called ""Ordeal"", an expose about the adult film industry, in which the actress claimed that her on-screen sexual exploits were performed against her will. Six years later, Lovelace came out with ""Out of Bondage"", where the anti-pornography advocate wrote that she ""was forced into 'Deep Throat'"", and was ""the prisoner of a madman"". Without a doubt, this madman in question which Lovelace alluded to must have been her former husband/manager Chuck Traynor. Like the ""Deep Throat"" star, The Runaways had a Svengali too, in the form of producer Kim Fowley, who refers to the band as his property, Cherie, in particular, a ""prima donna"" he instructs to think like a man. As Fowley indoctrinates Cherie in the finer points of being a sex object; at one point, lambasting his protégé for her ""lack of rock and roll authority"", this assembled piece of ""jailbait"" cheesecake takes it upon herself to bedeck her adolescent body in peepshow quality apparel, to Joan's dismay, and without Fowley's input. Unwittingly, ""The Runaways"" makes the case for Lovelace's naysayers that the porn star was indeed in control of her own sexuality. Even though we see Cherie, out of bondage, out from Fowley's control, late in the film, where she ends up working in a bakery, the Runaways' frontwoman, nevertheless, sets the stage for quasi-artists such as Madonna, whose self-promotion of her anatomical wares was made without any male encouragement."

","Two of the hottest stars of the century and a storming soundtrack ought to make for a cracking good movie, but this film lacks in critical areas - most notably script, direction and editing.<br/><br/>As for the terrific twosome, Stewart edges it in my book, more convincing in the role of Jett than Fanning is as Currie. Maybe that's an age thing - Fanning has to go to some dark places, perhaps a step too far for a young, polite and maybe naive girl. Stewart has a few years advantage, and would appear to have embraced this role more thoroughly. I don't think either had a lot of time to rehearse.<br/><br/>However Fanning easily out-guns her elder in the singing department. If she was so inclined, she could front any rock band in the world. I had to double check she actually was singing. Somehow I can't see her taking this path, but I for one would love to hear more of her full and powerful vocal abilities. Stewart plays along to the guitar very well, and certainly has the attitude of a rock chick.<br/><br/>Meatiest role by far is that of Kim Fowley, and Shannon laps it up with aplomb. As for the other band members - and this is a common criticism of the film - the are really only bit parts. I can forgive this - the film would have to be 4 hours long if everyone was to get equal coverage. Stewart and Fanning are the stars and the film is basically about Jett and Currie, based on a book written by Currie, which presumably is why that part steals the limelight.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes are polished, faultless, whilst others appear rushed and under-rehearsed. There are gaps in the script (maybe due to memory loss?!) and it all fits together rather like a jigsaw with half the pieces missing. It's a good film, but it should have been a great film, and Dakota Fanning should (and could) have made this the performance of her life. Kristen Stewart wins my admiration and deserves the plaudits for throwing herself into her role with 100% enthusiasm, whereas it would appear to be just another day at work for Fanning.<br/><br/>Dakota, you can't get by just by being a great actor - you have to show you're a great actor. I always get the feeling acting is a little bit of a sideline for you - and maybe rightly so, with school and college. I hope when you finish your education and all that goes with it (which no-one should deny you) we will see the ""old"" Dakota cramming every ounce of her boundless energy into film roles.<br/><br/>So, Runaways fans might wince at this film, but it manages to evoke enough of that 1970s spirit of excitement and innovation in music to satisfy those that were there, if not those that wrote the songs. I loved the cinematography, loved the music, and loved the performances. I just wish I'd be blown away by them."

","Aside from The Expendables this was the only other movie i was looking forward to in 2010. This was also the first major disappointment of 2010 movie wise. The starting scenes to this movie have Roxxi Roller wailing as the background music, so I'm thinking wow this is going to be so cool....well it started to falter from there. I love Dakota Fanning as she seems to be the next break through star however her lacklustre performance in this was only a chip of my problems with this film. First of all there were 5 girls in The runaways not two although after seeing the credits i can see why Joan Jett herself executive produced this project. The ending credits has what Joan and Cherie did for the rest of their careers once again.....what happened to the other 3 girls? As being an old fan of Lita Ford i think she did quite lucratively for a spell??? One unfortunate is that Scout Taylor Compton who portrays Lita in this didn't have a bigger role in the film as she is another astounding break through actress. Alas Lita Ford didn't want anything (for reasons unknown) to do with this film. This is my first feature from director Floria Sigismindi and will be my last if she directs any more movies like this. There is a rainbow in this however and that alone is Michael Shannon's portrayal of slimy Runaways manager Kim Fowley I have seen things in the 80s on the real Fowley and Shannon pretty much nailed it! Stewart was impressive at times as Joan Jett who apparently was side by side through the making of this with her. Stewart seems to nail all of Jetts queaks and quirks and does an honourable job here. The rest of the movie pretty much left a bad taste in my mouth. Give the script to Scorcese and lets get a good bio about the band."

","The sub genre of biographies on the most glorious musicians of our time has grown much over time. One of my favorites has to be ""The Temptations"" (directed by ), and this film is up there for me. Now like all genres, these films have a fairly general chain of events. A nobody craves to share talent with world, manages to reach limelight, but then is consumed by drugs and falls. Do I find this a weakness? No not necessarily, for every genre has its own tendencies. The super hero must save his love interest, Tom Cruise must dance in almost every movie he's in, Godzilla has to stomp on Tokyo, and every horror has the dumbass who calls out to the darkness expecting a friend. Don't even get me started on the near pointlessness of romantic comedies. These conventions aren't always present, but still often are and it's not always where you're going with a film but just how you get there. And also consider the fact this film and others like it are more or less pieces of history, so running into these conventions isn't really avoidable. Celebrities have a tendency to do stupid things.<br/><br/>For this film, the very enjoyable aspects lie in its sensuality and casting choices. The jail bait Dakota Fanning is bound to draw attention, and this is probably the only film in which I can partake starring Kristen Stewart. They're well aware their playing guitar legends, and so they both do quite well. And Michael Shannonas is just cool. The performances are pretty good and the soundtrack, if you're a fan of Joan Jett and her work, is damn good. Be sure to check this one out."

","Our Dear Hannah Dakota Fanning, When I first learned you were going to sing in a rock and roll band, I thought ""Awesome!"". I can't help but think Britt's love of music and her compassionate roles of troubled girls influenced you to take on this formidable project based on the book ""Neon Angel: A Memoir of a Runaway"" by Cherie Currie, whose character you so brilliantly depict. (i.e.: Brittany Murphy formed her own band in the 1990's, she had rock and roll parents and clashes with young Dakota(2003) who is into classical music in the magical ""Uptown Girls"" - The Special Edition DVD is a must have! - plus Britt is in ""8 Mile"" and ""Tom Petty"". ) Yes Kota, I remember your much acclaimed depiction of a troubled girl influenced by the music of Elvis Presley in ""Hounddog"" (2007).<br/><br/>I think it's neat you are friends with Kristen Stewart, just 4 years older than you. Both of you were in ""New Moon"" (2009) and as the ambitious guitarist/songwriter Joan Jett in ""The Runaways""., (a ground breaking, all girl mid-1970's band) the two of you bond very close as you as Cherie become a bona-fide rock goddess.. So close the two of you feel secure enough to engage in experimental sex with each other. (Edgeplay, a 2004 tell all expose by actual band members gives us a lot more details on the Runaways.)<br/><br/>The other members of the band have their moments. Michael Shannon as Kim Fowley is a raw, propelling energy whom pushes you girls beyond your comfort zone to be sexy and tough. He redeems himself by getting the Runaways a record deal.<br/><br/>I think you do an admirable job of capturing the conflicts Cherie experienced, especially about her home life Your acting is natural, unforced and intense. You rarely show your beautiful smile in this bioptic. I loved it when you did flash it. You mesmerize us with your eyes. Your dramatic acting reminded me of Natalie Wood in ""Inside Daisy Clover"" (1965) Kudos to Kristen also whom showed great talent in her riveting portrayal of her character.. Both of you sing well (there is no lip syncing in the ""Runaways"")and move well on stage.<br/><br/>I think you are living up to the expectations of your friend Britt, whom has graced our life during our lifetime and is considered to be one of the greatest talents of her generation. I look forward to reading your memoir our dear Kota.<br/><br/>Our Dear Kristen Stewart, Well, to begin with, you totally convinced me you are a very talented ""wild one"". Michael Shannon as Kim Fowley really is the luckiest ""dog (whatever)"" to star in this biopic with Dakota Fanning and you and help you as Joan Jett put together The Runaways - a ground breaking first all girl rock n roll mid-1970's band that got signed and came out with albums - The Runaways, The Runaways Queens of Noise and Live in Japan.<br/><br/>I simply adored your exuberant energy on and off the stage. I love the way you bonded with Dakota as Cherie Currie as you two meet in the club and hang out together after her audition to be the band's lead singer. You joyfully jumped up and down in one scene while walking with Kota. <br/><br/>I love the way you try and protect Kota from Fowley and try and keep the band together as she is aggressively promoted as the Rock Goddess. The love between Joan and Cherie was a lot deeper than the kissing and experimental sex they engaged in together while on the road. Another sign you two were very close is when Cherie faints just after you jump in her face about promoting her crotch instead of the music. I got totally upset seeing Kota bummed out in the shower and then falling down just outside the elevator. I really gasped! It was adorable when you got in bed with her at the hospital.<br/><br/>I emotionally squirmed as you became enraged and turn on Fowley when Cherie finally walks out on the band in the middle of a recording session. I was touched by your pain as you confront Cherie in the hallway as she walks out. I had the feeling that since Cherie came from an acting family that she felt compelled to get the acting bug out of her system. Of course, she was very troubled about her family and addicted to drugs by this time.<br/><br/>I loved the way you put together ""Love is Pain"" while soaking in the tub. I had the feeling ""Love is Pain"" and ""Crimson & Clover"" reflected the love you two had for each other. You work through this pain and throw everyone in your place out and go about your music and eventually form Joan Jett and the Blackhearts. <br/><br/>Dakota and you both gave strong, dramatic performances as well as the rest of the band. Stella Maeve was adorable as Sandy West - the most talented drummer of her time. The other band members had their moments on the stage and in the recording room. I loved the beautiful smiles you girls flashed through out the movie. <br/><br/>The director kept up the pace and gave us 70's nostalgia with the music and clothing. I recommend to everyone the DVD for the commentary(which includes Joan Jett along with Kris & Kota) and the extra features on The Runaways. (Plus there is a preview of Kris in ""Welcome to the Rileys"")(2010)."
"jessicanicole910","9","2","5","4 April 2011"," Great film about the 70's hard rock band
","If you are a fan of the 70's hard rock band The Runaways, or classic rock and roll in general, then you will enjoy this movie about the band at the height of their popularity and the struggles they went through, simply titled ""The Runaways"". The movie, written and directed by Floria Sigismondi and based on front woman Cherie Currie's autobiography, ""Neon Angel"", shows what it was like being a woman in the rock and roll industry back in the 70's.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart does an excellent job portraying Joan Jett with her dark jet-black hair, edgy style, and passion for rock music. Dakota Fanning also does a very good job portraying Cherie Currie, the innocent high school girl turned blonde rock star. Both actresses made their characters very believable, especially Stewart. I wish the other bands members had more attention though.<br/><br/>The soundtrack mostly contains Stewart and Fanning doing remakes of Runaways' songs such as ""Queens Of Noise"" and their signature hit ""Cherry Bomb"", but there are only three actual Runaways songs on the soundtrack. It would be better if there were more Runaways' originals on the soundtrack, as someone who could watch this movie might have never heard of The Runaways and would be curious to check out their music. It would be more appropriate if they included more original Runaways' songs rather than Stewart and Fanning remaking them.<br/><br/>While I do have a couple critiques about this movie, overall, I think it was excellent, especially if you are into classic hard rock music. If you're looking for a good rock and roll movie to add to your Netflix, you should definitely add this one. Full of sex, drugs, & rock and roll, ""The Runaways"" is a fantastic film about what it was like trying to make it as an all-female rock band in the 70's."

Too bad really because this gem is right up there with Whip it for great directing, top notch role players and getting it right as far as cast to movie production.<br/><br/>For me personally the best way I can describe a film is I buy it watch it and if it's really good I listen to the commentary and special features.

","Runaways, The (2010) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4)<br/><br/>By the numbers but entertaining look at the girl rock group The Runaways and their lead singer Cherie Currie (Dakota Fanning) and guitar player Joan Jett (Kristen Stewart). The film follows them from being discovered by producer Kim Fowley (Michael Shannon) to the touring, drug addiction and eventual break-up. It's hard to watch any rock and roll film today and not feel a bit of deja vu because all of these bios are starting to look like one another. I guess you can't blame the stories so much it's just that all of these artists pretty much lived the same type of lives and they followed the same paths of destruction. While we have seen everything here before, this is still a pretty strong film thanks in large part to some terrific performances by the leads. Stewart certainly has the look and energy as Jett and I thought she was very believable in the role. The scenes with her shouting, screaming and trying to take control of a situation towards the end of the film inside a sound booth was very effective. I also thought Shannon was terrific as the creepy, Frankenstein-looking producer who is as out there as any character we've seen from these rock pics. Scout Taylor-Compton is nice in her scenes as Lita Ford and even Tatum O'Neal shows up as Currie's mother. The real star of the picture is without question Fanning who makes the role her own and does so much with it even though we've seen that type of character before. I thought Fanning was incredibly effective as you could really feel the torture her character was going through and you could just see all the demons that she was battling. She certainly has the sexuality for the role but she also gave so much in terms of the character development that you can't take your eyes off of her. The music in the film was another plus even though I wasn't overly familiar with it. I thought the way they used the music in the film was effective and especially towards the end when Jett begins to break out on her own. I think the most entertaining thing here is the stuff we've seen before and that's the rise to the top and eventual fall. I think the film suffers when it tries to center on more professional relationships like the one between Currie and her sister. I never bought into that relationship and thought the film was more entertaining when it focused on the band. With that said, THE RUNAWAYS isn't a classic film but it's got a great atmosphere and strong performances that makes it worth seeing."

","I really enjoyed what I got to see of this movie. 'Cherry Bomb' is still stuck in my head, and seeing an all-girl band belt it out onstage was a real treat. I'm surprised modern female singers do not give it a go as this was the first I had heard it and LOVE it.<br/><br/>Michael Shannon was brilliant as the uber-sleeze but very smart Kim Fowley. He saw the 'jail bait band' potential right from the start and oh how telling that this band's first big break through was in Japan (can you say Sailor Moon, anyone?) Dakota put in one of her best performances to date playing the Cherry Bomb herself, and after donning the corset and stockings, I can say that Dakota is finally all growd up.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart rocked the role as Joan Jett, but I was left feeling ripped off. I am a huge JJ fan, and it would have been great to extend the movie and give us one of Joan's early hits, complete, on stage to show her comeback.<br/><br/>I was also insulted for Lita Ford's sake that the movie made NO mention of her successful career in the ending credits! It appeared the director was just as overly fixated on the gyrating teen blonde bombshell lead singer as the male audience of the day.<br/><br/>I was glad to see Cheri is still alive after all that, but CHAINSAW SCULPTING???? WTF??? That was a laugh."
"chez123-836-329812","7","2","5","7 September 2010"," Great film but lacking depth
","This film is a biopic of the first teenage all-girl rock band who made it big back it the late 70's with hits such as 'Cherry Bomb' and 'Queens of Noise'. The film charts the first few years from the formation of the band right through to the trials involving drug addiction and fights within the band.<br/><br/>What I liked about The Runaways: the style, the music and Dakota Fanning and Kristen Stewart in roles a million miles off what I have seen before. As far as music biopics go it seemed quite short or perhaps not as in depth as I would have liked. I had read a little bit about the band when I had heard the film was being released last year which made me want to see more however it ended a little abruptly for me. I'd not heard any of the band's music before nor did I know anything about the band themselves - thankfully they didn't scrimp on the music or the costumes.<br/><br/>The film focuses mainly on band members Cherie Currie (Fanning) and Joan Jett (Stewart) from when the band was formed, to them getting signed by Mercury Records right through to Currie parting ways with the group and Jett releasing her first solo album.<br/><br/>Fanning makes the transition from child star to adult actor well and looks great as the lead singer of The Runaways. Stewart shows there is more to her than the Twilight films (and general all round powtiness - hey it works for Team Edward/Jacob so don't knock it).<br/><br/>In the film there is only one family back story which was for Cherie Currie, which included twin sister Marie whom she later went on to release records with. This made for a more intimate insight into the character.<br/><br/>I would have like to have had one for Joan Jett also as there is an interesting character tale there, and one there was definitely room for.<br/><br/>My favourite quote from the film was from the band's Manager Kim Fowley played by Michael Shannon: 'The Runaways were... a conceptual rock project that failed.... Do I regret that they turned on me? No, I'm glad they turned on me. It shows spirit. If I'm training a wild dog, and the dog bites my hand, I know I've trained him well... ' A great film despite its scantiness, and a great soundtrack to boot!"
"chaaa","7","2","5","7 September 2010"," A sexy biopic of the short-lived superstars
","The Runaways tells the story of the now relatively obscure band that began the career of the now legendary Joan Jett. The Runaways may be obscure now, but they made quite a splash in their day. Joan Jett and Cherie Currie were international icons and the concept of an all-female punk-rock band was unheard of before them. Their songs were simple and not exactly profound but the girls' raucous joie de vivre and Cherie's tendency to ""flaunt her wares"" ensured that they became an overnight sensation.<br/><br/>The film tells the girl's story from just before they met. Joan (Stewart) was a tearaway, teenage punk who liked men's clothes and loud electric guitar. Cherie (Fanning) was a good girl gone bad who cut off her long, angelic, blonde hair and performed at her school talent show miming David Bowie in spandex and face paint. Joan meets legendary manager Kim Fowley outside a club and begs him to listen to her band. He instantly sees the potential marketing sensation and he and Joan handpick Cherie randomly from the crowd to become their singer.<br/><br/>The rest, as they say, is history. We've all seen this film before. It is your typical biopic, all sex and drugs and rock n roll, and then the inevitable fall from grace. I don't judge biopics for being formulaic. It's very difficult to deviate from the conventions of the genre. So, conventions aside, this is a decent film that works in what it sets out to do: give a snapshot of the world The Runaways came from. The visuals, the colours, the costumes and the music are all vibrant and exciting. The girls are sexy, spunky and fearless in their performances and the chemistry between the two leads is perfect. The relationship that is built between Joan and Cherie is both intimate and awkward. Neither girl quite understands the other but both are swept away in the excitement of their friendship and the whirlwind of their new-found fame. Of course the sex and drugs that were once so enticing soon become a problem, especially for the naive and bratty Cherie.<br/><br/>The appeal of the sweaty, sexy, exciting club scene is what makes this movie stand out. However, it loses its way somewhat towards the end as the band's downfall is handled lazily and feels a bit tacked on. If you like your girls slutty, your music trashy and your clothes held together with safety pins then this movie is for you. However, if you're looking for a profound analysis of the music and historical context of The Runaways, you'll come away disappointed."
"wakemeup36","3","2","5","4 August 2010"," Just another one
","I don't know much about The Runaways, other than the fact that they were an all girl rock band from the mid 70s. As a person who likes rock music in general, I was drawn towards this film. So now that I got to see it, this is nothing more than a generic rock n roll film.<br/><br/>I don't think you need any further explanation if you've seen a few films of the same type. But if you haven't, here's what the content mainly consists of. Sex. Yep lots of that. Band members doing it with random people and even with each other. And drugs, obviously. They'll smoke (I consider cigs a drug), snort coke, drink even though they're underage, take pills and all that stuff. A very retarded thing is how they managed to smuggle tons of drugs onto a Japanese airline. It's really hard to believe considering that was an international flight.<br/><br/>Another dumb thing about this film is how everything fall conveniently into place. Want a manager? Oh, there he is, on the other side of the street. Don't have any members for your all girl band? Take 2 paces to the left and there's your female drummer. Go to the right corner of the bar and there's your female vocalist. Other members will just appear magically. They get popular in what, 2 days? That's what it felt like anyway. And due to the cliché rock n roll unhealthy lifestyle and the oh-so-mean manager, the band falls apart towards the end.<br/><br/>I don't know how much of this is actually based on truth. As Joan Jett was part of the production, I'd say a good amount. But the crap is just so hard to swallow. With the exception of the central characters the acting is quite stiff. Whatever, the only real redeemable thing about the whole movie was the decent music. Sure it was a bit entertaining, but as a person who is not familiar with the band, I don't have a good impression of them. I wonder when Hollywood will actually make a film that actually discovers the positive side of rock n roll, like the loyal fans, the ideologies and I don't know, the MUSIC perhaps?"
"DICK STEEL","7","4","14","8 May 2010"," A Nutshell Review: The Runaways
","There's Johnny Cash, and there's Ray Charles, and now get ready for Hollywood's latest biopic on the all female rock group The Runaways, based on lead singer Cherie Currie's book Neon Angel: A Memoir of a Runaway, from which the screenplay was adapted from. Written and directed by Italian filmmaker Floria Sigismondi, as far as biographies on musical legends go, this film still adheres to the same formula, but only because the fate of the stars are such that temptation to go wayward comes stronger for anyone who's a somebody, and frankly such meteoric rise and fall makes for an engrossing drama.<br/><br/>With bands though, an additional element comes in the form of inflated egos that have to be massaged. Unfortunately out of the five members, only drummer Sandy West (Stella Maeve) share some of the spotlight up front, with the remaining two Lita Ford (Scout Taylor- Compton) and Jackie Fox (unmentioned by name in the film) relegated to draping the background almost anonymously and one might think that The Runaways are a trio. And similar to what Alvin and the Chipmunks Squekeul did as a parallel to real world happenings, band managers, in this case Kim Fowley played by Michael Shannon in an arresting performance who knows exactly what's required to survive in the dog-eat-dog industry, almost always want to sex up and boost the lead's popularity even further, which will cause unhappiness amongst the others in the same group. But who can help it, since from the onset both Kim and Joan Jett (Kristen Stewart) wanted a Brigitte Bardot sex kitten to front the lead vocals for their band, who comes in the form of Dakota Fanning's Cherie Currie.<br/><br/>Much has been said of Dakota Fanning's performance as Cherie Currie, and true to form she shows again why she's probably the undisputed actress of her generation. I strongly believe if she stays the course and not get distracted by the glitz and glamour that most teenage stars in Hollywood will likely succumb to, then movie fans, and fans of hers, will be in for many treats in store as she expands her filmography. So far she has been confined to playing her age over the last few years, and her role here as the jailbait of a rock star allows for a descent into vice coming all at once, dabbling with almost every vice you can think of. Her Cherie pouts as she experiments with fleeting same sex relationships with Joan Jett, swearing, no hesitation in showing the middle fingers, puffs away on cigarettes, does cocktail and hard drugs almost everywhere, and like a one-up in portraying the state of drunkenness as to what she had done in Push, though still not very convincing. It's Dakota Fanning like you've never seen her before.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart managed to barely hold her own against her co-star's more charismatic and iconic turn, and thankfully the opportunity came in the last act of the film with the formation of Joan Jett and the Blackhearts, who are heard rather than seen since this is The Runaways biopic. It served the narrative quite well though in ending the film with the unfortunate demise of one and the creation of another, highlighting Joan Jett being the brains and creative force behind the bands. Between the two girls, hers is the edgier role playing very well opposite the sex-kittenish one that Fanning has on her hands, and put together they just crackle and come alive with plenty of energy on stage, or when practicing in their trailer park behind closed doors, working on new songs. Forget Twilight, as Stewart shows that she has enough mettle in her to take on more challenging roles rather than a girl who has to deal solely with relationship woes with unreal creatures.<br/><br/>The Runaways contained enough subplots happening outside of the music industry to give it an all round experience, and since the story's adapted from Currie's book, there's an examination into the sibling rivalry between Cherie and her sister Marie (Riley Keough), and some had mentioned the more controversial aspects of her life had been omitted from the film, such as instances of sexual abuse when young. Then there's the entire episode of their visit to Japan recounted as well, and became the fulcrum for possibly the best stage performance by the stars in their roles, and to sow the seed of discord as well. The pacing of the band's formative years, success and downfall<br/><br/>The film has its production sets and art direction to thank for in bringing back the nostalgic 70s, as well as the rock-n-rolling songs from the mentioned bands, some performed by the real deal, while others ably imitated and covered by the reel ones, which is oh-so-important to be convincing. It's a film that deals with girl power in an almost alpha-feminist way, but human failings affect everyone regardless of gender."
"rockinkettles-1","8","4","14","27 April 2010"," The Runaways Rocked!
","I think the reason The Runaways didn't do that well in the movies is because no one knew who they were. They were the first ever all girl rock band in the 70's. Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning were very good as Joan Jett and Cherie Currie. I never knew that Joan and Cherie had a relationship outside the band. It just goes to show you never know what goes on behind closed doors. Joan Jett of course had a successful solo career with her band the Blackhearts. Unless it is Twilight, no one wants to see Kristen and Dakota in anything different. Maybe it will do better overseas, DVD or on demand. It is a great movie and should not be missed. The Runaways were a slice of history. One of my favorite scenes is when Joan has to go to the bathroom really bad. She goes into the room of these guys who were busting her chops earlier during rehearsal. Joan pulls down her pants and...go see the movie. When I was a teenager, I had all their albums. Even live in Japan. I turned my friends onto the Runaways. One of my friends was in love with Joan Jett. I liked Cherie Currie. But I still like Joan Jett even now. She rocks! And so did the Runaways!"
"jdesando","Null","4","14","7 April 2010"," Not Girl Scouts
","""You dogs would be lucky to get a gig singing in the shower. Go sell girl scout cookies."" Manager Kim Fowley<br/><br/>The last half of the '70's was a time of growth for me, away from rock 'n roll and toward family and profession. For the Runaways, the first all-girl arena-filling rock band, it was a time of the sex, drugs, and . . . well, you know the cliché already.<br/><br/>The Runaways centers not on Joan Jett (Kristen Stewart) but the drug-addled lead singer Cherie Currie (Dakota Fanning). Although Jett had enough ambition for all five girls, Currie had the bod and the Monroe-like sexiness. Fortunately, after Currie abandons them for a confused notion of home, Jett finally goes it without her and pumps her fist for millions of ""I Love Rock and Roll"" in 1882.<br/><br/>For a couple of years this band made believers of those hard core rock fans who thought girls didn't belong in the same hall of fame as the Beatles. More sexy than that iconic band but less talented, the Runaways serve as a caution about the heady, amoral world of rock stardom. <br/><br/>This film seems more interested in seeing what the band looked like (director Floria Sigismondi has built a career in video) than in the development of character; my case in point is her missing opportunities to mine the Jett persona rather than the Currie anarchy. She does better with the charismatic manager, Kim Fowley (Michael Shannon), whose combination of abuse and love was crucial to their tough style and endurance in a man's world. The training sessions in his trailer are a fine representation of the incubation and the working-class roots of their lives and their genre.<br/><br/>I'm feeling once again that I don't want a ride back there in the Hot Tub Time Machine—the scene is scary and dicey. I'd much rather stay home and tap into my Internet connections with news of contemporary bad actors like Jesse James and Britney Spears. Now they would fit even better in Sigismondi's superficial world"
"colinrgeorge","5","4","14","6 April 2010"," ""The Runaways""
","""The Runaways"" isn't much of a film, but it has so much damn style that it's hard not to be intermittently enthused by music video director Floria Sigismondi's music video of a movie. Her chipper cutting and blisteringly upbeat Joan Jett/Runaways soundtrack makes, on one hand, for spontaneous and thrilling tour sequences, which on the other, emphasize how hopelessly average the narrative around them is. Sigismondi has worked with the likes of Sheryl Crow and David Bowie, and understands the symbiotic relationship between sound and image—The problem is that when the film rolls sans tunage, she can't quite find the rhythm.<br/><br/>I suppose she didn't have the best script to work with, and as she's also credited with the adaptation of Cherie Currie's book, I'm inclined to blame conservative manipulation of fact in her writing before her direction. Knowing literally nothing about the Runaways as a band going in, I couldn't care less if ""That's how it happened."" In truth, I found their rise to superstardom in the first act of the film fortuitous to the point of contrivance.<br/><br/>The truth may be stranger than fiction, but watching characters I met ten minutes ago immediately succeed isn't endearing, it's alienating, especially in proximity to yet another groaningly caricatural cinematic businessman. You've got Giovanni Ribisi in ""Avatar,"" Jon Bernthal in ""The Ghost Writer,"" and now Michael Shannon in ""The Runaways,"" all in the span of, what, four months? Hollywood, I get it. Corporate guys are weasels. Even your corporate guys. With the omission of Jeremy Piven, I just don't find it funny or compelling anymore. It's cheap, lazy character writing.<br/><br/>But Shannon's performance in ""The Runaways"" is a minor gripe compared with its overall insubstantiality. The band biopic is nothing new, and while I commend Sigismondi for not watering down the sex, drugs, and rock and roll to cater to the sort of PG-13 audience that would eat up anything Kristen Stewart is doing by peripheral association, her film is still intellectually immature and fundamentally broken.<br/><br/>For starters, Stewart as Joan Jett has every reason to be our protagonist except a book deal. Cherie's got a louse of a father, a strained relationship with her sister, and a burgeoning singing career complete with a trendy drug habit. Really, movie? The 'price of fame' angle? Give me a break. The family stuff should carry weight, and doesn't, because the bulk of the film is bubblegum, which I'm perfectly content to chew. Just don't tell me it's a three-course meal.<br/><br/>""The Runaways"" is overlong. Its second half, which sinks into the band's inevitable downturn of fortune, comes to a screeching halt to flesh out story bits that I didn't care about to begin with. Sing that ""Cherry Bomb"" song again.<br/><br/>The problem is there's no reason to care, and entertainment value alone doesn't cover for the obviously weak story. And if the story is weak, as I suspect it is, because it's based nearly to the T on the honest to God truth, then with all due respect, it doesn't make for great cinema as is. Aspiring biopic writers, here's a tip: lie a little.<br/><br/>It's ultimately character that begets emotional gravity, not an event itself. Pill popping, drunkard dads, and band infighting don't amount to a hill of beans unless I really care about who those people are.<br/><br/>Sigismondi's film is strung up on the rack and pulled from both ends until its neither frenetic rock pic nor indie coming of age story, which is a shame, because the former is executed so well. When the music stops, it's all too clear that as far as drama goes, ""The Runaways"" is an absentee."
"dragonkings01","6","3","10","17 June 2010"," Weak story telling and bad directing broke these Runaways up....
","I don't know why all the love, I thought the movie didn't cover anything about the Runaways in depth, it was random scenes in their career that really didn't jell into a real movie about them or explain anything about their lives. The movie was just the chick from twilight doing a hammy Jett impression and Dakota in not one of her better acting jobs as Cheri. <br/><br/>With that said, the 70's was a interesting time for music and the Runaways were one of the better of that period. This movie was very superficial about their rise and ignores a lot of key details. It doesn't even establish that this band went through various musicians and spanned half a decade. If you took this movie as gospel you would think they had one Hit and maybe two albums in the span of a year then broke up, because a time line is never established. <br/><br/>The movie needed a re-edit to clear through the muddled directing and poor story structure. But it wasn't bad, dunno about recommending it on it's own merits. I had to google about the girls and the band just to figure out what was trying to be told. But hell Joan was in a class of her own in the 80's, in the 70's the Runaways had a lot to learn and a lot of potential. Too bad the movie ignored most of the band and told nothing. <br/><br/>But hell, I guess if you have Dakota fanning acting as a half naked Jailbait 70's rock princess on drugs and The twilight Chick running around in her underwear most people won't see the the plot holes or crappy directing and rave about it's originality for all the wrong reasons."

","...And more sex,drugs & rock & roll,and even more sex,drugs & rock & roll. If you haven't quite figured it out yet,this is the tale of the rise & fall of the 1970's pre-Glam (glamour-a sort of post glitter rock genre) rock band,The Runaways. In 1975,Kim Fowley,who is/was something of an icon on the Sunset Strip in Hollywood,who was associated with the likes of Frank Zappa & the original Mothers Of Invention,Jonathan Richman,to mention but a few, discovered a then,unknown guitar player named Joan Jett,who wanted to rock out in a big way & helped form The Runaways,and made them a success. 'The Runaways' attempts to tell their story of the road to success,and it's hard falling down. The Runaways lasted little more than four (or so) years,and recorded a few L.P's for Mercury,before burning out. Italy's own Floria Sigismondi,known for her work in music videos,directs from her screenplay,adapted from the novel 'Neon Angel' by Cherie Currie,based on her own life as ""rock & roll goddess"". Joan Jett acts as one of the executive producers. The cast includes Kristen Stewart,who moves up in a big way from her usual shtick in the Twilight series (another one is due sometime later this year,or next year),as Joan Jett. Dakota Fanning, looking dead eyed & myopic as Cherie Currie. Stella Maeve,as Sandy West. Scout Taylor-Compton,as Lita Ford,and Alia Shawkat,as Robin,as The Runaways. Michael Shannon is the very over the top,Kim Fowley,who is part Svengali,and part Frankenstein's monster as their manager,as well as some brief on screen time by Tatum O'Neal (yes,THE Tatum O'Neal, of 'Paper Moon'fame),as Cherie's mother. My two obvious gripes with this film is some of the historical goofs (I won't go into details,as not to spoil it for others,but musical historians will pick it up in the flick of an eye),and how the film mostly focuses on the working & personal relationship of Joan & Cherie (the rest of the Runaways seem to be little more than a backdrop most of the time). The biggest winner of this film (for me,anyway)is the music,which not only includes songs by The Runaways,but Iggy & The Stooges,David Bowie,as well as other period music of the era. For anybody born after 1985,who wonders ""what was the music of the '70's all about?"",this film will give you a brief peek into an open window of that decade. Rated 'R' by the MPAA,this film contains strong language,and much reveling in the Rock & Roll lifestyle (sexual experimentation,including nudity,much alcohol & drug abuse...mainly by minors),much on screen smoking"

While the aforementioned talent do a bang up job inhibiting their intimidating icon roles (especially Stewart with plenty of Body English –the shoulder-shrumped slouch is dead-on!), the film itself short-changes the other girls (i.e. Lita Ford, hell-o!) and is rather a by-the-numbers-melodrama. Yet the music rocks so that's something that first time director and screenwriter Floria Sigismondi (who adapted Currie's autobiography ""Neon Angel: The Cherie Currie Story"") does manage to capture the authentic feel of the era (grainy 16 mm footage helps too!) and the heart of rock and roll in general."

The movie's two young stars are both excellent in their roles, and I can tell that Kristen especially nailed Jett. Dakota's portrayal of Cherie may have nailed it, but I am not in a position to know for sure. Kristen and Dakota are both child stars who are now beginning to make their names as adults (or close). Both clearly have the chops.<br/><br/>Stewart, a special favorite of mine, need not constantly be associated with the Twilight movies, as she is creating a body of work that far surpasses that type of role. It is time to stop being surprised when Kristen Stewart turns in a top-notch performance -- top-notch is now the norm for this talented actress.<br/><br/>The Runaways does suffer from a routine 'rock idol' script, and in my opinion, concentrates too heavily on the Cherie character.

","Recruited for what would become a pioneer all-female hard rock band in the 1970s, two teenagers have to contend with whether to promote their music or sex appeal as per the wishes of their eccentric music producer in this film based on the true experiences of the title band that propelled Joan Jett to fame. The film is based on the memoirs of the band's lead singer, Cherie Currie, and the film is mostly spent on the dynamics and rising tensions between Joan and Cherrie, with Dakota Fanning and Kristen Stewart both convincing in the respective roles. Fanning has some particularly good moments towards the end as all the fame gets to her head and a final conversation between the pair provides a perfect note for the film to end on. In order to focus on these two big personalities, the film uncomfortably ignores the other three members of the band though, all of whom are so lightly developed that they remain completely interchangeable throughout. The fact that Cherie's family background gets such a large focus over Joan's when they are equal protagonists does not quite sit well either. Never to mind, the film is well paced enough that there is rarely a dull moment with Michael Shannon stealing every scene he is in as the band's off-the-wall producer with the craziest twinkle in his eye as he gets them to practise playing while food is thrown at them (!) and as he keeps going on about all negative publicity being good. There is also a lot to like about the girls' determination to succeed in a traditionally all-male industry no matter what it takes."

","Oh yeah, it is a way too difficult to film biopics about real rock bands. If the members are still alive, they can meddle in the process, send a scathing review after the film is made, or ask to be withdrawn from the script altogether if they fear their part in a given movie would be not so good. Or even the time limits of a film, even if the band in question, The Runaways, exited for not so many years, still, many many key events have to be omitted or so heavily shortened that any fan will end up scratching their head and asking whether it was what they wanted to see. Mind you, this version is not bad at all, as a musician myself, I must admit that the rehearsal process and backstage routine are depicted admirably well, and the whole grudge of a song learning, sound check, and pre-gig booze is here at an excellent realistic swap. Still, the short timing of the movie leaves much off the camera, and the whole thing seems a bit too rushed and sometimes ruined. The main actors do their part well, Kristin Stewart as Joan Jett is surprisingly decent, dark, menacing, self-destructive and deep. Dakota Fanning as Cherry Curie is another winner, with her blonde angelic looks and wild persona. The rest is a bit dubious. Kim Fowley? Was he that weird and queer? Lita Ford? She is present, but her fiery guitar and her fiery persona are shown so briefly and little, that one can only feel shame. The bassist? Her name? Poor dear, she never even uttered a word. Sandy, the drummer? She is cool at the offset, but then she is somehow lost in a mire. The rushes ending and vague scenes with bathtub and sea leave us a bit perplexed, and the whole wrap-up is a bit too confusing.

The Runaways was the very first all girl Rock band who were tough and rebellious and in the movie it really captured that, also people in the other reviews said some things about how besides Cherie and Joan the other members weren't included enough in this movie that is because lita ford the lead guitarist of the group refused to let them use her story, next is Sandy west, Sandy died in 2006 and couldn't really get much of her story without it coming from her and also Jackie Fox is a lawyer now and the crew for the runaways movie didn't want to take any chances also because the runaways changed bass players throughout.

","What does one say about a movie that's really good but could have been a great?<br/><br/>First off. Why was it really good? Well because The Runaways were the first all female rock band that wrote their material and played their instruments. The fact they were charismatic eye candy was a bonus for us males - so God bless'em for that. That makes this an important movie.<br/><br/>This type of genre tends to fall flat on its face, especially for musicians, when an actor is cast that can't play their respective instrument or mime the vocals. So when Joan Jett (played by the very gifted Kristen Stewart)is playing the guitar and singing, it appears authentic. Didn't hurt that Kristen resembles Joan Jett either.<br/><br/>Dakota Fanning is another gifted actress. Only difference is she exudes a wholesomeness that should have banned her from playing the role of Cherie Currie. But she handled it like a true pro. Folks. we're talking,"" Sex, Drugs, Booze and Rock N Roll."" Plus, she sings amazingly well on these tracks.<br/><br/>Casting Elvis Presley's granddaughter as Cherie's twin sister Marie was a great choice. The role was small but gave her the opportunity to mix- it-up with the pros and shine.<br/><br/>Now.How could it have been made great? Well,simple; more emphasis on the other band members, especially Joan Jett. The story line leaned too heavily on Cherie's family life leaving me wanting to know more about the other group members family life. I still don't know diddly-squat about Lita Ford's life. We actually get to see Sandy West's Mom's horrified reaction after Kim Fowley comes to their home. And as for Joan's family life? Well forget about it. Not a peep.And I don't recall the bass player, Robin, played by Alia Shawkat from the sitcom Arrested Development having any dialogue! We see they played in Japan. But did they play at CBGB's ? It desperately needed that kind of balance.<br/><br/>It would also have been nice to show a photo of the real-life Runaways in 1976 that morphs into how they look today, just before the ending credits. Cliché? absolutely. Relevant? Very much so. <br/><br/>BTW, the peeing on a guitar scene did happen according to Joan and the group it happened to was ( drum roll,please ) RUSH !<br/><br/>As a final note, the commentary is not to be missed. It has Joan Jett, Kristen and Dakota dishing out morsels of interesting background info. It too is rated R because of Kristen's penchant for whimsical profanity"

","Cherie Currie (Dakota Fanning) is a rebellious teen winning her 10th grade talent contest as David Bowie. Joan Jett (Kristen Stewart) is a tough bisexual teen sniffing glue and playing her guitar. She faces a lot of sexist attitudes. She approaches record producer Kim Fowley (Michael Shannon) outside a club to start an all-girl band. Kim introduces Joan to drummer Sandy West (Stella Maeve). Then Kim and Joan recruit Cherie into the band. Kim toughens the girls into an edgy rock band.<br/><br/>Dakota Fanning is trying to do more rougher roles. Kristen Stewart has a good handle on the tough young chick character. The girls do a good job. Then there is Michael Shannon. He is amazing in this. This is not necessarily a ground breaking music bio. In fact, it follows the try-and-true formula of all such movies. It just does it very well. Also it has some pretty good music."
"cwbellor","10","1","2","28 September 2014"," Don't look for the facts. Look for the truth!
","Does this film tell the whole story of the band The Runaways? No! Of course it doesn't. How can a film tell the whole story in one hour and forty minutes? When it comes to any film based on real events, whether it's Gandhi, Braveheart, Ray, etc, people have some very naive expectations concerning accuracy and truth. But any film based on nonfictional material is not a recreation of events. It's a representation of events. You're not watching a story. You're watching a summary. Many would tell you that this is Cherie Currie's summary and therefore a movie about her and not The Runaways. Because that is the case, doubts are aplenty not only about the accuracy but the integrity of this film. If by some miracle, there were four more movies made, each from the perspective of a different Runaway, the accuracy and credibility of each one would be challenged by passionate fans, moviegoers and those who were actually there.<br/><br/>What you get with this film is a thoughtful and captivating look into the era. It was a time when rock n' roll was still dangerous and a girl who wanted to play electric had a lot to prove. With Dakota Fanning's portrayal of Cherie Currie, you get a compelling performance where fragility and innocence mixes with angst and anger. Just like that cherry-shaped firecracker, Dakota can appear sweet and harmless. But if she feels the heat, she could easily be the bomb that blows up in your face. Kristen Stewart's portrayal of Joan Jett is a glimpse of iconic individuality in the face of sexist adversity. And when you think the performance might be veering towards one dimensional monotony, you see her start to crack. When an argument in the studio turns destructive and friendships deteriorate, Kristen's Joan betrays a vulnerability that is damn near heart-breaking. Michael Shannon threatens to steal the whole movie as he gives a larger than life portrayal of larger than life producer Kim Fowley. The character represents everything that is exciting, immoral and ultimately detrimental in the world these girls find themselves in. <br/><br/>Any film dealing with the familiar rock n' roll archetypes of sex, drugs and losing it all is bound to be at risk of floundering in clichés. These may be apparent, but only the insufferable cynics will let them get in the way of the truth. And this film does tell the truth. When these girls are on stage, the music, mind, body and soul are in perfect alignment. In those moments they are the most familial, the most powerful and they are so beautifully dangerous that nobody can doubt their strength. It is the purest high that they could ever achieve. The problems arise when the music stops. They walk off stage and they have to deal with family, love, friendships and future. The most obvious way to escape it all is to try and recreate the high. For many a rock star, the answer is never far and for Cherie Currie, the answer was only a pill away. <br/><br/>But in the end, the only high that matters is the music because the music is what everyone remembers. If you're looking for the truth in this movie, there it is."

","This was pretty good; dirty, raunchy, in your face and capturing the spirit and essence of the mid 1970's perfectly.<br/><br/>The story follows the conception and early days of ""The Runaways"" an all girl punk band that took the world by storm and focuses mostly on the tumultuous relationship between Joan Jett and Cherie Currie.<br/><br/>I'll admit to questioning the casting here and initially having a hard time excepting Dakota Fanning in the role of sex-kitten junkie Currie. She does a fantastic job though and her downward spiral was the part of the story that interested me the most. I'm not a huge fan of K-Stew but she looks just like and captures the toughness of Joan Jett really well. I did get tired of seeing her in leather pants in every single scene though. The clothes and hair in general are super fun, the music is great, the story as a whole felt kinda disjointed. Michael Shannon is suitably weird/sleazy as their manager. 8/12/14"

","The Runaways were part of the hard rock revolution and were an all female group. The movie is the story of Joan Jett (Kristen Stewart) and how she created ""The Runaways"" with Kim Foley (Michael Shannon) as their manager. Along the way they recruit Cherie Currie (Dakota Fanning) to be the bands lead singer and face. This is a very realistic look at how drugs (alcohol included) was part of the bands daily life and eventually their downfall. Joan Jett continued after the Runaways disbanded and became a major force in hard rock music throughout the 70's and 80's and still performs today.The Runaways music is some of my favourite music of all time and in the movie Dakota Fanning and Kristen Stewart actually sing in the live music scenes. I am a fan of Dakota Fanning and Micheal Shannon, but I did not know too much about Kristen Stewart, who is a fine actress and I look forward to seeing more of her work. If you are a lover of hard rock, watch the movie and listen to the Runaways discography. I was thoroughly entertained by this movie."

The soundtrack is a stunner this movie got me into the songs, it's about a group of teens going through challenges of the real word and not having any adult supervision and what trouble they get in to. So what's not to live about the romance and drama, kristen Stewart did a fantastic job playing Joan jett so played her so we'll and liked just like her everything was good how it was set in the 70s, she did a great job playing a tom boy girl!

","What does one say about a movie that's really good but could have been a great?<br/><br/>First off. Why was it really good? Well because The Runaways were the first all female rock band that wrote their material and played their instruments. The fact they were charismatic eye candy was a bonus for us males - so God bless'em for that. That makes this an important movie.<br/><br/>This type of genre tends to fall flat on its face, especially for musicians, when an actor is cast that can't play their respective instrument or mime the vocals. So when Joan Jett (played by the very gifted Kristen Stewart)is playing the guitar and singing, it appears authentic. Didn't hurt that Kristen resembles Joan Jett either.<br/><br/>Dakota Fanning is another gifted actress. Only difference is she exudes a wholesomeness that should have banned her from playing the role of Cherie Currie. But she handled it like a true pro. Folks. we're talking,"" Sex, Drugs, Booze and Rock N Roll."" Plus, she sings amazingly well on these tracks. <br/><br/>Casting Elvis Presley's granddaughter as Cherie's twin sister Marie was a great choice. The role was small but gave her the opportunity to mix-it-up with the pros and shine.<br/><br/>Now.How could it have been made great? Well,simple; more emphasis on the other band members, especially Joan Jett. The story line leaned too heavily on Cherie's family life leaving me wanting to know more about the other group members family life. I still don't know diddly-squat about Lita Ford's life.

"natashabowiepinky","6","1","2","2 May 2013"," Run Away with the Runaways
","The Runaways were the first all girl rock group, put together by a sleazy manager who saw a gap in the market. In their line-up was a very young Joan Jett... she would go on to much greater things with a group called The Blackhearts who would score a huge hit with a cover of I Love Rock And Roll, which would sell over ten million copies in the USA alone. The reason you probably haven't heard of the Runaways is perhaps because a) They had a massive falling out when the co-lead singer, Cherie Currie(!) decided to quit early into their creation, and b) Judging by the material in this movie at least, their music wasn't actually that good. Oh well, c'est la vie...<br/><br/>The 70's was all booze, sex and drugs according to those who witnessed it, and the film demonstrates that in graphic detail with a catalogue of debauchery and mayhem. Quite how these young bodies can stand so much abuse is beyond me, but hey... If all the Rolling Stones are still alive, I guess that's possible. There's also an awful lot of profanities exchanged between these amateur musicians... if you took any of these girls home to meet your mother, she'd most likely have a heart attack, You can't help but feel though for all they THINK they're doing for feminism, they're still being exploited in a different way... And most of their fanbase seem to consist of either dirty older men, and young girls who should know better.<br/><br/>Dakota Fanning completely ditches her good-girl image as the depraved and vulnerable Cherie, who sleeps with girls and boys during the course of events and snorts more blow than a cheap hooker. Kristen Stewart also surprises as the openly gay Joan Jett... free of the shackles of her usual downbeat roles, she portrays the boisterous and spirited young future star with relish. The reason why, despite all the talent on show, this doesn't score higher is not much happens in the 90 minute run time... Just a few performances of their one hit song and an impromptu trip to Japan, before Cherie leaves and the movie is as good as over. Oh, there's some stuff involving Cherie's fractious family life and the crush Joan has on her, but none of this is particularly exhilarating.<br/><br/>They may have been trailblazers in a way, but in my opinion the footprint they left on the industry was smaller than a mouse's. There are no real classics in their repertoire, and the only people who fondly remember them these days are either blinded by nostalgia or devotees of Joan Jett who adore everything she does. It's rather odd that a studio would bankroll a film about an average band that struggle for a few years before ending acrimoniously, such groups are ten a penny. But I suppose the fact they're female gives it novelty value, but not enough to convince me they were anything great... even if they had stayed together. 6/10"
"DKosty123","6","1","2","1 May 2013"," Historic Biopic
","Up until the Runaways hit the scene, women's rock and roll were limited to some random women in rock bands. The Runaways were the first group to change all that by having an all-women group. This is the second film to address this band. Both films should be watched and then remember that history is always revised in Media. When I watched the extras on the DVD I found out this story focus was on -Kristen Stewart Kristen Stewart ... Joan Jett Dakota Fanning .. Cherie Currie <br/><br/>Joan Jett and Cherie Currie were consultants on this film and so the story is limited by their point of view. Other than that limit I have no complaints about what the film tries to do. <br/><br/>Women in Rock and Roll prior to the band I can recall were a member of The Honeycomb who sang the song ""Have I The Right"" in the early 1960's and a woman drummer with The First Edition ( song -Just In Time). Kenny Rogers was the lead singer of The First Edition. Since neither of these counts as really hard rock, they were just token women who tried to break the barrier"

","The Runaways: The story of a 70s female rock band. It's capably acted by Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning. For me, the movie isn't going to win any awards, however I certainly wasn't bored when I watched it. The movie depicts the descent into and re-ascent out of the torturous world of rock and roll for the lead actresses in an entertaining way. The story is fairly predictable in that we see how fame and drugs effects the band members who eventually break- up. The refreshing part of it of course being the fact that it wasn't your more common male- dominated bands. Worth a watch.<br/><br/>On a side note, Dakota Fanning has certainly done some growing up!"
"seaofgiants","4","2","7","13 December 2010"," Terrible Sense of Aging, Growing & Time Passing
","I was excited to see what the young, new talent Kristen Stewart would bring to this great, edgy role. She was perfectly angst in Twilight, but could she be rock-n-roll enough? Could she lip sync? Act strung out?<br/><br/>Although she did a good job (so did Dakota Fanning, who I think will eventually become a great long- standing actor), she did not blow me away. To me, she pretty much played her usual, sarcastic, mumbly angst role. This time in leather hot pants & a guitar. She just didn't show the acting range I was hoping to see.<br/><br/>What I found most annoying about the movie was the non-existing capture of time passing -- of following these growing girls over the years. Suddenly they are ""rocking out"" in a bus, then in a stadium in Japan?? How did THAT happen?? When did they go? How long were they there? Then why were they back playing on the bus after that?? After hitting it big? It just didn't make sense to me.<br/><br/>And I don't really know the backstory of Joan Jett or the Runaways, I probably should, but this movie certainly didn't explain much to me. It didn't educate me to their lives or struggles, except that Joan went on to be successful as a solo artist and Cherie became a ""regular"" person. But I could have learned that much about Joan Jett or Cherie Curry by just reading an old Rolling Stone. This movie just didn't give me much more to think about. It was choppy & confusing (how come they are not growing old, not showing the years pass by, what year is it?). It was really just an OK movie."
"kosmasp","7","2","8","23 October 2010"," Running into Michael Shannon
","Michael Shannon is really great in this. He's really out there and almost steals the movie from our two leads (played by Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning). I had no idea who they were playing or what the movie was about (having seen it at a Sneak Preview and generally avoiding reading too much beforehand).<br/><br/>It's about growing up, about the music business, with very good performances. Though you might find it difficult to watch Dakota in a role like this, if you are used to see her as a kid. Well she's on the verge of becoming an adult and that plays into the role too of course. Kristen playing a sort of anchor in the movie. It is not a perfect movie, but it has many things going for it (the actors for one)!"
"gut-6","5","2","8","23 July 2010"," Compendium of clichés with great acting
","I don't think I have ever given 5/10 to a movie, as that is such a neutral, wishy-washy evaluation. If a movie is not good, it is usually bad or annoying to some degree. Yet 5/10 describes ""The Runaways"" perfectly. It is neither good nor bad.<br/><br/>On the good side, the acting is indeed good. I don't think I have ever seen an actor capture a living celebrity as perfectly as Kristen Stewart captures the young Joan Jett. In voice, appearance, personality and mannerisms, Stewart is indistinguishable from the real thing. It is an amazing performance. Likewise, Michael Shannon did almost as good a job as ultra-pretentious huckster Kim Fowley, although Shannon is more physically imposing than Fowley and looks more like Dee Dee Ramone than the actual Fowley. Shannon plays ultracamp but doesn't really look it. Dakota Fanning wasn't quite as good at playing Cherie Currie, the real Cherie being thinner and hotter and looking much older than Fanning. Fanning seems more innocent and diffident than Currie did on stage, but maybe that is closer to reality than Currie's stage persona. The set designers and costumers really put a lot of care into getting the 1970's fashions and furnishings right. Also much of the music is quite good. However only a minority is Runaways songs.<br/><br/>However acting alone cannot carry a movie. The script is just a compendium of rock clichés, the sort of fantasies a sheltered early teenager with a low threshold for rebelliousness would have about rock stars. Difficult startup playing house parties that get busted by the cops, lame rebelliousness, alcoholic or abusive parents, exploitative manipulative Maclarenesque manager haranguing his charges about rock & roll being all about sex and rebellion while misappropriating their revenues, lesbian experimentation, record deal with unhip record industry execs, screaming fans on overseas tours, rock magazine headlines, seedy hotels, male chauvinists saying a woman's place is in the home, personality clashes and drug addiction leading to the band's downfall. It's not necessarily inaccurate, but you've seen all this a squillion times before. There is no real story outside of this series of clichés, nothing at all unexpected. It's not notably boring or annoying, but sure isn't interesting either.<br/><br/>Still at least it's not a live action comic book for 13 year old boys or a Prince Charming chick flick for youngish single women, which every other film seems to be nowadays, so it's worth seeing if nothing else is on."

","What I liked about The Runaways: The music The ladies<br/><br/>What I didn't like about The Runaways: There wasn't enough story there Not a good timeline of events Didn't flesh out the characters- not even Jett or Currie who were the main focus Never really had a moment<br/><br/>I recently saw The Runaways, and here's what I thought:<br/><br/>It's not bad but not great either. I kept waiting for a moment that never came, which is not to say there aren't neat things about this bio pic. It certainly garners interest in the music and the ladies themselves, but it didn't satisfy me. It just sort of whet my appetitite, which may have been the point. The Runaways were short lived and saw much of their success overseas, but it also consisted of five kick ass, talented woman. The movie chooses to focus on two- Jett and Currie (and moreso on the latter). <br/><br/>Acting-wise, there are some pretty interesting performances. I say interesting because I think Kirsten Stewart functions better as a supporting player than an actual lead. When I think of all the things I've liked her in (Into the Wild, In the Land of Women), she hasn't been the lead. Dakota Fanning finally successfully sheds her little girl image with the role of Currie (unlike her finger licking role in The Secret Life of Bees). I think she made an excellent lead and was at times on the cusp of greatness but never quite delivered, which is why I don't foresee a nom. This could've been due to unfamiliarity with that particular lifestyle or the somewhat ""underdevelopedness"" (if that's a word) of the entire pic. Still, it's engaging, and I never felt bored albeit unsatisfied with the ending. The band's breakup for me seemed to have come out of nowhere. <br/><br/>The director is as provocative as the women she brings to life on film. The shot she chooses to open the film with sets the tone perfectly. The era seems authentic, and the mixture of bright, dingy colors create a stunning visual backdrop amidst the sex, drugs, and rock. The band's performances are stellarly captured with some strong vocals delivered by both Stewart and Fanning. <br/><br/>Overall, I think this film will surprise people but may prove to lite for fans more familiar with the band, its history, and music. However, I think that if you aren't familiar with The Runaways, by the film's end, you'll be a fan. 6 out of 10 stars."

","There's probably a lot of things they could of done differently but I think the thing that the movie effectively captures is the energy of what must have been a wild, intense ride from the point of view of teenage girls. They went from nowhere to completely uncharted territory without many rules. Crazy. And it was on that level that I enjoyed the movie. If you're looking for a deep insight or some bigger message I don't think you're going to find it.<br/><br/>One criticism I had that other people have written about was the lack of development of the other band members but there may have been reasons for this. For longtime Runaway fans, Sandy West was as big a part of the band as anyone. Lita Ford, while not achieving quite the success of Joan Jett, was pretty successful and well respected in the metal genre. In a sense The Runaways were the female version of the Yardbirds. Okay, that's may be a little bit of a stretch but it's kinda true.<br/><br/>I give them props just for getting this movie made and not watering it down to get a more Twilight fan, age friendly rating."

","I was reading someone else's review of this film, and he asked the question in my summary heading. The answer to that is simply. Joan Jett was the executive producer and Cherie Curries book was the basis of the story. Lita Ford was written off as a villain, and Jackie Fox was background scenery. Had this film been made today, I don't think Jackie's story would have been left out. Ironically Jackie went on to become a graduate of Harvard Law School and came out with her story of being raped by Fowley. Micki Steele's involvement would have been interesting as well. What a shame. I'll look forward to a real documentary about this band in the future that tells the complete story of everyone, and isn't transformed into the Joan Jett show. I would expect this from Gene Simmons. I gave this an 8 because at least two members got to tell their story, and problems associated with this band's startup. Also it shows what a jerk Kim was to the human race."
"thesar-2","5","1","3","3 March 2013"," The Bomb That Took Down the Jett on the Runaway
","Well, I completed my homework assignment of watching The Runaways. Can I go out and play now?<br/><br/>The objective of the task a friend gave me was to see a different side of Kristen Stewart since I thought I hadn't see a movie with her in it yet – outside the Twilight series, that is. Turns out, yeah, I did see Jumper and Into the Wild, but I do not recall her in those. Hereyou'd be blind not to notice her even while she's fairly mellow. As always, it appears.<br/><br/>Now, I'm not a Joan Jett fan, though I do enjoy her music when it comes on. I'm so ignorant on the topic of her past or present, I thought it was just her and some backup chicks. I didn't know anything about ""The Runaways"" band, nor the sequel: ""Joan Jett and the Blackhearts."" (I guess I was right on my thoughts for that one.)<br/><br/>Well, despite my ignorance and the fact this movie really wasn't about Joan, I enjoyed the ride of the girls wanting to develop a band from virtually nothing into sexy stardom. And they didn't waste any time jumping right into the destructive drug usage.<br/><br/>Perhaps this movie was accurate, because not only was Joan Jett one of the major producers, she apparently was on set all the time pointing out the accuracies. If this is true, and I have no reason to suspect otherwise, it was a pretty dull ride with so little happening, the movie seemed to be stretched out as far as it could to make this a feature length. Again, that's not to say I didn't enjoy it, but it wasn't the most ""explosive"" biography I've seen. (In fact, the original poster's tagline was: ""It's 1975 and they're about to explode."" Hardly.)<br/><br/>But, it did have fairly decent acting all around with, surprisingly the best performance in a movie about an all-girl band was Michael Shannon as Kim Fowley. He was sure out there, but I thought he was above the rest. And the rest wasn't that bad: the two leads, Stewart as Joan Jett and Dakota Fanning as Cherie Currie were very goodat looking melancholy all the time. Sure, that, again, might be accurate; these real life ladies might have been a bit of a couple of downers. I did believe in their performances, but they didn't grab me to care one way or another where they ended up.<br/><br/>The soundtrack, of course, was killer and the decades old scenery believable. I would recommend this movie of the (sorta) rise, (sorta) fall and (sorta) reinvention of an all (sorta) kickass girls band – they really didn't see that badass, by the way.<br/><br/>And, yeah, it was nice to see some range out of Stewart, even though in the two big rolls I've seen her in were sorrowful and downhearted rolls."
"Dory_Darko","6","1","3","22 February 2013"," Cool band deserved a better film.
","Back in the 70's, The Runaways was one of the first all-girl rock bands, initiated by then 16-year-old Joan Jett, who later went on to gain world fame with her band The Blackhearts. Now, I might be somewhat biased on this particular subject, because I am a huge fan of 70's (punk)rock, and especially female rock artists, but I am also a very critical film reviewer. The Runaways therefore, leaves me feeling in limbo.<br/><br/>I love musical biopics as much as I love the music itself, and since The Runaways falls exactly into my favourite genre of music, I thought this film would be nothing other than a win-win flick for me. However, I felt rather quickly discouraged from the build-up on. When you are telling a true-to-life story, I consider it an important issue to let the audience know who we're dealing with, what's going on and perhaps most importantly, why. These are real people and I want to know why they are who they are, and what motivated them to walk their chosen path in life. The film starts off with alternating scenes of Joan Jett and her soon to be band mate Cherie Currie. Doing stuff that, well... isn't that interesting. It doesn't tell us much about these girls except that they like punk rock and David Bowie. Honestly, having only seen the film last night, it's all I can remember about the first 15 minutes or so. And so the film continues.<br/><br/>They form a band, are taken under the wing of weirdo record producer/manager Kim Fowley, become famous and at some point, break up. The way director Floria Sigismondi tells the story, you'd think it was actually that easy. And this is exactly where the problem lies: bad direction. Possibly even worse editing and screenplay. We are given almost zero back-story of the lives of these young girls, and strangely, literally nothing at all about the personal life of Joan Jett. What makes it even stranger is the fact that the real Joan Jett was actually executive producer of this film, which completely puzzles me considering her part was so badly written. Her character comes across as not much more than a bystander in her own story.<br/><br/>At least we're offered snippets of information about Cherie Currie. We know that she comes from an instable family and that her sister (who is in fact her twin – something I had to learn from Wikipedia since it's never told in the film...) is the only one she is at least somewhat close to. Again though, strangely, what is never told here is that this girl was raped when she was 14 – an incident which strongly determined the person she would become later on. Very weird to leave out of a biopic.<br/><br/>It is my understanding that the rest of the band didn't give permission for their life story to be used in the film, and it shows. On the one hand, it's a shame because the back-story of the band is already so badly underexposed. On the other, I can't blame them, because this film would have done them no justice whatsoever.<br/><br/>The story of The Runaways is told as though it all happened overnight: formation, fame, break-up; in what feels like no more than a short year maybe. When in fact they released four albums, three of which with Cherie. Truly awful screenplay.<br/><br/>The actors though, are not at all to blame. Kristen Stewart embodies Joan Jett perfectly, she's got the looks, the voice (she sings all her parts herself) and the swagger. Dakota Fanning as Cherie does a very good job also. Although she may not look or sound that much like the real Cherie Currie, her acting more than makes up for it. But then again, anyone who's seen Dakota before, whether as a child actor or teenager, already knows she's a very convincing young actress. The rest of the band, much like their characters, are barely there to be noticed...<br/><br/>The part of Kim Fowley is played by Michael Shannon, and he approaches it with a ""love it or hate it"" attitude. Personally, I think he was an absolute scene-stealer (which is not necessarily a good thing, because obviously this film is not about him – though it is the direction that is to blame, not the actor), acting completely over the top, crude, and horribly inappropriate. Though I can see why some people absolutely hated his character. Simple: there is nothing likable about him. He's an a**hole, and a big one too. As an acting part however, it was obvious that Michael Shannon had a ball playing this guy, and I think that's what makes his role very enjoyable to watch.<br/><br/>The actors really do make up for a lot in The Runaways. All parts are equally well-played and very enjoyable. But when the technical aspects of a film are this poor, not even the best actors in the world can make it a success. Zero story, zero character development, shoddy editing and, worst of all, not enough music! Probably the stupidest thing about the whole film – you'd think that, in a film about The Runaways, there'd be more than two or three original Runaways songs! Yet we have to listen to ""Cherry Bomb"" over and over again, and we get only titbits of their other songs. Sheesh.<br/><br/>The Runaways may not have been the most groundbreaking band in history, but they certainly were a cool band of young rock chicks, and they deserved a better film than this one. I would say it's fun to watch once if you're into this kind of music, but that's it. Such a shame."
"moonspinner55","5","1","3","29 November 2011"," The Jailbait Chronicles...great attention to the visual detail, but the narrative drifts and then splinters
","Five teenage girls living in and around Hollywood in 1975 form a hard rock band which is fueled by sexual exploitation and driven to exhaustion by an adult manager with a talent for salacious promotion. Director-screenwriter Floria Sigismondi, working from Runaways vocalist Cherie Currie's autobiography ""Neon Angel"", does a fabulous job at recreating the look (and feel) of mid-'70s Los Angeles; from the stifling suburbs of the Valley to the street punks and dopers of the inner-city, Sigismondi's film has a visual pull and a gritty elegance that is, at once, immediate and nostalgic. Unfortunately, the time-line of events is a mess, with the band seemingly reaching international success (and finally imploding) in less than a year. The filmmakers are too concerned with getting to the cautionary aspects of this tale without giving us enough of the band's history. There was a lot of hard-hitting drama going on behind the formation and packaging of The Runaways (including distinct personality and musical differences between the real band members--Currie, Joan Jett, and Lita Ford among them), but this facile exploration of the group is mostly interested in headlines and druggy montages (which just eat up time on the clock). The costume design and art direction are spot on, and Sigismondi gets a lot of energy going in the film's early stages. However, when the band falls apart, the movie quickly follows suit. The narrative, choppy to begin with, skitters along to a wobbly conclusion; it is unsuccessful in building an emotional impact due to a basic failure in shaping and sharpening these characters. ** from ****"

","I have been a fan of The Runaways for a couple of years and was pretty intrigued by the idea of a biopic about them. I was excited to see the portrayal of young teenage girls getting thrown into the highly adult world of hard drugs, alcohol and sex.<br/><br/>I can honestly say that this movie didn't disappoint me. Stewart who plays female rocker Joan Jett was a treat. She gave a good performance as the rebellious and cool singer but I was never worried about her acting, I'd seen her in the movie Speak and knew she'd give it her all. She didn't let me down as I watched her raw and emotional performance. Dakota Fanning also was an excellent cast as Cherie Currie. She plays the innocent girl spiraling downward into the explosive world of rock n roll superbly. Stella Maeve is also another awesome cast choice. She is great to watch as Sandy West and I found myself smiling every time she was on screen. The last actor who made a profound impact on the film was Michael Shannon who plays eccentric band manager Kim Fowely. He is dynamite on the screen and I loved his sexist and harsh ways. Shannon dug deep and became a monstrous asshole. <br/><br/>The only thing I had difficulty liking was the haphazard progression of the film. I read Currie's ""Neon Angel"" and was expecting something a little more cohesive from the film. I don't know if Sigismondi was using it as a technique to further enhance the chaos of the band but it just annoyed me a little. As I said I like the movie. I enjoyed the grungy and hard examination of the 70's rock and roll world. The acting us great and so is the material. I love the music, always will, and found it faultless in the film. Fanning and Stewarts vocals are on key as is the awesome ability if the girls to play their instruments. <br/><br/>I recommend you watch it if you love music and enjoy a good trashy/grungy film about girls behaving badly. Trashy goodness."
"geoffgee","7","1","3","21 September 2010"," An excellent biopic with good music and interesting characters
","Today was the second time I've seen this film within a week. Prior to seeing it I knew nothing about the 70's girl band called The Runaways (indeed I was initially expecting a fiction about girls who run away). I thought it very interesting to watch how the girls of the band came together. Their transformation from naive but determined adolescent girls into hardened rock stars is depicted in a very watchable mix of the shocking, the touching and the everyday. The acting of all the main actors and actresses is of a high enough standard to make the characters totally credible. Considering their ages I am certainly impressed by the acting of the two main female roles. They also look very attractive - especially in the many close-up shots. The direction is for the most part unobtrusive apart from on two or three occasions (I won't say when) at which times I thought it was very effectively used. I'd say this is definitely a better than average movie which will justify more than one (if not several) viewings."

"MBunge","5","1","4","5 April 2012"," Okay but nothing special
","Though it's named after and supposedly about the groundbreaking all-girl rock band of the 1970s, a more accurate title and description of this film would be ""The Rise and Fall of Cherie Currie, guest starring Joan Jett and with a special appearance by Kim Fowley"". They just took the story Currie wrote in her book about her life, sandwiched in some stuff with Jett and let Michael Shannon tear the scenery apart with his bare teeth. If you wanted to look back through the decades and know who The Runaways were and why they were important, this movie will only give you a glimmer of a clue. Maybe they were so much of their moment that you can't really appreciate them if you weren't there at the time. The fact remains this motion picture doesn't tell you anything you can't see on any one of a hundred ""Behind the Music"" shows on VH-1.<br/><br/>With that, however, The Runaways is still a satisfactory little flick. Kristen Stewart is great, as always, and Michael Shannon is out the door, down the street, into your home and having sex with your mother as The Runaways' almost Nietzchian record producer. Dakota Fanning is reel purty but isn't asked to do much besides glower or look forlorn. The musical sequences are quite good and there are a couple of moments when writer/director Floria Sigismondi does an excellent job visually projecting what it's like to be inside the cyclone of sex, drugs and rock 'n roll. The movie also touches on the sexism the group had to endure and combat, but only in the most clichéd and hackneyed of ways. As rock bio-pics go, there sure have been a lot worse than this.<br/><br/>What keeps it from being any better is that Cherie Currie's story dominates the movie and it simply isn't that interesting. She's a 15 year old with looks and attitude who got plucked from obscurity to be the band's lead singer, couldn't handle the hard life of being a rock star and crashed back to reality. Joan Jett's tale of ambition and determination takes a decided back seat and the other members of The Runaways can be entirely described as ""the jealous one"", ""the lesbian one"" and ""the one who barely has any lines and might as well be a mic stand"". The best parts are when Shannon's Kim Fowley is completely blunt and ruthless in the molding of these girls young enough to be his daughters into icons of rock, but that largely disappears for the 2nd half of the film. The most intriguing part is how Cherie's older sister Marie (Riley Keough) transforms herself into a mirror image of her little sis. That image suggests so much but none of it is ever explored.<br/><br/>If every member of the band had been given a fair share of the narrative and it had focused more on the struggles between The Runaways and Fowley and between them and the rest of the world, I can't help but think that would have been a much more compelling story. Especially because the look of the movie is outstanding in how it captures the zeitgeist of the 1970s. I'm not sure any character's appearance has better symbolized that era of cultural decadence and stylistic chaos than Fowley's.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of this group, this genre or this time period, you'll probably enjoy The Runaways. Nobody else needs to rush out and watch it, but there's no reason anyone shouldn't give it a look."

","I love Joan Jett, I had the Runaways bootleg live album, one of the first albums I ever bought, back in the days of Vinyl and real rock and roll. While the Runaways birthed Joan Jett and The Blackhearts this movie doesn't really touch on that until the last 30 seconds of the movie and of course, that's the most interesting part of the story. This movie would have been better if they got rid of the fat chick from Arrested Development, who had no place in the movie at all. There's so many amazing stories from being on the road, but this movie is flat, and boring, and confusingly, about a bunch of underage chicks on the road in a rock band.. I mean.. come ON. This script is tame, and as such retarded since it doesn't emphasize the most interesting thing about the Runaways, Joan Jett, or Lita Ford for crissakes! Don't do a movie about rock and roll if you don't have the balls to show the scenes of what it's all about. I will say the casting for Lita and Joan Jett was pretty darn good and OK for Cherry."
"Polaris_DiB","7","1","4","10 September 2010"," The popularized aesthetic of the middle finger
","Initially, this movie seems like the type of joke people paste on message boards called ""What's the worst idea for a movie ever?"" ""How about a movie about The Runaways featuring the chick from Twilight as Joan Jett and that one little girl from How the Grinch Stole Christmas as Cherie Currie?"" Hahahaha--oh.<br/><br/>However, let's consider a few things first. One, I hear down the grapevine that Kristen Stewart takes Twilight about as seriously as the guys who made Vampires Suck. However, it's a job that provides her exposure and money. Secondly, with Hound Dog, Dakota Fanning pretty much announced that she intends to be a serious actor and not next year's forgotten childhood star television special. This movie makes a bad marketing decision by playing out of typecast, but the stars make a good marketing decision by playing out of typecast. This makes the relative success or lack thereof of this movie at least somewhat interesting. Here is an opportunity for these two actresses to break out of type.<br/><br/>But back to step one. We're talking about a movie about The Runaways. People who want to see movies about The Runaways want punks, rebellion, and disestablishment. However, this is obviously a commercial film. Those who want to see a nice movie featuring the innocent Bella Swan or cute-as-button blond girl from yesterday don't want punks, rebellion, and disestablishment. So the movie is kind of set up for failure before it even starts.<br/><br/>Okay, so, that said.... how is it? To be perfectly honest, it's pretty charming. Stewart and Fanning get to strut, lurch, scowl, and slouch their way through that world of popular youth angst that, ironic as those subcultures really are, at least are refreshingly angry and passionate in light of that new form of commercialized teen depression, emo. It features sex, drugs, and rock and roll without editing or shying away from any of those three concepts (especially incredible considering the leads' ages). And the movie is a straight-up old school underdog story that gives every fourteen year old sneaking into a club hope that they'll get discovered by a record producer just because of the devil-may-care 'tude on their faces and tee-shirts. It is everything romantic about the rocker aesthetic, where even the negative things such as drug abuse and band conflict is part and parcel of Musician's American Dream.<br/><br/>Thing being, of course, that it's no Almost Famous. This is all familiar territory, the rise to fame, the fall from grace, psychedelic breakdowns leading into junky rock soundtracks as the hospital scenes start stacking up and the stars stop having so much fun scene to scene. What it does have is a lipsticked Michael Shannon having fun as producer Kim Fowley, Fanning in Lolita chic, girls helping girls figure out how to get off, and yes, cinematography with wide angle lenses, hand-held moments, slow motion, saturated colors, club lights reflected off rain on taxi windows, everything set to rhythmic rumblings of electric guitar--you know, rock and roll. Yeah alright: underneath all the streaking eyeliner and angry expressions is something arguably quite vapid; but then again, that's kinda what rock and roll is, full dedication to acting out and getting fame and admiration for it.<br/><br/>It is, in the end, a well-produced and delivered form of the genre, and audiences' enjoyment of it will probably be directly correlated to their interest in the concept. For me, more than anything, I saw it purely out of curiosity to see where Fanning and Stewart are going. From what I saw, somewhere good, even if it is set up for too-cool-for-their-own-old-school hipsters to hate it on principle.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

Anyways they are trying to make it as a band during a time when girls was looked down upon for doing those things, such as rock n roll.

The performances of the main ""The Runaways"" were well done but that is the only positive thing I can think of in this film. Yeah it shows some of the characters like Joan Jett and Cherie Currie going through tough times, but didn't really care for it or had my sympathy.

"TxMike","Null","1","6","29 August 2010"," Pretty good movie of the story of the 1970s girl Rock and Roll band, The Runaways.
","The two main members of the 1970s Rock Band, The Runaways, were Cherie Curry as the lead singer and Joan Jett, the band's catalyst and guitar player. This movie is based on Curry's book, and one of the producers is Jett. From that I believe it is safe to assume the movie is very faithful to what really happened all those years ago.<br/><br/>When Rock and Roll hit its stride all the bands were guys. It was a rough music, not something for dainty girls. But Joan Jett as a teenager was not interested in what most girls were interested in. She bought a black motorcycle jacket, the kind that tough guys wore.<br/><br/>Kim Fowley, a guy, already had established some credentials as a producer and Jett got his attention at an event. He was intrigued by the idea that an all-girl group might be America's answer to the British invasion. He introduced her to a girl drummer, told them to work something up, and in a teen nightspot found Currie, told her she would become their singer because she had the 'look', even though she was not yet a singer.<br/><br/>When you take all that for what it is on the surface, there was no reason why this motley group of girls should have ever gotten farther than the garage, but Fowley, as eccentric as he appears to be, somehow had a vision, he drove the girls to look and sound like a rock band, and in a funny scene had neighborhood kids throw things at them, empty cans, paper junk, even dried dog turds, to teach them how to play under adverse conditions and to defend themselves.<br/><br/>The girls were teenagers. Currie was only 15. They didn't have much in the way of home lives, and they basically became ""runaways."" The movie is hard to watch at times, filled with profanity and drug use. But it gives a glimpse into that life and what it took to form a successful girls R&R band.<br/><br/>All the actors are good. Kristen Stewart as Joan Jett. Dakota Fanning (who really was 15) as Cherie Currie. And Michael Shannon in an inspired performance as Kim Fowley."

","""The Runaways,"" a biopic of the titular teenage girl rock band, may not be a particularly revelatory or substantial film, but, c'mon, neither is the music; it is, however, constructed in such a way that I think better mimics the flow and style of popular music than in other such tuneful biographies. It's a rousing good picture and sound to view and listen to throughout. Doubtless, it helps if you like the music, but the cinematography and montage is as saliently hectic and roaring--even sensitive subject matter such as sexualizing minors, taking financial advantage of them, or drug abuse aren't dawdled upon for melodramatic points. You know, sex, drugs and rock and roll. I'll take this over, say, the more recent ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" (2018) or ""Rocketman"" (2019), with their pretensions to something more.<br/><br/>Dakota Fanning and Kristen Stewart do well in the leads, too, and Michael Shannon is again entertaining in a role that calls for some showy acting. I've never yet seen any of the ""Twilight"" movies in their entirety, and I'll probably be OK if I never do, but I've been impressed with the work of some of the series' actors in other movies. I recently saw future-Batman Robert Pattinson in ""The Lighthouse"" (2019), and besides playing cool here, Stewart has earned acclaim elsewhere, including for ""Clouds of Sils Maria"" (2014). I haven't seen as much of Fanning, but I liked ""Coraline"" (2009) and ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019). I suppose my point is that it's nice to see youths, like Joan Jett and other members of the Runaways, succeed in showbiz beyond the initial kiddie craze that launched them to stardom."

","Spoilers as this gives my interpretation of some aspects of the story. Can spoil things, maybe, maybe not. <br/><br/>Getting to know this disk better allows me to notice the music more and more so I am rather glad that I purchased the Blu-ray, even though the price had not dropped to My Price at that time. <br/><br/>The story starts a few years before the story of Detroit Rock City (1999), which includes a memorable Runaways song in the scene where three guys go a.w.o.l. from their school. School Days, written by Kim Fowley and Joan Jett. A blatant aspect of Detroit Rock City is the violence and this does include interesting hidden comments on that. Kim as the manager of both The Runaways and KISS. <br/><br/>* <br/><br/>The band was a bunch of new musicians and the story shows something positive here, but sick too. A well worn phrase that rock musicians grow up fast on the road takes on a bitter edge. <br/><br/>Their main on-stage front guy as Cherie and the story shows her to have some fairly commonplace teen problems and weaknesses that really need effective help if the individual is to be able to stand on their own feet in an okay way. Myself, I was a non-starter in that. Cherie faced a lot more years of trouble than one would really hope would be needed. Indicators are that things have not improved since then. Compare the book and film versions of Girl, Interrupted or Harry Potter. Cherie got what Rowling's works got. <br/><br/>Meantime, manager Kim having grown up versions, teen stuff escalated, of a male thing that Detroit Rock City suggests might have been commonplace in the USA of that time. Indicators are that things have not improved since then. <br/><br/>This screen story is scripted in a way that highlights and underlines how Kim affected Cherie. Those who have followed these people for a long time will know a lot of additional detail, but background notes on the disk show that real historic situations were rewritten and sharpened in order to show more clearly how Cherie was damaged by this. <br/><br/>Kim as the power hungry bad guy who was so obviously bad, in some ways. Me, I need to add a mental footnote that he was a victim too. This story is a neat illustration of how those perceived to be flawed can get crucified. Cherie, but also Kim. And the modern world moves on. Scary, scary night? <br/><br/>Dakota – Cherie sometimes shows real beauty, but typically this beauty is only at the groin, another toy of Dr Frankenstein. It is less obvious that Kim is also a doll. I first noticed this feature via a magasine photo of Dakota and Kristen, Dakota in an amazingly attractive frock and I knew that I needed to see this feature just because of that frock. That frock is not in this feature, just a beautiful groin tacked onto a wreck. <br/><br/>* <br/><br/>Drafting this I re-watched The Big Country (1958) and it feels to have a relevance, even though any parallels are lop-sided. <br/><br/>I am also reminded of High Noon (1952), but that is the chainsaw side rather than how I understand the wider picture. The chainsaw is quality. <br/><br/>I am also reminded of Skins season 5 episode 5, Nick. Cherie had some massively damaging experiences and the feature shows her trying to face them honestly. She is not running away from key issues. <br/><br/>* <br/><br/>As this feature really did allow me to like their music I followed through by purchasing two dvds and two music compilation sets. <br/><br/>My big mistake was purchasing Edgeplay, a documentary made by their last ever bass guitar player. Joan chose to not be involved with this and she blocked access to Runaways music that she had written. I found that Edgeplay did include a lot of additional historic detail, a mix of real and maybe real anecdotes, but that it worked to stop me liking their music. The Runaways feature showed a mess but allowed me to really like the music side, this worked to knock that out, what it does show is a much greater mess. Television clips from Japan are included, but these do not compare well with the scripted on stage parts in the feature. Some people like Edgeplay, me no. <br/><br/>The second DVD was Joan Jett Live, from the same period as Edgeplay. Watch that alone I would have loved the music and considered Joan to have grown through a lot of different visual styles. <br/><br/>The CD compilations were Joan Jett And The Blackhearts Greatest Hits and The Runaways Mercury Albums Anthology. Before I saw Edgeplay I found these to be just what I hoped from the feature. Anthology includes several pics, mostly of messed up female musicians but including the cover pics of the albums, too. Anthology also has all of the tracks except for some of the Live In Japan tracks. Many are written by Jett and Fowley."

","What bothers me with young Hollywood is that every young girl must do an edgy, sexy movie when they are in their teens to prove they are no longer kids. This is the classic situation in regards to casting Dakota Fanning as Cherie Currie. She wasn't sexy, wasn't charismatic and wasn't' believable. <br/><br/>My friends and I sometimes even laughed at her performance. It seemed like a little girl trying to be a big girl. <br/><br/>The Twilight series is beyond terrible for me and I'm not a Kristen Stewart fan, but her performance was electric. She was spot on and even her mannerisms of Joan Jett were amazing. In some parts it was hard to distinguish her from Joan. She's kind of the tomboy type in itself but she showed a lot in this performance. <br/><br/>I've read a lot about Kim Fowley from friends that knew him and he was eclectic, strange, and very flamboyant. Michael Shannon was great in the role and really brought a fine element to the film showing how crazy and insane it can be when you are an overnight sensation. It also showed how many groups made a killing in Japan even if they didn't' make super stardom in the U.S. <br/><br/>I'm not a huge Runaways fan but I remember them and Cherie Currie. She was sexual, fun and wild and every rocker bad boy wanted her. Joan Jett was edgy, determined and passionate about her music and that's why she was the most successful of the group. This movie shows their struggles personally, sexually, and professionally, and how hard it was to grow up while trying to be rock stars. <br/><br/>The movie was OK but they really needed someone better to play Cherie. Dakota did the best she could be just wasn't' believable."

So you think with that pedigree it would rock. And at first this movie did, but then it just got sort of boring (even with the drug abuse) toward the middle of the movie and just stayed that way, flat. The acting is pretty good, and the casting of Michael Shannon as Kim Fowley was perfect. If you want to get a sense of the real Kim Fowley watch a good documentary called ""Mayor of the Sunset Strip"" about Rodney Bingenheimer, who played a role in the runaways career as well. Some might find this movie awesome, and I would not discourage someone from watching it and forming their own opinion, but when I hit pause to go do the dishes when there is a f'd up Dakota Fanning in lingerie in front of me you know there has to be something missing. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/"

","Edie Sedgwick does Tarantino in this grimy tale of androgynous, pixie, she-beasts. It's angry, loud, and rude...but with a Warhol-esque indifference to higher purpose, and laissez faires sense of humor. <br/><br/>As far as quality goes, Dakota Fanning is priceless in a campy, charmingly self-indulgent performance. I do not subscribe to todays trendy loathing of Kristen Stuart, but must admit her Joan Jett is not very dynamic. She looks right in the hair and makeup, but her impersonation seems forced. Fanning steels the show, helped along by an enthusiastic Kim Fowley as portrayed by Michael Shannon. The film also has a great sense of era and atmosphere.<br/><br/>But if you're trying to find a good movie in this, you're missing the point. It's an enjoyably bad movie, about enjoyably bad music: a gloriously heinous tribute to lowbrow glam, and an unabashedly vulgar study of D-list celebrity...a sort of half-a$$ed, suburban parody of Valley of the Dolls. Lovers of the awful, the depraved, and awesomely-bad style will enjoy a noncommittal, good-humored dabbling in this raw gem."

","Kristen Stewart's impersonation of Joan Jett was absolutely remarkable. Dakota Fanning does a fine job also. I wasn't a fan of Joan Jetts or the Runnaways, because I thought they were too mannish and raunchy. I was aware that the movie very well could be, as well, and I was right. Sometimes good movie-making depends on being able to omit/edit things to make way for a wider audience, as well as not to offend them with unnecessary B.S. - Then on the other hand, sometimes good movie-making depends on being able to show the truth and grittiness of situations. In this movie I felt there were things that could very successfully have been omitted, without loosing any of the gritty truth. They also didn't delve into the band's other members, which I can't help but believe that there were many fans of this group who were disappointed not to have seen more of their characters involvement in the film."
"vampyrecowboy","6","0","4","24 September 2010"," As a fan of Joan Jett...
","Well, I finally watched this and it was OK...but once again, Hollywood has to take control and bastardize something that could have been better.<br/><br/>Joan Jett is awesome as a singer...and she should have made sure that when Kristen sung her songs, she really belted them out.<br/><br/>As the 2 girls who portrayed Joan and Cherie, they missed a lot.<br/><br/>They didn't have the energy...<br/><br/>Joan Jett really belts out and really gives a wild and raw performance - even 20 something years later.<br/><br/>The story seemed to drag and there was not enough anger or anguish to make it really interesting...not entirely bad, it just didn't have the sparkle and raw energy that I was expecting.<br/><br/>Dakota and Kirsten did a remarkable job on looking like them but failed on the singing and playing in my opinion - as I have all the music and think that they were one of the best female singers to ever come out...Shania Twain, Pat Benatar, Belinda Carlisle and Alannah Myles aside.<br/><br/>They have such grit and sexual energy which didn't emit on screen and much of the story should have lasted longer.<br/><br/>I felt shortchanged on a movie I was really looking forward to see."
"gavin6942","6","0","2","16 August 2010"," Enjoyable, But Not as Great As Expected
","This film is something of a biopic, following the band the Runaways from its inception to its disbanding. In particular, the focus is on Cherrie Currie and Joan Jett, leaving the other members -- notably Lita Ford -- as mere background footage.<br/><br/>I liked ""Runaways"", but it's really not all that great. If you don't already have a solid understanding of who Joan Jett, Cherrie Currie and Lita Ford are, it didn't really explain things. It was also lopsided in that it focused on Joan despite being based on the book about Cherrie, and Kristen Stewart made very little attempt to go outside her ""safe"" range of acting. In other words, it was like watching Stewart, not Jett.<br/><br/>Dakota Fanning is capable of amazingly innocent or not-so-innocent roles, but despite this film being based on Currie's biography, her character comes off as the minor one to Joan Jett. Granted, as Jett today is the bigger star, this makes sense... but then the focus was disjointed. Fanning was able to be a dirty glam-loving rebel, so it is too bad her part was played down.<br/><br/>Beyond that, as I said, the focus was disjointed and you had to know the story going into it. Nothing was expressed too explicitly, so when the band rises and falls, and meets up with various problems, it seems that none of them are fully explored. One solution would be to add twenty or thirty minutes on to the movie, but this would do little to save it if that filler was just more of Kristen Stewart."
"TheGOLDENWALRUS","6","0","3","7 August 2010"," better than expected - Kristen Stewart was good
","Sure the Runaways were the first all female rock group and made it a huge for such a short time but their music never impressed me. Patti Smith is still way more punk rock than all the members combined (even at 60 plus years old). This movie wasn't so much about the music or their attitude but about growing up and maturity.<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart probably secretly can't wait to be done with her type-casted twilight days and show her real talent than the vampire soap opera. She was great in Into the Wild and Adventureland but I believe her performance in The Runaways has been her best to date. She portrayed Joan Jett's attitude very well (even cut her hair to look like her) and sounded very much like Jett's voice.<br/><br/>Dakota Fanning on the other hand . . . not so much. She bored me. She seemed to try to hard. Fanning at age ten acted like a thirty year old so I feel her ego got in the way of this movie. That and she was so miscasted to begin with. It's a shame they couldn't get Evan Rachel Wood. Her part required lots of range and all we got was her half blank look and a voice that never even sounded like Cherie Currie.<br/><br/>The movie is short. Without credits at about 96 minutes. I liked the way it ended. It left me wanting more but not in a bad way. My biggest complaint was the lack story with the other three members. The big message I got out of the movie was Jett wanted everyone to be equal in the band. The lead singer shouldn't be the only member everyone remembers but all we got out of Sandy West was she's was very sweet? Lita Ford seemed like a bully while Robin never really said a word except for maybe a ""yeah"" a couple of times (which is a shame because I like Alia Shawkat). The whole movie was 95 percent Currie and Jett. In fact, at the end we find out what happen to only them and the producer.<br/><br/>Michael Shannon was a pretty good playing the crazed and perhaps controlling producer Kim Fowley. Though his performance was over the top at most parts, it was probably written that way. Shannon is a very skilled actor (watch Revolutionary Road).<br/><br/>In short, The Runaways won't stick in your mind by the end of the week but it does get a thumbs up from me and turned out to be a much better movie than I expected. I didn't expect really anything.<br/><br/>*** / *****"

","A girl Rock and Roll band is formed in the 1970s and we see their rise and fall. This is based upon a true story. <br/><br/>Since I was overseas during the 1970s I had no idea who these girls were as I never heard of them and apparently their music never made it out of the U.S. except to Japan. But, I have heard favorable things about the group. So onwardOh, one more thing. I did hear this group paved the way for other girl bands, but I cannot think of one girl band – ever - at this moment, and I don't think a few more moments would help. Well, there is BOND, but they all do violins. Very good btw. Anyway, onward<br/><br/>Kristen Stewart as Joan Jett actually showed emotions in the movie and was very good. Dakota Fanning was terrific, but I got the feeling her heart really wasn't in it. Of course, that also sums up the character of Cheri Currie she played, but I still had that feeling. Twice I saw her eyes go to the director of this as the director must have yelled ""Cut."" The Editor wasn't on his toes if I am correct about that. This is not her type of movie, but she does have range. No doubt about that. But, most impressive was, without a doubt, Michael Shannon as Kim Fowley their producer, and Rock and Roll star-maker so to speak. He is such a presence that if he had more screen time, it would have been his show. <br/><br/>Production-wise sometimes it was like watching a movie thru a Kaleidoscope and this made everything incomplete. Too many scenes were in the dark. There is a lot of language, and sexual content and the ever-present drug use/abuse. But, overall, I maintain we really didn't get to know Joan Jett or Cheri Currie and, after all, it was their story or so I thought. They were pulled along by Kim Fowley and everything was non-stop at breakneck speed. Maybe that was the point. <br/><br/>Was somewhat disappointed in the songs as I don't think we were given a proper sampling of all the Runaways did. When the credits ran at the end, I heard a song I thought should have been within the movie. It was very good. And, it may have been sung by the real Runaways.<br/><br/>And, it would have been nice if there was a scene whereby they discussed what the name of the band should be. Yes, we got the idea from the little up close and personals we did see, but, sometimes a little trivia is a good thing. There were at least three other girl band members but they were not featured in here. It was mostly Jett and Currie. <br/><br/>The credits at the end said Joan Jett was a producer of this movie and that it was based upon a book by Cheri Currie. Jett still performs, but Currie is a chainsaw artist some place in California. Read into all that what you will. And, Kim Fowley sporting green hair walks with a cane along Sunset Strip. <br/><br/>Violence: No. Sex: Yes. Nudity: No, bare behinds from time to time. Sexual content: Yes. Language: Yes."

","THE RUNAWAYS – CATCH IT ( B ) An Erotic movie on The Runaways band, it looked like Autobiography, which is kind of good and bad too. At one point it's too much of Darkness, and watching Dakota Fanning doing drugs and Sex is Disturbing. Overall Good attempt. Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning were the stars of the movie, acted really well and looked like Cherry Curry and Joan jett. Amazing. Give it a shoot it's not the usual Hollywood movie it's darker and Rock N Roll! if anyone is interested in the documentary about Olden Teenage Rock and Roll its for them. though I really would have loved if the story was bit more sharper!"

","The Runaways<br/><br/>If you ask me, The Runaways sound like the kind of band that one would go see with a pimp who is looking to replenish his underage prostitute coffers.<br/><br/>And while the members of this rock n' rebellious girl group aren't hookers, they do have to swallow plenty of cockamamie ideas in order to succeed in the male dominated music industry.<br/><br/>Formed by eccentric record producer Kim Fowley (Michael Shannon) in 1975, The Runaways are comprised of 5, 16-year-old female musicians clad in leather and lace. With the precocious Cherie Currie (Dakota Fanning) on vocals and the ill-reputed Joan Jett (Kristen Stewart) on rhythm guitar, the group garners a huge fan base. Unfortunately, the road takes its toll on the inexperienced girls and they lose themselves to drugs, drink and ego, ultimately tearing the band apart.<br/><br/>Based on Curry's memoir, The Runaways is a satisfactory biopic of a band that spawned more successful solo careers than 1# songs, however, while it has its merits, i.e. visceral visuals and sleazy soundtrack, it's just not that tragic of a band biography.<br/><br/>Besides, everyone knows the most shocking disintegration of any musical collaboration is, and always will be, the breakup of a one-man-band.

"CAMACHO-4","6","0","7","19 June 2010"," The Runaways- A very well directed, well written film.
","I'm a big fan of Joan Jett and her hit singles Bad Reputation and I love Rock n Roll. I do have to admit I had no idea that she was in a band called the runaways early on on in her career. When I first began researching the origin of the group I became fascinated who the idea of a big screen movie based of the band's story.<br/><br/>The Runaways got my attention because it was about one of the first all girl rock band's assembled. Dakota Fanning plays the band's lead singer, Dakota is always good but I have to say that in this film she was overshadowed by actress Kristen Stewart who plays Joan Jett. When I heard that Kristen Stewart would be playing Joan I was very disappointed, we have to admit that she's not one of best new actresses we have, but in this film she definitely proved me wrong.<br/><br/>Overall, Runaways is a good film with a little bit of The Doors mixed in with a teen movie all rolled into one."
"johnmeagher","7","0","7","16 June 2010"," Good rock and roll movie full of tit's clichés
","The Runaways is a mediocre biopic full of melodramatic acting, over used clichés, and Glaring historical inaccuracies. <br/><br/>Fortunately the subject matter was more than enough to keep me interested the entire movie. I had heard a few Runaways songs before but seeing this sparked my interest in the band quite a bit. <br/><br/>As a rock and Roll film it holds up pretty well, but if you don't like The Runaways or Rock and Roll in general don't waste your time. It's a second rate film with a first rate soundtrack, and plenty of tits, drugs, and lesbian sex. <br/><br/>A solid 7<br/><br/>I'm planning to watch Edgeplay: A Film About the Runaways in hopes of getting a more accurate description of what went on."
