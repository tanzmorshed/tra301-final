","I saw this movie on a fluke.I was standing on 42nd street waiting for a bus to go home and a sister started passing out free tickets for a preview of this movie.I gave it a chance not expecting much.The promotional movie posters I've seen on the subway station walls do not give this film justice at all.<br/><br/>The movie is about a young rocker who goes on a journey to learn the craft and art of heavy metal.I'll leave it there.The movie is a heavy comedy and lot's of fun.If your are old enough to remember when Heavy Metal dominated the music scene in the eighties you are going to love this film.Jack Black is an amazingly talented comedian and actor and assuming he really wrote and performed the songs in this film he is also a talented musician.<br/><br/>Tenacious D is definitely worth a look!"
"9sam1","10","38","47","23 November 2006"," Greatest movie ever made
","Probably the best comedy in a long time. keeps you laughing nonstop! the acting is good and there are a lot of hilarious cameos such as Ben stiller as the guitar store guy. The plot wasn't as good as i had hoped but the comedy makes up for that. I can only hope for a sequel cause it seems like they can still do so much more. Even though it was 1 hour and 40 minutes long i still wanted more at the end :) also there is a scene after the credits which is actually one of my favorite parts of the movie!! I suggest this to anyone who loves a good comedy and Definitely suggest it to fans of The D or Jack Black. You should buy the album also, the songs are so damn catchy and hilarious, the music on it is Top Notch as well."

","Just saw it at as closing film of Austin Film Festival. Going in, a had seen a few snippets of their act at Alamo Drafthouse, and thought the trailer was amusing but I wasn't expecting such an epic theme music and the use of tarot cards is genius in the title sequence. Watch out for cameos from Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins, and the dark lord himself (who has a fetish for KG). So much over-the-top fun and the songs are so catchy. The car chase was by far my favorite scene. I know this will earn cult status right away and win over some new Tenacious D fans, just like me. I hope this does well in the theaters.

"hinfinityl","10","165","236","9 November 2006"," Takes The D To The Next Level And Succeeds (It Will Rock Your Socks Off)!!!
","I saw The D's new film tonight at a special advance screening, and I was so blown away by its sheer greatness that I felt I had to come onto IMDb and get the word out. Admittedly, I was already a huge fan of the D's work - I loved the HBO series and listen to their music weekly (there's nothing better to sing along to), but this appreciation actually made me more apprehensive going into to tonight's screening (for we've all been disappointed one time or another by something we love when it attempted to make the jump to the big screen). With Tenacious D's ""The Pick of Destiny,"" this is not the case.<br/><br/>Simply put, this film rocks harder than anything I've seen and is funnier and more majestic than anything Peter Jackson, Pixar, and Will Ferrell together could produce. It tells the story of the D before we came to know them, setting up intriguing histories of Kage and Jables' upbringings, their comings together, and how they were inspired to write songs about such things as Lee, Sasquatch, and Dio. Most importantly, they reveal the true inspiration to the Greatest Song In The World, ""Tribute,"" and how it came to be (which is different than the HBO Series' version). After you've witnessed it you probably won't be able to remember it (hence the Tribute), but your mind forever be changes by its genius.<br/><br/>I don't go out to movies very often anymore due to the high ticket price and the hassle of getting parking, paying outrageous concession prices, etc., but I usually make exceptions when it's starring someone I really love or concerning something of the the same variety. ""The Pick of Destiny"" was so good that I have no qualms going back to see it again when it releases nationwide, and I plan on convincing all of my friends to go, too. Last week we saw ""Borat"" and loved it, but this is honest to goodness TEN TIMES BETTER. For anyone who truly loves rock music and comedic brilliance, see this film. These guys' talent is so great you should have no hesitation supporting their cause. You will not be disappointed, and the Rock Lords will smile upon you favorably."
"greatfox-1","10","121","177","7 November 2006"," Tenacious D preview
","I was able to see a preview of this movie through UCLA's pre-screening program, and let me tell you: THIS MOVIE IS UNBELIEVABLY GOOD!!!! I have seen many movies, but few have made me laugh so sincerely or talk about the movie afterward as much as this one. I had a decent respect for Tenacious D before seeing the movie, and now I am MAD about them. I will most definitely buy their album when it is released on the 14th and will see this movie again.<br/><br/>If you were on the fence about seeing this movie, GET OFF AND GO SEE IT!! It is worth the extremely expensive price of movie tickets these days, as you will surely bust a nut laughing during the whole thing.<br/><br/>Aside from the comedy, the glorious and divine music that flows from KG's guitar and JB's voice is awe inspiring. The audience is left in a stupor that such beautiful harmonies and amazing riffs can be created in conjunction with such ridiculous (and hilarious) lyrics. If for nothing other than the music itself, this movie is worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>With a wonderfully coherent storyline tying in almost all aspects of the traditional ""D"" history and hallmarks, great new songs, hilarious comedy, and some pretty awesome cameos, this movie ranks up there with the best! Go see it!!"

From beginning to end, the movie is packed with fun, laughs, music, enjoyable rock music, hot chicks, more music, action, drama, and the f-bomb.<br/><br/>Although some scenes are entirely bizarre and unfitting, they were fun to watch and enjoyable. All in all this movie left you feeling great and happy. Especially those that love rock music.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is great, the laughs are plentiful, and the storyline is simple, entertaining, yet complex.

","I managed to see the MTV premiere of this movie last night and I needed to tell everyone that this movie brought the thunder. Obviously this movie will be most enjoyed by fans of the D as it has plenty of in-jokes for those that have seen the HBO series and has more than enough D for newer fans and the mass of soon-to-be converts. The music really shines with the new songs ""Kickapoo"" (which is much better than it sounds), ""Master Exploder"" (possibly the 3rd best song in the world) and ""Dude (I totally miss you)"". There are a load of excellent scenes (the car chase, the rock-off, the meeting) and cameos (including Dave Grohl as Satan!). I really could go on for hours but I don't want to give the movie away. Go see it. You won't be disappointed."
"redsoxmb545-1","10","76","127","24 November 2006"," Tenacious D: In The Greatest Motion Picture of All Time
","Tenacious D: in The Pick of Destiny tells the fictional tale of the formation of the band Tenacious D and their quest to find the Pick of Destiny, a guitar pick with supernatural powers made from the tooth of Satan himself (played by Dave Grohl). JB (Jack Black) and KG (Kyle Gass), joined together by fate, must travel to the Rock N' Roll Museum and steal the Pick of Destiny to become the greatest band on earth. The movie is hilarious and delivers non-stop laughs. Jack Black and Kyle Gass work perfectly together, having been real life friends and co-workers for over 20 years. The film is in part, a musical. All (or most) of the music was written and performed by The D. All of the songs are new material and many of them are classic. The soundtrack is definitely worth checking out. This film will be mostly appreciated by fans of Tenacious D, but if you are not a fan of The D, I still think you will enjoy the movie. If you are a fan of the D, then you must see this movie. The acting isn't as bad as you may think, and the laughs and crudeness never stop coming. I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking to get their socks rocked off and laugh as hard as they have laughed in a long time. Look out for cameos by Dave Grohl, Ronnie James Dio, Meatloaf, Ben Stiller, Amy Poehler, Tim Robbins, John C. Reilly, and Neil Hamburger. Also, stay tuned for an extra scene after the credits."
"berky11","10","69","127","25 November 2006"," Best Movie Ever
","I am a HUGE Tenacious D fan, and I think this is not the funniest movie in the world, but the most entertaining. It's not laugh-a-minute but that's not what the D intended it to be. I went into the movie seeing all the HBO shows, memorized both albums, and that made it even more enjoyable. Plenty of inside jokes from past Tenacious D albums, and HBO shows. Since I knew the new album already, I knew 40 minutes of the movie because it is a musical comedy. I would say it has the best first 5 minutes of any movie and the best last 5 minutes of any movie. Hands Down.<br/><br/>See This Movie Now!"
"happy_skull","10","23","43","8 November 2006"," Rather brief review
","This movie is very silly and very funny. You can't ever criticize it for taking itself seriously. If you've heard their previous album or seen their HBO videos from the album, you can imagine the extremely foul-mouthed, rocking good time that is this movie which tells the fable of how the group Tenacious D came to be formed.<br/><br/>Full of cameos, it not only gives a fictional account of Tenacious D but is a send-up of musical history as well. The humor reminds one of Something About Mary in that they often ""go places you'd thought they wouldn't,"" but it lacks the scatological humor of South Park. This movie contains no nudity, except for mooning."
"your-favourite-accident","10","4","5","2 December 2006"," It will rock your socks off!
","I absolutely loved every minute of this film. Jack Black and Kyle Gass most definitely brought the thunder in this epic tale of friendship, hard rocking and destiny.<br/><br/>Filled to the brim with unnecessary swearing in every sentence, toilet humour and the general rule breaking attitude, this movie is a must see for the hard core tenacious D fans of the world.<br/><br/>We follow the journey of young Jables (Jack black) and Kage (Kyle Gass) as they try and recover the pick of destiny, to win the open-Mic night, and to become the greatest band on the planet. The duo have to overcome obstacles such as a room full of lasers, a man with one leg and the devil to accomplish their task. I'll let you see whether they make it or not.<br/><br/>The soundtrack itself is awesome enough, and now we see the D in person, making the experience even more magical. A must see for anyone who calls themselves a tenacious D fan. Watch out for the inside jokes from the first album!"
"pyrocitor","7","5","7","25 July 2007"," Love it or hate it, Black and Gass return to what they do best
","Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny <br/><br/>The concept of writing a film review for the Tenacious D movie may seem slightly unnecessary, as just about anyone upon hearing about the film most likely already had a sense of whether or not it would interest them. Fans of the duo's rock-comedy album and cult classic television show, or the incessantly energetic Jack Black will have jumped at the prospect of an hour and a half of unfiltered Tenacious D madness, and those who generally would not gravitate towards such forms of entertainment will have already uttered a groan, and discounted any possibility of seeing the film. And while the film will prove highly entertaining for those who would normally take to this sort of thing, it falls short of being strong enough to win any fans outside of its existing demographic - those who were fans of Tenacious D already will be satisfied, but those previously unimpressed are unlikely to change their opinions very drastically after experiencing the film equivalent. <br/><br/>Director Liam Lynch seems for the most part content to sit back with a camera rolling, leaving Black and Gass free to do what they do best - namely pull the infectiously energetic and likable slacker rocker schtick which exposed them to the public eye in the first place. What is unfortunate is the consistent feeling that the material feels too watered down to really excel as a film and reach the full comedic potential the premise originally boasted. While the occasional comedic gem may float along, for the most part it feels like these occasional high points are too inundated in mediocre sequences to be truly memorable. It's hard to pinpoint exactly where the problem lies; in terms of content the film plays upon the same themes and plot points which made Tenacious D so crudely enjoyable in the first place, but the material feels a touch too familiar by this point, coming across as still enjoyable, but merely cute or chuckle worthy, rather than the real belly laughs which should have been evoked. <br/><br/>Another crucial component of the band's charm, the music, also sadly falls short of the duo's previous material. While the film boasts a superb opening sequence and song, explaining Black's oppressive religious home life, and his determination to break free and become a celebrated rocker, after the opening credits, the music sadly never rises above anything more than satisfactory. However, the orchestral music backing up the band's music at crucial plot points was an inspired touch, adding to the faux 'epic' feel to the pair's overzealous quest, as do the tarot card transitions between plot points - another clever touch. Traits like these are what make the film ultimately rise above mediocre, and add style and class to what otherwise might have fallen apart at the seems if not packaged effectively. <br/><br/>While the film is unquestionably centered around Black and Gass themselves, while both are sufficiently entertaining to carry the film even though its weaker points simply by their raucous charm, neither can boast the film to be among their most comedic or entertaining performances to date. And while none of the background players have very much to do whatsoever, it's in the wonderfully in-jokey cameos that the film really excels. Tim Robbins in particular is flat out hilarious as a mysterious and unsettling 'Stranger' also in search of the fabled guitar pick, and Ben Stiller is the funniest he has been in years in an excellent bit part as a guitar store employee, equipped with garish amounts of rocker hair. It's also nothing less than a scream to see the legendary Meatloaf poking fun at his hard edged persona by playing Black's vehemently religious father in the film's opening scene, as well as singing on screen for the first time since Rocky Horror Picture show. Foo Fighters musician Dave Grohl is memorably badass, reprising his role as Satan from the band's music video, and John C. Reilly makes an almost unrecognizable appearance as a flying sasquatch in an unsettling drug induced hallucination sequence. <br/><br/>While the film may not win Tenacious D many new fans, for those who previously enjoyed their work it is still easily worth a watch. There may not be a whole lot of new material, and the songs may not be quite as caustic and catchy as in the past, but Black and Gass's collective enthusiasm is enough to guarantee that the legend of Tenacious D will keep on rocking for quite some time. Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny may not live up to its boast of being ""the greatest motion picture ever made"", but it does certainly guarantee a highly enjoyable, albeit forgettable hour and a half of inspired madness and head banging rock music. <br/><br/>-7/10"
"llucifer14","10","8","13","25 November 2006"," The double-dipped cream dream thrill ride of a lifetime!!!
","This film rocks...so hard...<br/><br/>The cameos...the drug references...the sharing...the love...the ROCKING!!! When Jack and Kyle first met in Tim Robbins' ""Actors' Gang"" theater company years ago, who knew that such a legacy of awesome music and hilariousness would ensue?? All that door to door rocking paid off...<br/><br/>Although anyone who enjoys classic rock will get a major kick out of this film, I would definitely recommend renting the original 6 HBO episodes at your local video store before going to see the film in the cinema. They're on the Tenacious D Masterworks DVD, which is available for rent at pretty much every video store. There are some inside jokes in the film that refer to these earlier episodes that will add something more enjoyable to the overall viewing experience..."
"desturbd1","7","8","14","12 November 2006"," Solid, keeps a grin on your face...
","(Very mild spoilers; a basic plot outline, no real details) <br/><br/>IF you go into this movie with sufficiently low expectations. I saw this film at a free screening a few days ago in Maryland, and the only reason I agreed to go...was because it was free. I expected a few chuckles, but as I have never been a huge fan of Tenacious D, not much more then that.<br/><br/>The first ten minutes of the film are hilarious, as we are given a look at Jack Black's humble Christian origins in a Midwest American town. The film then takes us years into the future, to the first meeting between JB and Kyle Gass, the second half of Tenacious D. We see the formation of the band and the genesis of its name. Finally, as the title suggests, the second half of the film details their quest to obtain the fabled ""Pick of Destiny."" Again, the beginning of the film was laugh out loud funny, and most of the movie at least kept a smile on my face. That said, there were times it felt a bit long; it's only 100 minutes, but it still felt like it should have been a bit shorter. The story is every bit as absurd as it sounds, and this is not a film you see if you want a real plot. Which is fine, except it means that many of the jokes are very hit or miss...and when they miss, they miss bad. Same thing with the songs; it is a musical, but many of the songs lost their appeal after the first minute or so...then kept going anyway.<br/><br/>I will say that the R-rating really saved this movie from bombing; The D's humor simply couldn't work without cussing, sex, and drug references. But unless you're a real fan of the band, or at the very least know you appreciate their style of comedy, I would recommend you save yourself some money and rent. ""Pick"" will make you giggle a bit...but is it worth 9 bucks? I don't think so. I was tempted to rate it a 6, but since I do think that many would enjoy it enough to justify seeing it in theatres, a 7 seems more appropriate. Just be sure it's your style."
"gregory6689","7","14","29","29 January 2007"," A really good movie but still I'm disappointed!
","When I first heard that Jack Black and Kyle Gass would make a movie about their band I was freaking out! I love their music and I hoped that this movie would be really funny! Now that I have watched it I can't really say that these hopes weren't satisfied but I think I expected more. The movie is full of Tenacious D's great music and I really loved listening to all of it. There are a lot of great jokes and I just love the story, at least the first bit. I don't like the way the movie ends. The ending is very abrupt and in my opinion they could have extended that a bit more.<br/><br/>Overall I think it is a good movie to watch! Everyone who likes rock music should watch it! It'll give you a good laugh!"
"Azrael_200","10","3","4","1 December 2006"," Yes it is the Greatest movie ever made!
","I loved this movie!! Jack Black and Kyle Gass have probably made one of the best comedies since Up in Smoke. This movie has something for everyone: rock, drugs, and Satan. What more could someone want? I suggest this movie to anyone that wants to sit back and forget all the trouble in the world and have a good laugh. Even if the movie does not do well in the theaters it is sure to become a cult classic. I do suggest anyone going to see the movie pick up the D's first album because a lot of the jokes are made only funnier if you have heard the songs( such as JB's obsession with Sasquatch and the epic battle against the devil.)The movie still is guarantied laughs even if you have not heard their music but the songs are so great you can't pass them up."

"ethanrunt","10","7","14","18 November 2006"," Critics were Wrong, greatest comedy/cult film for years!
","A film which starts perfectly, using the animated Kage and Jables seen in such classic videos as ""FHG"" and ""Classico"", spoofing THX with the power of Farts.<br/><br/>As much as i hate fart jokes, gosh darn it, when they are done by slackers and not by animals, damn they rule. From this we get into an ultimate rock opera named ""Kickapoo"" with young JB rocking out about Christina family and his uptight father, played by Meatloaf, who really wails on the song. And when Sabbath's Dio sings to JB to keep him informed of what to do via a poster, wow, it's ultimate classic rock, no Nirvana in sight, well, not for an hour and a quarter, because, of course, Dave Grohl, the Nirvana drummer, reprises the Devil for the film.<br/><br/>After a brilliant start, the music keeps going as the credits are done using Tarot Cards, some which i have, due to the deluxe version of the soundtrack. I rule, hee hee. And then, we enter the story with young JB now being JB and meeting KG on Venice Beach, where JB interrupts KG's brilliant guitar work with an improvisation over Bach, and there they hate each other, and we see Lee for the first time.<br/><br/>Now, if you have never seen the show, Lee is their fan, he's the person who really likes them, has a website for them, but fears them when they become obsessive and fears for his life. Lee here is just a simple Pizza dude, but heck, he's not too important in the film, it's just, it's Lee, he gets recognition.<br/><br/>KG soon tolerates JB after a parody of what seems to be getting as hip as Scarface, A Clockwork Orange, but i can't see how a lot of people will recognise the spoof, rather think it's just a skit, but nonetheless, the comic disturbance of seeing Jables being beaten by Americans pretending to be English in white suits is nice, and with a Training Montage following it to level the pace, any uncomfortableness is forgotten.<br/><br/>I haven't talked much about the music of a lot of it, mainly Kickapoo, but the music is top notch, rude, crude, classic, and also you rehear songs from the series, mainly History and the opening tune, and the first strummed part of Explosivo, but it's still amazing, especially on a huge screen.<br/><br/>The story of the film is just crazy, to pay the rent, JB and KG, after finding their band's name, Tenacious D, on their arses, try to make a song that will win them the cash at Open Mic Night. It starts off like Episode 1: The Search For Inspirado, but teeters onto crazy classic ness when they spot that every great rock band had the same Pick, forged from the tooth of the Devil in the Middle Ages, as we are told by Executive Producer Ben Stiller's Guitar Store Dude, and that the Pick is in the Rock and Roll museum in Sacramento.<br/><br/>From this they travel to Sacramento, where they meet Tim Robbins' brilliant Tramp character, as perfectly done as anything, complete hilarity. From this we get into the greatest call back to the TV series during a drug trip, in which JB finally meets Sasquatch.<br/><br/>It's a road trip of a lifetime with less road, less trip, and more guitars, but it's pitch perfect, continuing the brilliance of the TV series the film gets every joke it wants to in, and has more laughs than Black claimed, there were more than 1 Orgasmic jokes here, and just watching KG and JB on the big screen is epic, but wait, there's the amazing ending to talk about.<br/><br/>Having had to re film it as test audiences didn't recognize the Blues Brothers parody, yet Clockwork Orange was noticed?, it had to be re filmed, and, as much as i'd love to see the original, this is fantastic.<br/><br/>Dave Grohl reprises his role as a Demon, here the Devil, from the video ""Tribute"", he is offered KG if he wins a rock-out, but otherwise would have to stay in hell AND pay their rent, we get an amazing song to end it. Grohl lays it out in a harsh voice that's piercing to the eardrums as we get KG and JB making plans, and a synchronized, and held very long, ""Fuuuuuuuuuucccccccc*****"" and hilarity ensues. Great lyrics to a brilliant song reveal what is the best song in the world that Tribute is based on, and believe me, it's pretty much there in my eyes.<br/><br/>1:34 minutes long, starting and ending with fart gags, and including C*ck push ups and laser deactivation with genitalia scenes, Tenacious D is obviously not a film for the whole family, nor for Commercial Black fans, but for Fans of the series, it's the ultimate movie, clever, stupid, brilliant, rocking, and has great cameos. Fast, fun and pitch perfect, i urge every fan to see it, not so much the rest though, you won't get it.<br/><br/>One more thing, they even mention Rocket Sauce, that's how special it is. 10/10 easily, and the best cult and comedy movie in the last 20 years!"
"ks_voyer","10","6","12","24 November 2006"," Redeeming social value is overrated
","This movie is absolutely hilarious for any fan of half-baked comedy, rock and roll, and particularly, the Greatest Fans, but will be lost on most of the populace. Fortunately, those people probably won't be watching it, and so the rest of us debauched fools can enjoy to our hearts' content.<br/><br/>Fans of the D, especially those who watched the original HBO specials will appreciate the parts of the film that are extremely self-referential, including the origin of ""Tribute"", the obligatory openmic cue cards, and Sasquatch. Meatloaf's performance is brief, but extremely well done and delightfully ironic. As for KG and JB, they are unapologetic about their hedonistic love of the rock, and if nothing else can be taken away from the film, there is the message that pursuit of dreams, however ridiculous they may seem to others, is always worthwhile."

"DonFishies","6","5","10","18 November 2006"," Funnier than I imagined, but way too random and ridiculously unbalanced
","I randomly entered a draw for free tickets to see Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny, and after winning, was unsure of what to do. I was sure I was not going to like the movie as I was never a big fan of the band, and am fairly indifferent to the work of Jack Black. But I went anyway, if for any reason, just sheerly for fun. And what I got was a fair mix of bad and good, but I was most definitely surprised at both how the film was so much better than I expected, and just how terribly random it is.<br/><br/>After a short musical interlude about the sad and rock-impaired childhood of JB (Troy Gentile, the spitting image of Black) followed by a kickin' credits sequence, we move onto him as an adult (now Black himself) and his meeting with Kyle Gass (as himself). He had wanted to become part of a group, and is instantly attracted to Gass as a fellow band mate. Gass is reluctant at first to do anything, but after witnessing a chance encounter where Black is beat up by a gang straight out of A Clockwork Orange, he takes him under his wing and lies to him about being a major player in the music business. Eventually Black finds out the truth, but decides against making his new friend hit the road.<br/><br/>I have already said too much, but suffice to say that the newly formed band needs to create their ""masterpiece"" and sets out to acquire the 'Pick of Destiny' in order to do it.<br/><br/>The film stays on course for the most part with a healthy dose of humour and musical interludes. Other than one scene, every song used is from the band, and plays along excellently alongside the film (of course, the lyrics tend to also be about the certain scene, but their elaborateness really makes for an excellent combination). But while it does stay on course, it does feel unbalanced. In some instances, everything that is said or done is just hilarious specifically for the fact that it is so ridiculously random. But in others, the randomness really just ruins the audience's suspension of disbelief, and just becomes downright stupid.<br/><br/>I do not think I have ever seen such a random film in my life, and while some of it feels very well thought out (Black, Gass and director Liam Lynch wrote the screenplay), other parts just feel thrown together and out of place. It is obvious that the film knows its genre (very broad comedy), and knows its ideal audience (fans of the band and Black, and of course stoners), but almost wants to steer onlookers away by throwing in these atrocious and awful scenes. Yes, a lot of them make for smirks and a few broad laughs, but mostly out of the fact that they just do not feel right here. It knows exactly what it wants to be, and in a way that is great. But in another, it really segregates the audience, and makes for anyone not feeling the jokes to feel completely awkward while everyone else laughs. The whole film works on this good and bad principle as a give-and-take type of thing, and sadly never attempts to move away from it.<br/><br/>Black and Gass work off of each other quite well, and make for an interesting pair. Black clearly steals the show away, as he actually knows what he's doing when he is not standing beside Gass, whereas Gass seems very confused without Black. I realize that Black is the popular comedic personality, but despite all the jokes and laughs he delivers, Gass just seems DOA without him. They have a solid chemistry, but Gass just cannot do it on his own. The music is also a big highlight, as it is both vulgarly original and disgusting vile all at once. It is a bit hard to take in some instances, and in others just feels like total overkill. But for the most part, it works, and adds a very distinct extra layer to the film. As a sidenote, I do not think I have ever heard the word for male innuendo that starts with the letter 'c' used so frequently like I did here. It is clever at first, but just becomes annoying after a while.<br/><br/>Going along with the randomness is the cameos. Meat Loaf, Tim Robbins and Ben Stiller are just a few of the recognizable faces that show up here, and they help add to just how wild the film becomes. All of them play ridiculously over-the-top one-dimensional characters, but there is something to be said for how frequently they pop up and how funny their small amounts of time are on screen. And really, what is Robbins doing here? He did the same thing in Anchorman, so I really am beginning to be a little curious as to his random presence, especially so fresh off of his Oscar win.<br/><br/>Another interesting thing is the subtitles and animation that pops up to show the various transitions (and of course, the history of the Pick or 'POD' as they call it). This same style is used during the credit sequence to great effect, and it looks pretty good during the film too. It works well, and feels seamlessly branched right into the film without problem.<br/><br/>For the most part, the long-awaited Tenacious D film is a lot better than one would expect. Yeah, it is ridiculous and so terribly random, but it does have a few genuinely funny moments too. Just do feel forewarned that not everyone will enjoy it.<br/><br/>6/10."

"DiffrentALF","7","8","20","7 November 2006"," Tenacious D Doesn't Rock Your Socks Off
","Contrary to what the trailers would have you believe, Tenacious D in 'The Pick of Destiny' is not the greatest movie in the world. It is just a tribute. The new movie, directed by Liam Lynch (Sarah Silverman: Jesus Is Magic) and going into wide release on Nov. 22, is truly a film for the fans of Tenacious D. The movie starts out promising, with a young JB, played by Troy Gentile (who also played a young Jack Black in Nacho Libre), defying his parents and calling to his hero Ronnie James Dio (of Black Sabbath) for help. After this he heads out to Hollywood and by the time he reaches the right one he is already grown up. Here is where the adult JB (Jack Black, King Kong, Saving Silverman) meets the slacker KG (Kyle Gass, Elf) and is initially rejected by KG, who claims to be an accomplished rocker. From this point forward the movie somewhat slowly progresses, with a few funny bits thrown in, as JB and KG become friends and form their band. The funny bits are mostly references to songs off their original CD, so the band's fans will eat it up while others may find the sequences stupid or pointless. After a lackluster performance at a local club, they discover that all the great bands seemed to have used the same guitar pick, they go to the local music store to investigate. Luckily for them, the music storeowner happens to know everything about the pick, which cannot be purchased anywhere, and gives them information to get them on their way. So the duo set off for the Rock n' Roll History Museum in Sacramento to find the 'Pick of Destiny', a magical guitar pick made from one of Satan's teeth. On the way they break up, JB more interested in getting the pick and KG more interested in attractive co-eds, and JB heads out on his own while KG goes to a Sorority party. When JB is on his own he eats some trippy mushrooms and gets to meet Sasquatch, leading to one of the film's funniest sequences, while KG tries and fails to impress the college girls at the party. After this JB and KG happen to find each other at the Rock n' Roll museum where they search for the pick. Once they are finished there a predictable car chase occurs followed shortly by the climatic showdown between the D and Mephistopheles himself, who has taken a sexual liking to KG. This scene embodies a lot of what the whole movie should've been like, and ends far too quickly. Overall, Tenacious D in 'The Pick of Destiny' seems to be just another mediocre entry into the 'stoner comedy' genre. It lacks a lot of the charm and laughs of the short lived HBO series about Tenacious D, and doesn't ever live up to the rock musical that one would expect from the opening scene. The new music by Tenacious D was definitely a plus, but it would've been nice if they played some of their classics in the film as well. The film also had plenty of cameos by the likes of Ben Stiller, Tim Robbins, and Meatloaf, but most of them didn't add much to the movie. Fans of Tenacious D will appreciate this film, as it gives JB and KG some much needed recognition, but most others will likely find the laughs too few and the plot too stupid to truly appreciate it. Then again, as Tenacious D once said, ""it doesn't matter if it is good it only matters if it ROCKS!"" The Pick of Destiny definitely fulfills that promise."
"Chrysanthepop","Null","7","17","20 November 2008"," Tenacious D's Boring Destiny
","Being a fan of Jack Black, I was really looking forward to 'Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny'. It starts off with a metal song and a young Tenacious D running off to Hollywood to become a rock star, promising an entertaining film at the least. But things go rapidly downhill ever since Kyle Gass appears on screen. The film loses focus at times and shifts to silly subplots here and there. The soundtrack is great and that's what kept me watching along with Jack Black, who is good while the rest of the cast are annoying. Having watched 'School of Rock' not too long ago, perhaps I was expecting something on that level but to me the humour in 'Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny' did not work and I found most of it irritating."
"sonofaheg","10","2","3","4 February 2010"," Awesome movie
","Tenacious D is a classic movie , one for the ages. Jack Black is superbly funny in this movie, no one can deny his talent as an actor and also a singer. Kyle Gass as his sidekick also plays a good part in the film. It may be low budget but it drew some big time celebrities, Ben Stiller and Dave Groul of the foo fights are just a few. I give this movie to thumbs up for its cheese comedy which will make you laugh every time you see it. Jack Black and Kyle Gass prove that true friends will never separate even through the hardest times and will stick it out until the end. My favorite scene SPOILER!!!!!! when they face the devil in an epic battle of the bands and JB says that the devil can have kyle as a sex slave if he wins had me laughing so hard i almost fell out of my seat. I no that most people wont give this movie a chance from what they have heard about it but give it a chance, it will be worth it. I give this film a big 10."

","This movie is everything a Tenacious D fans can hope for. Director Liam Lynch partnered with The ""D"" is a concoction of epic proportions. Of course you need to understand the humour and format of Tenacious D. When I saw it there wasn't too many laughs from the audience but the reason is not a lack of humour or intelligent jokes. This movie seems to have been released on to an unsuspecting public that haven't familiarised themselves with the musical duo. This movie does stay true to it's roots. For the few of you who have seen the HBO TV series and heard the album, they have not forgotten what their audience loves. Like the TV show people have noticed from the trailer the JB and KG apartment scenes and of course the open Mic nights that each Tenacious D episode would start and finish with. The soundtrack is phenomenal and each song blows you away.<br/><br/>...And Dave Grohl plays a fantastic Devil.<br/><br/>This is the perfect movie for those of you looking for a hard time and a rocking musical."

","There is no question that this movie rocks, mostly for either D fans or potential D fans who haven't yet discovered JB & KG. I am a D fan.<br/><br/>I was expecting a pretty silly movie. I was expecting A LOT of profanity. I wasn't expecting much of a plot. But I didn't care... D on the big screen would have to rock.<br/><br/>What I found was a movie that wasn't (very) silly, although funny and entertaining. I found, for D, NOT a lot of profanity. I also found a coherent plot that, at least for a D fan, was followable throughout the movie.<br/><br/>I don't know if I was disappointed, but probably not. I didn't laugh as much as I expected, but I didn't roll my eyes at mine or D's childishness as much as I expected either.<br/><br/>What I did expect, and got, was ROCKIN'! The music was great. It's so easy with the D to get caught up in the catchy lyrics and overlook the musicianship behind those lyrics. This movie helps the viewer better catch the musicianship, which is more accomplished than anyone would notice in a lot of what D has come up with. I think that one of the best things about this movie is how it shows KG to be an equal partner in the sick genius of the D.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to getting the CD... it will be different from the first. I am addicted to the first but didn't necessarily need another one. I will get another D, not a regurgitation thereof. And that fact DOES rock my f***ing socks off! By the way, unlike everyone else in the theater I went to... don't leave during the credits. Besides the theme song from the movie (which plays first) there's another song and a skit. They are worth waiting for that smoke.<br/><br/>If you think you'll enjoy this movie, I think you will. If you think you won't, you may well not. But in either case, if you go, leave your expectations in the ashtray in the car... you're not going to get what you expect. And that's not a bad thing (in this case, anyway)!"

","I was on the fence going in to see this. I was a big fan of the HBO shows and the songs from that, but didn't so much like much of the material (the album and TV appearances) that came after that. Perhaps my expectations were low going into this -- perhaps I doubted whether or not I was still even a Tenacious D fan. But this movie was hilarious, I don't even know why. I often found myself laughing uncontrollably, scene to scene, for most of the movie, and when the film ended, I truly wished that there was more material. To me, that's one mark of a good comedy, or a good film, period, for that matter -- if you feel like you could watch an extra hour of film and still be entertained. I'm already seeing some negative reviews, so I feel it my duty to report that I think this was definitely the funniest movie I've seen this year."

But, Liam Lynch (who directed the Tribute video) co-wrote and directed this movie and was loyal to what it was supposed to be - a film about Tenacious D!<br/><br/>I for one REALLY enjoyed it. You can see it if you know nothing about them and still find it funny (as long as it's to your sense of humour!), but there are many nods to those who have seen their HBO series.<br/><br/>Meatloaf was brilliant in it, as was Dave Grohl as (guess who?!) Satan! The new material is really impressive, and fits into the film really well. I can't wait to get my hands on the album/soundtrack! There were times though that I wanted them to kick into one of the songs on their first album, but that's the only thing I can say that went wrong with this film for me. Then again, the guys can't do any wrong for me ha ha!"

I think I laughed harder at this movie than any movie in a long time. It was terribly inappropriate but not in a way that made you feel guilty for laughing. It had a great combo of both music and acting and managed to tell a rather amusing story. The list of actors was great, the cameo appearances by many were pleasing. It's a musical that many can get into as the music isn't distracting from the over all plot. I really enjoyed this movie. It is geared to a certain crowd I would say, but if you like Jack Black and that style of humor it's great."

The D is obviously not for everybody. I can scream at people and tell them to go see it and enjoy it, but it is pointless. The movie is a bomb, but it is still funny as hell. Some nice cameos from some big-time talent, great music and lots of funny stuff from KG and JB. One of the bonuses about this film is that it has brought the D back together and we have gotten to see them on various TV shows, the guys work so well off of each other.

","Im not Tenacious d's biggest fan, as i don't own any of their albums but i do think they are hilarious and this definitely comes across in this outstanding big screen effort which I saw at the weekend in an advanced screening. Packed with catchy tunes, punchy wit and some of the best visual gags (check out Tim Robbins scenes and the powerslide)i have seen in a while this is a must for any D or jack black fan.<br/><br/>The storyline is perhaps not to be taken seriously....at all maybe. The idea of the pick that makes rock and roll bands the greatest is certainly hilarious though. Jack Black and Kyle Glass are fantastic as are the deranged cameos from both fellow frat packer Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins. Both are incredibly funny and provide some great scene stealing moments. Liam Lynch directs with competence and manages to capture the life of the band as he has done in the music videos. The film is just bursting at the seams with laughs and had me laughing the whole way through.<br/><br/>I cannot recommend it enough, any person who is in to rock music in some extent should appreciate the rock and roll history museum and the film on the whole.

","As a stone cold Tenacious D fan, i really wen't into the cinema expecting the worst. I was pleasantly surprised. Though most of the jokes weren't hilarious, it had it's moments where you look back on it and laugh. Such as a Devil who swears nonstop, or a flight on the back of a sasquatch. The stars (for a low budget film) are brilliant, and everyone is done great. Plus, for other fans, Jack does his brilliant 'Oh for god sakes Kyle, kick it!' moaning rage quite a lot. It is rated R, or where i live, a 15, and I can easily see why. But it only seems to scrape that rating, i feel they could of done more to make it more 'D' than any other band stories/comedies. No fan will be disappointed, i guarantee, but people that don't really know Tenacious D, and are just going for a bit of fun, or because they like Jack Black (or even KG) they may not like it so much. It has brilliant bits for everyone (and you finally find out the greatest song in the world, as mentioned in their hit song 'Tribute'.) Less I spoil no more for you, go and see it!<br/><br/>Gazza"
"bopdog","8","4","9","19 November 2006"," Bold idea, very entertaining. Spectacular music! But it's not for everybody
","I am adding this single, top paragraph two weeks after I first wrote and posted my comments here on IMDb. I just found out that 'Tenacious D' is, evidently, Jack Black and Kyle Gass' real band, in biz around LA since 1991. Unless that web-based info is part of an elaborate hoax. If legit, it does explain the virtuosity described below. Just wanted to say, I was not aware of them, nor, therefore, was I a fan, particularly. But to give credit where credit is due, those guys do a marvelous tribute/comedy cover 'review' of the hair band phenomenon. It also explains, to a degree, Black's involvement with 'School of Rock'. Kind of a long way to go to nurse a one-laugh gag, but hey--- this movie did have its bright and stirring moments!<br/><br/>'Tenacious D' is not for everybody. It has some stellar moments, but also some lamer moments. It's a bit uneven. But overall, it is a bold concept movie that works. I was entertained.<br/><br/>Jack Black has by now proved himself to be a pretty funny guy. He's got a charming naive 'chutzpah' that makes him an endearing character, no matter how stupid his on-screen behaviors have been written to be.<br/><br/>The other guy, Kyle Gass, is a new one for me. But his pudgy, middle-aged self was somehow sympathetic for the audience. At first I thought Gass would be a 'Curley Joe'--- the odious actor who was a horrible 3-Stooges replacement, trying to steal the role of the late, great 'real' Jerome 'Curly' Howard. But I was pleasantly surprised to find that Gass' resemblance to Curley Joe was merely a superficial resemblance. He pegged the character of the aging loser, who dreams of a rock career, and who is, at the end of the day, a complete 'nobody', perfectly. His character is every comic book store clerk, Dungeons & Dragons master player, and general nerd, geek, and flake stereotype. But you really LIKED the character anyway.<br/><br/>I don't know who did the music for this movie, but it was fantastic. If you love the memories of the 70s and 80s hair bands, you'll find this rendition very skilled. Not mere mimicry, but an amazing set of stylistic creations. They say you have to be a true virtuoso in order to do comedy music--- this movie seems to prove that point. Some real songs were woven in with some excellent new stuff. The writing, and the musicianship, were spectacular.<br/><br/>It's a bit salty, and raunchy--- probably not a good date movie,. unless your date likes a good gross laugh. Intriguing movie--- not perfect, and kind of unique and weird, but that should be a welcome thing in this era when we all like to complain that all movies have become money-obsessed cookie-cutter clones of every other movie. This one is no clone! I gave it an 8 out of 10, with the caution that not everyone will get it, or like it."

","More than any other movie in recent memory 'Tenacious D: The Pick Of Destiny' gets by on the sheer force of the personality of one of its cast members. That personality is Jack Black, and his charisma alone is responsible for dragging this movie from awful to at least watchable. <br/><br/>It's silly, but I enjoyed some parts of it. Most of the songs are instantly catchy, and I'm sure teenagers and fans of Tenacious D will love the foul mouthed songs. Ben Stiller pops up and for once he is not doing his usual nice guy Ben Stiller routine. Which is a nice touch. Tim Robbins also makes an appearance too.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, not even Jack Black can save it. He is watchable as always, but these are not ninety of his better minutes"

But my friend called me a few nights ago and told me that this movie was so hilarious and that I needed to see it, so I figured to give it a shot, so I rented it. I just watched it and I have to admit that I just had a great time watching it. I am a huge classic rock lover, so I think that's part of the reason why I loved it so much, but the guys made the movie work and had great chemistry.<br/><br/>JB is a kid who ran away from his religious family to become a rock star, when he gets to Hollywood he finds another old balding heavy set man KG who is playing his guitar on the streets. He is extremely impressed with KG and begs him to be in a band with him. KG lies and tells him that he's a huge rock star, but when JB finds out what a fake KG is, he forgives him and they find out what makes a band great and that is ""The Pick of Destiny"", so they must go to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame to find the pick that will make them play like true guitar Gods.<br/><br/>It has funny music, some great humor and some gross, and the story just worked for a comedy. I thought this was a great surprise, I really enjoyed Tenacious D: The Pick of Destiny, I think anyone could too. Believe me, you'll definitely enjoy the scene where KG and JB are fighting to ""outrock"" Satan, I have to admit that I've never seen anything like that, it was great.

","This was a 'steady' flicknot as fun as Jack Black's other films but definitely better than Nacho Libre. Personally, this musical comedy is so much easier to digest than other operatic Broadway drivel, especially if you are a fan of Tenacious D (their song ""Wonderboy"" is a real hoot!).<br/><br/>Black and Kyle Gass make up the band that is Tenacious D. Listen to their song ""Tribute"" to better appreciate the movie (the video's hilarious, too!). The movie is a spin-off of the song, which tells the story of how Tenacious D was formed to become the world's greatest band by defeating Satan himself (played by the Foo Fighters' Dave Grohl). Watch out for other cameos by Ben Stiller (also the executive producer), John C. Reilly and many more.<br/><br/>The plot is thin and ridiculous but you continue to watch it anyway just because it can be irreverently fun (living out the essence of rock). Also, because rooting for the underdogs that Black and Gass areold, balding, tubby rockstar-wannabesis such a classic crowd-pleasing formula. Watch it if you like rock, don't take things so seriously, and just want to zone out for some self-indulgent me-time. :o)"

Jack Black has so many great facial expressions and the music in the movie is just as inspired and great as the original album. ""Master Exploder"" and ""Kickapoo"" were my favourites, along with ""Car Chase"" and ""Break In-City (Storm the Gate!)"" Some of the material in the movie is from the album, but not much of it, so no worries of a rip-off.<br/><br/>My only problem with the film is that it ended too soon. It should have lasted about another 10 minutes, or at least for one final song.<br/><br/>I give it an 8.5 out of 10 because of ending a tad too soon and there should have been a few more minutes of Satan, because he rocks."

The usual sheer greatness as any of the films that Jack Black has been in, more-so teaming up with his hard-rocking compadre Kyle Gass just made it even better.

I had the soundtrack to the movie last week and listened to it non-stop. To see the movie was pure bliss for me and my hubby. We've both met Jack and Kyle after 2 different Tenacious D concerts and also saw them when they toured with Weezer. We left that concert after the D was done playing. Nobody can top their show!

","I was lucky enough to win free passes to the sneak preview of POD. Let me just tell you, from just the previews I was excited to see it! The movie absolutely rocked! What I really liked about it was the fact that JB was in his element. With other movies like ""School of Rock,"" he does namby pamby music for kids and families, but this music is obviously all his.<br/><br/>I took my brother and sister with me to see it, and we laughed basically the entire time. There are a couple places where I wonder what the hell they were thinking, because some items are a little disjointed, but for the most part it was great. A lot of the time it didn't seem like a low-budget film, so that is a plus.<br/><br/>What I was most surprised about was Dave Grohl as Satan. That is f-ing hilarious! You honestly wouldn't know from seeing the film that that is him.<br/><br/>I say that if you are a rock fan and are into JB, KG, and/or Tenacious D, go see the film. Be prepared for a LOT of drug references, a LOT of four letter words and some skull shredding rock!"
"angus-58","8","3","6","30 October 2006"," The ""Wayne's World"" for a new generation...
","(Contains very mild spoilers regarding the intro of the film)<br/><br/>So, having managed to get into a press screening of Jack Blacks' new film I suppose I should do my job and say something about it.<br/><br/>First off I'll have to admit that I went to the film without any preconceptions. I think Jack Black is a very good comedian and showman and I do enjoy Tenacious D as a band - possibly more for the comedy value of their lyrics and videos than the actual music. I have never seen the TV series that ran in the States catapulting them to stardom as 'The D' so a lot of the cameo roles by a whole host of people that also appeared on the show flew straight past me.<br/><br/>The film starts off with little 10-year old JB joining in at dinner with his ultra conservative Christian parents (his father is played by Meatloaf) with a song about his home town of Kickapoo with enough expletives in to warrant the 'Parental Advisory Sticker' on the album cover ten times over. His parents, who consider rock music the devils work, are understandably not very pleased at this and after his father has finished lashing him with his belt he tears down all of Jack's beloved rock posters and pretty much bans him from following his dream. All is saved though when the one poster that has escaped his fathers wrath - of Ronnie James Dio - comes to life and advisers young Jack that to follow his dream he has to leave home and go to 'Hollywood'. Cue Jack making a quick exit through his window with some cash and his guitar and a trek around the USA to all the towns called Hollywood before he ends up in Hollywood, California, many years later as an adult.<br/><br/>It is in Hollywood that Jack mets Kyle Gass - his partner in crime at Tenacious D - and despite a bad first encounter Kyle ends up taking Jack in after seeing him beat up by a gang inspired by The Clockwork Orange. Thus Jack's tuition begins and the two cement their friendship and eventually go on the quest to find the 'Pick of Destiny' to help them achieved the Rock Godhood they so desperately desire!<br/><br/>'The Pick of Destiny' is a rock musical comedy. It certainly achieves it's aims and is utterly hilarious. It had pretty much the entire cinema laughing throughout the movie and has got some classic moments in it. Ultimately though whilst it is a very enjoyable 95 minutes - and certainly produces more laughs in that time than many traditional comedies - it's a film that seems like it finishes before it has started. The film doesn't really seem to go very far and when it finished I did have the slight feeling of ""oh, it's over already?"" - which is on one hand good (it was so fun I didn't realise it'd been on that long) but on the other it's not so good (was that it?).<br/><br/>This film will be the ""Wayne's World"" for a new generation. I can imagine nations of teenage rockers, and non-rockers alike, loving the film. Quoting the film. Worhsipping the film. And to be honest rightly so. The film is hilarious (have I already said that enough? :p). I just wish it'd been double the length! <br/><br/>Oh, watch out for some of the custom guitars and possibly the best use of a cock in a movie I've seen :p<br/><br/>School Report: B+ (Funniest film of the year but drops points for finishing just as it was building up steam) <br/><br/>PS - Can't wait to see the band live when they play the UK later this year :)"

","For all of you older people out there who have not caught up with the MTV Generation, Tenacious D is the rock band of Jack Black of 'School of Rock' and 'Shallow Hal' fame. He teamed up with his mate Kyle Gass and together the two of them created a 'cult' band.<br/><br/>Tenacious D in: The Pick of Destiny is a film about the fictional account of how the band formed.<br/><br/>The film starts off with a hilarious song sung by Jack Black, depicting his life as a child in a religious family who think of rock as ""The Devil's Music"". Rock is JB's life and he feels that if his family won't accept that then he will run away from home. And he does just that. Many years pass as JB travels through LA, he meets a street guitarist KG. Thinking that KG is a famous rock star, JB decides to 'audition' for KG's so-called band. The two soon discover that fate has lead them to each other through unusual circumstances.<br/><br/>Thereafter, the film takes a giant leap into absolute ridiculousness. The new partners in crime go on a quest for 'The Pick of Destiny"", a guitar pick that has allowed all the legendary rock stars of today to play outstanding music that they had never heard before.<br/><br/>The soundtrack features songs by Tenacious D and is a great addition to the film. Obviously this film is not meant to be taken seriously, but I did not think it was executed very well.<br/><br/>Jack Black has been a real disappointment to me lately. He is a comedic genius yet he is wasting his time on rubbish films. His most recent, The Holiday, dumbed him down so much that it was hard to believe that this was actually Jack Black. He was not allowed to show off his comedic abilities and was just in the film for lame comic relief.<br/><br/>However, this film was obviously made for fans of Black and Gass's band Tenacious D and will surely be loved by all of them. With its crude humour and offensiveness, Tenacious D definitely won't give Borat a run for his money but will still entertain fans of the ""D"".<br/><br/>5/10"

","Many expected a very cheesy movie that wouldn't make you laugh more then a slight giggle but many of them have been deceived by this outstanding comedy. The acting was actually very well done and the plot was very simple and easy to follow. I can't but help to become a Tenacious D fan whenever I watch this movie. The songs are simply brilliant. Its impossible not to sing along to at least one of the extremely catchy songs in the movie. There is a lot of swearing, but not even as much as if you would hear siting on a bus with a bunch of middle school children. I wouldn't say the cursing is over the top but I would say if you don't like too much use of the F-word then this movie may not be for you. Still, the comedy scenes in this makes you fall off your seat laughing. I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a fun movie and some rock n roll."

","Worth the admission price for the Rock-off alone!! Any D fan will LOVE this movie (even though it's a tad short) and cameos from John C Reilly, Ben Stiller, Tim Robbins, Meatloaf and Dave Grohl (just about recognisable) prove that the D rock hard enough for anyone. Even Dio... The sasquatch/mushroom scene is going to become an instant classic (I don't want to say any more and be accused of putting spoilers in here). Fans of the original HBO series will see a couple of nods to the D's early on-screen appearances in characters such as Lee and the open mic host. I only wish that they had played a few of the songs from the first album and the omission of 'the government totally sucks' from the POD album is also a shame. Other than that this movie rocks. Obey the D!"

","I caught this at an advanced screening and i have to say that this is a contender for film of the year. The shear stupidity and cutting edge soundtrack bring this film into my top 5 list. The story starts out with a young JB and him living with his religious family, he escapes his father with the help of Dio and embarks to find a rock mentor. As he grows older (Jack Black) he meets KG (Kyle Gass), a rocking, lying guitar player in Venice beach. They come to here about a magical pick called the pick of destiny. They embark on a quest to find the pick and on the way get into all kinds of trouble. JB gets high on magic mushrooms and meets sasquatch, KG goes to a fraternity party. The film has some amazing cameo appearances such as meatloaf (JBs Father), Ben Stiller (Guitar store worker) and Tim Robbins as a crippled foreigner. It is the story of the rise of Tenacious D and how they came about. Overall i gave this film 10/10 as it is what i love in a film- Stupid,kick-ass soundtrack and a host of celebrity cameos. Long Live The D!"

","I shall start by saying that this film is almost definitely just for Tenacious D fans! The jokes will seem strange and boring if you do not like Tenacious D, as such I recommend anyone that doesn't like Tenacious D not to see this film so they save money, however, that said, if you like Tenacious D, this is a must see film! It is hilarious and has a great storyline, great as in funny and Tenacious D style! The story starts with JB as a child, rebelling against his own father and asking Dio for guidance. This is all done in a classic D-style song. JB is told to go and find another band member, he finds KG in Venice. Playing his rocking rhythms to the public. JB is instantly in awe and asks if KG wants a singer. I will not spoil the entire film but there are many hilarious events, such as JB getting ""stoned"" on mushrooms that he has found, and KG singing ""The History of Tenacious D"" by himself, only singing his part of the song. Along with the amazing song between them and the Devil. This film ""blew my mind""! And is a must see film for any Tenacious D fan!"

If you love the D this movie will rock you so hard your head will explode.<br/><br/>Don't buy the soundtrack until after you see the movie, as it will ruin some of the jokes. The new music was amazing and I particular loved the little scat jams JB busts out throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The cameos were all great too, but the highlight for me was Meatloaf. So glad they got him to sing too!<br/><br/>Non-D, non-JB fans should go watch Borat again or something. Everyone else prepare to have your socks rocked off."

","Well I luckily saw this film while in Hollywood and I got a hold of advanced screening tickets. I must be honest I did not know what to expect from this film. I am only a casual fan of Tenacious D say a song or two.<br/><br/>As soon as the film opens with the first song from the album 'The Pick of Destiny' I was completely captivated from beginning to end. I was laughing from the start to finish my sides were literally hurting.<br/><br/>The plot I admit is completely stupid but that is what makes it so funny. Jack Black and Kyle Gass are on top form when acting and rocking their hearts out! Cameos such as Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins make the film even funnier because of the roles that they take on that you would not normally see them in.<br/><br/>One thing I would point out about this film. If you are a die hard Tenacious D film, I would recommend buying the album after you've seen this film, the reason being because the songs are more funnier when you have not heard them before and it makes it more special when you are seeing the film. Anyway, as soon as the film finishes you want to buy the album anyway! I know I did, but I have to wait for its release! If you like silly, crude but also clever humour then go and see this film. It is definitely one of my favourite comedy's of all time. Tenacious D fans would be delighted with the film and would get the film more than fans who have never heard of them before.<br/><br/>Tenacious D are the greatest band in the world.

","Review: 'Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny' A film about a band trying to become the best band ever and pay their rent by stealing a legendary guitar pick from a rock and roll museum couldn't have been done better to be honest. Starring Tenacious D', Jack Black and Kyle Gass, directed by Liam Lynch this film is about the music and the humour, the absurd plot is a testament to that. This film serves as an extremely loose origin story, I can only imagine, to the formation of the band 'Tenacious D'. Released in 2006 this is a music-comedy, adventure. JB and KG are aspiring successful musicians. When they run out of money to pay for rent they decide to enter a competition where the best band wins, but before they play they learn of the 'pick of destiny', a legendary guitar pick which is supposedly one of the devils teeth. They decide to try to steal it from a museum. Firstly Jack Black and Kyle Gass' relationship on screen is partly why the film is so good. They are so natural together. One scene that sticks out to me is toward the start of the film is when KG meets JB. KG is a very arrogant street performer at this stage while JB is innocent and acts like an absolute fanboy. KG tries to keep up an act of disinterest while JB applauds his performance. Towards the end of the scene KG flicks his pick at JB like he's god's gift to the earth. I thought this was hilarious as KG is as much of a loser as JB is at this point in the film. The music is also good being one of the main reasons to see the film. It is for the most part performed by Tenacious D themselves as you would expect. What really makes this film standout to me is the dream sequences. Like in 'The Big Lebowski' they are visually stunning, unique scenes. Without giving too much away there is one scene with an actually decent song in it and in another there is a trippy bit of Bigfoot. One thing I didn't like about this film is that halfway through it sort of has a cliché friends falling out moment which is reconciled quickly. I understand that it was to add a bit of drama but if they did it in a more creative, original way I would have appreciated it. If you do decide to see this film or if you have seen it and plan to re watch it I would recommend to look out for the cameos from Ben Stiller, Amy Poehler, Dave Grohl, Meatloaf and many more. The opening of this film is probably the strongest part of the film JBs origin is too funny to miss, if you don't plan on seeing this film at least watch the opening. In conclusion the soundtrack is great, the relationship between Jack Black and Kyle Gass on screen cements the whole film together and the dream sequences are pretty cool. All in all I give it a 7/10 and would recommend it. Keep an eye out for those cameos."

And the story is quite nice too, except for the middle of the movie. This was the part that disappointed me. Because it really seemed like they were stretching the movie there. And that just bored me extremely.<br/><br/>Now should you watch this movie? If you like a)Tenacious D b)Tenacious D like Humor or c)rock music definitely yes. Even if you don't like the humor or the story or whatever, the music is really great (and I am saying that, as somebody who usually just listens to Thrash Metal).

First of all, Jack Black is one of my favorite actors because although he can be annoying at times, he is a hilarious and exceptional actor. I thought the plot of the movie was great because they were originally going to make the movie a true story about how Jack Black and Kyle Gass first met and how Tenacious D began. But instead they made the movie interesting and made a more goofy story line which i'm glad they did. I thought this was a good laugh and was pretty well directed considering the seriousness of the movie. This is one of my favorite stoner movies(aside from Harold and Kumar).

","""Tenacious D In The Pick Of Destiny"" is rock and roll translated to celluloid, everything about it just kicks you in the face. The plot is all over the place, you just never know where the next scene is going to take you. If you managed to figure out the ending to this movie in advance, I'm really impressed and slightly worried. The acting is also really energetic, Jack Black plays every Jack Black character ever but here it fits best. I also love all the cameos, some faces just show up totally unexpectedly (I won't spoil the surprises). The best part is undoubtedly the music though. Tenacious D might just be the best guilty pleasure band in the history of guilty pleasures. Much like with Spinal Tap, I know it's played for laughs but I just genuinely enjoy their music. This movie is worth watching for ""Master Exploder"" alone. Overall ""Pick Of Destiny"" is pretty great, even when you're not stoned (though it probably helps)."

Well its basic, it has what some more seasoned movie goers would say 'a predictable plot' but thats just it, everything outside the plot such as the crazy characters, hilarious dialogue and awesome music just make you forget about the 'story' its weird because once i just accepted this fact i enjoyed it a whole lot more once i saw it for the 2nd/3rd time.<br/><br/>The direction and cinematography is actually pretty good for whats essentially a full length music video movie and the special effects and stunts, while basic are used in such a way that it just enhances the already crazy level of slapstick awesomeness to a whole level.<br/><br/>I only have a small problem with the movie as it currently stands, as a fan is that there could have been some more new material that wasn't on the album, i guess i just want as much TD as i can get.<br/><br/>9.5/10 PS. its better than school of rock, you should watch go watch that too."

","For those unaware, Tenacious D is a real rock band composed of famed comedy actor Jack Black and his best friend Kyle Gass. The two got their short-lived start on the HBO program of the same name, and now get a film their fans have long been waiting for. Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny might not be what you'd expect from Jack Black. After doing Nacho Libre and School of Rock, two films aimed directly at children, some might not be familiar with Black's dark comedic side. But this makes sure you're well aware and not willing to forget anytime soon.<br/><br/>This is a musical comedy. Not quite an in-depth character study on both Black and Gass, but a very vulgar, raunchy, musical comedy with jokes focused around lyrical humor, bongs, and slapsticky elements. Most of them earn a chuckle, but the main humor is the music. Never being properly acquainted to Black and Gass's band, I let myself glide through The Pick of Destiny with no expectations. After the first song, ""Kickapoo,"" was played for the beginning sequence I knew the numbers wouldn't let me down.<br/><br/>The film begins telling the story of how JB (Black) left his strictly religious family to form the greatest rock band on the planet. He runs into street musician KG (Gass) who begs him to join him in his quest and ""show him his ways"" of music. When he finds out KG was trying to trick him, JB is at first upset, but then believes that since KG needs rent money, they could go around and play at certain clubs and such to pay for it.<br/><br/>It's simplicity itself, but in a good, cute, harmless way. The film is very vulgar, a trait I was not aware of, but am accepting of. Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny has a love affair with four letter words, especially in the duo's music which is funny yet very juvenile.<br/><br/>Jack Black and Kyle Gass have likable chemistry throughout the whole special, and nothing ever feels forced. Clearly, this is a stoner film. How is this made clear? Consider a scene where JB and KG need to face the devil, yes, the devil himself in a rock-off to see who is worthy of The Pick of Destiny. This all comes down to one simple question; would this film have been funnier if I had two friends and a bong handy? The band itself has the spunk and tenacity to carry a film. The script not so much. The music is lively, the characters funny, but the situations are hit or miss. From the box office revenue, this reminded me that it isn't easy to be a satanic, vulgar rock band in this day and age.<br/><br/>Starring: Jack Black and Kyle Gass. Directed by: Liam Lynch."
"Electrified_Voltage","7","0","0","31 March 2011"," Tenacious D in their own movie, with mostly positive results
","I first heard of Tenacious D, the musical duo consisting of Jack Black and Kyle Gass, years ago, finding articles on them in music magazines. This would have been around the time their self-titled debut album came out. I then saw Black play the starring role in the 2003 film, ""The School of Rock"", which made me become a fan of him as a comedian. To this day, I still haven't seen much of the ""Tenacious D"" TV series (though I did see part of an episode which I thought was very funny), but in late 2006, when I saw the trailer for the duo's then upcoming movie, ""Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny"", it certainly did catch my attention. It took me over four years to get around to watching this fictional biopic, but I was still expecting to get lots of laughs out of it when I finally did see it, even if it wasn't great, and fortunately, I did.<br/><br/>In his childhood, JB lives in Kickapoo, Missouri, and has a passion for rock music, but this kind of music is forbidden in his strict religious household. Following the instructions of Dio, who comes to life on JB's poster of him, the young boy runs away and sets out on a journey to Hollywood to fulfill his rock dreams! After traveling around the United States and going through more than one other Hollywood, a now grown up JB finally arrives in the most famous one, in California. Here, he soon meets a guitarist named Kyle Gass, and is amazed by his skills, but this man doesn't seem to want anything to do with him. That night, JB is attacked by a masked gang, and Kyle pretends that he saved him from them. The guitarist then takes the aspiring rock star to his apartment. While training JB to be in his band, it is revealed that Kyle has been lying. He actually doesn't have a band, and has been living off rent checks sent by his mother, which she has just decided to stop sending! Kyle is about to leave his apartment and move back in with his parents, but when JB sees the guitar Kyle has just bought him with the last of this rent money, he convinces him to stay, and together, they form Tenacious D. The two of them set out on a quest to find a very powerful guitar pick known as the Pick of Destiny, as it appears that every rock legend has used it! <br/><br/>Troy Gentile plays Jack Black's character as a kid at the beginning of this movie, just like the actor did in ""Nacho Libre"". He was an excellent choice for this, as not only does he resemble Black, he can also really nail the comedian's facial expressions! I was already laughing during parts of this opening sequence, and found many more big laughs, plus some smaller ones, throughout the film. The part where JB and Kyle first meet is one of these memorably funny parts, especially when JB makes up lyrics to the classical pieces Kyle plays on his guitar! The two co-stars help carry the film with both their comedic and musical talent. They deliver lots of funny lines and play some good songs as they go on a quest full of mishaps, on which they don't always get along and don't always have the same attitudes. One really silly and over-the-top but still funny segment is JB's mushroom trip, caused by some mushrooms he finds in the forest and eats, not thinking about what they could do to him! The funniest bits of this sequence are that ones that show what's actually happening! There are some pretty weak gags, such as the ""ear p%#@*^s"" one, but this is far from a constant problem.<br/><br/>This feature film starring the renowned Tenacious D duo bombed at the box office, but has still gotten a decent cult following. Many may criticize it for its lowbrow humour, and there's no denying that it has a lot of that, but that's not a bad thing for everybody. Since this is an R-rated movie, I really don't think I have to point out that it's obviously not for kids, but there are also many adults who should stay away from it as well. If you're offended by the F word and/or by Satan (played here by former Nirvana drummer and current Foo Fighters frontman and guitarist Dave Grohl) being portrayed in a humorous manner, then you certainly should NOT watch ""Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny""! I'm sure there are other things in the film that could easily offend as well, so you should be aware of that. However, if you're not offended by this sort of thing, you're a Tenacious D fan or maybe just a fan of Jack Black as a comedian, and you can take the film's tastelessness, then I can recommend it for you."

","I didn't really know what to expect from this film, I kinda knew what the main story or theme was but I only wanted to watch it as I think Jack Black was hilarious in School Of Rock. Man, am I glad I checked this film out! its awesome! A riot from start to finish and I would recommend it to ANYONE! (of the right age that is!) Jack Black is again excellent in this with his immense & seemingly unstoppable energy he brings to a movie. Great stuff. There are some nice cameos as well, namely ben stiller and a very surprising appearance by tim ""shawshank"" robbins. I particularly enjoyed towards the end of this flick with the showdown that happens. Not gonna say anymore as it will give too much away.

","This movie rocks! It's a screamingly funny mock-heroic epic about two fat, middle-aged heavy metal rockers who go on a Tolkien-style quest to find a magic guitar pick that will grant them unlimited talent and fame.<br/><br/>Everyone knows the inspirations for this film. Starting with Led Zeppelin, all great heavy metal bands have copied the myths, lore, and pageantry of the LORD OF THE RINGS novels, along with assorted occult, black magic, and other colorful symbolism. In a way it really ""closes the circle"" to have a Tolkien-style ""epic"" about a heavy metal duo, with the cultural influences coming full circle.<br/><br/>But did anyone notice the obvious tributes to the old Robert Redford Paul Newman con-man movie, THE STING? The most obvious link is the way that each new chapter in the saga starts with a colorful picture -- supposed to be Tarot cards, but THE STING used the same device. And the plot is quite similar. In the STING, a bright-eyed young con man seeks out a tired, washed up master to learn the art of ""the sting."" Tenacious D uses the exact same plot, with Jack Black as Robert Redford and Kyle Gass in the Paul Newman role.<br/><br/>The only thing that's missing is the Scott Joplin soundtrack!"

","Tenacious D is one of the best comedic bands out there, and finally band members Jack Black and Kyle Gass have taken to the big screen in The Pick of Destiny. Everyone knew it would happen eventually, but I don't think everyone knew it would rock so much! Black plays himself, JB, along with Gass, again, as himself, KG. Both do great jobs and bounce off each other throughout the whole film. There's some great cameos too from the likes of Foo Fighters front man, Dave Grohl, SNL star, Amy Poehler and producer Ben Stiller. But its the songs that make this movie really shine.<br/><br/>Let's face it. When watching a film like this you really just want to see JB and KG rock it out, and that they do very well. If you try and look any deeper than the band and their performances, you will probably be unsatisfied, so don't try to. This movie is really just an opportunity for fans to watch their heroes' journey to the top, while busting riffs along the way. Fans will be familiar with the crude humor and will not be disappointed. I think I can easily say now that people unfamiliar with Tenacious D will most likely not enjoy it. I have to admit, even as a fan, that the jokes in between the songs are good and plentiful, but not hilarious.<br/><br/>Aside all this, The Pick of Destiny perfectly captures the era of metal that dominated the 80', mixing it with comedy and music. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and any metal-head should give it a go.<br/><br/>7.5/10 <br/><br/>Hamish Kearvell A.K.A Screaming Japan Productions - www.myspace.com/screamingjapanproductions"

"Dillypogo","6","0","0","19 August 2008"," Tenacious D: Disappointing jokes, good songs!
","Comedies tend to either fall into one of two categories. The first category is intelligent, wise-cracking and actually funny. The second category is dumb, boring and unfunny. Sadly, Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny is in the second category. The plot follows JB (Jack Black) and KG (Kyle Gass), two rockers who meet and believe they are destined to become the greatest band the world has ever known. When they gain knowledge of a magical pick made out of the Devil's tooth, they plan to steal it from The Rock and Roll History Museum.<br/><br/>This highly anticipated movie disappointed many due to it's lack of good jokes and overall unfunniness. If you were to ask me to tell you about a hilarious part of The Pick Of Destiny, I couldn't because after watching it, I realised that I hadn't laughed a single time throughout the entire film. Sure, I'd maybe grinned or smiled but I hadn't laughed which is a shame because it ruined the film for me. With better jokes I would have enjoyed this a lot more and it may have just been up there with my favourite films.<br/><br/>Jack Black and Kyle Gass give equally great performances, but Gass's performance was inevitably overshadowed by Black's because of Black being so well known. But Gass, having mainly had small parts in previous films, gives a promising performance and I look forward to seeing him in future releases.<br/><br/>The film has many cameo appearances including Ben Stiller, Tim Robbins and Meatloaf, but it's Dave Grohl who has the best cameo as the Devil in the second last scene.<br/><br/>The thing that saves The Pick of Destiny are the outstanding songs. Not only do they supply some humour to the film, but they are also pretty damn good. They certainly saved the best for last in the last 20 minutes or so, where Tenacious D battle the devil through means of a rock-off where there is a highly entertaining 10 minute song.<br/><br/>The few jokes simply aren't that funny but the songs are excellent. I give it 6/10."

","I had a good time watching this one. Although this film doesn't size up in terms of storyline and/or plot development, the music made it all up for me. It was rockin. You can consider this a musical perhaps because of all the rockin and head-bangin taking place and I tell you, its one hell of a musical. The songs were supervised of course by Tenacious D and I guarantee you, if you're a fan of rock and roll, you will absolutely love this one. The songs gave me the LSS and that happens to me rarely.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller, Tim Robbins and David Grohl (of the Foo Fighters) made cameo appearances which was a delight. Tim Robbins as a bum with a bum leg was so hilarious, I couldn't stop laughing. The rockin duo of course were funny as hell. The comedic timing and the delivery of jokes were spot-on. Add to that the crackalackin' music of Jables and Rage Kage and you're in for a musical rockin extravaganza you've never experienced before.<br/><br/>7/10"

","A film reviewer--I cannot recall if it was Entertainment Weekley or a local reviewer--very flippantly reviewed this movie with a couple of short paragraphs and dismissed it something to the tune of(I'm paraphrasing,of course)this movie being a decade or so late in capturing the fresh,raw quality that was Tenacious D,since they'd been a hot cult act dating back to the mid-nineties and by now had been well-exposed and almost(inferred here)passÃ©. <br/><br/>To that person,I say 'Fie!' This show still rocks,even if it seems a little stunted and hurried.<br/><br/>The account of the meeting and ""coming to be"" of ""The D""--actor/musicians JAck Black and Kyle Gass--is no doubt laced with embellishment and,no doubt,could've been released a while back,but it still more than maintains the raw power,enthusiasm and energy that the D brings to their shows. A stripped-down cast that features somewhat inexplicable cameos by the likes of Tim Robbins,Amy Poehler,Fred Armisen,Ben Stiller and Mealoaf(and an energetic turn by Foo Fighters frontman DAve Grohl as Ol' Scratch himself),this movie is pretty much otherwise ALL JB and KG,and as such it is a fun ride. Director Liam Lynch must be a fan of the duo,because they are pretty much setting the pace here.<br/><br/>So in sum,it may've been a film that was ten or eleven years overdue,but this IS certainly a Tenacious D movie and if you're any amount of fan of the legendary pair,this should not disappoint."

","This movie just... Rocks! I borrowed it from a friend of mine and I watch it... To be honest, when I was watching it I thought: What the hell is this? But I liked it very, very much! It is one of the most hilarious films I've ever seen. The songs and the lyrics were great and the ultimate rock cast really was the tip of the iceberg. I mean: Meat Loaf and Dio together in ONE scene... Top notch! The story was really original and fun. Of course, it's not a story like 'The Shawshank Redemption' or 'The Usual Suspects', but a movie like this doesn't need such a story. And the constant 'F-words' and the 'S-words' didn't bother me at all, it just made the movie and the songs even funnier.

Kyle Gas not doing any real acting i believe that he delivered well and used his ego into the equation. Jack Black being the cheeky boy that he is really makes you laugh.<br/><br/>The film although a musical still gives you the sense of an Aventure film.

","Jack oh how you rock. Let Jack of the leash and you do invariably get variations of a familiar character all of which I suspect are close to Mr. Black himself. So whilst this in my opinion is not a bad movie and does indeed have some very funny scenes. Liking this movie is I think going to depend if you like Jack himself. Yes it's crude and yes we have seen Jack do this many times before (this character is just a more adult version of his school of rock character). The premise of the movie is Jack and his co-star and fellow 'tenacious' member Kyle Glass go on a journey that is both physical and spiritual to reclaim the pick of destiny the movie is named after .What we get is basically a series of sketches that vary in degrees of humour. A few good cameos from Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins and an ending that one spots from pretty much from the beginning but it's enjoyable without being great.

","When i heard that Jack Black was working on another rock comedy i was totally excited because i really love ""The School of Rock"". But later i just forget about it because it wasn't release in Mexico and also because i knew Tenacious D as the Jack Black band but i never heard anything of Tenacious D music. Until one month ago that i heard the song ""The Metal"" in the Guitar Hero demo and i really like it so i came here to investigate about the film but in the film releases it wasn't Mexico. I start looking the DVD and finally one week ago i get it. I saw the film that same day and i really enjoy it.<br/><br/>For me this is one of the best comedies of the year, along with Borat film and Nacho Libre, also with Jack Black.<br/><br/>I think i enjoy this film so much because i love rock music so i find this as a tribute to all the people who have the rock music in their hearts. And of course, because is nothing but hilarious; with Jack Black that for me is one the best comedians right now and also a great musician.<br/><br/>The plot is really funny, is about the start of Tenacious D, how JB and KG know each other and also involves one of the darkest (and funniest)secrets in rock history about the Pick of Destiny.<br/><br/>The cast is great, like i said Jack Black is hilarious and the same of Kyle Gass. And with many cameos like Ronnie James Dio, Meat Loaft, Ben Stiler, Tim Robbins and Dave Grohl as the devil. For me the most hilarious is the one of Tim Robbins, is just great and very different of all the work of Tim.<br/><br/>About the music: as i said, i never heard anything of Tenacious D but now i'm a fan and i want all their albums. The lyrics are really funny and they play really good, specially the last song in the film with Dave Grohl's voice and drum is amazing.<br/><br/>As a conclusion: i think that you don't need to be a hard core fan of the band to enjoy the film but i'm pretty sure that i enjoy a lot this film because i love rock music. Excellent comedy. 10/10<br/><br/>DVD: Excellent, i love all the deleted scenes and the making of the film and soundtrack.

","""Tenacious D"" is Jack Black's side band with partner Kyle Gass. They mix comedy and hard rocking into their songs, each one an attempt to create the next rock and roll anthem. ""Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny"" is their first major motion picture and it details the creation and early days of the band. We were a little concerned as it opens with a rock opera piece of the young Jack Black at home, being a rebellious rocker. All of the parts are sung, so we thought this was where the movie was headed. Although the opening was pretty funny, we really didn't want to sit through an entire film like this. After the credits, however, the story begins as Jack heads to Hollywood and meets up with Kyle. Kyle promises to teach Jack the ways of rock and roll and, as they try to establish themselves, they learn the true secret of rock is a guitar pick made from the tooth of Satan himself, ""The Pick of Destiny"". The film follows their adventures as they go on a quest to find and obtain this pick. Jack Black plays his extreme self, very similar to his character in ""School of Rock"". The songs in the film are very funny. Much of the film is very over-the-top, but that is clearly intentional and very tongue-in-cheek. Although we enjoyed it, I will say that is not for everybody. It is more of a niche film, but if you are a fan of Jack Black, Tenacious D or the culture of hard rock, you will certainly find enough amusing moments to make it worthwhile."

Many reviewers are saying that the movie is a big disappointment compared to the show; that the movie lacked any of the funny aspects/elements of the show...huh? I don't get it. The movie is chock-full of elements and situations from the show. I have watched every single episode of the show, and I can honestly say that only ONE episode (""The Potato Cult"") isn't represented in the movie.<br/><br/>In fact, I'd say that, without watching the show, a viewer of this film will be bored and lost. You get the Open Mic bar MC guy (same actor as in the TV show), D performs it's first song ever on stage and are told to get some new material if they want to play there again (just like in the show)...we have the D fanatic Lee (same actor as in the show), this time, he's a pizza delivery guy, and the boys don't stalk him, but he's still there throughout the movie as their only fan...You've got Dave grohl as Satan (just like in the Tribute video), you've got JB saving KG by diving in front of an evil bolt of lightning (like when Kyle took a bullet for Jack on the show)...and we can't forget about the sasquatch scene when JB eats the mushrooms and trips his face off (similar to the sasquatch episode in the show)...<br/><br/>I'm beginning to lose my faith in this web site. I can totally understand why a casually observer or Tenacious D neophyte wouldn't like this movie, but if you're into the D then THIS MOVIE TOTALLY BANGS YOUR EAR PUSSIES! It was exactly what I thought it would be, and I was laughing like a 14-year old for 90 straight minutes.<br/><br/>I'll put this in all caps to make the point: IF YOU LIKED THE SHOW YOU WILL LOVE THIS MOVIE...plain and simple."

","TENACIOUS D IN 'THE PICK OF DESTINY' 2006 (JACK BLACK, KYLE GASS) DIRECTED BY: LIAM LYNCH ~ THE RUNDOWN: JB-Naysayers beware - the guy is actually very funny and completely proves himself in this absolutely hilarious, immensely entertaining, well-made and completely original comedic masterpiece. ~ In a Utopian society, as*s-kicking movies like this would be the ones winning Oscars and getting acclaim instead of pieces-of-sh*t like Braveheart. The very poor box-office results of POD prove that Jack Black doesn't get the respect he deserves, yet he consistently gives amazing performances. In POD, for instance (which he co-wrote with Gass and Lynch), his usual on-screen energy returns again full-force and he makes the audience share in it whether they want to or not making the film a totally refreshing and involving experience. And at the same time he manages to brilliantly combine that Carrey-like energy with hilarious subtlety in every scene he's in, in every line he delivers, and in every look he gives. He's also a really good singer, and really just an all-around fun actor to watch. ~ The movie itself is also invigorating. Ninety five minutes is usually a little long for a comedy of this type but POD is actually very well paced and very entertaining as well. Furthermore, the movie isn't just for some good laughs; I mean, there's some serious sh*t going on here. The movie could actually be called groundbreaking for its genre and could easily take the title of a modern rock opera with a soundtrack that, by no means meets the caliber of The Wall or Rocky Horror, but definitely gets the job done when it comes to totally rocking. As for the story...well, it's as intelligent as possible without stepping out of its boundaries, and, at times, when accompanied with the music, is genuinely inspirational. I also absorbed the clean, well-polished look of the movie and got an overwhelming impression it was made and orchestrated with care. ~ Overall, 'Pick of Destiny' really just embodies ass-kicking in a tastefully vulgar manner, and I really hope more Tenacious D movies are on the way."
"Donatien3","9","0","0","14 February 2007"," The D reign on the big screen
","For the best part of a decade, Tenacious D, comprising of Jack Black and Kyle Gass, have been rocking out fans worldwide with their unique blend of acoustic melodies, rock, comedy and metal. To most, they are best known for ""Tribute"", their tribute to the greatest song in the world (which some believed was ""Stairway to Heaven""). Now, following a TV show, two albums, and a DVD, comes ""Tenacious D in: the Pick of Destiny"". Black (also known as JB or Jables) and Gass (KG, Kage, Rage, or Rage Kage) play themselves in this fictionalised account of the origin of ""the D"". As expected, the film includes a dozen songs which help narrate the movie, including: Kickapoo, Classico, Baby, History, Master Exploder, Papagenu (he's my sassafras), Dude (I totally miss you), Break in-city (storm the gates), Car Chase City, Beelzeboss (the final showdown), POD, The Metal.<br/><br/>It also boasts plenty of guest starts, both singing (Meatloaf, Ronnie James Dio, Dave Grohl) and non-singing (Ben Stiller, Tim Robbins). The movie starts with a young Black, tied down by his conservative Christian father (Meatloaf), and dreaming of becoming a rock star. Through the advice of Dio, who comes to life in a poster during the performance of ""Kickapoo"". After running away to California (and growing up very quickly), Black meet Gass, who is busking at Venice Beach. Mesmirised by his guitar playing ability, Black tries to get in Gass' band, but is rebuffed. It's only when Black is later attacked by a group of ""A Clockwork Orange""-style thugs, that Gass offers his friendship, and a place to crash. From there, Black begins his training under Gass (including mastering the power slide and the cock push up), and with KG's rent payments from his parents due to be cut off, aim to win the open mic night at their local bar. When their performance of ""History"" doesn't go down as well as they thought, they focus on writing a masterpiece. Struggling to find the perfect song, Black, flicking through Gass' old Rolling Stone magazines, discovers that all of the best guitar players use the same pick. As they try to find the pick in a music store, they discover the origin of the pick through the store's owner (Stiller). Known as the pick of destiny, it was originally one of Satan's teeth, before being carved into the green, ram-shaped pick, now held in the Rock 'n' Roll History Museum. From there, Jables and Kage aim to break into the museum, steal the pick, and become rock gods (as dreamt by Black, whose performance of ""Master Exploder"", complete with all the cock-rock trimmings, is so powerful is causes one guy's head to explode). While Gass' predilection for ladies causes the band to split (Black: What's it going to be Kyle? Tits, or destiny? Gass: Tits.), they eventually reunite, steal the pick, but, just as they're about to get ready for open mic night, they confront Satan (Grohl) and engage in a rock-off. If the devil wins, KG will go back to hell and becomes Satan's bitch, and if the D win, Satan must pay their rent.<br/><br/>Fans of the D will love the references to their first album (including the appearance of Lee, the band's only groupie, Gass telling Black to wake up at the crack of noon to start training {which was featured in ""Rock your Socks""}, cock push-ups, and referring to their rock-off with Satan as the greatest song in the world). For non-fans, the level of humour is similar to that of ""South Park"", ""Borat"" and ""American Pie"", focusing on broad, scatological laughs. In fact, the film is bookended with fart gags by Gass.<br/><br/>Overall, ""The Pick of Destiny"" is, for those who are familiar with the D and their level of humour, an awesome movie, with some genuinely good songs, covering a variety of genres. For people new to the D, it's still worth a look."

","I hadn't expected much from this film. Although I'd enjoyed Tenacious D's first CD, it was clearly Tribute that stood out, and I just couldn't figure out how they'd manage to pad this out into a full movie.<br/><br/>It's really more of a musical, rather than a film featuring some of their music, and in this respect works really well - with the characters rockin' out at various stages throughout the film, and all those little strange tracks you may have heard on the CD's suddenly work perfectly in the movie.<br/><br/>A stand-out moment for me is the actor playing the young Jack Black who had captured the nuances and character of grown up Jack perfectly.<br/><br/>It's an amazingly daft movie, but that's kind of the point.

","Cards on the table: I'm a bit of a Tenacious D fan. I have the album and I loved the series of TV shorts. If you don't know who they are, Tenacious D (or just ""the D"") is the rock band which comprises Jack Black and his buddy Kyle Gass. In the TV show, as in this movie, they are not playing themselves but two characters with the same names. The screen versions of JB and KG are wannabe rock musicians whose sense of self-worth vastly outweighs their actual talent. This film tells the story of their meeting and the formation of the band, as well as their quest for the fabled ""pick of destiny"", a magical plectrum which grants the possessor the abilities of a rock legend.<br/><br/>Many will be familiar with Jack Black from his role in The School Of Rock, and there are similarities here. School of Rock was almost a watered-down version of Tenacious D, with the language toned down for a younger audience. In Pick Of Destiny, both Black and Gass ""let the F-bombs fly"" and the result is mostly successful. The characters are amusing and the movie is stylishly presented, but I found myself wanting more.<br/><br/>Tenacious D are most amusing when they're actually performing. For too long in this movie, they are simply a couple of fat blokes in an apartment, arguing. I would have preferred more songs and less banter. I would even have been happy for them to reprise some of the songs from the album, but as it stands the movie takes too long to get going and the real funny moments are too far apart. There are cameos by Tim Robbins and Ben Stiller, but these rely too much on silly wigs to add much to the proceedings.<br/><br/>I found myself wondering whether the concept of Tenacious D was enough to support a whole movie, but consider this: if Bill and Ted had enough mileage for two successful films, The D should have been able to fill one."

","I am a Ten D fan. I bought this soundtrack before viewing this film so maybe that is why I liked it so much. I laughed so hard you would think I was high. But no, I just got how they wanted to do a quasi musical. I was dismayed at how many times the boom mic came popping down. I counted at least 6, so I decided it was a joke in the movie. Kind of like a running gag. I literally laughed all throughout this film. My husband likens it to the Cheech and Chong movies of the seventies and eighties. The reason the ""pick"" didn't do well in the box office is because you cannot take your bong in to the theater, even though I didn't need it. So that said, I think it's going to have some pretty good DVD sales."

","I think I can objectively understand why viewers who aren't fans of Tenacious D may not enjoy this movie, but for long time fans of the HBO show and the first album, the film will likely be a welcome treat. In case you aren't already a fan and are thinking of seeing the movie I would suggest that you first listen to the soundtrack a few times as the film ends up being an excellent visual companion to the music, which is always the most important thing when it comes to the phenomenon known as Tenacious D. As for the movie itself, there are some lulls but the funny scenes work well enough to make you forget about the down times, and the music is fantastic, and by that I mean hilarious and somehow excellent at the same time. For example, the song ""I'm Just a Baby"" is barely comedic but showcases the actual musical talents of JB and KG. There are also some terrific cameos that fill out the movie. All in all, Tenacious D's Pick of Destiny may not be the most humorous movie of the year (That's probably Clerks 2 or Borat) but it's still a very entertaining time and not a waste of your money."

"DICK STEEL","6","3","8","22 November 2006"," A Nutshell Review: Tenacious D: The Pick of Destiny
","It might be an understatement to say that Jack Black is truly a jack of all trades. Of late his profile has been raised in the various high profile movies he's starring in, ranging from his own comedies like Nacho Libre, which I thought suffered from its own over-hype unfortunately, to blockbusters like King Kong for him to flex some dramatic muscles. I still remember the smaller supporting roles he played in movies like High Fidelity, and now he's probably in the bigger league, having the ability to open a movie with just his name on the marquee.<br/><br/>Tenacious D however, is not a one-man show. It's actually a Jack Black-Kyle Gass vehicle in which they play two absurd rockers conveniently called JB and KG. They're dreaming of the day of making it big in the rock scene, with cash and chicks in their sex, drugs, rock and roll lifestyle. But until then, they have to content with paying the bills, and performing in open mic sessions of smaller joints. And of course, not having sufficient talent to come up with a hit, works against them, though they manage to snag one die hard fan along the way.<br/><br/>Making its jump from TV (was an HBO series), Tenacious D doesn't need you to learn up its history in order to enjoy it, as it begins with a fair bit of background story of how these two friends, with a passion for rock, meet and develop their friendship and partnership in showbiz. In his movie, they're on a quest to seek the legendary Pick of Destiny, which almost every who's who in the annals of rock history is observed to be using, rumoured to be a part of Satan (ok, all you folks who associate loud music with the devil will probably rejoice at his point).<br/><br/>And to humour these folks, JB and KG are your expected foul mouthed characters who pepper their lyrics with bawdy sex lines and vulgarities, which, in my opinion, totally rocks, spoofing the genre of music to a T. To truly enjoy the movie, you'd have to pay close attention to the lyrics and the dialogues between the characters, though some might add that it's a bit of an overkill having almost every line punctuated with Fs or Cs. Laughs are also milked from physical action, with inane bits like the Power Hugs and the Power Slide, which is touted as THE arsenal in any bona fide rock star.<br/><br/>The other highlight of Tenacious D are the hilarious cameo appearances from folks like Tim Robbins, John C Reilly, Ben Stiller (woohoo!) and even Meat Loaf, for some rock cred. Their characters, some unrecognizable until you do a second take, add plenty of colour to this wacky fantastical film.<br/><br/>But Tenacious D blew hot and cold, and there will be points in time where you will just cringe at the delivery, or simply be unimpressed by the predictable ho-hum plot. It's almost as if Bill and Ted had put on loads of weight, and have recycled their excellent adventures into something with a rock element, and replacing Death with Satan himself. Satan here is done in awesome crimson red, much like Hellboy, horns and all, but with plenty more devilish attitude to boot. And yes, Jack Black can sing, really. A genuine performer if you ask me.<br/><br/>If you're someone with a holier than thou attitude, steer real clear from this movie. It's so offensive that those who cannot stand the slightest murmur of insanely vulgar dialogue or set action sequence, will probably suffer from a bad fit. Stay tuned until after the end credits for a scene between JB and KG, where they try to conjure yet another masterpiece in front of their tape recorder."

","I am a fan of Tenacious D and I was hoping against hope that this would be the one movie that would show the true talent of Jack Black and Kyle Gass. I was wrong. I was hoping for a something of the old Tenacious D in this movie, but no, not even the talent of Ben Stiller or Tim Robbins carried any punch. You would think that if you had any friends in the movie industry they would suggest that they think this movie over before giving it the go ahead. When HBO had their half hour shows on, they were fresh, funny shows. I was sad when they were no longer on HBO. But I am sorry that I paid the money for this film, please wait until it comes on HBO.

My sympathy goes out to all of you who have suffered a fate similar to mine, ie. watching Jack Black attempt to entertain the masses. Oh, what we will do for our loved ones. And yet, through all this I have found that we are the ones that, in fact, have the closest ties to Mr. Black, far closer than that of his forlorn fans, God bless them all. For it is us who must suffer the agony and shame of his performances. It is us who know the frustration and humiliation his friends and family must feel after yet another piece of garbage has been produced. All I can say is that Mr Black & Mr Gass are very fortunate that this country is so large. This ensures that no matter how terrible the drivel is that they produce, there are still enough fans to allow them to make a substantial living. In fact, I am hoping they make enough off of this flick to allow them to take a long, long break from film-making. So, Tenacious D, do something for your fans and their long suffering partners, go on hiatus, for a very, very long time. Thanks again for allowing me to finance your comfortable life style. I have never burned money before but I feel that if you decide to do this again, instead of going to see the film, I will just go out back and set fire to a $20.00 bill. I believe I will gain much more satisfaction from doing that than having to watch you again. I will also not have to feel as though I have ENABLED this duo again.)"

","First of all, if your a Tenacious D fan or you like Jack Black then you won't be disappointed with this movie. If you are, then there is something wrong with you. I got to see this film early because of a limited advance screening at my cinema. No one was disappointed with it. They got what they expected, a movie about JB and KG's Tenacious D mixed with some Rock 'N' Roll music the whole way through.<br/><br/>The story starts with JB moving out of his parents house and travelling all the way to Hollywood to confront his dream. He then meets KG there, and is instantly impressed with his music skills. KG is impressed with JB as well, but the problem is that KG has to pay the rent, which he can't without his parents. However, JB reckons both him and KG could easily win a music competition to pay off the money. However, the people aren't impressed with their music at first, so their only hope of impressing them and winning the competition is by travelling 300 miles to the Rock-And-Roll museum, to find ""The Pick Of Destiny"" which will make them become the greatest rock-and-roll band in existence.<br/><br/>Now, I didn't know what to expect at first when I saw this. Well, I was kind of guessing that there was going to be quite a lot of music in this movie, and sure there was a lot of it. The music is impressive, and I could definitely recognise the Tenacious D music in the film. It's also interesting to see this movie, because it shows you how both JB and KG met up, and there's also quite a bit of comedy here. It's a smart movie, but at the same time it felt like an entertaining musical.<br/><br/>So, seeing the Tenacious D movie was not a disappointment at all. If you're expecting a lot of music and funny moments, then Tenacious D: The Pick of Destiny will offer that. If your expecting a serious movie, walk away now, and don't bother with it. Like I said before, Tenacious D and Jack Black fans won't be disappointed with this."

(Btw movies about trying to get Satan's power are rarely funny or meaningful. Learning that you can accomplish something great on your own is much funnier and momentous.) I love Jack Black but was so disappointed in this wannabe musicalthough they are talented musicians, the songs were stupid without anything catchy. Not one song stayed in my mind. I tried to enjoy this as a parody, but it just isn't parody-like enough. There were many opportunities for funny jokes that started off good but then just fell flat. You cannot compare this to Spinal Tap which was very funny with consistent humor as a pure mockumentary.<br/><br/>This script was probably conceived and written while in a drug or alcohol based stupor. Nobody involved who was sober had the guts to tell JB that this movie was only funny to stoners or possibly, some, but not all, Satanist teenagers.<br/><br/>Jack Black should have hired a professional comedy writer and a sober editor. Many lame scenes should have been cut out. Many crude words and gestures should have been cut out. And don't think I was offended by the bad language because I have virgin earsI don't. My husband is Italian from Long Island, and everyone knows they take cursing seriously; in fact they call it Sicilian Poetry. My husband uses the f-word as a verb, a noun, and an adjectiveso I know what I am talking about when I say the language in this movie was awful and crude and made me cringe. But worst of all, the crude language was not funny. I can forgive anything if it is funny or has a good purpose.<br/><br/>This movie was so boring, so pointless, I couldn't believe JB could be a part of something so incredibly worthless. Which brings me up to my final disappointment, the ending was totally lame. I will not detail it because I do not wish to include any spoilers. I will just say that this movie did NOT get better as it went on, it may have even gotten worse Save your money and your time, this movie is not worth it."

","I've been the biggest fan of The D ever since hearing/buying the 2001 album and purchasing/loving the Tenacious D Complete Masterworks DVD. I don't need to go into how much I invested myself into the band and its reign as the Kings of Rock.<br/><br/>After seeing the movie, I feel annoyed and upset. I've been anticipating this movie for two years, and it was a horrible let down.<br/><br/>Personally, the plot was too slow to keep me entertained.<br/><br/>Many of the songs in the movie (and soundtrack) do not have the magic creativity that The D brought with in HBO show and debut album. The big budget production only subtracts from the originality of their talent. Too many songs seemed forced, uninteresting, or unintelligible from any others.<br/><br/>Many gags and references from the HBO show and 2001 album completely took me out of the story. The movie seemed to be reaching out to its existing audience rather than expanding into another level of power.<br/><br/>I don't agree with the direction Liam Lynch took in telling the story, and that's nobody fault but his own. Movies are either entertaining or they are not.<br/><br/>And for me, unfortunately, the movie barely kept me smiling. It's a hard thing to admit, but this movie was bad.<br/><br/>I'm sure other people will love this movie. So I assume that my expectations for this movie were way too high to begin with.<br/><br/>I am seeing them in concert tomorrow night in Chicago at the UIC Pavilion. And I'm sure I will have a better time there."

","Jack Black is not funny. All he seems able to do is shout a lot and throw in the occasional profanity, sometimes for variety doing it with a contrived, ""Deliverance"" type drone in his voice.<br/><br/>Tenacious D, or Tedious D, has to be one of the most insipid, uninspired and uncreative concepts of all time. Music parodies have been done before and have managed to be both musically sound and entertaining comedies - refer to the Bad News films from the UK, or, even better, the numerous efforts of Christopher Guest and his many friends.<br/><br/>If you are somehow entertained by Jack Black's overweight and out of date concepts of what is funny, knock yourself out.

Like JB saying: ""Wow, this place is futuristic!"" when he's about to enter KGs crappy room. The best lines must be: ""That's where the POD is too"" ; ""The pot?"" ; ""The Pick of Destiny!"". All the misunderstood abbreviations are hilarious. I red the 'Mistakes', but I never really saw any of them, although I've seen the movie 13 times, so I'm not disappointed.

","This Is Spinal Tap is a good example of comedy and rock mixed together, here however the two actors existed as a (real) rock band long before this film was made. This is a fictionalised beginnings story, so JB (Jack Black) leaves his religious family and mean father Bud (Meat Loaf) for Hollywood to become an awesome rocker, and he meets guitarist KG (Kyle Gass) on a beach. They know that they are destined for greatness, but to achieve it they go in search for the pick of destiny, a mythical pick made from the Devil's tooth that gives many rockers the power to create great music. In the end, they did get the pick, but it is broken, and they instead defeat Satan (Foo Fighters' David Grohl) in a ""rock-off"", chop off one of his antlers, and it becomes the bong of destiny. Also starring JR Reed as Lee, Ronnie James Dio as Dio, Amy Poehler as Truck Stop Waitress, Tim Robbins as The Stranger, Ben Stiller as Guitar Center Guy, Colin Hanks as Drunk Frat Dude, Junebug's Amy Adams as Gorgeous Woman and John C. Reilly as Sasquatch. Black is a fantastic singer, and both him and Gass are fantastic musicians, all the songs of the film are fantastic. As for the film itself, I can't say it is brilliant, but it is filled with brilliant musical, spoof and slapstick gags. Good!"
"Sanfelix","6","1","2","10 December 2008"," Unimpressive
","Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny can be described best as limp. Hitherto Jack Black has over-acted insanely in the vast majority of his pictures. Now that may sound as though i am condemning him, it gets a laugh, and i am all for getting the laugh. However in Pick of Destiny, Black fails to get the laugh he so anxiously croons for. Supported discouragingly by Kyle Gass, a cameo by Ben Stiller is the only thing that alludes this is a high budget, Hollywood movie.<br/><br/>The plot line is wafer thin, I, like many, was expecting a quasi-factual account of the formation of the 'D', and when I realised this was not to be the case, I accepted that a fictional account of the formation could be equally as intriguing. I was wrong. Horribly wrong. The story staggers from scenario to scenario, leaving the irrefutable taste of dissatisfaction in the mouths of the audience members.<br/><br/>The conclusion (or perhaps more aptly, the dissolution) of the film features Black and Gass, having a rock battle with Satan himself. A resurrection perhaps of Tenacious D's earlier works (Tribute), in a sordid attempt to maintain any quality in the film. Whilst a die-hard 'D' fan would probably sorely disagree with me, the witless, embarrassingly unfunny and, in fact, musically challenged ending of the movie is a perfect encapsulation of what a waste of your time the preceding 1 1/4 hours were.<br/><br/>The only thing worse for Tenacious D than releasing this film, was releasing the soundtrack weeks before."

","Berated by his father over his love of rock just one time too many, JB is convinced that a vision of rock has summoned him to Hollywood. Having been to all of the Hollywood's in the US, JB finally washes up in Los Angeles where he comes across ""rock God"" KG playing for change on the boardwalk. Seeing the boy's adoration, KG takes JB in and teaches him the way of rock in return for chores. When it transpires that KG is far from the person he seemed to be, a friendship has been formed and the stars appear to be in alignment for them to achieve greatness. They only lack on thing  the legendary pick of destiny. And so a quest begins.<br/><br/>This is one of those films that, if you really get into it, you'll probably be rolling with laugher and find it a great joy from start to finish. This group is the minority of people though and the rest of us will find a comedy that is mostly amusingly silly and occasionally misfiring. It is a very fine line it walks as the genre of rock opera is a spoof in itself so really this film does feel like it is trying to spoof something that doesn't need spoofing. That said the overblown narrative and songs make for a silly and engaging comedy, with plenty of outrageous moments catching me laughing. Sadly too often the line is crossed and it spills over into the overly-silly or puerile. I was surprised by how well it walked this line because to me the trailer had made it look terrible. Watching it from the start though, it does create an atmosphere in which it does work  which it obviously never got in the trailer.<br/><br/>I'm not a massive fan of Jack Black but within this creation his OTT rock performance works. He will still annoy those that get annoyed by his basic performance but those people will be unlikely to enjoy any part of the film since it is entirely in his image. Of course not to take away from Glass, who is pretty much his equal here and is a bit better than Black if only because his performance is a bit more restrained. Support is mostly just a handful of fun cameos featuring Meat Loaf, Grohl, Stiller and Robins among a few others.<br/><br/>Overall then, this is a silly, overblown affair but it does work if you buy into it as a spoof version of a rock opera epic. It isn't as hilarious as some would have you believe but it is sporadically funny once it gets you in the mood and, while far from brilliant, it is an enjoyably silly film."
"The_Void","8","1","2","31 January 2008"," A hilarious fun time from start to finish
","The obvious thing to say about this film is that it 'rocks'. And that's an obvious thing to say because it does rock, in fact The Pick of Destiny rocks hard! The style and feel of the film will be familiar to anyone who has seen the TV show or listens to the music; being a big fan of both, this is a bonus for me. Some ideas from the television series are reused for the film, although most of it is new material and the format does translate very well to the big screen. The film is a cross between comedy and musical and the two are combined; Tenacious D made a new album for this film and the songs are very well used. Anyone who knows Tenacious D knows that they're the self-professed greatest band of all time, and the plot focuses on that idea. We watch as JB (Jack Black) travels to Hollywood where he meets KG (Kyle Gass). The two form the band 'Tenacious D' but soon become frustrated at the fact that they're not as awesome as the likes of Dio and AC/DC. The reason for these bands' awesomeness soon becomes apparent, and JB and KG end on the trail of the legendary 'pick of destiny'...<br/><br/>Jack Black is constantly proving how great he is at carrying films, and since the plot in this one is paper thin; this fact does really help the movie. Jack Black clearly enjoys himself throughout the film and it's great to watch. Kyle Gass is the less boisterous of the pair and has a good chemistry with Black. The supporting cast is decent too; Hollywood stars Tim Robbins and Ben Stiller have amusing cameos, while rockers Ronny James Dio and Dave Grohl also have small roles. As mentioned, there really isn't much plot; but that's not a bad thing. There are plenty of jokes and absurd situations to keep things moving. It's the music that provides the most laughs; the sequence featuring the song 'Break-In City' being my favourite part of the movie. The film doesn't take itself seriously for a minute and it is a lot of fun to witness it for that reason. Naturally, there's no point to the film, but if you're looking for a film with a point; this quite clearly isn't the film to see. Overall, this movie is a must for fans of the band and/or the show; the film is unlikely to appeal to everyone, but it hit the spot for me."
"morbius82000","7","1","2","25 December 2007"," School of Rock with swearing
","That's what I think of when I watch this movie. Kind of a nastier version of school of rock. Both are Jack Black basically being himself as the opera style singer loving all things over the top in rock music. There are very few people who can deliver with the kind of energy and passion that Jack does, it is mesmerizing to watch. When I first saw the HBO series on Tenacious D I instantly identified with the characters, as I have frequented many an open stage in my life. It is a definite sub culture of great and not so great talent. Just the fact that JB and KG wright these epic ""monster jam"" songs on two acoustic guitars is a stroke of genius. The fact that they can actually pull it off is the most impressive part.<br/><br/>There are some moments of genius in ""The Pick of Destiny"" (the gig simulator, the ketchup pentagram trying to summon a new song ""you're judging yourself, that's why that riff sucks"") but overall the movie is a little dull and I was getting tired of Jack Black rhyming everything with ""suck a c*ck"". Thankfully the movie stays on target throughout without any pointless love interests or anything like that, and if you are fan of the D, you probably won't be disappointed. Dave Grohl is particularly good as the Devil. Cameos by Ben Stiller (the guitar tech that everyone has met once in their life) and Tim Robbins breathe much needed life into the story once it starts to sag a little. Tim Robbins Russian inspired character reminds me a little bit of Mark Mckinney's taxi driver character from Kids in the Hall, but he still is brilliant.<br/><br/>A fun escapist juvenile trip into rockout land. Long live Jables and the Kage."

Well, for some reason it seems that people who had no interest in either the music or comedy of Tenacious D thought they'd come out to see this movie. ""Oh, Jack Black! He was in Nacho Libre!

","Young Jack Black leaves home to start a career in rock. He meets Kyle Gass, and together they go in search of the Pick of Destiny, a legendary guitar pick that allowed rock stars to play the greatest songs in the history of music. But someone else also wants the pick: Satan.<br/><br/>This film has one major flaw: much of it is just a rehash of past songs, music videos and the television show. Dave Grohl has already appeared as Satan, Sasquatch (played by John C. Reilly) has already been their drummer, they found silver-striped mushrooms in ""Jesus Ranch""... so the writing of this film probably only took about twenty minutes, which is sad because it showed up about five years after the peak of their popularity. Can I blame director Liam Lynch (""Sifl and Olly"", ""Jesus is Magic"")? Maybe not...<br/><br/>Disregarding that flaw, I really loved this. There were some stupid parts, but the film worked well as a musical and the tunes kept the plot flowing smoothly. I already thought I fell in love with it after the first five minutes: Meat Loaf as Jack Black's religious father (perfect), a kid who looks exactly like Black playing him as a youngster (perfect), and then the arrival of Dio (more perfect than perfect). Throw in Tim Robbins later (one of the greatest actors of my our time) and you have a real winner in the cameo department (did I mention Ben Stiller or Amy Poehler or Colin Hanks?).<br/><br/>If you don't like Tenacious D, you might not like the humor of this film. I really can't say, as I already really enjoy the music of the D. Not sure I think Jack Black is a great actor (he's a bit obnoxious), but I can't deny he plays a fairly accurate Jack Black...<br/><br/>If you are a fan, or are willing to be, give this one a try. Unless you have an absolute hatred for the D, I think you'll like it. I was sober and I liked it. At least, I think I was sober. Anyway, it's a million times better than ""Envy"" (which I just reviewed), so if you liked that, this is liable to rock your flipping socks off."

A veritable Gospel According to Tenacious D.<br/><br/>In the beginning there was Lil' JB (Troy Gentile, playing young Jack Black like electrodes attached to testicles) whose father (Meat Loaf) would not let him rock. So he petitions the master piper, Dio, for advice (just to hear Ronnie James let fly, ""Go - my - son - and - ROOOOOCK!"" is worth the journey), following his dream to Venice Beach where verily he didst meet solo minstrel, KG, in a conflagration of Bach, Beethoven and Mozart. Thus - with Jack Black's rocket-fueled psycho-tenor and Kyle Gass's axe-tastic acoustic - was Tenacious D born from rock thunder and stale pizza.<br/><br/>In contemplating how their legendary heroes could be so barbecue tasty, they notice that all - Rhoads, Van Halen, Young, Townshend - wield the same guitar pick.<br/><br/>After The Tale of The Pick is revealed by a grizzled master of disaster (Ben Stiller) at - where else? - Guitar Center, they begin The Quest to acquire The Pick, to chase down the Creamy Rock Greatness that it promises.<br/><br/>In a movie carved from the same black sabbatical cloth as *School of Rock*, Jack Black once again flies slam-banging, accompanied by the rock soundtrack of MY generation. It is a wonder to behold this hurricane of adrenalin, his every minute action tailored for maximum overdrive. <br/><br/>Not since Martin & Lewis has there been a comedy duo so adroit; like Martin and Lewis, the seeming ""straight man"" - Kyle Gass - is a master comedian himself, knowing his place in the matchup and lending impeccable timing to the mix. And his guitar-work is freakishly astounding.<br/><br/>Splashy standout tracks are Kickapoo (the opener), Classico (Gass's composite arrangement of Bouree in E Minor, Fur Elise and Eine Kliene Nacht Muzik, with Black inserting as many filthy lyrics as humanly possible), Master Exploder (the metal fantasy sequence) and Beelzeboss (the final showdown with Satan, played by a very outraged, very red Dave Grohl).<br/><br/>Though Spinal Tap was the progenitor of this genre of rock obliviousness, the lines are fast blurring between the cheese and the rock. Master Exploder scares us into realizing that the parody(Tenacious D) are actually more talented than the ""serious rockers"" they spoof - this is what the Cinderellas and the Y&Ts and the Great Whites actually look and sound like! Ultimately, Master Exploder - featuring Black banshee-wailing as ominously as Ozzy or Chris Cornell - is Real Rock. Shot from the engorged penis of hell.<br/><br/>If you were weaned on metal, if you are fueled by Satan, you'll love Pick of Destiny and find much to be amused by: from the Guitarway to Heaven (director Liam Lynch could not secure the rights from Page and Plant to actually call it the ""Stairway""), to the subscription rock magazines, to the big-talking small-fry (Kyle comporting himself around his sh*t-hole like it was a palace that ""his albums"" were paying for), to the rock idol worship, to the Clockwork Orange reference, to the Power Slide from The Who's Wont Get Fooled Again (which, as any rock geek will tell you, is the most awesome moment in that song), to the fact that Stiller's rock burnout sage cites Robert Johnson as the first owner of The Pick of Destiny (very cool, considering that Johnson is regarded as the first true guitar god, the man who started rock rolling through the blues).<br/><br/>Paying homage to their wonderboy HBO series, a wealth of familiar faces and situations appear, from the open-mic gig (with announcer Paul F. Tompkins raising ambivalence to suicidal heights), to policeman Kirk Ward, to meeting Lee and battling Satan, with a host of cameos, from Amy Poehler, Tim Robbins (doing his Rade Sherbedgia), Colin Hanks - and Sasquatch! <br/><br/>In the most beauteous twist of all, Tenacious D's quest to worship Satan through the majesty of rock leads them to a great inner truth: that ""Satan is not in a guitar pick - he's in all our hearts."" <br/><br/>How right they are.<br/><br/>(Read this review unabridged at: www.poffysmoviemania.com/TenaciousDPickOfDestiny.html)"

Besides, what else was I going to do for eight hours?

Already I was enjoying it, and I was ready for more of a good movie to make me laugh.<br/><br/>Tenacious D did more than just make me laugh--it made me want to spend hundreds of dollars to see this amazing band in concert. It made me want to learn all the songs on guitar and play them. It made me laugh HARD (especially the scene where JB gets high on shrooms, absolutely classic!) at the essence of stupid humor, the type of humor that takes a two-year-old's brain to comprehend but a master filmmaker to craft into a good movie. They did it with Dumb and Dumber. They did it with Anchorman. And now they've done it with Tenacious D: The Pick of Destiny. Not only that--I can't stop watching the damn film! I found it on the Amazon marketplace for $10 and spend hours extracting $10 in coins lying on my closet floor. Oh, man, owning this movie was totally worth spending that hour kneeling down in my closet.<br/><br/>The storyline's absolutely ridiculous. But for some reason you appreciate JB and KG's majestic quest to acquire the Pick of Destiny, a magical guitar pick that came from Satan's chipped tooth itself. In fact--this movie is almost like a reincarnation of This Is Spinal Tap--it rocks out HARD, makes you laugh, make you gasp in shock, and makes fun of rock music in special, intimate ways. In Tenacious D, it's a bunch of funny Satanic imagery.<br/><br/>This is a movie not to be missed by any fan of stupid humor movies, Jack Black, the band Tenacious D, or anyone who likes to ROCK.

","A fitting tribute for the self-professed ""World's greatest rock band"", Tenacious D's peculiar brand of epic song mockeries are hilariously adapted to feature film. In what could be a front-running candidate for the funniest musical film since Spinal Tap, The Pick of Destiny will only suffer criticism when paired with a non-fan who is not expecting a musical. Anyone who is familiar with the insane energy and zany humor of the band will feel right at home however, with the non-stop whirlwind songs relaying one of the D's earliest missions. In rolling out this prequel to their HBO cult classic show, stuffed with medieval imagery, marijuana homages, and foul language, Kyle Gass, Jack Black, and director Liam Lynch manage to get the insane tone of this wild band just right, producing one of the most consistently funny and clever musicals in memory. <br/><br/>Though the film is easily accessible to anyone with even the slightest interest in rock music, the constant in-house jokes and wealth of Tenacious D material sang during the movie will most likely alienate closed-minded viewers who had no idea they were getting themselves into this massively warped songbook. Anyone craving a melodic edge in their dialog however may be rewarded past expectation with Black's never-ending surplus of energy, singing about the bizarre events as they unfold on screen, which would just remain insane ramblings if not paired with the acoustic alchemy of partner Gass. Throughout the short music film, the dark, edgy material weaves it's way through the pretend-epic's engagingly cute storyline, describing the meeting of these two rhythm masters, up to their fateful journey to acquire the legendary pick the title speaks of. <br/><br/>The script may feel a little underdeveloped aside from all the concentrated jamming, but the irreverent duo's hilarious bickering will make you all but forget there even needs to be a plot. As long as one expects a musical, one as warped as Tenacious D fans have come to expect, there is no denying the inherent charm and unique flavor that this accomplished goof provides; it is simply the majority of movie watchers out there, who don't have any idea about what this band does, that may find all inherent joys throughout the fun-paced film sadly overlooked."

","The Tenacious D movie is every bit as good as I could have wished for it to be. After the lukewarm reception it had gotten in the States and the not so promising trailer I had already prepared myself for a mediocre comedy experience. This movie was not mediocre. It's a fanboys dream come true. And maybe that's just what made it such a commercial failure. This movie is for fans who know the Tenacious universe. Any casual viewer will probably feel like they don't get the in-joke.<br/><br/>Screw it. I'm not a casual viewer. I'm a fan of the D and as such I enjoyed every minute of this great cinematic adventure of JB and KG. Somehow the guys managed to put in all the things that have been important to their history so far: Dio, Sasquatch, Lee, the Devil, their silly announcements in the local club they sometimes play in and, of course, cock push-ups. Speaking of cocks, ""POD"" is nowhere near as obscene as the little short movies they put on their ""Complete Masterworks"" DVD. There may be the occasional fart joke, but sperm-orgies and nudity have been omitted, thankfully.<br/><br/>The cameos are funny as hell, from Meat Loaf and Ronnie James Dio, to Ben Stiller, Tim Robbins, John C. Reilly and, of course, Dave Grohl. And Troy Gentile who played Jack Black as a little kid just absolutely nailed the part. He looks so uncanningly like JB that it's almost hard to believe there's no relation between the two. The songs rawk and work even better in the context of the movie than they do on CD. And the story itself is fast paced and full of precious little details. I loved the way JB and KG first met and how JB went from KG's apprentice to his huffy boss. The highlight of the movie, however, is the scene in which The D pay tribute to Pete Townshend's legendary power slide during ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" from the ""The Kids Are Alright""-movie.<br/><br/>""Tenacious D: The Pick Of Destiny"" shows how much fun it is to be a rock fan. In a lot of ways it's like the ""Bill & Ted"" movies. Silly, mindless fun with a huge cult factor. This is one of the very best movies with a real band playing the main roles. The only downside is, that it was such a bomb that we're probably never going to get a sequel. That's a sad thing, but then we do have this great movie and when the DVD is released we can watch it over and over and over again.<br/><br/>Tenacious D! They reign!"

","This Movie is awesome! All the Journals voted the movie very badly. And I don't know why. All Characters are brilliant and the Story is much better then all the mainstream movies I've seen in the last Years. It's very funny and has also action in it! In a view scenes I got tears in my eyes cause of laughing. While watching it you'll see: Man, they work very hard on this movie. they make an effort and the result is marvelous!!! <br/><br/>The special effects are better then in the last Star Wars movies^^<br/><br/>Yes, they are using ""bad words"". Yes, the movie contains drugs.<br/><br/>But without this it wouldn't be the D-Style. And it wouldn't work. This style is a genius form of truthfulness that makes the story and above all the Characters more realistic. <br/><br/>The Movie contains, besides the amusing, 2 important things: ""Friendship"" and ""if you have a dream: risk something, fight for it"".<br/><br/>If this Movie becomes no success in the Theaters, then it is the blame of the Media. Not enough positive recommends and not enough commercials.<br/><br/>Watch this Movie cause it ROCKS! ""This is just a Tribute"" :)"

","One of the funniest (if not best) movies of the year goes virtually unnoticed by everybody. This happened twice this year. First with ""Idiocracy"", Mike Judge's follow up to ""Office Space"", and now with this, quite possibly the most rocking sh1t ever put on film. It may be sloppy, it may be thrown together with no care for proper film technique, but I'll be damned if I didn't laugh my ass off both times I saw it. I don't intend to give anything away, I just think it's worth noting that I was completely sober the first time I saw it and still thought it was kickass. I would also like to say that I appreciate all kinds of film and usually look down on trashy stoner comedies like ""Harold and Kumar"" and ""Dude, Where's My Car"". This is nothing like those lame ass movies."

","Yes, before viewing this golden nugget of a movie I was a Tenacious D fan. However, I wasn't completely impressed with the Tenacious D: The Complete Masterworks DVD. I enjoyed it, but it wasn't exceptional. The movie, however, was one of the most well done comedies I have ever seen. It was hilarious and outrageous, and was far better than any other Jack Black comedy, even School of Rock and Nacho Libre. You can really tell that this project meant a lot to both JB and KG and it definitely shows, because not only did this movie put a split in my side from laughing so hard, it blew my mind AND warmed my heart. It is a shame that it hasn't even cracked the top ten at the box office, because it is definitely worthy. GO see this movie."

","For those who loved ""Wayne's World""...""The Blues Brothers""...and hell, even ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" you will find much to like (but probably not love) in ""Tenacious D: The Pick of Destiny,"" a fictional epic about the formation of the JB (Jack Black)/KG (Kyle Gass) band. Two out-of-work losers with a love for rock n'roll are met with a dilemma when KG's long-supportive mother stops sending him rent checks; JB and KG make tracks for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame after a sage music-store clerk (an inspired Ben Stiller) tells them about the titular pick (a funny animated-tapestry sequence gives the backstory). Along the way, our zeroes encounter a snaggle-toothed stranger (a game Tim Robbins), Sasquatch, stoner security guards, sorority chicks, and Satan himself (an ironically-cast Dave Grohl), in a climactic sequence that has to be seen to be believed (and preferably played at high volume). Rarely do I see comedies in the theater, but ""Pick"" is an extremely nice change of pace...it may not go up to 11, but it hums a tune both crude and clever for a good 90 minutes. And the songs are inspired low-brow hilarity. Recommended.<br/><br/>6.5 out of 10"

Some of the most twisted events took place in that movie....the big foot part....the mushroom part....and in the end when they did the rock off against the Devil. A classic formed in Tenacious D....one of the best films I have seen in a long time. The last couple things I saw in the theater were stupid..but this movie rocks. This really made me laugh hard. The whole basis is Jack Black runs of to find his rock partner in Los Angeles. His partner is Kyle Gass and man who has always been bald.

All this with the Humor of Teancous D makes this the best movie ever.<br/><br/>The Cameos are great right of the back, with Meat Loaf and Dio singing to JB. Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins are great, I really like Tim Robbins character. You also find out who Satan really is! The Music and Musical references are hilarious and Awesome.

"phillipstephenso","2","5","25","16 November 2006"," Whoa, Dude!
","Jack Black continues his psychopathic obsession with satirizing the great rock stars in this preposterous farce of a movie. He and his partner are Tenacious D, which is the most profane, raucous, drugged, and filthy rock band of all time. If you like this kind of Neanderthal farce filled with all of the sophomoric paraphernalia of rock bands, more power to you. And, if you love drugs and gratuitous profanity of the most juvenile nature, you will love this film. But if you have more things on your mind than which rock star wields the most demonic pick on a guitar, please avoid this film like the bubonic plague or the AIDS virus. The rock gods are fully satirical in their own silly majesty without depending on disgusting and fat boys like Black to characterize them. I guess Black does seem to be converted to a hatred of Satan in the end. But, those creepies and lifeforms with French-fried brains who worship rock and drug paraphernalia shouldn't be expected to appreciate this nuance of salvation through grace. Just say no! There are some nice-looking extras in this film, though. And, Satan really puts on an impressive rock show in this film, unlike the pathetic Tenacious D."

I can't believe this is called a musical...what a waste of film and a waste of my time. Definitely the worst movie of the year. Nacho Libre wasn't much better. If Jack Black wants to be a singer, I wish he would go on the road and leave the movie industry to actors and actresses that can act and are worth watching. 45 minutes into the film I was fast forwarding it to hopefully find something worth watching.

"z_dude100","3","7","42","9 November 2006"," A Disappointing Tenacious D...
","I saw the film two days ago at an advanced screening on my campus, and was extremely disappointed. Although I must confess I am only a casual Tenacious D fan (I find some of their songs and skits to be pretty funny), this film wasn't nearly as irreverent as the show. In my opinion, I found it to be detrimental, as the jokes seemed cliché and recycled. The cameo appearances, especially that of Tim Robbins, were the bright points of the film. As for the reception of the audience, lets just say that they tried to give us tickets to the red carpet world premiere of the film and most people turned them down.<br/><br/>Everyone's been asking about the rating, and I must say that the film seemed like a rather weak ""R,"" due pretty much only to language and drug use."

","""JB"" (Jack Black) runs away from home after being spanked by his father (Meat Loaf). Years later, he finally makes it to Hollywood and comes across the greatest guitar player he has ever heard, ""KG"" (Kyle Glass).<br/><br/>After a little squabble, the two decide join forces and perform at an Open Mic Night at what appears to be a less than popular bar. To their shock, they don't do that good.<br/><br/>Back at their less than spectacular apartment, the two are trying to figure out what the legends of rock have that they don't while looking at some old magazines. It's only then that they realize that the guitarists on the covers have the same guitar pick.<br/><br/>While trying to look for a similar pick, an employee of the music shop (Ben Stiller, who is also the film's Executive Producer) tells him the ancient story of the ""Pick of Destiny"", of which they seek. This employee, who has long gray hair and thick glasses, also tells them that the pick, which was made from Satan's tooth, is in a history of rock museum.<br/><br/>Now the two pot-smoking losers with delusions of grandeur goes on a music-filled adventure to steal the pick.<br/><br/>Let me say this up front, if you are not a fan of Tenacious D, which gave us the comedy actor Jack Black, then you should skip this one. I am not a fan of these two, and only watched it because it was suggested by Flixter.com.<br/><br/>The jokes, for the most part, produce silence more than anything. I laughed at maybe three of the jokes, and chuckled at a few others. Tenacious D is only for a certain audience, of which I am not.<br/><br/>This movie lags in numerous places, and this is where the worst jokes appear. And let me say that, when Black and Glass are not working off one another, they are completely lost on screen.<br/><br/>All the songs in this movie is by and performed by Tenacious D. Many of the songs perfectly advance the storyline by describing their adventures at the time in the film. However, I felt that the songs sounded too similar to be told apart.<br/><br/>Another problem with this film is that the language will turn off a lot of people. There are a lot of four-letter words in this film. There are also some drug references. I would not recommend this for children.<br/><br/>Part of Tenacious D's schtick is that Black is in your face, and Glass stays in his shadows for the most part. This is how they are in this movie, and it doesn't really work. Now, this may have been part of the act, but I felt that Glass just didn't want to be there. In one scene, he performs his (background) lyrics at a party and he just can't work alone.<br/><br/>Tenacious D are supposedly rock fans in real life, and have maybe two rock legends in the movie, I lost count because I was so bored with this film. Personally, I would have liked to have seen more rock legends and icons in the film. However, we don't get that.<br/><br/>What we do get is a movie filled with completely lame jokes, lots of foul language, a lackluster script. You also get horrible acting, and an unoriginal story. However, you get some pretty good songs that pretty much sound the same.<br/><br/>The story could have been promising, but many of the scenes appeared to have been added into the film at the last second. This is somewhat similar to The Blues Brothers movie many years ago, but the Blues Brothers had a much bigger following -- and two songs on the Billboard music charts. Tenacious D only has a small following, with a few HBO specials under their belt. And, unlike The Blues Brothers, the comedy is not well thought out at all.<br/><br/>If you are a hard core fan of Tenacious D, then I suggest you check it out. However, like most of the movie audience when this film was released to theaters, I would say avoid this one. Save your money on this one, folks."
"jellyneckr","Null","4","23","9 March 2007"," Unwatchable
","The highlight of the terribly titled Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny comes before the New Line Cinema logo even appears on screen. In a cartoon animated by John K of Ren & Stimpy fame, Jack Black and Kyle Gass fly off the force of their own flatulence. It's stupid, it's immature, and surprisingly funny. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is just the first two. Once the live-action begins, the quality declines at an unstoppable rate. Jack Black and Kyle Gass, capable of being hilarious in small doses, have managed to create a motion picture so juvenile and limp that one would expect it was assembled by putting together ideas the duo came up with while in seventh grade. Their performances also are of middle school quality. Neither of them show any of the charm they have shown in previous works. A pointless cameo by Ben Stiller seems like an attempt of temporarily saving the audience. Only problem is, like the rest of the flick, it doesn't work. 1/10 (I'm giving a point for the aforementioned opening)."

Most importantly, the increasingly obese, never funny, and awesomely mediocre Kevin Smith never appears in the film.<br/><br/>Fat Black's amphetamine fueled antics wear thin fast, and the high-school-play level writing doesn't help.

","Jack Black has proved his talent and has been in many great movies, especially Orange County & Saving Silverman.

All the hype for nothing! If you're a fan of Jack Black, like I was, I can guarantee you'll hate this movie (unless you enjoy pointless humor that's incredibly forced and doesn't work). The only way to know how bad it is is to see it for yourself and I dare you."

","Tenacious D is Jack Black's side line project. A rock band probably inspired by Jack's performance in 'School of Rock' where after he thought he could form a rock and roll band. The circles within circles of then actually making a documentary film about the band, homage to Spinal Tap takes the joke too far unless its held up with a really good comedy. The theme of the film is trying to make the next rock and roll anthem. Jack does his usual over the top performance which his confident performance allows him to pull off without annoying the audience. This starts quite funny and could have contained but like the Borat movie they introduce a plot line that lets the film down. The music is usually better than the comedy on offer here."

Of course, I have a lot of kinds of movies--just look at a wide span of my ratings, and you'd think that I get a dollar for every high score I give out, but what I mean is this is the kind of movie that resonates with me on a creative level--it's in the vein of my fiction writing, it's what just comes naturally from me (not in the vein of my non-fiction writing, which is boring and crappy). The weird thing is that this movie has been well received, whereas I can't get agents to not ignore me even when I kidnap their female offspring and make them my love slaves, but on the other hand, I don't have one of those cool birthmarks on my ass.<br/><br/>Which is all to point out why this film so easily won me over. I would have liked The Big Bounce (2004) too if only Sara Foster would have had a cool birthmark on her ass.<br/><br/>Writers/stars/rock-out-with-cock-out masters Jack Black and Kyle Gass and director Liam Lynch waste no time getting as ridiculous as possible, and they sustain it for most of the film. I had to start hitting pause so I could laugh from the first scene. The idea of narrating the film through absurd song lyrics is funny and is executed in a way that's even funnier than the idea, even though that was funny in the first place, and you couldn't really film an idea, so maybe it's funny to try to talk about it as if I observed it, and I really shouldn't have tried to make the distinction. Let me just mention the hilarious cameos from Ben Stiller, Tim Robbins, John C. Reilly, Dave Grohl, etc. in a completely arbitrary way instead, and also put in my vote to Hollywood for more wacky low-budget surreal fantasy scenes spawned by mushrooms.<br/><br/>You can also tell that Black and Gass really do love the kind of music they're spoofing, which gives the film an earnestness that's a pleasantly odd fit with the absurdities. They really do love fat schlubs with bad wigs playing rushed and emotionless versions of Bourée on Venice Beach."

A group in the audience I watched the film with was agreeing in hilarity. Else...<br/><br/>Admittedly I have yet to see a single episode of the ""Tenacious D"" TV series (the closest possible occurrence is if the local cable channel Jack TV lands a deal with HBO but it seems unlikely) although I've seen Jack Black enough to say that his mannerisms and style of humor are usually hit-and-miss, and ""The Pick of Destiny"" (directed by Liam Lynch) falls just about somewhere in the middle.<br/><br/>Here, Black is - eh - JB, an aspiring rock artist who once ran away from his hometown of Kickapoo, Missouri as a young child and reaches Hollywood, Los Angeles several years later in his mid-thirties. Here, he meets KG (Kyle Gass, the other member of the eponymous band), whom he forms the band Tenacious D with. Together, they embark on a road trip to The Museum of Rock and Roll in Sacramento in search of the legendary guitar pick made from the devil's tooth, which they believe is the secret to their musical career's success.<br/><br/>Less ""School of Rock"" than ""Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle,"" ""The Pick of Destiny"" feels like a stoner comedy that's mostly running on fumes as basically, it simply involves a string of gags involving c**k push-ups and a psychedelic Jack Black doing an ala-Happy Pap-Pap song number with Sasquatch. A few of which work (I especially liked Tim Robbins' cameo), but they are far outweighed by those that don't, resulting in several dragging moments. If you're into the band's music, you might have a rocking time (pardon the pun... couldn't resist) as there are oodles to be had here, but that's as far as recommendations go. If you're not a fan or aren't into gritty and foul-mouthed humor, you might not get as much amusement as you're supposed to.<br/><br/>Simply put, if you believe there's enough reason for you to warrant this movie a shot, who knows, you may find yourself enjoying it.

The movie takes itself about as seriously as the hard rocking duo do on tape and in real life, and is filled with pure rock n' roll nonsense. What I loved most was the way Jack and Kyle started off quite different in the film from what we have all come to expect from the D, but then through a brief series of hilarious events quickly become the laid back yet high strung, bud burning yet highly ambitious pair Tenacious D fans have come to love. I was laughing to the point of tears throughout the entire film, and my girlfriend who is only a casual fan of D's music, was giggling like I've rarely seen her.<br/><br/>Basically, if you're looking for something insightful and meaningful you are probably better off seeing something like The Fountain. But if you simply want to laugh and rock out (the movie is a bit of a musical, with the D's signature sound throughout the entire thing), The Pick of Destiny is purely a good time, poking fun at all the aspiring rock musicians looking to make it big any way they can and portraying the simple yet powerful bond of two friends sharing the same vision of rock n' roll greatness."

If you haven't seen those, go right now and pick up a copy of The Complete Masterworks by Tenacious D, which also has an amazing live show on it, and as a package is pretty much worth 4 times what you pay for it. That aside, I was stoked to see that this movie was finally being released, and lo and behold at Michigan State they held a free sneak peek, which I just returned from. Overall, it was a bit uneven, but still rocked pretty hard. The cameos by Stiller and Robbins were both great, and Dave Grohl as Satan was awesome. A few of the shots are set up exactly like shots in the original sketches, and fans of the original will constantly be going ""ah!"". I was particularly pleased that they brought back the nightclub host, and Lee. The songs were pretty sweet as well, though you only get abridged versions of many of them and I am still waiting to hear the full album. From what I've just heard from the film, they aren't nearly as good as the original batch though (and the history of tenacious d, an old song, makes a couple of appearances). Jack Black is kinetic and basically lights up the screen, this has always been true and is never more true then when he has KG at his side. They definitely put on a great show here, and it's well worth your time to check out, and if you're a D fan then you really have no choice. As long as you're not easily offended, it's impossible to not love the D. Tongue-in-cheek lyrics aside, its clear they really do have an amazing love for rock, and they are more than capable of convincing anyone of it (and giving you a rockin good time along the way)."

The plot is virtually irrelevant as the movie leads the duo in search of the sacred 'Pick of Destiny,' molded from the orifice of Satan himself. With fantastically rancid lyrics and thunderous overtures, this movie delivers the most tenacious of the D flavor fans have come to love. JB offers his usual comedic excellence, but also exemplifies his range of character in the poignant scene of his first ""on stage"" performance. KG lends his usual perfunctory performance to complement the outrageous ambitions of JB's search for the Pick of Destiny and eternal rock glory.

","I'm amazed by some of the reviews I read for this movie. The idea that this collection of heavy metal injokes amounts to a great film is laughable. It's more laughable than the movie.<br/><br/>I am a fan of Jack Black. I really enjoyed him in King Kong and a number of other pictures, but he's allowed his persona to go to his head. The plot revolves around the title's Pick of Destiny, which is supposed to have come from the tooth of Satan himself and will bestow him with magical rock powers. Funny idea, but they do nothing with it.<br/><br/>Instead, this becomes a bad buddy picture. And the songs that Black has built it around try so hard to ""rock"" that they come across as juvenile. They use the f word constantly, as if this is a badge of rock honor and let's not get into all the stupid sex jokes. A ten year old might find these hilarious, but I demand a little more of a comedy."

","Jack Black and Kyle Gass play fantasy versions of themselves in this comic showcase for their side-band Tenacious D, an art-rock outfit with satirical, barbed lyrics. An ex-runaway obsessed with heavy metal and a beachfront-living, pot-smoking slacker who pretends he's a rock god meet and form a band (the birthmarks on both their butt-cheeks form the group's moniker). Opening with a funny prologue which apes a Twisted Sister video from the '80s, ""The Pick of Destiny"" is a fairly well-produced movie aimed at older kids; it occasionally resembles nothing more than a middle-aged variation of ""Wayne's World"", with jokey-stoner interludes and a climactic bout with Beelzebub himself, yet Black and Gass have an enormously comfortable rapport (they also acted as producers, co-wrote the script and all the music). The target audience will obviously go for it, though inspiration is a bit low, particularly in the second-half (just about the time our heroes impulsively outrun the cops in a student-driver car). The music sequences are far more successful than the attempts at movie satire and, for the first thirty minutes or so, Jack Black's manic enthusiasm is infectious. *1/2 from ****"

If that doesn't say enough as to how brainless this movie is, think about Jack Black singing for about 20 minutes of the movie and that being its selling point. If you actually like listening to Tenacious D because of their musical prowess, then knock yourself out and buy the soundtrack. Don't waste your time with this though.

"crown-16","4","1","5","17 October 2010"," It had such potential
","Someone wrote: ""If you have no knowledge of Tenacious D, and their humor, do not watch it, because you will not like it."". <br/><br/>This was the root of the problems. I had no knowledge of Tenacious D and while I won't go as far as to say I hated the movie, it was made more for their fans than for the general public.<br/><br/>What gets me is that it had such a potential. It had a great concept, it had Jack Black and the chance to rock (literally) School of Rock preceded it so here was a blueprint of how to make a great movie and even improve on it. Instead they went downhill.<br/><br/>What went wrong other than being a movie for the T-D fans.<br/><br/>First: Kyle Gass may be in the real life band but he is totally wrong for the movie part. It would work much better with a younger rocker who was really good but down on his luck, then with the help of Jack Black he would get his chance and shine. Now this character was a soft bald overweight kid whom grew to be a soft bald overweight adult. Doesn't work for the movie in my humble opinion. For example, instead of being a total loser at the Sorority party, a more suited actor/performer could have his first revelation and totally rock the place. Then while the girls throw themselves at him he would remember his buddy and mission and go find him. Wouldn't that work better? Second: The music. They have a specific number of fans already loving it. For the rest of the people it just doesn't work. I mean even at the final showdown with the devil the music was an anticlimax for me.<br/><br/>Third: Humor or lack of it. It had its moments, after all you can't hide Jack Black's talent. I especially liked the chase scene being watched on live TV by Lee the car's owner. Other than that it was way below School Of Rock's.<br/><br/>Fourth: The plot should be tighter. Some points were explained at the deleted scenes. Like why would Gass try to evade the police? (Answer he was so into the video game that he was actually hallucinating). How come the club's announcer is the devil? (Answer, before they changed the plot it was actually Lee, their only fan. It then makes sense, that's why he was helping them) <br/><br/>And what about the mushroom induced hallucination with the Sascq... Saskua... oh Pooh, Bigfoot! Totally out of place, or was it a video clip within a movie? <br/><br/>Fifth: I suppose fans of the band go for lewd language, sexual innuendos and drug use/humor. I suppose this is the producer's and director's choice but alienating everyone below 16 (18 in my opinion) is not a good business decision. Such a pity I couldn't see the movie along with my kids.<br/><br/>Bottom line : Mildly entertaining but forgettable."
"MichaelMargetis","4","1","5","21 November 2007"," Disappointing
","I, Michael Margetis, am a huge Tenacious D fan and even I found their movie to be stupid. Isn't that the whole idea though? It's supposed to stupid, right? Well, yeah, but it's also supposed to be funny. 'Tenacious D and the Pick of Destiny' is funny far too seldom though. Most of the time it's just eye-rollingly cheesy. <br/><br/>The best part of the film is without a doubt the songs. The songs are just flat-out hysterical from 'Kickapoo' which starts out the movie with the ingenious lyric, ""A long-ass f__king time ago in a town called Kickapoo..."", or even the film's conclusion with 'POD - Pick of Destiny' which is even funnier if not extremely awkward. Jack Black is side-split-tingly funny in both his dialogue and mannerisms as always, but Kyle Gass, the other half of the dynamic duo, is just flat-out terrible. He's a horrendous actor, his humor seems really forced and he doesn't have any screen presence what-so-ever. The plot is predictable and well, flat-out stupid. One of the best things about this film is the cameos -- Tim Robbins plays a creepy backwoods hermit while Ben Stiller sporting big frizzy hair plays a guitar store owner. <br/><br/>All in all, there is a few very funny scenes despite the uproariously funny music number, but most of the time 'Tenacious D and the Pick of Destiny' is a dud. Grade: C-"
"kennyevans","3","1","5","24 July 2007"," Maybe I Missed Something-Maybe This Film Missed The Target
","I was looking forward to seeing this film. I'm familiar with JB and KG's music and thought it was great, if a little on the coarse side and having one or two more fecks than it should have.<br/><br/>However right from the start this film just didn't sit with me. There's was no background on JB and we were thrown right into this scenario we had to take as read. Were we expected to fit this character into the mould of any other angst teen who wanted to be a rockstar? This film missed all the great clichés and funny stuff associated with rock music and being a budding musician. OK Spinal tap, Bill & Ted and Wayne's World has already covered those bases and that kind of makes you think why make this film? It was like a badly written Dumb and Dumber with guitars.<br/><br/>The story and delivery were constantly stilted and the more I watched the more I thought this was aimed at 12 year olds, so what about all the foul language? Back to the story, the pick of destiny...it wasn't even original or absorbing. The pizza guy was a stoodge and some of the musical material in the film was quite bad. The Tim Robbins character was great but for me he didn't fit nicely into the film and stuck out like a sore thumb. My favourite bit was the Ben Stiller scene in the music shop, I thought at that point the film was beginning to come to life and take shape a bit but it just seemed to nosedive after that. I kept thinking 'that would have been great to do that there' and so on and I feel they missed many opportunities to expand the characters and story and make it a bit more engaging.<br/><br/>The climax and resolution of the film just fell flat for me. The music was rubbish and I got the impression JB was just on some kind of rock God trip, trouble is he lacks the looks, musical ability and presence of said God. The slight comic relief, relief from KG was as wooden as his acoustic guitar. Probably the most empty film I've seen in ages, the whisp of an idea stretched out to 90 mins with such thin content it should never have got passed the development stage and should've been binned. At least in Waynes World we had sympathy for and loved the characters and at least in Spinal Tap we laughed for 20 years. This will go down as the proverbial crock for the majority of people.<br/><br/>Would have made a far better batch of quick 3 minute youtube videos or a simple straight to DVD release to 'D' fans, but at least it kept some people in work!"

He could sky rocket above the well-skilled and professional talent of Silent Bob to become an American Master, but instead he decides to roll around in the mud with all the little piggies swilling farts and feigning sarcastic-satanic worship.<br/><br/>I think his movie is about how Rock evolved into Garage Band evolved into Garbage Band evolved into Tenacious D. What a shame, they both play the guitar so well yet they waste it on this.<br/><br/>I admit I did laugh very hard at three times in the movie, so I was generous and gave it a 5 out of 10.<br/><br/>-LD<br/><br/>______________________________________________<br/><br/>my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/"

","Back in 2013, I jokingly created an IMDb list called 'Non-irritating performances by Jack Black' which consisted of zero titles. Over the years, I have wondered if I might have been a little unfair (he was just about bearable in Tropic Thunder, I suppose), but I feel vindicated after watching Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny, which sees Black putting in a grating, boorish, self indulgent, and seriously unfunny performance to beat all others.<br/><br/>The film stars Black as JB, a wannabe rock star who teams up with guitarist KG (Kyle Gass) to form the group Tenacious D; together, they plan to take the music world by storm by laying their hands on the Pick of Destiny, a legendary guitar pick made from Satan's tooth that endows the holder with incredible musical skills. All of this nonsense definitely has the potential to be funny, but Black's egocentric performance, Liam Lynch's uninspired direction, a lack of decent material that relies too heavily on vulgarity, 'stoner' gags, and pointless cameos, and surprisingly cheap production values makes for a really painful experience.<br/><br/>1/10. Foo Fighter's Dave Grohl puts in the best performance as Satan, but it's nothing we haven't already seen in Tenacious D's much played music video for 'Tribute' (which I actually like, along with the rest of their debut album — go figure!)."
"Bataeu","4","1","6","8 October 2007"," Disappointing
","Jack Black is a great actor. I've enjoyed everything he has been in so far, but this movie just didn't do it for me. His roles in films such as Orange County, High Fidelity and School of Rock were (in my opinion) his best roles. I was hanging out to see Jack Black play in a movie that involved him being part of a band and while his musical performance was brilliant in this film, the film itself was a let down. The humour was childish, and the bigfoot scene left me feeling embarrassed for some reason. Also, what is it with Jack Black and oral sex jokes in this film? I think there were about 5 mentions of ""sucking c*ck"" in the film.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm giving this film a 4/10, mainly for the dream sequence in which Jack Black has the Pick Of Destiny (awesome song) and Ben Stiller's cameo."
"postmanwhoalwaysringstwice","4","1","6","2 April 2007"," could have been worse
","The lengths comic actor Jack Black will go for a laugh are quite extensive. His best material tends to be in films revolving around music, like ""High Fidelity"" or ""School of Rock"", and to a point this one: ""Tenacious D: the Pick of Destiny"". The film or, more appropriately, the movie follows the rock duo Tenacious D from their humble and misleading beginnings through a quest that Joseph Campbell would either appreciate or scream misinterpretation. Although they have been known to sell-out Madison Square Garden, Tenacious D, the supposed greatest band ever, really feels more like a cross between Bill & Ted, Spinal Tap, and Weird ""Al"" Yankovic, if Iron Maiden's Bruce Dickinson were on vocals. The storyline, as it is, follows the duo as they quest for the secret behind the guitar gods of history (from Robert Johnson to Jimmy Page). Though this is not really a very good movie, it is quite amusing and includes a classic moment involving a rock chord played on a lute. This thing is full of enough rock music references to keep any rock fan pleasantly surprised for 90 minutes, so it's really not the total waste it looks like from afar."

There were only a few good songs but many of them felt very much made for the movie rather than a true work of inspiration.<br/><br/>My friends all seem to disagree, even some older than me now (I'm 20), I just never really understood how they could enjoy a Tenacious D with less quality than they had before, more immaturity, when they had matured themselves.

"MrJukka","3","0","6","10 December 2006"," At times there was some rock but roll it did not
","I was hoping for a funny movie with some good rock. There was, I feel one good moment with the devil who surprisingly can act. OK, I must say The music was loud but not classic. Jack and Kyle would have done better if they had relied on classics instead of their own music. Pity. When they used other people's music, the result was much better. The best instance of this in the whole film was Bach with a twist. That almost made me a fan for the Tenacious D.<br/><br/>Jokes were lame and not inventive. Possibly the best one is the beginning telling about JB's childhood.<br/><br/>It could have been sooo much better. Next time, boys, please."
"teh_mode","6","0","1","9 December 2006"," Strictly for fans only. Tenacious D has little to convert the non-essentials to Jack Black's style of comedy.
","If you imagined a band half way between the vocal tirades of Meat Loaf and the relentless guitar playing of System Of a Down, you have a vague idea of what listening to Tenacious D is like. The best/worst rock band of all time finally get realised on the big screen in Liam Lynch's Tenacious D: The Pick Of Destiny. Here, we get a relatively dull back-story of how Tenacious D formed, and then a slightly more amusing tale of their voyage to find ""the pick of destiny"".<br/><br/>Tenacious D comes alive with its music. Whether it is JB's fantasy about rocking an open mike lounge or the stand off between the D and the Devil, these are the liveliest moments in this disappointing spectacle. There are also a couple of amusing cameo appearances, the funniest comes from exec-producer Ben Stiller, who explains the back-story of the infamous pick with laugh-drenching detail. And Tim Robbins turns up as a knife-wielding madman hell-bent on snatching the pick from our two lame-brained heroes. But sadly Â– this movie rarely stretches beyond its own fan base. The film's director, Liam Lynch, who himself was responsible for the novelty record ""United States Of Whatever"" does not seem to instill his film with the kind of quirky flair that made Nacho Libre (2006) offer a Jack Black that played it low-key. Nor, for that matter, does it possess the wit or charm of School Of Rock (2003), a film where we knew that Black was meant to be rubbish and slothful.<br/><br/>Jack Black has never been one for subtle humour, but his uber-energetic schtick still needs the right direction in a film. In High Fidelity (1999) he was kept on a leash by playing opposite John Cusack, whose character brought a healthy balance to the script. Here he is let loose along with co-star Kyle Gass who, sadly, possesses none of the comic talents of his portly sidekick. The film relies far too much on the wide-eyed externalisms of JB to liven up the dull screenplay. But it is not Black's fault that this movie is ultimately under whelming. His previous film, Nacho Libre had a weird quirkiness to it. Not only that, but Black's character was meant to be ridiculed, whereas here it is never truly sure if Tenacious D are meant to be cool or rubbish. The world around our two protagonists is just as stupid as they are. Still, this should not disappoint the hardcore D faithful. It offers a satisfying experience, even if it doesn't live up to the Wayne's World's of this world."
"silentbob_rulz","8","0","1","3 December 2006"," best movie since DETROIT ROCK CITY
","I thought the movie was excellent. You can tell when Jack Black is held back from excellence when he does movies like King Kong etc. but this...all J.B. baby! Must see if you like either of the following films: Waynes World, Little Nicky, Detroit Rock City. You can tell Jack Black loves this style of films. Maybe he should get baked more in movies, just to remind us all he hasn't changed. Better than Macho Libre, better than School Of Rock (just barely) and it shows now, that Ben Stiller is just as whacked as i thought. We need a Jack Black / Adam Sandler Rock Off oneday.<br/><br/>SEE THE MOVIE! Enjoy ladies."
"RATTFINK","8","0","1","2 December 2006"," Awesome, but I'm a big fan of JB and KG
","First off, I'm a guge... i mean huge fan of Tenacious D and Jack Black. I first saw Jack Black in Mr. Show, being a huge fan of Mr. Show. I watched Mr. Show because I'm a huge fan of the Ben Stiller Show, and I loved Bob Odenkirk in The Ben Stiller Show. Anyways, I'm a huge fan of all their sketch comedy stuff. So I was HUGELY disappointed by the Mr. Show movie, Run Ronnie Run, or whatever it was called, it GUGELY sucked balls. Which made me leery when I heard that they were making a Tenacious D movie. I was even more leery after seeing a lameass preview for the movie. But I saw an actual clip from the movie on the internet, when JB first meets Rage Kage, and it was HILARIOUS. So I went to see the movie and let me tell you, it ROCKED! But then, I'm a huge fan. If you're a fan of the D, you will NOT be disappointed. But it's not for everyone. I realized this when I was watching the movie for the second time, and people were WALKING OUT OF THE THEATER. Why the f*** did you f***ing buy tickets for the movie if you're gonna walk out?? The same thing happened when I went to watch the Martin Lawrence movie, Run 'til Dat. Some old lady bought tickets to the movie because she was a fan of the FOX TV show, and Martin starts talking about... well, let's just say really explicit sexual stuff involving women who've had tracheotomies, and she couldn't handle it, so she walked out. People WALKED OUT ON THE D. I have no idea what they were expecting. It's the D. It was awesome. KG was hilarious. I was almost afraid JB had gone totally Hollywood never to come back, but he's back on his game in the movie. If you love the D, you'll love The Pick of Destiny."
"sliscoa","3","0","11","2 December 2006"," Very Disappointing
","It really kind of pains me to write this, because I have been a big fan of Tenacious D since the HBO days. But this film is just a really, really big disappointment. It's staggeringly formulaic. One of the great entertaining things about Tenacious D was always the fresh, outrageous humor. In The Pick Of Destiny, it feels very stale at best. If I didn't know better, I'd say everyone involved on the creative side of this film was high throughout the production (and, yeah, maybe that was the case - but c'mon guys, you're making a movie - we notice). There are a few bright spots, notably the outstanding ""Master Exploder"" bit, but by and large it really lacks the punch that was present even as recently as the first album from ""The D"" was released. I can't help but think this film might have been a lot better had it been made about five years earlier. Or if perhaps Bob Odenkirk or David Cross (who were involved in the creative side of the HBO show) had been involved. As it is, it suffers tremendously from the poor script, old jokes, and really amazing lack of passion throughout..."

","I am a very big Tenacious D fan. Their HBO show is funny as hell and their album is awesome, not only as a comedy CD, but as a rock CD too. Jack Black usually kicks ass in most movies and I don't think it was necessarily his performance that hurt this film. This movie was just not funny at all. It was a major disappointment. I spent the whole movie waiting for the funny part to come, but it never did. The whole plot was completely pointless. (SPOILER WARNING) All they accomplished was getting a bong out of Satan's horn. Sooo stupid. Tenacious D is better than this and I think it is a shame that they had to misrepresent themselves to the world with this crappy movie. See Borat instead."
"keithw1975","3","0","10","26 November 2006"," Really disappointing...
","I think JB can be pretty funny at times but this show was just sad. It wasn't even funny in a stupid/funny way. This is the first movie I can remember where I kept thinking about getting up and leaving. I wanted something funny and had decided on either this or Let's Go to Prison. Since the latter had gotten bad reviews on here and this had better ones I chose this waste of time. The funniest parts of the whole movie were Tim Robbins at one point and the part where bottles are smacking JB in the head.<br/><br/>If you are thinking about seeing this wait until it is on sale at the video store for 99 cents about 3 months from now.<br/><br/>Keith"
"Tim-bugby","6","0","5","26 November 2006"," Close but no cigar
","I Went to see the preview of this film on Friday quite excited to see it because i love tenacious D and jack black. I had recently bought the album to go with the movie which in 1 minute into the film i realised was not such a amazing idea, This was because the film is basically a musical which is fine but not when you have bought the album.<br/><br/>There is just one thing that surprised me and hacked me off was that in two scenes of the film you can see the microphone hanging down which sadly shows unprofessional-ism which is sad really for a great film such as this but besides this i thought i was a great film and its worth a watch."
"xwblnbobx","6","0","7","25 November 2006"," Average at best
","Let me start off by saying that I loved the HBO series and most of their songs, but this movie isn't really on par. It seems like a few years of doing kid movies combined with that horrible disease that we will all get called ""old"" diluted his original sense of humor.<br/><br/>There's still some funny moments, like the Satan speech at the end and the car chase, so Jack Black isn't totally washed up. It just seems like they were trying too hard to make a movie version of the show. Did we really need to see an outline of his penis? The show, back in 99 or whenever, would've made that scene 10 times funnier without resorting to such an obvious shock gag.<br/><br/>I think what JB needs to do is leave this style behind him and find a new style of comedy for him. He's a funny man, but all good comics change over the years and this style doesn't work as well as it used to. The show was funny because that's just what he and KG did. The movie fails because they tried too hard to go back to that old spot.<br/><br/>I've seen worse, but I've seen WAY better."
