"Kuriente","8","166","175","14 July 2014"," Surprised
","I am an aircraft mechanic, so admittedly I have trouble watching a movie which will undoubtedly abuse reality in terms of physics and aircraft design. I recall seeing previews for this and being stunned at the laughable scenario of an inverted passenger plane. That experience dropped my expectation to essentially zero.<br/><br/>When I watched this film I was surprised in two ways. Firstly, the scenario was more plausible than I had given it credit. Inverted flight is a problem for most planes because of aerodynamics. And while some aircraft are aerodynamically capable of inverted flight (even some passenger planes) it is additionally a problem because hydraulic and engine oil systems are often gravity fed. This means that if a plane is able to fly this way, most of them won't fly for long before systems begin to fail. The film did a reasonable job of portraying this as the plane was just barely able to sustain level flight with a full pitch down elevator position and displayed low engine oil press warnings which led to engine fire. I suspect the roll maneuver would require more altitude than the film suggests...but otherwise it's not far from what could happen in reality if this was actually attempted. Most engine fire T-handles are designed to instantly shut fuel and bleed air valves for an engine...which doesn't seem to happen here, but that was my biggest realism gripe.<br/><br/>My second surprise is that this movie has very little to do with aviation. Aviation seems to be the setting for the story, but the subject itself is substance abuse. The story could have just as easily been set around a bus driver or a ship captain. Given the fact that aviation was merely a setting for the story I have to give credit to the film makers for paying at least some attention to realism.<br/><br/>I thought the story was fascinating. It's the sort of film that requires something of the viewer. You can't watch this without making moral judgements and that process requires each viewer to evaluate how they feel about certain subjects. The story creates just enough moral dilemma to get people thinking and any story that can succeed in that gets a pass from me."

","Washington gives what is nothing less than a performance of a lifetime in this tension filled film dealing with a pilot wrestling with inner demons. The aviation sequences are stunning and the crash one of the most breathtaking ever filmed. The director is highly gifted and his skill and passion are clearly evident. The script is superb, with intelligent plotting and sharp dialog that captures reality. It is, once again, Washington who shines here above all else. His power as an actor is what truly gives this movies its fire. His portrayal of a substance abusing addict/alcoholic is painful to watch because of the humanity he brings to the part. It is a tremendous accomplishment and one of the finest studies of addiction ever filmed."
"Bob_the_Hobo","9","120","150","19 November 2012"," An Emotional Tailspin
","Denzel Washington is William ""Whip"" Whitaker, an alcoholic pilot who, after a night of heavy drinking, remains drunk well into the morning he is to fly a plane into Georgia. When his flight goes into a sudden tail- spin, Whip manages to save all but six lives through his crash-landing. Whip is a hero until his toxicology report comes up positive for everything under the sun, leaving the airline, Whip's union, his friends, and Whip in a tailspin of their own. <br/><br/>I have often thought that Denzel Washington is one of the finest actors to ever grace the silver screen, and he proves that assertion with a film that is assured to receive him a sixth Academy Award nomination. Here is a man broken beyond measure, stumbling through his lost life until unprecedented new stress is placed upon him. Not even the intervention of those he holds close can stop his self-destructive nature - or can it?<br/><br/>Robert Zemeckis has been on a sturdy path with animated films recently, so it was with a bit of apprehension that I saw his most recent live- action offering since ""Cast Away"". But have no fear. The direction here is clean, crisp, and efficient as ever, producing a simple, but powerful script by John Gatins, chock-full of par-none supporting roles by the likes of John Goodman, Don Cheadle, and Bruce Greenwood. <br/><br/>Undoubtedly the best part of the film - besides the wonderful cast - was the soundtrack. Joe Cocker, Bill Withers, and more are used expertly to mold into every emotion, sometimes emotional roller coaster, Whip experiences. Each song (some used more than once) slips seamlessly into the background and keeps the audience following more than the script. <br/><br/>""Flight"" is a powerful, dark, character study about a man who has fallen to his darkest depths, and finds out how to fall farther. It sees Denzel Washington in top form and Robert Zemeckis' triumphant return to the live screen."
"atlasmb","8","33","38","4 September 2014"," Can a man be both hero and criminal?
","Trailers might lead you to believe this is a film about flying. Or about an amazing flying feat. But it is all about the lead character, Captain ""Whip"" Whitaker (Denzel Washington), a man who is a pilot and an alcoholic. The flying and a terrible crash provide background for the story of this man, who has struggled with his illness for years.<br/><br/>In many ways the story is not that original. We have seen numerous stories about alcoholics and heard real-life testimonies of the behaviors that accompany alcoholism, and this film tracks with all of them.<br/><br/>It is worth seeing for the brilliant portrayal of Captain Whitaker and the performances of the other actors in the film. Some parts are difficult to watch because the acting is so engaging.<br/><br/>I also think the film raises some interesting questions that some viewers may not be willing to acknowledge. If one is an alcoholic, is the entire worth of that man nothing more than what his sickness drags him down to? Are we what we do? Can we rise above our neuroses or our worst behaviors? Often we see public figures condemned in media for indiscretions or harmful acts; is that, then, the measure of the man or woman?<br/><br/>The film, even if judged solely for its dramatic content, is worth seeing."
"cummingsjosh7","8","188","244","31 October 2012"," Flight is an expert character study
","Flight takes off with a pulse pounding opening that sets the tone for the movie. However, Flight is not an action movie but instead is an in-depth character study of an alcoholic. While the film itself is a good story and an interesting analysis of one man's addiction to alcohol, the real treasure of Flight is the superb performance from Denzel Washington.<br/><br/>In Flight, Denzel Washington plays a pilot who must crash land a commercial airliner to save the passengers on board. This may seem like a hero story since Washington was successful in saving the lives of the majority of the passengers. However, the results in Washington's toxicology report showed that he had a large amount of alcohol and cocaine in his system. Suddenly, this turns into a criminal investigation and Washington is faced with the difficult decision of either accepting he has a problem with drugs and alcohol or spend the rest of his life in prison.<br/><br/>Flight is a brilliant character study because throughout the movie you aren't quite sure whether you like Washington or not. The man is a hero but he cannot stop drinking which constantly puts himself and others in danger. The director of Flight, Robert Zemeckis (Cast Away, Forest Gump), successfully makes the audience care about a man that should go to prison. Even though Washington's character is constantly letting you down, you still find yourself rooting for him. A director that is able to accomplish that feeling within his audience is doing a great job at film making and character development.<br/><br/>It is clear that Denzel Washington devoted himself to this character. Every move that Washington made was true and you believed every action his character was doing because Washington was so convincing. This film could have been very boring. After the first half an hour there isn't much action and the story drifts from a plane crash to Washington's struggles with alcohol. This could have been disappointing but instead, the performance of Washington is mesmerizing to the point where you are completely drawn into the film. The film didn't need to continue having as much action as the first part of the film (the plane crash) because watching the development of Washington's character was so interesting.<br/><br/>Even though Washington steals the film, he is backed up with some very respectable supportive acting. Don Cheadle (Hotel Rwanda, Ocean's Eleven) plays Washington's attorney and delivers some powerful moments in the film. Although, no one would ever expect a poor performance from Cheadle. John Goodman (Argo, The Artist) plays the comic relief in Flight. Even though Goodman is only in the film for a short amount of time, he delivers some of the best scenes in the movie.<br/><br/>Flight may not be as exciting as some of Denzel Washington's recent movies but it is definitely worth the money. The film is a very accurate portrayal of the struggles and despairs of being an alcoholic. With a fine director and an expert lead role along with many great supporting roles, Flight is a film that shouldn't be missed. The only minor problem with Flight is that it's a little lengthy when it doesn't need to be. Other than that, Flight is a very well made drama. A-"
"corrosion-2","8","142","186","21 October 2012"," Denzel's Showcase
","Flight will rank alongside The Lost Weekend, Leaving Las Vegas, etc as one of the classic films about alcoholism. It features, in my view, Denzel Washington's greatest performance to date. It is so easy to overplay a drunk but extremely difficult to get it right and Denzel is spot on and totally believable here as an alcoholic. Also, not many A list actors would play such an unsympathetic character.<br/><br/>Perhaps the biggest surprise is Robert Zemeckis's decision to do what is basically a character study. However, as shown in his previous films what he brings to the table here is to ensure that as well as studying this flawed character, we have a thoroughly gripping and entertaining movie. In addition to Denzel's standout performance, all the other performances are great. John Goodman balances the drama with the right dose of humour. Go and see it, but not on board a flight!"
"theredraylives","7","78","104","21 February 2013"," Only soars on Denzel Washington's fantastic performance
","Flight is the kind of movie that studio marketing departments seem to hate. Watching the trailer, it gives the feeling of a lighter film, dramatic, with some suspense. It does not, however, indicate that this is an incredibly dark film about the depths and perils of addiction. The trailer gives a completely different idea of what this movie is going to be about, but with Denzel Washington's ""Whip"" Whitaker doing cocaine about thirty seconds into the runtime, one can safely throw away any thoughts they may have had about it.<br/><br/>Mr. Washington stars as Captain Whitaker, piloting a flight from Florida to Georgia; a relatively short flight, but when something goes wrong at 30,000 feet, the quick-thinking and talented Whip rolls the plane to pull it out of its dive and ends up crash-landing, saving the lives of all but six people on-board the plane. The namesake sequence of the film is probably its best, filled with amazing tension and some stellar effects.<br/><br/>Washington absolutely shines in this role, and being an actor of immeasurable talent, there is no question why he is up for an Academy Award for best actor. His acting is the kind of amazing that doesn't even require words- near the end of the film, his performance is absolutely heartbreaking, and Denzel Washington wears it in his face. Sadly, the rest of the film (outside of scene-stealing performances from John Goodman and James Badge Dale) isn't really up to par. The film follows Whip's self-destructive alcoholism as he is caught up in an investigation into the cause of the plane crash; friends try to help him and are spurned, he is alienated from his family, and he finds fleeting comfort in strangers such as Nicole (Kelly Reilly).<br/><br/>This is where the film runs into problems, however. It wastes far too much screen time developing Nicole's character only to drop her off the face of the Earth. She enters Whip's life as a common ally, someone battling her own demons and addictions, but she is seeking help. She then vanishes from it just as quickly. Her character isn't all that interesting to begin with, and the same can be said for most of the rest of the characters and the story in the film; they only serve as a backdrop, a mirror through which Whip's many, many demons are reflected.<br/><br/>Flight is, unfortunately, a film without much of a sense of direction. Robert Zemeckis seems to be all over the place, pouring multitudes of attention into Nicole's character, the plane crash, and Whip battling his demons, and it never seems to make up its mind as to what it's about. The film never, for a moment, questions whether Whip is actually at fault for the plane crash, and in fact it was his actions that saved many lives. Maybe it is Washington's poise and gravitas in the scene, but it never feels like Whip isn't in control. True that he is drunk and on drugs, and has many serious, serious problems, but saving the lives of ninety-six people (himself included) wasn't one of them. So while the plane crash story is certainly interesting, there's never any doubt about exactly how it is going to play out.<br/><br/>Flight could have been a better film if it had capitalized on the success of the tension it so well displayed early during the plane crash. Whip's story, his battles with his numerous demons- and ultimately, his freedom from them- are moving and wonderful to watch. If Zemeckis hadn't tried to shoehorn in this ridiculous investigation plot that never really merits any attention, it would have been that much better. Washington gives a five-star performance, but the rest of Flight lands at a dismal Three and a half out of Five Stars.<br/><br/>Check out my profile for links to my other reviews!"
"ClaytonDavis","8","152","215","16 October 2012"," Flight brings Denzel back to greatness!
","Robert Zemeckis' latest film Flight starring Academy Award Winner Denzel Washington is not only thoroughly entertaining and terrifically structured, it encompasses a soul that Hollywood hasn't really delivered in quite some time. The film, that closed the New York Film Festival, is simply one of the best films of the year.<br/><br/>Flight tells the story of Whip Whitaker, an airline pilot that saves a plane and nearly all its passengers from a certain death. When an investigation is carried out to look into the details of the crash, Whip's troubling lifestyle begins to surface. Writer John Latins creates a dynamic and an internal narrative confrontation for viewers to become immersed in a story full of mental struggle. It's a unique and very engaging story that stands as one of season's best efforts.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington, and not to be taken lightly, is fully in the zone and portrays one of his finest screen moments in years. I haven't been this impressed with his abilities as an actor since The Hurricane (1999). He lands solidly in Whip, giving us his natural aggression, charisma, and flaws. Allowing us to travel with Whip on this journey, Mr. Washington proves once and for all, he is one of the great treasures of American cinema. Denzel gives an access root into the character for all intended purposes, a clear understanding of the inner resistance that will not only plague Whip, but the movie audience as well.<br/><br/>The story doesn't seem like an obvious choice for Robert Zemeckis, who has excelled in genres that have provided masterpieces like Forrest Gump (1994) and Cast Away (2000). As the film provides a more dark and jagged approach in his directorial style, Zemeckis executes with precision. It's a satisfactory effort from the director who makes his return to live action after a long string of motion-capture efforts. Assisting Washington's bravura performance is Oscar-nominee Don Cheadle, who teamed up with Denzel in the 90's classic film, Devil in a Blue Dress (1995). As the wise-cracking lawyer, whose own moral values may be tested in exchange for corporate and criminal immunity, Cheadle is a relieved presence. In a comedic and near-brilliant performance, John Goodman steals Flight from every actor including Washington in his short, two-scene appearances. Goodman continues to show an effortless range, even in poor film choices, and a confidence that makes him one of the great character actors working today. It's a performance that Oscar should consider on multiple levels. In a heartbreaking turn, Kelly Reilly as the drug-addicted Nicole, provides an emotional epicenter and boundary that stands as one of Latins' great writing achievements. Reilly is simply marvelous.<br/><br/>Continuing to beef up their acting resume, the great Bruce Greenwood shines while Brian Geraghty continues to prove he is one of Hollywood's best kept secrets.<br/><br/>Composer Alan Silvestri orchestrates an outstanding score that is both melodic and soothing. Cinematographer Don Burgess, once-nominated for Forrest Gump, gives clean, fresh camera lenses look into a shockingly dirty and gritty story. Zemeckis' handle of the astounding opening scenes, especially the plane crash, is one of the best visual and nail- biting moments of the year. Its Zemeckis at his best!<br/><br/>Flight is not only one of the best cinematic efforts of the New York Film Festival; it stands as a great surprise and entry into the 2012 Oscar season. Denzel Washington is completely Oscar-bound but the buck shouldn't stop there; a deserved consideration campaign should be given to John Goodman and Kelly Reilly along with screenwriter John Latins. Flight is a home-run!<br/><br/>Read More Reviews at The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)"

","FLIGHT is a great film! In a day and age where almost all Hollywood movies try to thrill us with special effects and gore, FLIGHT 'soars' with extraordinary acting and a story that will change lives. I went not knowing really what to expect. A drama about a crashed airplane, right? Well this film is much much more. It is truth. Truth about life. Truth about addictions. Denzel Washington does an awesome, believable job as an alcoholic airplane captain, struggling with his addiction and accusations after the plane crash. John Goodman plays an interesting character and provides some laughs. Without giving too much away, I will say that if you like drama movies or Denzel, go see it. If you are, or know anyone who is struggling with an addiction of ANY KIND... go see it! It just might change your life. 9/10 A+"
"watcher52","3","77","116","8 November 2012"," A good film corrupted by Hollywood greed,,,
","It is easy to appreciate the high praise for one of Denzel's finest performances, the wonderful cast, and the quality of the narrative and storyline over the course of most of the film. This script had great potential to produce an often compelling story, with fine characters and direction. (I'm ignoring the fact that in everyday reality, a pilot like Denzel's character would be impossible, since professional pilots are subjected to regular drug and alcohol tests.) But, alas, virtually all the reviews and reviewers are blind to the film's fatal flaw.<br/><br/>What so terribly wrong here?? In nearly all action films and psychological dramas, the writers and director are offered several different--often competing--conclusions, the final ""hook."" I watched a film that deserved an 6/7 for its entire length, until the final 15 minutes, the scene where Denzel's character breaks down in a sudden fit of moral consternation in the official inquiry. At this point, the film suddenly is transformed from a serious drama into a sloppy, moralizing MELODRAMA. What a great loss. But Hollywood will out, destroying an intrinsically dark tale by providing a redemptive ""happy ending"" that is utterly incredible. Of course, 90% the audiences will love this, but it doesn't change the facts.<br/><br/>Think: When Denzel's character's interrogator asks the big question in the hearing, the real alcoholic he's been in every scene becomes a utterly different person. He can easily avoid blaming the innocent stewardess, AND save himself, with one answer: ""I don't know."" And then repeating it, over and over. Exactly what a binge drinker would have done--except for Hollywood and HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS of dollars at stake at the box office!! Concluding the film with the broken pilot preaching the gospel of AA while gratefully serving his prison term is like stepping into an entirely different fantasy, one without credible linkage. Speaking as a professional writer, no one who has read great novels and fiction critically can come to any other conclusion. But this qualifier regarding familiarity with supreme fictions will exempt the vast majority of readers who usually appear on this site."
"RavenZ","8","57","95","6 December 2012"," Don't read too many reviews - experience it for yourself.
","By now you know what the movie is about, so I won't rehash.<br/><br/>What you have here is the anti-Sully Sullenberg. Denzel is incredible as the best pilot you don't want flying your plane, or do you????? Tough questions and tough decisions as Denzel deals with, or doesn't deal with, the aftermath. You pull for him every step of the way, but the problem is which way do you pull? The visuals are very good, gripping, scary. I felt like I was hit hard in the chest while watching the plane.<br/><br/>Make sure the little kiddies stay home, but you need to see this movie. I hope the Academy hands Denzel the Oscar."

","Excellent character study about a troubled individual. As an airline captain myself, it is very difficult to sympathize with someone who would put his passengers in constant danger by being a chronic substance abuser.<br/><br/>But, it is a very high credit to Denzel Washington to make you care regardless. His fearless performance is why Washington is one of the world's greatest actors! I am so very happy to see him take on a challenging part like this, after doing so many roles he could do in his sleep.<br/><br/>Robert Zemeckis turns in his least Zemeckis-like film ever, getting out of the way and allowing the script and the actors to do their parts. The film gets seriously sidetracked with the two appearances from John Goodman, but Goodman has spent his career just popping up and giving goofball performances, so no surprise there.<br/><br/>All in all, very good work on all counts, plus the ending works.<br/><br/>******** 8 Out of 10 Stars"

","This was the strangest movie I've seen in a while. The beginning is ?close to an hour? of some AMAZING flight crash sequence scenes. The rest of the movie is about a man's fight with alcohol and drug abuse. Get it on Netflix, watch the 1st hour, go to an AA meeting, come back and watch the last 15 minutes. You won't have missed a thing! The acting was good - but the story is advertised as being about a plane crash, when it's more about man's struggle against himself.<br/><br/>The beginning scenes are supposed to depict a man with deep feelings for a stewardess - instead it looks like he's hired a hooker, so it doesn't quite jive later in the movie. More details on the reconstruction of the jet, show some of the simulator footage of what may have happened when other pilots tried to land, show NTSB reviewing the black box etc, would have kept it more in line with the advertised plot. The correct advertisement would be ""An egotistical, self-centered, alcoholic, drug addict makes an amazing jet plane landing - see how he feels about that!"""

","Imagine real-life hero pilot ""Sulley"" Sullenberger with a severe drug  and alcohol problem and doing a few lines prior to taking controls in  the cockpit, yet still managing to land his packed airplane with  absolute precision on the Hudson River. Would he still be a hero?  That's the dilemma of the new film, ""Flight,"" which just hit theaters  this week.  This is a difficult movie to sit through. Yet it's tough to decide  which is more gut-wrenching -- watching a doomed airliner packed full  of passengers buckled down in a nosedive headed for near-certain death,  or the central character played by Denzel Washington, whose personal  life is just as out of control.  While Washington's character nicknamed ""Whip"" manages to miraculously  maneuver the aircraft towards a crash landing that undoubtedly saves  lives, the captain comes under increasing scrutiny once the post-crash  investigation begins. Conducted by the National Transportation Safety  Board (NTSB), the investigation begins to reveal some troubling  revelations about Whip and his conduct. Every second of the pilot and  crew's lives are scrutinized, which uncovers some ugly secrets about  how Whip spends most of his free time. Most of the time his best  friends are named Jim Beam and Jack Daniels, with a few lines of  cocaine to add a little spice.  The hero-addict dichotomy is a marvelous dramatic device which helps to  sustain a longer-than-average 2.5 hour movie. The audience faces a real  conflict here. We don't know whether to cheer for Whip to beat the rap  and move on with his life (after all, he heroically saved lives), or be  exposed as the fraud he is so the healing and recovery process can  begin.  Indeed, this film is not so much about the plane crash and aftermath as  it is about addiction and realizing that one has a serious problem.  While the crash scene is one of the most intense such moments ever  recreated on film, the film's highest moments of drama actually occurs  in hotel rooms and in front of refrigerators when Whip faces his  toughest choice -- whether to drink or not. Most of the time, the  bottle wins the war of the inner spirit, just as it tragically so often  does with real life alcoholics.  If there's any doubt about Denzel Washington being one of the finest  actors of our generation, this should finally settle the issue. His is  a resume filled with high moments -- his Academy Award winning  over-the-top portrayal of a corrupt cop in ""Training Day"" perhaps being  his best work. But this performance is every bit as strong for entirely  different reasons. Washington shows great range in this film,  flip-flopping between the boozing jet-setting playboy (played to  perfection) and the sad and lonely loser that deep inside he know he  has become.  It's Washington when he's most vulnerable that carries this film. Just  the right expression at the right time, a teardrop in a rare moment  when he lets his guard down, or displaying a phony facade of going  through the motions while being stoned and high on the inside -- these  are the virtues that only a few actors working today could so  successfully give to an audience. No doubt, Washington's role here will  be remembered when Best Actor nominations come out for this year's  Oscars.  Robert Zemickis' direction is also near-perfect. This is often a dark  and depressing movie, a sort of ""Leaving Las Vegas"" with an airline  pilot in the central sympathetic role. Yet we never get too low, even  watching a man hellbent on self-destruction. Zemickis, perhaps best  known for his direction of ""Forrest Gump,"" handles the material with  great care, managing an excellent supporting cast -- led by two superb  roles by Bruce Greenwood and Don Cheadle -- who serve to change the  mood just when the film seems to become too dark.  There are some scenes and story lines that I found unnecessary. Whip  finds a romantic interest along the way, a fellow addict. I had a hard  time buying the notion that a 20-year career airline pilot would find  much in common with a very plain-looking heroin addict one step up from  doing back alley tricks as someone to find comfort with . The girl  simply lacks any appeal. To her credit, at least she's headed in the  right direction in her recovery while Whip guzzles one beer after  another. But I found her not only to be implausible partner but totally  unnecessary to the story -- adding at least 30 minutes to a film that  probably should have capped out at two hours.  The film builds to a fulfilling climax that won't be revealed here.  Some ends are tied up nicely, while others remain frayed. Which is all  fine -- that's how real life works.  In short, this is good film made much better by the wide range of  talent displayed by one of Hollywood's finest actors. Denzel  Washington's performance alone is reason enough to see the film."
"Snoody","5","22","35","18 February 2013"," Crashed but didn't burn
","Flight is one of those movies where the trailer makes you feel like you know what you're in for, only to find out the movie has nothing to do with a plane crash or planes in general.<br/><br/>Sure the plane does crash, and the premise of the film starts off with revolving around what actually happened with the plane. However, even the opening scene starts to fill you in on the main characters intentions and moral standing throughout the film. If it wasn't for Denzel playing Whip, his character would have gone nowhere, since by all accounts he is a very unlikeable guy. Denzel does bring some warmth and a friendly face to the uncomfortable crass moments of Whip. Finding out this screenplay sat around in Hollywood for awhile until Denzel sparked interest is not really a big surprise. Other than Denzel and a few moments of Goodman's always enjoyable on screen moments, this film is flat. It's about a drug/alcohol addict ""hero"" who never seems to really give us what we want as an audience (a moment to cheer for Whip).<br/><br/>This film is a by-the-book redemption film, but done better by Johnny Depp in ""Blow"". The cast sort of just deflates around the script, and a lot of unnecessary ""Jesus"" moments which start to feel like a hidden agenda for the writers. The female lead, a recovering drug/porn star?/lost her way, is also very boring. She offers little to no real connection to the audience, only aiding in predictable ""my life is now saved"" pictures on Whips jail wall at the end of the film. <br/><br/>The film itself is watchable, it's not a total failure in the technical aspect. There is a rise and fall and entertaining moments. But it is very boring, this is one to watch on Netflix when there is nothing else to do. I would really like to see Denzel in a much more compelling and interesting material. The guy is incredible, hence his nomination, but very obviously under utilized by this material."
"ruthfreese","1","100","188","28 November 2012"," Flying scenes are BS
","I am a commercial pilot by profession. This crash scene is based very loosely on an Alaska Airways plane that crashed in 2000. Don't get your hopes up: your relatives could not have survived this catastrophic equipment failure if they'd had Whip, fueled by 3 lines of cocaine, at the helm. The elevator jammed ""full nose down"" causing a descent rate of over 13,000 fpm, not 4000 fpm as stated in the movie, (which is a normal rate of descent for a jet). Other pilots flying by relayed to air traffic control that they saw this plane inverted, and in a steep nose down dive.<br/><br/>Let's say for the sake of the argument that the pilots had managed to slow the plane down with spoilers, gear, and flaps, like Whip did, and then flipped it on its back:<br/><br/>Realistically, the plane would have slowed from 13,000 fpm to 12,000 fpm and when flipped on its back the stress would have ripped off the tail.<br/><br/>Assuming somehow that the pilots flipping the plane upside down had managed to level it off, the instant they turned it rightside up, the plane would have nosed down and crashed. This lovely controlled glide onto a field would never have happened. Oh, and also, when a plane goes on its back THE ENGINES DO NOT CATCH ON FIRE. The engines actually flame out due to fuel starvation due to the fuel inlets being at the bottom of the fuel tanks.<br/><br/>After the crash scene, there are two hours of Whip being drunk while Nicole appears to have no problem remaining sober. There are also random people popping up praising Jesus."

","I normally only write a review when moved to do so because I love a film, or hate a film. Unfortunately for this film it was the latter case. This film was tedious, confused, boring and uninteresting. It didn't seem to know whether it wanted you to like or hate the protagonist, whether it was trying to be dramatic, funny and quirky or cool - far too many slow-mo scenes of Denzel Washington strolling around in shades looking cool after a drink and drug binge - and in the end it is none of those things. There's only so much you can watch of some guy drinking himself to death - although he doesn't seem to exhibit any physical problems, which is strange. This is no Leaving Las Vegas.<br/><br/>There doesn't seem to be much point to any of the films characters who are all one-dimensional to say the least. Even John Goodman's appearance couldn't save this one - his character looks and sounds ridiculous and this is the first time that I would say he simply was very unconvincing in a film. Similarly, Denzel Washington seems to spend most of the film playing drunk badly or pulling this strange 'duck face' that he has developed in recent years in the moments that are supposed to be awkward or emotional - it is a poor performance from one of my favourite actors.<br/><br/>Add to all of this some very odd and badly handled references to a more philosophical side of the situation with people constantly referring to 'God', trying to shoe-horn in some fate vs. free-will ramblings into an already messy film, left me very relieved when 'Flight' limped to a predictable conclusion.

","This is hands down one of the worst movies ever, the only good part was in the trailer, the rest is just one long painfully dull story about a pilot that can't admit he has a problem with alcohol and the people that care about him trying to get him to see it. Don't waste your time on this one. It was a huge disappointment, lots of nudity but to no purpose to the story, what little story there is. I usually love Denzel Washington and his movies, his acting was good but it was the story or lack thereof that made this so bad. It's a long movie, 2 hours and 18 min of boring.

","I really wanted to like this movie but something besides the crash went terribly wrong. Of course Denzel is great, acting wasn't the problem, for the most part. To put it bluntly, the main disaster here was the director pulling punches, playing it safe. Remarkably, the supposed center piece of the movie, the crash, was actually completely irrelevant to the plot. Think about the setup, the pilot was not responsible for the crash and he saved the plane, for the most part, with very few deaths. The movie took great pains to make it clear how extraordinary this was, ""everyone crashed the plane in simulations"" etc. Well, did the pilot's alcoholism help this or hurt this performance? Simple question but this apparently had nothing to do with the moral point of the movie, so somehow his miracle flying and his alcoholism were never considered as related. There could have been many different solutions. E.G. perhaps the pilot missed something obvious in his walk around, so he both ""caused"" the crash and saved the plane, would have preserved the main arc of the story, kept the crash at the center of the movie but legitimately brought in the alcoholism. And the ending simply sucked, in prison, now wiser and honest........sigh, boring, as was the reconciliation with his son, feel good American tripe ending, double sigh."

Well in the beginning of the movie all you see is a half naked woman on the screen, instead of a powerful introduction to make the plot stronger.<br/><br/>That was the biggest problem with the movie. There wasn't a strong enough story to make it a drama. I didn't cry once. I farted instead. I love Danzel Washington, but the movies plot was horrible. I did not even feel any sympathy for the main character who was a drunk cocaine addict that was a pilot. <br/><br/>The plane crash was barely 20 minutes and the entire movie was mostly revolved around a prostitute no one gave a sh*t about and drugs. I felt like I was watching intervention 5 times. <br/><br/>Where was the drama? I thought the movie would have a deep past for Danzel Washington's character but it didn't give enough to satisfy me. All it was in the movie was the crash and him doing cocaine and drinking. <br/><br/>Yawn. I don't get why the co-pilot's wife in the movie was an annoying religious woman who's only line was ""praise Jesus!"" How freaking annoying.

","I watched the movie as I read here on IMDb that ""An airline pilot saves a flight from crashing, but an investigation into the malfunctions reveals something troubling."" OK, I thought, good cast, Denzel usually doesn't let me down and waited for more than 100 mins to see if something would actually happen. But nothing... It turns out that the whole theme of the movie was just alcohol abuse. As a south European, I always have a hard time understanding whats the problem with alcohol abuse in the US, why people cant just enjoy a drink from time to time. On top of that, there are some hints of other drugs abuse, but it seems that for some reason the producers think that smoking isn't that bad after all (I'm a smoker so I can relate to that... LOL).<br/><br/>That said, the movie is very well made, nice photography, nice scenes, good acting. But 130 something minutes to get to the conclusion that alcohol is bad... well I wouldn't have watched it if only I knew. Pity for the misleading description of the movie.<br/><br/>As for the rest, some characters don't seem to really have a real impact on the story or the main character. They are just there probably to give a little flavour to an otherwise pointless movie.<br/><br/>So I give it a 4 as it doesn't deserve less in my opinion; the packaging is very well made. But I really do not see the point of crafting such a huge context just to express this kind of message. The guy could have been a taxi driver. For the sake of clarity, in my scale 4 is crap with some merits, but not to be suggested to anyone."

","Flight is the story of a commercial pilot Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington) who is able to land a defective plane with extraordinary skill, maneuvering it into an inverted position in order to slow the decent. We see this inverted flight captured in the trailer, but believe it or not this is not the most provocative element of this film. The story is so thought provoking that it will have you walking out of the theater questioning whether or not you could or would choose nobility over self-preservation. Most of what takes place behind the scenes looming like a predator waiting to strike is the blame game, with Whip continuously asserting that no one could have landed that plane except him. That point is supported but it's the collateral damage of his arrogance that is at the forefront of determining liability. The trailer also lets the audience in on the fact that Whip is found to have alcohol in his system as is discussed with Hugh Lang (Don Cheadle) who is the attorney brought in to defend Whip on behalf of the Pilot's association. Hugh was very straight and very narrow, which was the case with most of the characters aside from Whip. It was the dichotomy of Whip's persona so brilliantly conveyed in his mannerisms, responses, and facial expressions that makes the performance Oscar, Golden Globe, BET, Trumpet, Image, MTV and any other awards worthy. If Mr. Washington had uttered eight bars I would say he deserves a Hip Hop award or a Grammy, he was that convincing. I recognized this person that Mr. Washington portrayed so true to life, which is not just a testament to good writing, but mostly to the phenomenal acting talent that is Denzel. All the characteristics that made this individual a hero were the same characteristics that could potentially make him infamous. I will say that I as well as many fans am always open to greater insight into who Denzel is, however the rear view was totally unnecessary. The film does a great job of telling a story about the human condition, nobody is one dimensional and sometimes extreme circumstances make you write yourself a reality check. The question is when you cash that check will you be happy with the results. If you have any fear of flying this is not the movie for you. It will reinforce that fear and possibly cause you to swear off flying altogether. I give this film a green light."

","I had high hopes for Flight, no pun intended. It looked solid. Denzel Washington as a heroic pilot who may have other, deeper issues? Sounded good to me. Sounded almost like Oscar bait, even. But it's not. It's about fifteen minutes of awesome (at the beginning) and ten minutes of solid sweetness (at the end) and them more than an hour of crap. Washington tries hard (sometimes way too hard), but his character is so incredibly unlikeable that when the expected epiphany occurs I didn't feel empathy toward him, I felt relief that it was finally, blissfully over.<br/><br/>Washington is Whip Whitaker, an experienced airline pilot. Flying out of Atlanta, he encounters some severe weather but manages to thread a needle through the clouds to clear skies. Problem averted until about half an hour later, when the plane begins to fall apart. Whip pulls off an interesting, unfathomable maneuver, flying the plane upside down for a short time to arrest an extremely steep descent. The plane crashes, and nearly everyone survives. But there's more to the story - had Whitaker been drinking prior to flying?<br/><br/>Yes, it's a FWI (flying while intoxicated) movie, and suddenly it's not about the awesome crash but rather the character of one Captain Whitaker. It's about his fall, rise, fall, fall, fall, fall, rise?, fall, and so on from grace, with the help of a lawyer (Don Cheadle), his best friend (John Goodman), an ex-junkie (Kelly Reilly), and a union rep (Bruce Greenwood). Will Whip rise to the occasion, or will he sink further into decline, hastening his own demise? There's a hearing coming up with the NTSB. Will Whip give it all he's got, and then some, for the sake of his own life, those of his kid and ex-wife, and those of the wreck's survivors? A little while into the movie, you realize these questions are not only moot, they're boring. <br/><br/>Whitaker is a jerk. He's a charmer, sure, but essentially he's a selfish jerk who rebuffs everyone's attempts to help them (even if they're cynically doing so to save their own careers), until...well, you probably know until when, because the movie follows the blueprint of every down-in-the-bottom-and-then-redeemed story to date. <br/><br/>If you enjoy watching Denzel Washington in any movie, this is your movie - because it's any movie, you see. If you enjoy seeing Denzel Washington mumble like a person who's learned that people mumble when they're drunk, this is also your movie. He doesn't act so much as pretend to be a character, and here he thinks that character is Denzel Washington, Drunk Guy. He stumbles, he mumbles, he mutters, he stutters, and that's about it. <br/><br/>In most of Washington's movies, he's the one carrying the film. Here, he's surrounded by a very capable cast, and they prop him up like a cigar-store Indian. Cheadle and Greenwood have great scenes together, Reilly is a wonderful find (I didn't realize she was British - excellent southern US accent), and Goodman not only steals his scenes, it's almost as if he's acting in an entirely different movie altogether.<br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend Flight. Despite previews that almost make it seem like an action movie, or at least a psychological drama, it's neither of them. It's a standard-issue hard-luck story, but by the end you might not care whether the main character overcomes his obstacles or not, and that's a death knell for movies like this."

So I don't buy the drunk and coked up pilot BS. Additionally, everything about the flight was unrealistic. Pilots don't fly into storms. Take off climb out is not that steep. Just how high can a jet spin-up? Those engines just kept going faster and faster and faster... ridiculous. The behavior of the flight crew is unrealistic during the emergency and the crowning piece of BS is the inverted flight to a roll-out into perfectly controlled gliding flight with two engines on fire! Pure crap. Those are just the ""high points"" there are so many other problems with this movie. I'm tired of people telling me to lighten up, its just a movie. I guess people are just so used to being fed BS that they will accept any crap that Hollywood puts out. Another stupid movie to be eaten up by the stupid masses. After the first 30 minutes I just gave up on the movie to do my homework. My homework is far more productive than wasting my time on a movie that plays on the public's lack of flight knowledge and makes light of being an alcoholic and a drug addict pilot or being heroin junkie. Don't waste your time with this horrible movie and Denzel... what the hell happened to you?"
"rgerber4","6","20","35","5 November 2012"," Not what it seemed
","Flight is not a movie about an airplane crash, it's a movie about a alcoholic / drug addict who needs to hit rock bottom, then sink even lower, before finding redemption. Though finely acted by Denzel Washington, his character has few redeeming qualities and it's flat out hard to root for him, even in the clichéd ending. I also have a big problem with the stereotyped co-pilot and his even more blatantly stereotyped wife. The co-pilot, a devout Christian, becomes worthless during the crash sequence, relying on prayer and basically panicking... meanwhile, totally wasted and fried Denzel Washington (drunk and high on coke) saves the day. Then, later in a hospital scene, the co-pilot's Stepfordwife-esque spouse stand by his side, never blinks, and her only dialog consists of her saying ""Praise Jesus"" in a loud monotone every time her husband says something. If minority or gay characters were portrayed as such blatant stereotypes, the critics and mainstream media would be up in arms. Other than that, Flight is a pretty good movie - well acted and directed, and hauntingly realistic. The entire crash sequence is extremely realistic, enough so that I guarantee you'll be thinking about it the next time you hit severe turbulence on a trip somewhere. But,before seeing it, you need to be aware that Flight is not the movie the commercials make you think it is, so go in with your eyes open. Oh, and another note: don't take your kids to see this movie unless exposing them to raunchy language (particularly one scene where a drunk and belligerent Washington tells off a recovering addict)and full frontal female nudity is OK with you."
"sixbells99","1","35","67","10 March 2013"," A terrible film that sends a dangerous message
","The film seems to be in as much denial as a raging alcoholic and its clearly trying to preach that drinking is bad. Yet the opening scene we have the Denzel Washington performing a flight maneuver the red baron would be proud of. The praise for his piloting skills comes up in the film as regular as an internet pop-up. Just so we never forget how good a pilot he is, even if drunk!<br/><br/>But now here's the money shot he's a junkie and an alcoholic and he was higher than Ozzy Osbourne when saving the plane from crashing to the ground. But the message of the film is, drinking is bad, oh yes, drugs are worse because if you taking them while in control of a vehicle you might exhibited piloting skills Luke and Anakin Skywalker would be proud of. <br/><br/>This is kind of strange message because I thought the reason drinking and taking drugs was made illegal while flying and driving is that it impairs your judgment and you are more likely to cause a crash. But in this film universe seems to be the other way round.<br/><br/>Anyhow Denzel's character is bad for doing this, and the guilt for saving all those lives while higher than a space cadet is too much and he confesses. He then goes to jail but it's a Hollywood Jail where in fact he is happy now, since he confessed. <br/><br/>What should have happen in the film is that his drinking and drugs caused the crashed and killed passengers. This is real life and the brutal reality of people in responsibility of vehicles or planes while intoxicated. But I guess this is not Hollywood enough.<br/><br/>Did nobody in the film think it was weird logic? There's a terrible plane crash people die while a pilot is high on vodka and cocaine, yet the cause of the crash is 100% mechanical failure and it's the great piloting skill that prevents further death? <br/><br/>This film sends a dangerous message, because it sends the message the only think Denzel's character did wrong was get caught. That his piloting skills were in no way impacted during the crash, this is a very bad message to send to young people. A very bad film."

","Denzel Washington shows us yet again that he is one of the premier actors of the past 25 years. His convincing portrayal of an alcoholic is downright painful to watch, and I mean this in a very good way, it is such a believable performance. He is the pilot of a plane that crashes, yet his skill as an aviator saves almost all of the passengers. The aircraft is clearly in need of an overhaul, but it's his drug and alcohol addiction that comes prominently into question. With a great supporting cast, including John Goodman, whose character lights up the screen in the few scenes he's in (and someone he's worked with before, 'Fallen' in 1998, and with the Rolling Stones' music figuring in both films!) and Don Cheadle, a much more straitlaced character than Mouse, from 'Devil in a Blue Dress' ('95) where he played opposite Denzel. Kelly Reilly is also wonderful as an addict who befriends Whip (Denzel). Great characters in a well told tale."

","Over twelve years since helming his last live-action film Cast Away, director Robert Zemeckis has decided to mark his comeback to film-making with a bang courtesy of his new drama Flight. Having dealt with Delorean time-machines, cartoon rabbits and autistic heroes in his previous productions, Zemeckis takes a dark turn with his latest effort as he teams up with two time Oscar-winning actor Denzil Washington to present a film about the temptation of alcohol and how it can affect the life of its central character. While it has been done before in other alcohol-related films like The Lost Weekend (1944) and Leaving Las Vegas (1995), you can't help but be intrigued when you know that Denzil has an Oscar nomination for it.<br/><br/>William ""Whip"" Whitaker (Washington) is a pilot who has an alcohol addiction. After spending a heavy night drinking and doing drugs, he takes charge of his latest flight despite still being in a drunken state. But when his flight starts to develop problems in the engineering department, he manages to prevent the plane from crashing thus saving the lives of nearly everyone on board. Although he is hailed a hero, the toxicology report reveals he had alcohol in his blood which leaves him in a tough predicament as he faces being investigated over the incident. As he continues to indulge himself to booze, those around him including lawyer Hugh Lang (Cheadle), close friend Harling Mays (Goodman) and former drug addict-turned-new love interest Nicole (Reilly) try to support him.<br/><br/>As soon as the film starts, you know straight away this isn't Zemeckis's usual territory as we see Whip surrounded by empty beer bottles, lines of cocaine and a sexy (and naked!) Latino woman which sets the tone for what the character's life is all about. This allows writer John Gatins (Oscar-nodded for his script) to create a narrative confrontation for viewers as they become immersed in a story of mental struggle. But for the first half-hour, the film is mostly dominated by the spectacular flight sequence which sees Whip having to handle landing the aircraft in its perilous situation. The director has always excelled when it comes to action scenes and here, it is no exception as the camera shakes uncontrollably and leaves us adrenaline-filled. It is edge-of-your-seat stuff for something so catastrophe and should only be experienced on the big-screen. But the film is not so much about the plane crash and aftermath but is more about Whip's addiction. The highest moments of drama actually occur when confronted by the bottle whether it be at his father's farm or a hotel room he stays at near the film's climax. The latter environment sees him face his toughest choice of whether to drink or not even when facing an important event the following day. Most of the time, the bottle wins the war, just as it unfortunately does so with real life alcoholics. Of course, there are those who try to help him throughout the film but his nasty personality overcomes him even to the point when he gains some new romance in his life by hooking up with former drug-user Nicole. Having spent several years starring in average action-flicks, Denzil Washington manages to reclaim responsibility as one of Hollywood's best actors with his stunning performance of a man whose addiction leaves him in a troubled state of mind. Washington is able to mix charisma, aggression and hidden trauma to his performance as he leaves his audience conflicted over whether they should support his battle to recover or loathe him for his selfish attitude. Don Cheadle and Bruce Greenwood lend effective support as the two authoritative men tasked with helping Whip in his situation but having to put up with his outrageous behaviour while John Goodman stumbles off the set of The Big Lebowski to chew scenery in his limited role as the mouthy but comical dealer. A pleasant surprise in the cast comes from British actress Kelly Reilly as she puts on an immaculate Southern accent in her role as Nicole and provides an emotional and wounded counterpoint to Denzil's Whip.<br/><br/>However Zemeckis does let his guard down with the characterisation and plot structure which is what almost ruined Cast Away in its finale. Though we become fascinated by Whip, we never really find out WHY he is an alcoholic even when we get given some brief details about his family history. When we do see him confronting his ex-wife and son, it comes across as predictable for a man in his state and is a plot cliché that has been done so many times in films and television shows. This also affects the Nicole character as she makes an important contribution to the film's first half only to disappear and then randomly pop up in a contrived manner. Audiences will also find it hard to root for Whip as he is presented as unlikeable for the majority of the film and even when we get to the important courtroom scenes, we struggle to really know whether to care about his fate.<br/><br/>VERDICT: Robert Zemeckis makes a worthy return to live-action films with this gritty but slightly underwhelming character study which is strengthened by an award-winning comeback from Denzil Washington and a mid-air sequence of thrilling proportions."

","Full Disclosure: Hold a Private Pilots License. <br/><br/>In ""The Lost Weekend"" and ""Days of Wine and Roses,"" men battle their addiction to alcohol. Both Ray Milland and, particularly, Jack Lemmon portrayed the alcoholic lifestyle to perfection.<br/><br/>Then there's Denzel Washington. He's a pilot taking control of a doomed commuter jet on a hop from Orlando to Atlanta. Mr. Washington performs a miraculous, impossible maneuver to save the 102 souls on board (losing six) when a catastrophic mechanical failure occurs. Problem is he's drunk (.24) and roused from the alcoholic stupor by cocaine.<br/><br/>""Flight"" follows Mr. Washington from the pre-flight check to his testimony at the NTSB investigation.<br/><br/>There is a subtext of rebirth and spirituality in ""Flight."" Passengers are helped from the crash by a group holding a baptismal service as the plane shears their church spire and misses them by mere feet. His co-pilot thanks God for the crash even though both legs are crushed. However, it's not a spiritual path moving Mr. Washington along his character arc. It's a fellow addict in a parallel story and facing the lies about his life.<br/><br/>One might believe this is the stuff of great drama. Unfortunately, the venerable Mr. Zemeckis allowed padding in this overlong story with too many meaningless scenes that keep the film circling for a landing. We learn very little about Mr. Washington. Most information about his past is gleaned by inference; we first see a Navy tattoo, but he's too young to have flown in Vietnam and too old for the Middle eastern wars; he was a pilot for Delta and it's inferred he's well down the career ladder; his Tuskegee Airman father may have been a drunk who operated a crop dusting service but there's no indication it was an abusive relationship (his Mother is barely mentioned); his son hates him for being a drunk while his ex-wife can barely stand the sight of him at her door. But why? People drink to ameliorate pain.<br/><br/>In ""The Lost Weekend"" we know Milland is disappointed in himself for not being able to write. In ""Days of Wine and Roses"" drinking stems from career pressure and working a job Lemmon loathes. The bottom line: it's self- loathing.<br/><br/>What makes Mr. Washington drink? ""Flight"" offers not an iota of explanation. He's just a garden variety drunk who not only flies loaded but drives that way as well. Drunk driving and flying are inexcusable. Without empathy served up, Mr. Washington is highly unlikable even though he's a stud pilot who saved a lot of people. That's the germ of the story missing from ""Flight."" The locus between bum and hero. The multifaceted personality drawing positive and negative attention.<br/><br/>That a slick lawyer buries the toxicology report to keep Washington out of prison adds little to this ""hero."" As does his personal drug dealer, John Goodman, introduced with The Stones' ""Sympathy For The Devil.""<br/><br/>Portraying an airline allowing the damaged jackscrew causing the elevator failure to remain 1200 hours after a maintenance notification unfairly paints them as uncaring incompetents. Not cool. Aircraft Mechanics should picket theaters. <br/><br/>The reason Mr. Washington caves at the NTSB hearing is to save the reputation of a (boozy) flight attendant he was bedding. His decision is made because she saved a child during the crash and he admits he's told too many lies. A greater story of the politics of lying is absent in ""Flight."" A missed opportunity for a better story. <br/><br/>The final scene has Washington's son visiting him in prison under the guise of writing a paper with the theme, ""The Most Interesting Person I've Never Met."" The son's first question is, ""Who are you?"" Mr. Washington answers, ""I don't know."" If he doesn't, how is the audience to know. It's a senseless response given Mr. Washington, it's inferred, had a great life he wasted for reasons unknown.<br/><br/>There is something in the script of ""Flight"" the writer (a hack who's written some real dreck) kept to himself. Or couldn't articulate. It's a shame a Director of Zemeckis' proportions chose to film it. ""Flight"" is a talky, overlong, snoozy character study minus a leading character that's also absent tension and internal conflict."

","I will keep this review as terse as possible because a movie this average, it seems to me, deserves no less, but surely no more. To the film's credit, the first twenty-five minutes or so passes in nearly flawless fashion, being both breathtaking and gripping. It is well paced and well-acted, believably realistic and terrifically terrifying. And that extended intro, combined with two or maybe three other scenes, constitutes the entirety of ""positives"" in this film. The remaining 90 or so minutes is a cascade of unnecessary or inexplicable scenes and events, each with its own cliché and predictable and banal ""moment."" Perhaps the most ludicrous of these are the ones in which the film very overtly pushes—rather pathetically, I might add—not just a religious opinion, but a religious agenda. Constantly referring to the plane crash as ""pre-determined"" and an ""act of God"" (surely you can see the bigger picture here) not only comes off as extraordinarily preachy, but also undermines the entire purpose of convicting or indicting or at the very least searching for evidence of negligence on the pilots part, which is really the underlying plot for most of the movie. So in conclusion, the film is, on the whole, fragmented, broken, and rather illogical, and is connected together with a tenuous string of non sequiturs and character and plot inconsistencies, with a few very well done scenes scattered throughout. It is worth a rental at best, but if you're like me, you will want to watch only the first half-hour, because after the frightening plane crash introduction, it is the movie itself that begins to nosedive (apparently uncontrollably) and might you venture to guess who the victims of that crash are?"

","A great central performance doesn't make a bad script any better. 'Flight' begins - after a somewhat overwrought sequence establishing that 'Whip' Whitaker (Denzel Washington) is an alcoholic coke head - with a literally fantastic plane crash sequence in which he saves the lives of all but six of the 102 on board by being a super-cool ace pilot, unlike his co-pilot whose hysterics are completely over the top. Scary, but the shots of a flaming 727 or whatever upside-down at 500 feet make you feel admiration for the FX team, rather than empathy for the passengers. If you want a seriously terrifying plane crash sequence look out 'Alive!'(1993), about the Chilean rugby team cannibalism episode. In 'Flight', you'll end up chewing your own arm off in boredom.<br/><br/>But 'Flight' isn't about planes crashing, it's about an addict and his redemption. In which case, Zemeckis has got the cart before the horse - or in UK English, the whole thing a*** about face. After the way he handles the plane crash, anything else Whitaker does will be a complete anticlimax. And it is. The whole film is too long, John Goodman annoyingly retreads his 'Lebowski' role, and of course the female characters are about as deep as a Stoli and orange.<br/><br/>Don't believe the hype; turkeys don't fly."

The character of Nicole went no where ... Her storyline never materialized. Basically, Nicole's character appeared to be an afterthought that got interrupted mid thought.

","This is a very serious movie. It deals with an issue that is probably more common than any of us who ever fly would probably care to think about - the possibility of alcoholic pilots flying under the influence. There's some potential for this to become a pretty good character study of Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington) - the alcoholic pilot. But it really doesn't manage to do that. There's not much in this character to actually study, to be honest. Whip is an alcoholic pilot, who won't admit that he has a drinking problem and is basically a jerk toward anyone who tries to convince him otherwise. He's not a likable character; he's not a character you really spend very much time rooting for. You're happy at the end of the movie, when he finally makes his confession to the NTSB hearing, and I personally appreciated that at the very end, he seemed repentant and cleaned up and was looking for neither sympathy nor excuses, even as he sat in prison. But there was a lot between the beginning and the end that really didn't work all that well.<br/><br/>I didn't really care for the character of Nicole (Kelly Reilly). Actually, to be fair, it's wasn't that I didn't care for Nicole. My problem was that I didn't see the need for Nicole. Nicole was an alcoholic and drug addict on the road to recovery who hooked up with and started a relationship with Whip. But to what end? Reilly was fine as Nicole, but what did the character really add to the movie? I just didn't see it. I didn't much care for the union rep (Bruce Greenwood) or the union's lawyer (Don Cheadle). All they basically managed to do was reinforce stereotypes about both unions and lawyers, as they fight to get Whip off the hook, even though they know beyond a shadow of a doubt that he had been drinking and that he was a drunk. That's what I want out of a pilot's union and its lawyer - getting the drunk pilot back at the controls of a plane! John Goodman added some basically comic relief to the movie as Harling, a cartoonish drug-dealer friend of Whip's. I didn't care for the co-pilot (Ken Evans) and his obnoxious but surprising unemotional wife, (Bethany Anne Lind - ""thank you, Jesus"" repeatedly in monotonous tones) who are angry with Whip for the crash which has left the co-pilot crippled for life, but manage to get him into a prayer session. With perhaps the exception of Nicole (who was likable but who was extraneous to the story) none of them were characters I cared about. And even Whip I didn't care that much about.<br/><br/>I was really put off by what will surely become one of the classic ridiculous plot devices in Hollywood history, when, the night before the NTSB hearing, the union gets Whip put up in a hotel, with all the alcohol taken out of the fridge and a guard at the door to make sure he doesn't go out for a drink. Unfortunately, the door to the adjoining room (which was also unfortunately unoccupied) was unlocked, so Whip could help himself to that fridge with no one knowing and go on a binge. Please. Don't insult my intelligence by stretching things too far. That was dumb.<br/><br/>The best part of the movie was the portrayal of the airline crash at the beginning, as Whip becomes a hero at first for managing to crash-land the plane with only six people being killed. That was very well done, very tense and seemed realistic enough to me. After that, to be honest, this kind of fell apart. (5/10)"

"Michael_Elliott","Null","4","5","20 November 2012"," A Character Study That's Honest
","Flight (2012) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Denzel Washington turns in one of the strongest performances of his career playing Walt Whitaker, a pilot who becomes an overnight hero after he saves the majority of the passengers on a doomed plane. Soon after becoming a hero Walt starts to get questioned on whether or not he was up all night partying and in fact was flying the plane drunk and soon he's forced to face himself and the events. Robert Zemeckis has certainly delivered a very entertaining, honest and depressing look at a man who seems to be good at just about everything except being honest with himself. Going into the picture I really wasn't sure what to expect but the film turned out to be great from start to finish and it's certainly one of the more honest looks at an alcoholic to come along in a while. The screenplay by John Gatins is extremely well-written and I think it deserves a lot of credit because I really appreciated the way we get to know this character. Because it's Denzel you're automatically going to want him to do good but the challenging aspects of the screenplay are so well handled by the actor and director that you really do feel like you're getting a complete character study. Zemeckis adds in some great song selections, the cinematography is top notch and there's no question that the film contains some excellent and tense drama. The Q&S session is perfectly handled and the crash sequence is one of the most chilling I've ever seen. Washington is excellent in the role of the troubled pilot as he contains that charm we all love but it also gives the actor a chance to give a full performance. He's so great at everything he does I think he often doesn't get the chance to do a role as complete as this one but he proves why he's one of the best out there. John Goodman, Don Cheadle and Kelly Reilly are all great in their supporting roles as well. You've also got to give everyone credit for not watering down the material and going for a safe and clean PG-13 rating. While there's nothing overly offensive here, the R-rating does allow for an honest and open look at this very flawed character. FLIGHT is certainly one of the years best films."

"sorgos61690","2","20","39","5 November 2012"," Flight ""Crashes"" With the Flight
","If my husband and I had not been sitting in the middle of our row, we would have left. The flight scene at the beginning of the movie was incredible, but it pretty much stops there. It seems like Hollywood rarely cranks out really good movies anymore. Denzel Washington is as good as he can be in this role, but we found it hard to care about his character, and the movie did almost nothing to develop relationships; something truly key to any good movie. His character had one somewhat meaningful relationship in the movie, one which comes and goes virtually out of nowhere. <br/><br/>Never have I felt so ""deceived"", if you will, at what the plot of a movie was about. Any of the trailers you'll see pretty much focus on the flight and crash, but it's almost solely on the life of an alcoholic. It was so boring (after the ""flight"" ended)I felt like it was at one time a movie about an alcoholic and they added the ""flight"" scene to save the movie, literally, and added a good ""70's"" song and nudity to attempt to put the interest in. For the record, these are elements that do not interest me at all, but they seem to interest Hollywood, especially when there isn't really much of a story. I find it interesting that this film has the same director as Cast Away, which also began with a plane crash; but the movie wasn't really about the crash. At least in that movie, from the title alone, you had a much better idea what the movie was about. <br/><br/>The end is somewhat redeeming, although as I mentioned, it was hard to care much since you don't wind up caring for his character to begin with very much, not because he's an alcoholic, but because the movie pretty much thrives on his deprived state, and drags out his depravity. We got it,OK; he's an alcoholic!"

","First, at two hours and eighteen minutes it was one hour too long. They could have easily cut an hour from the movie and lost nothing. It was so slow paced that it became boring.<br/><br/>Second, there were far too many plot holes. Without giving away too much there is no way that hospital nurse would have allowed herself to be thrown out of a patients room by a guest of the patient; a lawyer would have risked being disbarred by been directly involved in the activities he was a direct party too; the NTSB would not have functioned the way they were shown; the news media would have been all over the pilot trailing and hounding him from the start; and the pilot in the end would have never done what he did without out some motivating influence that just wasn't there. It just wasn't believable.<br/><br/>Third, the portrayal of Christians was just rude and offensive. It was as if Hollywood looked at the success of movies like Fireproof, Courageous, and Facing the Giants and said ""hey, these Christians go to see religious movies so let's cash in on that and make a godly looking movie."" And like so many things Hollywood has no interest in or understanding of but make movies about anyway, it was totally devoid of any spiritual aspect. One Christian character in the movie shouts out ""Praise Jesus"" twice and both times it is so outlandish and ridiculous that the audience in the theater we saw it in broke out in laughter each time and the second time there was a continued murmuring that lasted the rest of the scene.<br/><br/>If you want to see a good heart-lifting movie go see one of the ones I mentioned above but don't waste your money on this one. It's not even work a $1 Redbox rental."

It's about an alcoholic/drug-addict airline captain who 'heroically' crash-lands a plane, though he was high because of substance abuse when he did it.<br/><br/>So many flaws, I can't name them all here. I realized immediately that I didn't like the main character, 'Whip' (that's Denzel's name in this fiasco). How did this putz become an airline captain? He would have been shut down and escorted off the plane if he showed up in a dazed stupor the way he did. ""Roll the plane""??? Give me a freaking break. This airline jet would have to be flying close to Mach 1 to maintain flight in an inverted configuration. <br/><br/>The co-pilot could destroy the drunken pilot and his lying friends who are trying to get his lame butt off the hook, but the script-writer cops out by making the co-pilot choose 'divine intervention' as an excuse to remain silent about Whip's intoxicated state during the crash investigation. Just when you think it can't get any worse, John Goodman shows up to do his over-the-top schtick, this time as a drug dealer. <br/><br/>More garbage from Schmollywood.

"jackbelisle","7","13","24","17 October 2012"," Flight: New York Film Festival Review
","""Flight"" closed the 50th annual New York Film Festival on Sunday, October 14th, 2012. I was lucky enough to be at that premiere. <br/><br/>While this film is being marketed as a big action film, at heart, it is a deep character study that showcases Denzel Washington's best performance in years. <br/><br/>Washington stars as Whip Whitaker, a seasoned airline pilot. <br/><br/>On the morning of October 14th, 2011, Whip wakes up after a booze and sex infused night. In order to make his flight at 9am, he shoots a line of coke to get him in line. What follows is 20 minutes of pure filmmaking genius, which shows Whitakar making his way to the airport to prepare for his flight. Despite being drunk and high, Whip manages to pilot the plane through some bad weather. After falling asleep and letting his copilot (Brian Geraghty) take control, Whip wakes up just as the plane begins to go into a dive. After throughly freaking out the entire plane, Whip miraculously inverts the plane and lands it safely, saving most of the people on board. <br/><br/>The plane crash scene is done with scary accuracy, and you can't tell that special effects were employed. After the amazing first 45 minutes, a character drama develops that lasts the rest of the film. <br/><br/>Denzel- simply amazing, grounds his character and really makes you believe you are watching an alcoholic. He will most certainly be nominated for an Oscar. Other characters that shined were John Goodman as Harling Mays, Whitaker's Big Lebowski-esque drug dealer, and Brian Geraghty as the G-d loving co-pilot. <br/><br/>Onto direction, Zemeckis has not lost a step after his 12 years away from live-action filmmaking, the script is very solid, and the film is beautifully shot. On the downside, I thought the film could have been a bit shorter, while still getting across the same message.<br/><br/>Overall- 7/10<br/><br/>P.S. I attended the New York Film Festival as a reporter, and you can see some of the reports I put together from the red carpet here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk-aUeF9DeE and here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmUNOe7ZAsU"

""PRAISE Jesus."" This movie should have never made past a 5 star rating. Things that would be happening in this movie, are just completely unrealistic, and it has different topics, kind of like Family Guy.

"rizzojr","5","19","38","12 November 2012"," This ""Flight"" fails to take off..
","In his first live action film in 12 years, director Robert Zemeckis brings the story of an impaired pilot flying a stricken airliner to the big screen. As most reviews state, Flight is an excellent examination of character development. And, while the characters are indeed compelling, the overall story goes undeveloped.<br/><br/>Captain William ""Whip"" Whitaker is an ace pilot who struggles with various substance addictions. After a sleepless night partying with a flight attendant, Whitaker is forced to save his doomed jet as it plummets to the ground. However, the hero is quickly forced to go on the defensive once it becomes known he was intoxicated during the flight. <br/><br/>It is at this point in the movie, approximately 25 minutes in that Flight begins to stall. It quickly transforms from a riveting movie to one of unrealized potential. As the film progresses, it becomes clear that the two lead characters face internal demons that prevent them from leading normal lives. Yet what the movie's writers fail to do is fully develop its characters; never answering these questions<br/><br/>o Why was Whip the one pilot who could land that aircraft? o Is the relationship between Whip and his father the reason he is an alcoholic? o What internal demons is Nicole constantly battling? o Other than a drug dealer, who is Harling Mays?<br/><br/>Despite these character issues the movie could have been a success if it had only taken advantage by comparing and contrasting the lead character – that of an ace pilot and his internal demons. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, Flight succumbs to a predictable ending. And, I was left to exclaim to the remainder of the theatre, ""what was the point?"""
"tbmforclasstsar","9","16","31","3 November 2012"," powerful performances and brilliant directing keep Flight high off the ground
","Robert Zemeckis is one director I never really think of when it comes to some of the best directors of all-time. But when you actually go back and look at his career, there hasn't been a lot to shake your head at. Director of an acclaimed franchise in Back to the Future, an Oscar winner for his direction for Forrest Gump, and the motion capture master behind The Polar Express and A Christmas Carol, it was exciting to hear that Zemeckis was moving past motion- capture and back into live action film. Even more exciting was the idea of Zemeckis working with Denzel Washington on a challenging film for both director and lead actor.<br/><br/>The result of Zemeckis and Washington's partnership is the film Flight, the story of an airline pilot who miraculously crash lands a nose-diving jet, saving the lives of 96 people. The conflict? Pilot Whip Whitaker is an alcoholic and was under the influence the morning of the crash, a crash that resulted in six deaths and could result in life in jail for Whitaker.<br/><br/>The opening thirty minutes of Flight are some of the most intense minutes of film this year. While we know from a synopsis or seeing a trailer that this plane is going to crash, the process of filmmaking the turbulent nose dive is brilliant by Zemeckis. The camera shakes seemingly uncontrollably as the plane starts to fail in the sky, bags and items fly about the cabin, passengers scream, and Denzel powerfully acts as Whip trying to regain control of the plane as it plunges to a certain crash. These moments are edge-of-your-seat, heart-pounding filmmaking at its best and something everyone will want to see on the big screen rather than from the comfort of their living room.<br/><br/>But after the crash, the film is quite different. While this may have started as an action packed story, it shifts to the drama of a stumbling alcoholic that can't keep himself from the urges of a drink or other influences. Very similar one of Zemeckis' other films, Cast Away, Flight starts off with a loud bang and turns into a slow character study completely spotlighting the protagonist.<br/><br/>This is, after all, what Flight is. It is not a drama, an action movie, a romance, or a comedy, even though it contains all of these elements. The film is a dark character study about a man who cannot resist the urges that have haunted him for years and years. It is a study of not only this character, but of the morality of him and the audience alike. How long can Whip continue to drink in excess and tell himself he has no faults for the plane crash? Even if the crash was mechanical failure, how can Whip not see the danger he put all the passengers in the minute he stepped onto that plane? And, even more importantly, how deep will the audience stumble down with him? We defend Whip from the very beginning, but as each addiction and issue begins to unravel, how long will we stand in his court? Zemeckis, Washington, and the screenwriters make it hard for us to want to jump ship, but they give us every reason to as the events of the film play out.<br/><br/>The other portion of the film is the relationships Whip has with his wife and son and a woman he met at the hospital named Nicole. Whip's wife and son have come to understand the alcoholic tendencies Whip has and they have separated themselves from that life, while Nicole, who was in the hospital due to a drug overdose, does not understand the man Whip is and slowly falls into a relationship with him. While Nicole tries to get herself better, Whip falls apart more and more and creates an environment that is awful for a recovering addict. Unable to help himself, his family, and his new love interest, Whip has truly hit a low of lows, and this isn't even calculating in the investigation from the government that could mean the rest of Whip's life is spent behind bars.<br/><br/>To read the rest of the review (IMDb form too short) visit: http://custodianfilmcritic.com/flight/"

There is no depth to this movie, no real insight into the trials that a pilot may face after a disaster and how aircraft mechanical malfunctions can be handled by a talented pilot.<br/><br/>The movie is instead about Denzel's ridiculous alcohol problem that he would have no realistic way to sustain throughout a career as a commercial pilot, since commercial flight crew in the U.S. are regularly subjected to being breathalyzed and drug tested by the FAA. But logic has no place in this movie, nor does this movie allow any character, besides Denzel's, to be developed."

Either I'm a fanboy or he really is a great actor. I suggest he is a great actor. This is a way cool movie and too close to reality for comfort. I mean, don't they screen pilots before they fly full of booze? It seems a bit thin on the ground at times, given the seriousness of the subject matter but upon reflection, the way it ends, suggests this is a super intelligent way of dealing with the subject matter. It is my second favorite movie ever about alcoholism, as one of its central themes. For those who don't care about the subject of too much booze too often, it is just another very good Denzel movie."

","Denzel gives a high-flying (pun intended) performance as Whip Whitaker, a commercial pilot who may have a drinking problem, but he'll certainly be the last to know. Directed with restraint by tech-whiz Robert Zemeckis in his first live-action effort in more than a decade, ""Flight"" is a gut- wrenching film with its power grounded in its lead performance by Mr. Washington. He too acts with a restraint unseen in his Oscar-winning work as a bad cop in ""Training Day"", instead opting to bare his soul with his eyes. Man, those are some heavy, storied eyes. And they should be. From the film's riveting opening crash sequence (Zemeckis' time to shine) to its gripping court-room ending, we take a saddening journey through Whip's life as it spirals out of control faster than a full-pitched plane in a nosedive. At times a tad preachy, but ultimately satisfying, you can go ahead and reserve a seat for Denzel on a direct flight to the Oscars. And it would be a cryin' shame to not mention John Goodman's knockout turn as a drug dealer. Wow he's brilliantly funny!"

The plot was very interesting and one that takes a different direction from what we usually see these days (IE comic book heroes, crazy animated features).<br/><br/>Some scenes were entirely overdone, especially the scene in the hospital with the copilot. I'm pretty sure the entire audience was thinking, ""Should I laugh? Or should I cringe?""<br/><br/>I also left feeling unsatisfied with how some relationships were developed. I wish they would have developed the relationship between Whip and his father more, and maybe even shown him and his wife before things went to hell. Also, when Nicole suddenly decided to get clean and is gone for basically the rest of the movie until showing up in those pictures at the end, it was definitely a ""huh?"" moment.<br/><br/>Some of the best moments came when John Goodman's character showed up for comic relief. Those scenes definitely helped lift the air of awkwardness that settled every so often.<br/><br/>That being said, Denzel was in fine form. His acting reminded me of classic Denzel. Don Cheadle also delivered a great performance. John Goodman did what he does best, delivering a performance reminiscent of Walter from The Big Lebowski.<br/><br/>Don't spend your money to see it on the big screen, but it's worth renting."
"cattjones","8","18","37","3 November 2012"," Buckle up, folks
","When I first saw the preview for this film I had no intention on seeing it. I already have panic attacks every time I know that I am going to have to fly somewhere. I was feeling every bit of turbulence that the folks on the plane were feeling. I hate to fly and this film did nothing to sway my concerns in this mode of travel. As shown in the trailer, at some point the airplane is actually flying upside down. At that point I would no longer need to worry because I would be dead of a heart attack. Although this film centers on the plane crash event, it is not the main focus of the film. The main focus centers around pilot Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington) and the issues that he is dealing with. Charlie Anderson (Bruce Greenwood) and Hugh Lang (Don Cheadle) arrive on the scene and try to help mitigate the situation, but they become enablers just like almost everyone else in the film. I think that there were two bright spots in the film. The first one was Derek Hogue (Dane Davenport), who is a guy dealing with cancer and has gained a whole new perspective on life. The second character was Harling Mays (John Goodman) who is what can only be described as a closer. He was hilarious. Margaret Thomason (Tamara Tunie) played a huge part in saving the majority of the passengers on the plane although her participation was not acknowledged in the film. I think that the writers kind of dropped the ball a little bit here. I just want to say that I have always wanted to get a sneak peak at Denzel's backside but now that I've seen it, it was really no big deal. The film was definitely good enough to hold your attention although it was longer than it needed to be. There was no real surprises in this film and it was pretty predictable from beginning to end, but I think that director Robert Zemeckis did an excellent job telling this story. For those of us who are fearful of flying, this film will just add to your anxiety and it puts yet another scenario in your head of what could happen as you're cruising at 30,000 feet, but I say, turn off all your electrical devices and buckle down and go and see this film. I give it a green light."

Flight is a film about a man coming to terms with his addiction to alcohol.<br/><br/>I am a social worker and really interested in addictions, so watching this movie was very interesting for me. Denzel Washington was phenomenal as a man with a serious alcohol problem. The plane crash ultimately becomes a catalyst for him to realize that he is an alcoholic and that he needs help. <br/><br/>The actual plane crash scene is amazing! I was on the edge of my seat for the whole thing. The scene was well directed, produced, written, and acted. <br/><br/>All in all, I highly recommend this movie. However, if you are looking for a high paced, action filled movie, this isn't going to be it. There is a lot of drama and a fair bit of action, but again, this movie is not about the crash itself--it is about how the crash ultimately makes the captain come to terms with his addiction.<br/><br/>Hope you enjoy!"

If you have any understanding of flying then Hollywood immediately broke the laws of physics right in front of your face.The question in my mind while the plane was inverted was 'Well what now? , how do you save this because you can't land upside down and when you turn back over it will nosedive again . . but no when turned back over it glided!!?? So that was the heroic skillful pilot bit debunked at the start. So then we get to the drinking and drug problem. Clichéd enough said and John Goodmans role the 'saviour' was a character who could easily have been Micheal Jacksons personal MD..please. What I find most annoying though is the redemption. The sugar coated epiphany . . I didn't get that bit. He throws away a career he admittedly should not have but in doing so presumably because he could not besmirch the character of his heavy drinking stewardess who was twice as drunk as he was according to the toxicology. The 'Hero Fesses up' and 'heroically' throws away the financial support to his ex wife and son who presumably end up in the Hovel Nicole lived in just to save the face of a stewardess who was already labelled a drunk. Sorry but none of the angles squared up and resolutions only created further questions. Maybe I should have stuck with my original plan to sit and drink coffee and read a few magazines while my wife shopped instead of watching a movie that was designed to provoke your thoughts but when you started thinking you only realised how the plot had well 'missed the plot'. Like the unflyable plane Denzell sadly had an unplayable role. An Oscar? No sorry Denzells' Portrayal missed Micky O'Rourkes Wrestler by a country mile."

","Call me a sucker for expecting this movie to take a fair look at alcoholism, and the REALITY that every bad thing which happens cannot be fairly blamed on any drunk who just happened to be there! In fairness on my part, there was some observation of sheeple-people stupidity in the reaction against and judgement of drunks, but altogether the writers made clear their purpose was to justify the scapegoating and punishment, as usual, of those who are ill with the addiction as knowing ""perpetrators"" This idea, popularized by politicians and the media, couldn't be more ridiculous, considering an addict's state of mind, while those who go unpunished for their sober-minded and greed-driven neglect were far closer to deserving criminal prosecution.

"petra_ste","8","5","8","24 October 2015"," See you all on the dark side of the moon
","Robert Zemeckis reminds me of Steven Spielberg - a gifted visual storyteller who is usually better at more lighthearted fare (in his case, Back to the Future and Who Framed Roger Rabbit?) than at darker stuff. Flight, however, is Zemeckis' best serious movie, a sharp drama anchored by a magnificent performance by Denzel Washington.<br/><br/>Washington plays Whip Whitaker, veteran pilot whose plane malfunctions during a flight (a tense set-piece which Zemeckis handles superbly). Whip pulls off an impossible maneuver and manages to land saving almost everyone on board; when he awakens in a hospital, he is hailed as a hero. Trouble is, Whip is an alcoholic - he was piloting drunk and high on cocaine. While he was unconscious, blood samples were taken from him, toxicology tests performed; Whip realizes he may go from saviour to culprit of the disaster.<br/><br/>I've never seen Washington give a weak performance; this is among his best ones. Whip is a thorny character, a man capable of decency and empathy, but also weak and self-destructive. If the first act of the movie is about Whip's plane crashing, what follows is about Whip's LIFE crashing and burning as well.<br/><br/>Although the incident is the flashier scene, a few quieter moments are even better, such as when, at the funeral of a crew member, Whip emotionally blackmails a surviving hostess into keeping quiet about his addiction (""Imagine your son at this same church looking at you in that box""). As far as Hollywood protagonists go, Whip is a rather unsavory type.<br/><br/>The stellar supporting cast includes John Goodman, Bruce Greenwood and Don Cheadle - three actors who are always good - and Kelly Reilly as a drug addict who bonds with Whip; Reilly is fine in the tricky role but her subplot feels truncated and narratively unbalanced.<br/><br/>Although the ending isn't as clichéd as it could have been, I feel Flight screamed for a darker conclusion - one tragic in the classical sense, where the protagonist is destroyed by his fatal flaw. Still, this is a powerful character study, both Zemeckis' and Washington's best work in years.<br/><br/>7,5/10"

","I've seen this movie a couple of times. Each instance was at a completely different period of my life and I watched with a completely different mindset each time. The first time I saw it, I saw mostly only what was on the surface, the thrill of the plane crash. This time, the second time, I watched it with the point of view of someone who helps individuals with addictions. Captain Whitaker did his job every day. He was able to function every day.
He saved lives the day of the crash. No question about it. He saved lives even under the influence of cocaine and alcohol. No one questions anything until something happens. We would probably be surprised how many people function while impaired by substance use. This is an important movie. Watch it."
"quincytheodore","8","3","4","12 March 2015"," A brilliant tale of triumph
","In an epic tale of man versus booze, Denzel Washington takes flight in one of his best roles as a deeply disturbed alcoholic pilot. He takes the audience into a private struggle, one that can easily draw us to root for this man brimming with flaws, but inadvertently hailed as a hero. The lies he makes, and the way he tells them in almost self-convincing way is sometimes lightly humorous, although the persisting issue is a heavy one.<br/><br/>Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington) is a heavyweight drinker, with occasion cocaine sniffing as break in between, I was informed about many types of liquors just by watching him drink. In his line of profession as a pilot, in which he's extremely gifted, it's a serious offense. Certainly, flying with an intoxicated pilot is no way to start any vacation. However, in a time of emergency, he manages to land a crumbling plane, in a stylish way, to boot. This instantly makes him a hero, but the follow-up investigation might just reveal his addiction and pretty much ruin his life.<br/><br/>Nicole Maggen (Kelly Reilley) is an attractive red haired drug addict whose life entwined with Whip's, solely because they are treated in the same hospital. Whip sees her as a somewhat an escape from real life, meeting her seems rather surreal, not to mention at such junction of his life. Ultimately Nicole realizes her addiction problem and tries to find help, which proved to be a rude awakening for Whip to face his own problem.<br/><br/>Hugh Lang (Don Cheadle) is Whip's attorney in the investigation. He tries to save Whip's career, partially because of duty and perhaps some appreciation for Whip, but he eventually finds himself weighted down by Whip's erratic behavior. Hugh is involved professionally, though he resembles an incidental ally at times. John Goodman, whose entrance is the song ""Sympathy for The Devil"", is Whip's crack dealer. A shady acquaintance, evil Santa, who gives dark respite for Whip at his darker times.<br/><br/>With fast and highly engaging screenplay, it highlights the few days of alcoholic's life with interesting perspective. Often his deception shows much confidence, but he falters when he's alone, these scenes is wittily shown sometimes even with barely dialogues in them. The start and the end provide more bombastic scenes, the first plane crash sequence is very engrossing as it puts the audience right besides these characters in their desperate time.<br/><br/>Flight could've been an entirely bleak or somber movie, but it takes us into a man's journey to face his demon, merely as audience and with tongue-in-cheek humor. As result, it is a brilliant tale of triumph."
"dierregi","7","3","4","9 March 2015"," The higher you fly, the more disastrous the crash
","A good, solid story about the fall from glory of an arrogant pilot. It can be seen as a metaphor of addiction. Substance abuse makes you fly high, but you lose track of your limits and people around you start to dislike your self-centered attitude. Some of those people are lost forever; others may still be around to forgive you.<br/><br/>The plot itself is about cocky airline pilot Whip, who manages to save most of his passengers during a disastrous flight from Orlando to Atlanta. Despite (or because) being high on cocaine, Whip successfully performs a daredevil move and lands the plane on a field. There are six casualties though and legal actions to follow.<br/><br/>Whip is in full denial of his addiction to cocaine and alcohol and manages to alienate everybody around him. Linked to the main story is a rather unnecessary subplot involving a female addict. Satisfactory ending."
"joncheskin","8","3","4","4 January 2015"," Spot-On Drama About Addiction
","If you have ever wondered what it would be like to be an extremely talented person with a horrible substance-abuse problem, Flight is definitely the movie for you. Alcohol and coke contain the seeds of destruction for pilot Whip Whitaker, and a disastrous mechanical failure on a flight to Atlanta push his life of deception and denial to a point of catastrophe. Whip saves the flight with a Sully Sullenberger style maneuver, but the truth is that he was bombed when he came to fly the plane, and a lawyer hired by the pilot's union has to do colossal damage control to keep the word from getting out. Whip recovers from the crash on his farm and finds a fellow addict to share a relationship of sorts during the convalescence, but this relationship, like his already-destroyed marriage, is quickly on the rocks because of his continued drinking (sorry about the nasty puns). <br/><br/>What makes this movie special is that most of the details about the addiction are very believable, and then are elevated to an utterly- truthful status by Denzel Washington's brilliant performance. Washington gives a perfect picture of a man who is talented and appealing in many ways, but whose soul is completely death-gripped by the booze and drugs. It is a sad story told brilliantly.<br/><br/>The end of the movie, I will say, is perhaps not realistic. I cannot go into details, otherwise I would have to check off the spoiler box, and so the film has a flaw (see it for yourself!). The filmmakers to some extent paint themselves into a corner with it, and perhaps it could have happened, but I don't believe it. Nonetheless, everyone should go and watch the addict and be appalled."
"bob the moo","Null","3","4","17 August 2013"," Makes a big impact early on but mostly wastes it and the potential in the cast (spoilers)
","When it came out everyone knew two things about Flight – it has a dramatic plane crash in it and it represented a shot at an Oscar for Washington. The timing was the usual end quarter 4/quarter 1 period where the big push films tend to come out and the trailer did a great job of showing us the plane crash in too much detail. I understand why it did because by far it is the best part of the film. We open with pointless nudity which seems to only be there so that we can be told that we are watching a ""grown-up"" film. In retrospect it probably needs to do this because it is not as mature as it thinks it is.<br/><br/>From here we get some establishing of characters before we have the incident on the plane. This scene is intense, dramatic and really well filmed; if you were not engaged by the film by this point, this sequence will do it. Sadly the remainder of the film fritters this all away and never makes the same impact again. Although not related to the cause of the crash, Whip has major problems with drink and drugs and this is what the majority of the film is about. I assumed that it would explore his character and his struggle but in reality we get one sequence of his self-destructive nature after another. All of them are well acted but none of them are reflective or do anything different from the one before or the one coming up next – indeed some of them are close to celebratory in how they are delivered and I'm not sure why humor was such a part of the film. Anyway, this is really all we get and to be fair the professional nature of it and the background of the crash does mean it is quite interesting, but it never does anything of merit outside of this.<br/><br/>Instead of character and struggle exploration, we get a last-minute Road to Damascas and glib redemption. This feels cheap and only serves to highlight how little the film actually did with the character and the subject. The cast do what they can with it. Washington is great – shame he wasted so much on such an average film. Cheadle doesn't have too much to do but is a good presence – likewise Greenwood, Gerety, Tunie, Beauvais, Leo and the other familiar faces you'll see. The film really uses them as face though and not too much is done with them. Goodman feels totally out of place, like he has walked in from another film; I understand what his character was, but if the important thing is making his character convincing then they should make a film for that character – here what his delivery brought hurt the film – particularly when he is in the hotel room scene near the end, he adds a comedic element it didn't need. Velazquez (My Name is Earl) is used primarily for her nudity – it is totally unnecessary but I shan't pretend the film didn't get my whole attention from the very first shot because of it.<br/><br/>Flight starts with many attention grabbing elements – in particular the crash sequence. From here it becomes an issues film but sadly it is one that is mostly badly done. We have ongoing scenes of behavior but nothing within them to run with. It should have been so much more and Washington clearly was up to the task, but it does nothing till an obvious denouncement. It isn't a bad film, it is just a disappointing one as it gradually deflates itself and wastes the potential it all."
"Troy_Campbell","7","3","4","30 January 2013"," A solid examination of alcoholism.
","After the opening scene in which pilot Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington) wakes up with a monster hangover yet drinks some more alcohol, smokes some weed and does a line of cocaine, it's clear the trailer for Flight was massively misleading. This is not a light-hearted movie with elements of mystery, trademark Denzel coolness or a hint of darkness; this is an intense drama about alcoholism that cuts deep at every turn. The plane crash isn't the focus here, it's merely an extraordinary situation which serves to push Whip's condition to the fore, allowing an examination of the addiction that can inflict itself even on people in positions of great importance. There's no doubting the nobility in attacking such a serious topic, but there's elements that don't work: Kelly Reilly's heroin addict doesn't convince, Don Cheadle is criminally underused as Whip's lawyer and the ending is, if not necessarily the easy route, definitely gift-wrapped a little too neatly. With a solid turn from Washington, a thankful resistance from director Robert Zemeckis to get melodramatic and a terrific soundtrack, Flight manages to stay on track about a man who goes way off it."
"jimbo-53-186511","6","4","6","24 August 2014"," An interesting film, but I can't help but feel that this film could have been a lot better than it actually is
","Denzel Washington plays Captain Whip Whitaker who wakes up one morning to make a seemingly routine flight from Orlando to Atlanta. During the course of the flight the plane malfunctions and Whitaker is forced to make an emergency landing. Following the crash, Whitaker is initially hailed a hero due to the fact that he managed to save the lives of 96 people out of the 102 people that were onboard. However, when toxicology reports are carried out, traces of alcohol and drugs are found in Whitaker's system and once the NTSB get wind of this they assume that the reason for the crash was down to the fact that Whitaker was 'impaired' when he boarded. However, Whitaker maintains that the reason the plane crashed was down to the fact that it was 'faulty'. With the help of his friend Charlie (Bruce Greenwood) and defence attorney Hugh Lang (Don Cheadle), Whitaker sets about proving that the crash was down to a defect with the aircraft rather than human error. Will he be successful in proving his innocence? <br/><br/>I think the main problem with Flight is that it fails to develop its central character Whip Whitaker. We quickly learn at the start of the film that he's an alcoholic, but this issue isn't really explored. We can assume that it's probably something to do with the strained relations between his estranged wife and his kid, but again this is only an assumption. I think if we'd have got a bit more of a back story for Whitaker (what triggered his alcoholism, where he went wrong as a father, why he's obnoxious and arrogant). Even if it was only a 5-10 minute segment just to understand his character a little bit more. Whilst it's clear that Whitaker isn't a likable person, I also didn't particularly hate him because I couldn't understand why he was the way he was. I found myself almost indifferent to his character which is a failing as more often than not it makes me indifferent to the film as a result. The character of Nicole (Kelly Reilly)strikes up a friendship with Whitaker and they almost become kindred spirits as they are both affected by alcoholism - again her character was quite poorly written, but unlike Whitaker she was, at least, fairly likable.<br/><br/>Another problem with this film is that it's almost impossible to sympathise with the main character; He willingly boarded an aircraft knowing that he'd had no sleep and was pumped full of drugs and alcohol and he knowingly risked the lives of all his passengers - yes I'm aware this is a plot device for the entire film, but it does make it difficult to root for Whitaker (especially when we learn how selfish he is throughout the film).<br/><br/>There are other things that stretch credibility such as Whitaker being able to crash-land a plane and save 96 lives out of 102 whilst he's under the influence of alcohol/drugs and had no sleep the night before, yet 10 other fully trained pilots crashed their planes and ended up killing everyone on board in a simulated recreation of the event whilst they were stone cold sober. That for me was just ridiculous. Whitaker's representative Charlie Greenwood knew that Whitaker was a heavy drinker prior to the plane crash, but yet he still allowed him to fly. Come on!!! Are we supposed to believe that this would happen in the real world? <br/><br/>There are positives to this film and despite all my objections above, this is a very interesting film and I suspect anyone who is a fan of stuff like 'Air Crash Investigation' will more than likely enjoy the film. Washington put in a stellar performance (one of his best in years) and he does his best with a rather poorly written character. John Goodman was excellent in a minor role as Whitaker's friend Harling Mays. I think Goodman is a fantastic actor and has so much energy and does manage to breathe some life into this film whenever he was on screen. The direction and cinematography were also impressive.<br/><br/>Flight is an interesting film rather than a great film. It's main failing is that it doesn't develop Whitaker's character and because we learn next to nothing about him, it made it hard for me to understand his character and ultimately meant that I couldn't make an emotional connection. It's worth watching for the interesting subject matter, but I can't help but wonder what could have been with better writing and better character development."

Instead, you will be greeted with excessive drug abuse and alcohol consumption.<br/><br/>Denzel drinks heavily that night and the next day he goes to work to pilot an aircraft.

He's rudely awoken by mechanical failure and he miraculously (crash) lands the plane in an open field. Some people die. There is an ""investigation"" (don't count on this to make the film any better) and his supervisor and lawyer help him to lie to the legal system to say he wasn't drunk on that fatal day (to which he argues but then agrees). they also try to keep him off drinks. But alas, he does drugs (in front of his supervisor and lawyer.. WTF) and consumes alcohol like a maniac. At the trial, he lies (under oath) about his drinking problem, but after 2 minutes he confesses to his addiction. He is then sent to jail. And the movie is over!!! <br/><br/>How come the authorities don't know they have a drug and alcohol addict on their payroll? A total rip-off. The movie is so slow, it is unbearable.

The film depicts a self absorbed alcoholic pilot who is a cocaine user, and what upset me greatly is that many in the audience seemed to like him as a character. Some of the performances are done well especially the young co pilot and the stewardesses on the flight crew but for one minute did I believe Denzel Washington was a Pilot. Any one consuming that much vodka on an hour flight would be flat on his back passed out.<br/><br/>Am not an expert but when the Co Pilot saw that the Pilot ( Washington) was unfit for flying the co pilot had a responsibility to take over controls. Mr.Washington's nomination for a Best Actor to me is undeserved. John Goodman was ""comic"" as the drug dealer. <br/><br/>Why did thee Director make the Co Pilot who suffered many life enduring injuries and his wife as cartoon characters because they both found solace in Faith?

"Quinoa1984","9","6","11","3 November 2012"," ""HOLD ON!"" with Zemeckis' daring, full-blooded live-action comeback, and Washington in great form
","Man, what a comeback for Robert Zemeckis to live action! This is a hard-hitting drama that, from the look of the trailer, would appear to be just about the 'hero' factor of a man: what is a hero? This is a subject that with the right approach can really be commandeering. In a sense this is like Zemeckis' Taxi Driver, only substituting alcoholism (with some drugs, though the booze is the key) for insanity. Who can make a difference in this world? Can a pilot who goes on drinking benders and sniffing coke with an ex-wife and kid he doesn't see? Instinct, apparently, can kick in at the most odd and desperate times - such as when a plane malfunctions and it goes into a state of chaos. <br/><br/>What we see with Captain Whip Whitaker, who is a risk-taking but courageous pilot, is gray area. This is not a guy we can entirely root for, and this is good. It's further complicated, and this should be the most complimentary sense, with Denzel Washington's casting. With a few exceptions in his career (i.e. Training Day), Denzel plays a guy the audience can root for. And hey, a hero-pilot is someone people love to lionize like Sullenberger ""Sully"" from a few years back. But what if the guy is just messed up, or has some internal demons? The script makes reference possibly to a history of familial alcoholism; when Whip returns to his father's old farm, he, in a fit of attempting-to-get- sober, empties and throws out bottles and bottles and cans and cans of liquor. Was this all his? Zemeckis leaves this part off. Good.<br/><br/>Washington is likable even when he is a lout. This could be a criticism that this drunk isn't a *bad* drunk, per-say. Irresponsible, sure, and aggrandizing. But it gets perspective when he's paired against another addict, who is recovering after OD'ing on heroin. The clean-up for this character was perhaps a little too quick, and there is a scene in a hospital stairwell in the middle of the night as Chip recovers where a cancer patient comes along, dropping some God-philosophy, and never appearing again. But these are faults on a small enough level that they don't really knock into what the main vision is of the film: this man, and his very real struggle: what's going to happen with the lucky but sad fact that six of the 102 passengers died(?) <br/><br/>I really admire Zemeckis working in a gray area morally. There were hints of it in Forrest Gump (Jenny's character as not really what Forrest saw her as, and Lt. Dan's struggle to a 'life'), even Back to the Future (she's your MOM, dude!) But here it's like Zemeckis and his writer say 'screw it, let's go into it full-hog'. And the path of the character is so compelling because we care about him much more, or I did anyway, because of his flaws, of his (non-existent) parenting and his fight against the cover of lies he's surrounded himself in: the booze, the coke, the two (or was it three) mini-bottles of vodka found on the plane, and the ensuing investigation. Even the man most in Whitaker's corner, played by Bruce Greenwood in a straight-laced but well-played exasperated performance, doesn't know what the hell to do with him after a while.<br/><br/>In a sense the film is like the best episode of the TV show 'Intervention' never made: we see this character in full dimensions, and it goes further with the performance by its star. You almost take a guy like Washington for granted when he does studio stuff like (as of late) Book of Eli or Safe House. Whip Whittaker is a character, full of pain but also dark, biting humor, warmth, charity, some madness, and Washington plays it all full tilt, but with a lot of subtlety and notes where we just have to watch him, every second of a scene where Zemeckis stays on him. It's almost more about his face, how he changes from cocky-asshole drunk with a buddy like John Goodman's character (who almost comes in like out of a Hunter S. Thompson book, almost not used enough), and when he is sitting at a meeting with his union rep and lawyer (Don Cheadle, grim-faced as usual), the movie is really about that: what is going to do - hell, like the Avengers, man: what is he PREPARED to do?"

Movie opens with full female nudity, which is fine in moderation; however, it's like Production told the female actress to keep walking past the camera through the hotel room in the opening scene. It's so obvious that was added as they were filming. The woman just walks around aimlessly while Denzel is on the phone. Oh now, ""put on your panties, walk by again and then show your thong"".. ""now bend over for no reason""... ""okay now walk by again""... Overdone. The story is completely predictable, sad and just gets more tragic as it unfolds. The movie does well in showing a struggle with addiction; however, everything is overdone, I almost fell asleep in the middle, and there was no suspense (in my opinion)."
"jadepietro","9","7","14","3 November 2012"," A Fall from Grace
","This film is highly recommended.<br/><br/>The friendly skies aren't all that friendly in Robert Zemeckis' Flight, a well-written melodrama that deals with alcoholism and drug abuse, America's fascination with heroes, and the news media's zeal for the behind-the-scenes investigation.<br/><br/>Flight is a film about a man's fall from grace, both literally and figuratively speaking. The man in question is ""Whip"" Whitaker, an ace aviator, alcoholic, and drug user. After avoiding a fiery crash that saved many lives, in the film's best sequence, Whip is thrust into the public spotlight. It seems much easier controlling his aircraft than his own life choices. Hiding behind his dark aviator glasses cannot hide the fact that Whip was high on alcohol and cocaine when flying that plane. With the media frenzy caused by his heroic aerial maneuvers and the FAA opening up the case, Whip may have successfully navigated his plane to safety, but there's still enough turbulence ahead on his bumpy road to recovery. Upside down may be a perfect phrase to describe Whip's plane, but it also describes his life, one that is still in turmoil as he tries to avoid his personal free fall in this tragic aftermath.<br/><br/>Director Robert Zemeckis returns to the live action format after experimenting in computerized animation with mixed results ( Beowulf, The Polar Express, and his best effort, Disney's A Christmas Carol ). However, his prior knowledge in that area of technology has helped to produce a dazzling set piece involving the near crash that begins this film.<br/><br/>It is the most memorable portion of Flight, a beautifully constructed sequence that shows off his skills by seamlessly incorporating sound and CGI effects, taut editing, specific camera angles, and carefully selective photographic images which create a harrowing white-knuckle moment in cinematic history. ( Special mention must go to his assembled production crew: cinematographer Don Burgess, film editor Jeremiah O' Driscoll, and special effects supervisor Michael Lantieri. Also, Alan Silvestri's subtle and original score serves the film well without over-emphasizing the action on screen except for the inclusion of some pop standards that counteract that effect. )<br/><br/>After this thrilling action-packed scene, the film settles on the emotional and sometimes predictable storyline of the film's main character and his bout with alcohol. The film does not shy away from the seedier side of its anti-hero and his drug dependency. Casting is foremost in this role, especially if the film is to gain the momentum from which it began. Fortunately, Zemeckis has wisely put Denzel Washington in that pilot seat. <br/><br/>Now Washington has always been a fine actor, but lately he has relied too heavily on his leading man status and charisma to carry him through ill-conceived roles. ( Just try sitting through Unstoppable or The Book of Eli as proof. ) His strength as an actor has always been in flawed characterizations and villains ( Training Day, Malcolm X, The Hurricane ). Here the actor gives one of his most powerful performances in years.<br/><br/>The fine supporting cast includes Kelly Reilly, delivering a strong performance as Nicole, a young drug user whom Whip befriends, Tamara Tunie as Margaret, a flight attendant and friend, Bruce Greenwood as his union representative and friend, and a scene-stealing John Goodman as Harland Mays, his hipster supplier. Don Cheadle teams with Washington again, this time as his crafty lawyer. Their sparring as attorney and client gives the audience the privilege of seeing these two talented performers play off each other so skillfully. <br/><br/>John Gatins wrote the literate screenplay and keeps his character-driven situations as realistic and honest as possible, except for a slightly maudlin uplifting ending that might satisfy most moviegoers. ( To me it seemed too preachy and self-righteous, regardless of Washington's acting prowess. ) Still, Flight is an exciting action thriller, skillfully directed by Zemeckis and flawlessly acted by Washington, who creates an intense character study of an alcoholic, a man in crisis unable to stop his downward spiral until he begins to realize that he can't fly away from himself or his real issues.

"ehlert-alex","6","5","9","18 February 2013"," Denzel Washington bails out a painfully slow movie with an incredible performance
","""Nobody could've landed that plane like I did,"" Captain 'Whip' Whitaker (Denzel Washington) proclaims in ""Flight"". The same declaration applies for the performance Washington puts on in Director Robert Zemickis's film. ""Flight"", despite its painfully sluggish pace, captivates audiences thanks to a gripping storyline and a haunting performance from Denzel Washington.<br/><br/>The morning after a sleepless night filled with drugs and a dangerous amount of alcohol, Captain Whitaker shoots some cocaine to straighten up for his short routine flight to Atlanta. When a mechanical failure forces an emergency landing in a field, Whip's flying expertise (and possibly some creativity from a stiff midflight cocktail) glides the plane to a smoother landing than anyone thought possible. After controversial toxicity tests reveal the state the pilot was in during the flight, Captain Whitaker finds himself torn between hiding the truth to remain a hero or facing his problems head on for the first time and losing his newfound fame.<br/><br/>The special effects used in ""Flight"" produce quite the visual spectacle during the plane crash. Views from behind and inside the plane, along with from the ground, are used to communicate the gravity of the situation that the one hundred and two passengers and crew are in. Passengers and luggage are thrown around the cabin as the plane disintegrates in midair, eventually crashing through a church steeple and ""landing"" in a field. The realistic portrayal of such an intense situation brings the audience right inside the cabin with the passengers.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the mesmerizing special effects only carry the movie so far. After the plane crash, there is little action to speak of. The impressive visuals that kick off the movie fade away, and a more psychological mood takes over the movie. Whip's efforts for physical and mental recovery last what seems like ages in the two hours of movie time after the plane crash. The dragged out character analysis of Captain Whitaker left me reaching for the ""eject"" button over and over. However, I was brought right back in every time by Denzel Washington's heart wrenching performance.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington's incredibly believable portrayal of Whip's struggle for sobriety draws audiences in and holds their attention throughout this long movie. Washington conveys that struggle effortlessly and subtly, particularly through his body language and eyes. His performance is complemented by the fact that writer John Gatins tells the story from a third party observer rather than from Whitaker's perspective. Being allowed in to see each event as the other characters in the movie do, audiences truly become emotionally invested in Whip's life.<br/><br/>""Flight"" takes moviegoers on quite a ride as they watch Captain 'Whip' Whitaker struggle with substance abuse, fame, and regret after his heroic emergency plane landing. Though this can seem drawn out at times, hold on and fasten your seatbelts for an ending as jarring as the crash that starts the movie."
"ferguson-6","7","5","9","4 November 2012"," Banana Boat is here
","Greetings again from the darkness. What is a hero? There have certainly been no shortage of super hero movies these past few years, but those are mostly comic book characters brought to life through the magic of Hollywood. Can a heroic act turn a flawed man into a hero? Should his flaws change how we treat him after the heroic act? All these are questions raised by the script from John Gatins. The easiest question of all? If you are a movie producer and you need a flawed hero ... the obvious choice is Denzel Washington.<br/><br/>Director Robert Zemekis returns to live action after more than a decade of experimenting with animation. Of course, Zemekis is firmly entrenched in Hollywood lore thanks to his Back to the Future trilogy, as well as Forrest Gump (for which he won an Oscar). This is quite dark material for Zemekis and he handles it quite well. The trailer tells us what we need to know about the premise. Denzel plays a pilot who, under extreme circumstances, ""inverts"" the commercial jet he is flying so it can be landed in an open field. Yes, invert means to fly the plane upside down. If you are queasy about flying, this is one to avoid. And don't count on this being the in-flight movie on your next business trip.<br/><br/>The first 30 minutes of this movie are as strong as any seen on screen this year. We quickly get a sense of Captain Whip Whitaker and then we see his remarkable actions during an incredibly well filmed crash sequence. Unfortunately, I found the second half of the film plays like a heavy-handed advertisement for AA (not American Airlines). Whitaker is exposed for his absurdly high blood alcohol level and existence of cocaine ... so clearly presented in the film's opening. Over the years, many films have tackled addiction: Leaving Las Vegas, Clean and Sober, When a Man Loves a Woman. Rarely have we seen the expert talent of deception and lying that Capt Whitaker displays.<br/><br/>There is little doubt that Denzel's performance will warrant Oscar consideration ... and it should. The film depends on an actor skilled enough to reach the depths necessary for us to believe this guy, despite his cocky pilot strut and unmatched flying skills, is little more than a mentally weak addict.<br/><br/>There are a couple of outstanding supporting performances here: John Goodman as Harling Mays, a colorful and energetic, free-wheeling dealer who works miracles with Whitaker when he appears to gone to function; and Kelly Reilly (Mary Watson from the Sherlock Holmes movies) as fellow addict Nicole, who connects with Whip and tries to help him. We also get solid work from Don Cheedle, Brian Geraghty, Tamara Tunie, Peter Geraty and Melissa Leo. There is also an odd scene featuring James Badge Dale as a cancer patient/philosopher.<br/><br/>The Alan Silvestri score is effective, as is the soundtrack featuring the somewhat obvious songs from Joe Cocker, The Rolling Stones and Cowboy Junkies. The issues with the script are minor and it is recommended in spite of the Bruce Greenwood factor. Every frequent movie goer has their acting nemesis and Greenwood's presence usually indicates a disappointing movie for me ... not the case here."
"rgkarim","7","5","9","2 November 2012"," Took Flight In A Different Direction
","Denzel Washington, a man of many faces, many talents, and many great roles. From football coach to psychopathic father, the man seems to be able to tackle any role and make it come to life. So I feel that fans other fellow fans of this actor were ecstatic to see his latest movie come out this weekend. The premise of this movie focuses on a pilot by the name of William Whip Whitaker who becomes a hero after saving the lives of countless passengers on a crashing plane. Despite his heroic efforts though, his blood work reveals he was intoxicated, which could lead him to life in prison if convicted of flying under the influence. What will be the outcome? <br/><br/>I'll admit I had my skepticisms about this movie, especially the 2 hour and 15 minute time tag placed on it. In my mind I couldn't see how they could keep this case interesting for that long of a time period. However, the boys directing this movie took a different approach to entertain the audience, than an aviation version of Unstoppable. Instead the film is more a message bringing movie, one that has the potential to inspire or offend in so many ways. Unlike other case drama films, Flight immediately tells you Washington is guilty of intoxicated flying, and has some issues to deal with. Rather than working to uncover the truth of the case, this film works to see if Whip can run from his mistakes, all while continuing to binge on his guilty pleasures. Thus, one can imagine there isn't much excitement or on the seat moments in this film. That doesn't mean there isn't some emotional stimulation in this movie though. Washington once again brings a realistic edge to the character, portraying the sleaze ball Whip to a rather gruesome detail. Countless points in the movie you start to judge and despise his character, as he throws himself further down the rabbit hole. Yet at the same time, the various elements of the movie help you feel sorry for the character and somehow bring you into the mindset of someone trying to overcome his challenges. If you're looking for a film to help place you in someone's mindset, well then Flight is for you. <br/><br/>Washington wasn't the only thing to help bring this tale to life. I'll say now that the casting director should get a pat on the back for who they cast in this film. Although Washington took most of the screen time, each supporting actor had just enough screen time and importance to continue driving the tale in different directions, helping Whip uncover more of his self. Kelly Reillydid a nice job playing a fellow addict who was going through her own problems and being Whip's crush, adding some well-timed drama to the mix. John Goodman'sacting also was well appreciated, as the big man managed to relieve the tension with his well delivered comedic lines. However the man to really help drive Denzel's character was Don Cheadle, playing the lawyer assigned to Whip's case. Cheadle's calm demeanor, and ability to act rational were perfect attributes to make the lawyer come to life. Overall, these actors are blended together in just the right amount to keep the story and laughs coming. <br/><br/>Other than acting though, what else does this movie have to offer? For me it's again worthy to talk about the editing work in both sound and visuals. Flight's camera work wowed me as the crew found ways to capture the emotions of the scene. Whether it was a close up of the artificial red eyes, or a wide angle shot showing off the beautiful scenery of the movie, the camera was situated just right to capture all the details. I was especially impressed with the chaotic flight scene, which for once wasn't overdone in a cacophony of howling wind, explosive sound effects, and a fury of string instruments. The crew instead kept things balanced, calm, and easy to follow, while still managing to make one sit on the edge of their seat as they wonder who will make it out of this dire situation. Along with these visuals was again a well selected soundtrack to help add a little more depth to the scene. Some tracks were used to help add a sad tone to the movie, which had other audience members tearing up, while other songs were merely in the background to I guess be a stereotype to alcohol humor. Regardless, the editing is well done to make a drama like this more realistic and for me enjoyable.<br/><br/>However, with realism comes responsibility and this movie may push the limits for some audience members. Although rather enjoyable and clever, some of the dialog will offend certain audience groups and perhaps take away something from the movie. Those who are easily insulted by religion dialogues, may not enjoy the constantly used line of, ""It was an act of God,"" that seemed to be used as an excuse for every incident to befall man. Those who may be sensitive to alcohol situations may also need to desensitize themselves as well, as the realistic portrayal may strike close to home to again be offensive with their stereotypical visuals. Some of the dialogue, laced with some nice cursing, also may cross the line to make you very angry and distracted. Other than offensive stereotypes though, there are some other weaknesses to this movie. The pace of the movie is also slow and the long time tag on the movie might not have been the best decision to make. Editing could have tightened some things up.<br/><br/>Flight has a good message, great acting, and some fantastic acting, but I can't say it is one of my favorite movies this fall. So those looking for a good drama take up this movie, but for most I say rent in on Netflix for a rainy afternoon. Drama:7.0 Movie Overall:7.0"

","I would compare this movie to compost but I wouldn't want to give compost a bad name. I was very disappointed in Denzel Washington. I have never seen him play in a movie with such bad language and nudity, (which was not necessary to the plot). About half way through we got up and left---just couldn't take any more of the crap. So sad---could have been a very good movie. It is a shame that so many movie makers feel that they must put in such gratuitous nonsense in order to sell tickets. In the future I will be very cautious about going to see any Denzel Washington movie. I have a list of actors that I avoid their movies because of their amorality, and Washington may join the list.<br/><br/>Morris"
"Steve G-2","3","6","12","12 November 2012"," Good acting, preachy and weak on plot, poor on character development
","As expected from the trailers, the flight scenes are thrilling - not believable, but thrilling; but overall the film felt like a commercial for Alcoholics Anonymous. (The familiar formula: ""you have to admit you've hit bottom and then AA can save you."") All the acting is competent but none of it particularly impressive; but maybe that's the fault of the script. Denzel Washington, Don Cheadle, and John Goodman can always be counted on to give what the script demands, but this one didn't demand much, or even allow for much. Once you know that it's a movie about alcoholism and drug addiction, the major plot developments become predictable as movie devices, but at the same time contrived and unrealistic. Many plot elements were not credible: the open association of Washington's character with an obvious and outrageous drug dealer; his co-workers' tolerance of his obvious abuse for years before the film opens; his stability and effective behavior while full of alcohol plus cocaine; the takeoff into a severe storm; Nicole's incredibly quick and painless withdrawal from heroin, etc. Worse, while Washington's, Cheadle's, and Bruce Greenwood's acting was fine in individual scenes, their characters badly lacked continuity; their behavior at any one moment was often inconsistent with their characters as developed up to that point, especially toward the end. The hotel room door left unlatched; the open window; each step of Washington's interaction with the mini-bar - all were unbelievably contrived; and the final drug transaction apparently was deemed necessary for the setup of the final scene, but was totally inconsistent with Cheadle's and Bruce Greenwood's characters up to that scene; I could almost see the actors thinking ""does the script really call for me to do this?"" Oh, and Washington's behavior while full of alcohol plus cocaine seemed designed to convey one message: alcohol bad, heroin bad, cocaine - well, maybe pretty good. It gets you hot babes and is a quick, sure remedy for drunkenness. Despite a good cast and some excitement, I can't really recommend this film to any audience."

","""An airline pilot saves a flight from crashing, but an investigation into the malfunctions reveals something troubling."" I went to a screening of this movie based on this short IMDb synopsis of the movie. Having not viewed any other promotional material for this movie, I went in expecting a movie focusing on the investigation of this airplane crash. What I came to realize is that it is a movie about the investigation of an alcoholic.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington's character Whip Whitaker is portrayed as an exceptional yet alcoholic airline pilot. The movie revolved around Whitaker and his alcohol and drug problems, yet it does not investigate any of the problems that cause the plane crash or the character's hardships. Sure, we are allowed a glimpse into the life of an alcoholic, but the movie does not provide any reason to feel sympathy for the character. We do not know how he got to be that way in the first place. <br/><br/>The movie is predictable in the ways that we would expect of a Hollywood movie about substance-abuse recovery. The story culminates to the character's epiphany that he has a drug problem and that he needs to recover from it to have a fulfilling life. <br/><br/>Overall, it was an entertaining movie, but it my view, it is a rental or a Netflix watch."

","Just horrible. Denzel has always been a ""hit and miss"" kinda guy IMO. I admire his acting ability, but this movie is just absurdly bad. I am not a prude, but gratuitous nudity in a movie never sits well with me. I usually enjoy Zemekis' movies too, but this is a festering turd of a disaster of a disaster flick. Denzel plays Whip, an airline pilot who does every drug on the street and guzzles the juice as well. Before the first five minutes, you lose all ability to sympathize or like the guy. And what's with the F word every other word? AGAIN, I AM NOT A PRUDE, but dialogue is destroyed by the overuse of profanity. This was why I didn't like PULP FICTION either. <br/><br/>The only remotely entertaining and riveting scenes are of course the malfunction of the stabilizer and the ensuing crash scene. After this, the movie descends further into caca and chaos, not sure which direction or genre to adopt...spiritual odyssey??? Comedy??? Mystery??? No...just a damn mess!<br/><br/>If you want something better, skip this atrocity and just watch the episode CUTTING CORNERS/FATAL ERROR of AIR CRASH INVESTIGATION, which I am told FLIGHT was inspired by."
"zensixties","1","4","7","4 January 2014"," Perfect Landing!
","Let's face it; this film has very little to do with being a pilot, flying, a plane crash, etc. It's mostly about a drunk and coke head who befriends a heroin addict.<br/><br/>This film has been done many times before of course, even the drunk pilot concept with Cliff Robertson in ""The Pilot"". The script writer was able to cram enough elements into this film to have something for everyone...that is except for those of us interested in well done original film-making. It's got a plane crash, sex, drugs, rock'n'roll, John Goodman as a coke dealer, a cancer victim, a heroine addict/hooker, a father-son thing, an all-star cast.<br/><br/>But the worst aspect of this aside from its trying to squeeze money out of a weak script by over-blowing it, is the unbelievability of the scenario. This is extremely unlikely to occur in a US commercial flight: a drunk coked-up pilot mixed with a catastrophic failure of the aircraft all at once. My final comment is that the actor playing the copilot's wife gave the the most ridiculous performance I've seen in a long time. <br/><br/>On one level though they came in for a perfect landing. The destination was the twin airports of BBD (big bucks made by dumbing it down) and ILD (injecting a lethal dose of Stupid into film junkies). They had a slight diversion to the city of BSC (big stars act like cartoon characters), but after connecting through the airport of OHC (overhype and crass), came in smoothly and landed on the tarmac of OPA (overpaid actors) and the final destination of OCM (overcharged moviegoers). <br/><br/>I recommend instead 1964's ""Fate is the Hunter"" starring Glenn Ford and Rod Taylor or my favorite flight film: ""Flight of the Phoenix"" (1965) with Jimmy Stewart, Richard Attenborough, and Hardy Kruger."
"evanston_dad","7","4","7","19 March 2013"," Recommended on the Basis of Denzel Washington's Performance Alone
","Based on the trailers for ""Flight,"" I was expecting a investigative procedural film. Denzel Washington plays a pilot who manages to crash land a plane with a minimal loss of lives, a feat everyone agrees no other pilot could probably accomplish. But evidence that he was intoxicated while flying the plane emerges and instead of a hero who saved lives, he becomes a possible felon who caused the crash in the first place.<br/><br/>But the film isn't interested in the investigation. Instead, this is a film about an alcoholic and the rock-bottom journey he goes on that leads him to face his addictive demons. I've never been a huge Washington fan, but he does pretty tremendous work here. This also feels like surprisingly grown-up material for director Robert Zemeckis, who's most known for treacly stuff like ""Forrest Gump."" My major complaint about the film is that it's far too long. An entire subplot that gives Washington a nominal love interest in the form of a fellow addict could have been cut from the film entirely -- and a good half hour with it -- without any significant impact.<br/><br/>I don't know that I would heartily recommend this film for any reason other than the excellent performance of Washington.<br/><br/>Grade: B+"
"The_Film_Cricket","8","4","7","5 November 2012"," Denzel's best performance in years.
","Flight is a movie that opens with a powerful scene aboard a doomed airliner and then calms down into a thoughtful and quietly moving drama about a man coming to grips with addiction and personal responsibility. That may make the film sound boring and preachy, but it is certainly not. Seen through a challenging performance by Denzel Washington – his best in years – this is moving and very spiritual film about a damaged man who works through the fog of his own ego until he comes to see the light.<br/><br/>It also has some questions about the people that we choose to call heroes. We would like our heroes to be saintly, good-hearted and exude quiet cool. Our hero in ""Flight"" is William 'Whip' Whitaker, a seasoned airline pilot who is no angel, in fact he really shouldn't be flying at all. As the movie opens, we see that he has spent several days drinking right up to the morning before he is suppose to pilot a flight to Florida. He drinks heavily and then uses cocaine to get himself out of a hangover.<br/><br/>As Whip boards the plane, the flight crew can see that he isn't fit to fly, but no one questions him. That extends to his wet-behind-the-ears co-pilot (Brian Geraghty). The plane takes off into a nasty storm. Whip takes the plane out of the threatening weather and into the sun-drenched, cloudy patch above the storm. Then something goes wrong and the plane goes into a nosedive. Acting on instinct, Whip – who never loses his cool – inverts the craft in an effort to pull it out of the dive. In contrast to Whip, the rest of the flight crew is panicky and serves to mirror our reactions to these horrific events. Righting the plane, he lands in a small field next to a church. Nearly everyone on board survives.<br/><br/>Whip is deemed a hero in the press. He wakes up in the hospital with a concussion and some minor injuries. He learns that there were a few casualties on the flight – including the flight attendant named Katrina (Nadine Velasquez from ""My Name is Earl"") that he spent the weekend drinking with. Also, there is going to be a full-fledged investigation by the NSTB. This is a problem, especially when a lawyer named Hugh (Don Cheadle) informs him that a toxicology report confirms that he had alcohol and cocaine in his bloodstream. This could send Whip to prison for the rest of his life.<br/><br/>Out of the hospital, Whip goes to his late grandfather's farm to escape the press. There he pours all of his alcohol down the drain. Seeing how many bottles he had lying around, we are stunned to discover the level of his drinking. He is not a casual drinker, but a full-blooded alcoholic. Whip is a man who has cleared out the better, and more secure, parts of his life to make room for his habit. That includes an ex-wife, and a 15 year-old son that he hardly knows. If there are nine levels of personal Hell, then Whip has arrived at about Level 4. He knows that he drinks, and he does so because he likes it. The movie never makes the mistake of making excuses for him. Pouring out the booze was only a temporary fix, he returns to his drinking at the next sunrise.<br/><br/>The drama of ""Flight"" comes from the fact that Whip needs to be clean and sober in order to testify in a federal hearing. That's a problem for his buddy Charlie (Bruce Greenwood) and the lawyer who is trying to help him. There is a very easy way out of this, there was mechanical flaw in the plane, plus Whip's toxicology tests were administered with faulty hospital equipment. But Whip is his own worst enemy. He continues to drink and continues to put himself in a compromising position that could land him in jail. One of the best scenes in the film takes place the night before the hearing as Whip is locked in his hotel room and tries to busy himself. Then temptation offers him a means of escape.<br/><br/>Those descriptions may make ""Flight"" sound like a preachy TV movie, but this screenplay is so much more observant than that. Denzel Washington is a wonderful actor whose best quality is that he isn't afraid to look like a jerk. We like Whip and we want him to straighten his life out, and Washington's performance challenges us to care about a man who doesn't care about himself. All around Whip are people who love him and circumstances that should light his path. The movie is very spiritual in nature. There is a lot of talk about God and his role in our lives, but that knowledge only comes to Whip late in the story at a moment of crises.<br/><br/>If there is a weakness in the film it comes in the way the story resolves itself. It is difficult to describe without giving anything away, but suffice to say that Whip is so self-destructive that it is kind of shocking that the story would allow him such a turnaround. We've seen this man destroying himself so it is hard to believe that he would have such a revelation so quick. Still this is a powerful performance and a powerful story. This is a movie that is about more than a plane crash, about more than an alcoholic. It is one of those films that is about so many things that they only really come to focus when you think back on them."
"gsfsu","2","7","15","16 February 2013"," Total Waste of Film
","The only reason I can think of to watch this piece of crap is because Denzel Washington is your favorite actor and I give him credit for doing a worthwhile job in a film that has very few of those. Otherwise, this film stinks.<br/><br/>Everyone in the film, with the exception of the captain (Denzel) is a stereotype including the normally excellent Don Cheadle. The girlfriend druggie with a heart of gold. The lawyer who uses omissions and technicalities to divert the truth. The co-pilot Bible-banger who has more faith in a god than in his own abilities. The airline owner who has secrets he doesn't want exposed in the prosecution of his pilot.<br/><br/>The irony is that the crash depicted in this film did, in fact, occur - but over the Pacific Ocean and there were no survivors. While it would be nice to think that pilot could have saved his aircraft like Denzel did it wasn't possible and thereby lies the first improbable sub-plot of this movie.<br/><br/>Disregarding the story line and focusing upon the movie itself there are several glaring shortcomings. It moves slow as molasses with the exception of the flight and crash. There is much too much wasted time showing closeups of Denzel in his drunken stupor. There are needless nude scenes which add nothing to the picture. The language is also needlessly vulgar and the audio track blasts the background music multiple times which is guaranteed to stop your heart if you were, like me, dozing off in the many scenes which encourage it.<br/><br/>But the bottom line is missing. Oh sure, there is an ending. But it is neither satisfying nor surprising. It is as boring as the rest of the movie. You will walk away wondering just why anyone felt it necessary to make this movie when there are so many worthwhile stories to tell.<br/><br/>This movie isn't a comedy nor is it an action movie. It could be a drama, if only it had some but alas, no. It is just a waste of time."

","I kept thinking through this movie that it was expressly created to be a path to the Oscars for Denzel Washington, the formula being put an actor in an unattractive role with fat belly, bad attitude and an addiction, and you're on your way. But, ""Flight"" doesn't make it because the plot line is too predictable and shallow, the characters are caricatures, lacking believability and connection with each other, and the screen writing amateurish. Especially exaggerated scenes involve John Goodman's dope dealing character, which is so blatantly parodied, it can't be taken seriously. And there is an embarrassingly poor scene that coincidentally introduces ""Whip Whitaker"", alcoholic pilot extraordinaire to the ferret-like ""Nicole"" re-habbing heroin addict. As the two meet for the first time in the hospital stairwell for a smoke, they are all of a sudden joined by a dying cancer patient who is dragging his drip-line apparatus up the stairs, looking for a ciggie to mooch. He is given a whole pack by Whip, and in return, he makes a muddled speech about dying, how good it feels to be alive, and retreats back down the stairs. Another contrived interplay occurs when Whip, looking for cover, visits his injured for life, young co-pilot in the hospital, and things really get out of hand when the co-pilot's young wife keeps interrupting them with ""Praise Jesus"" utterances, until they all join hands, and the screen mercifully fades to black. And here's a good question...why would Whip's crewmates, who all seemed to know about his history of pre-flight cocaine and alcohol shenanigans, ever want to get in an airplane he's piloting? And are airline execs and union bosses really this corrupt and anxious to get old, drug- addicted pilots off without consequences and back up there? Finally, if you're looking for a real movie about addiction and broken relationships, check out ""Crazy Heart"" with Jeff Bridges in his Oscar-winning role. It has all the heart and soul, and fine performances that ""Flight"" does not."

And unfortunately, you have to be your own hero while picking yourself up from such situations as your will is what determines your future course of action regarding those addictions.<br/><br/>c) As far as acting and script is concerned, there are few very powerful scenes (e.g When Whitaker first meets Nicole in a hospital and an interesting cancer patient comes and speaks few powerful lines about the Act of God).

","From Robert Zemeckis, the director of ""Forrest Gump"" and ""Cast away"", it might have been logical to expect another good movie, although the aforementioned ones are pretty old. Also, the Oscar nominations for best actor (Denzel Washington) and best screenplay must mean something. Unfortunately, after the almost epic 20 minutes in the beginning, the movie seems to nosedive along with the plane.<br/><br/>It all starts with Whip (Washington) waking up in a hotel room next to what I thought was a prostitute. She turns out to be a flight attendant who works (and occasionally has some fun) with Mr. Whitaker, the pilot. Now, I don't mind nudity in movies, but if you pick it for the first scene in the movie, whatever your purpose was, it won't turn out good, or even shocking – it's just going to look cheap and make people label the movie as ""not really good"" straightaway. Even if the naked girl (Nadine Velazquez) is really beautiful. After that, we realize the main character is an alcoholic who takes cocaine for breakfast and gets high on oxygen, he does that in front of people he has never seen before (his co-pilot) and in front of friends, and nobody seems to mind or feels the need to report him. He is also divorced, has a son who lives with the ex wife, and rarely speaks to them both. The perfect antihero. This role is very suitable for Washington but it is far from his best and so this somewhat average performance questions his Oscar nomination. The plot moves on when Whip drugged and drunk but extremely lucid, operates the Flight 227 to Atlanta which, after some turbulences, starts to fall apart, and he is forced to crash land it in a field, managing to save the lives of almost everyone on board. He wakes up in a hospital and is informed that, because of the results of his blood test done after that crash, he could face criminal charges, and is advised to stop drinking, which is not easy.<br/><br/>As I said, this movie starts out greatly, but fails to deliver. After the tense, scary, nervous first part, it's as if another movie begins – a story about an alcoholic who tries to make order in his ruined-by-an-addiction life. It's something we have seen many times, and here is not very impressive, especially because of the constant presence of religious symbols that end up reducing every event and action to God's will. Most of the other characters seem put in there just so Washington doesn't have to act alone, there is no real relationship between him and them, or at least you can't feel it. Apart from that, the story didn't have to be over two hours long – some scenes are either tedious or pointless, and should've been left out. The soundtrack, despite being obvious (Feelin' Alright by Joe Cocker plays whenever Whip takes cocaine), works really well, and the directing is fine. Therefore, I can't sincerely say it's a bad movie, I liked it. It could just have been better.<br/><br/>Rating: 6/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/"
"secondtake","7","3","5","10 March 2013"," A really interesting, well made movie with a terrific Washington
","Flight (2012)<br/><br/>What starts as one thing ends up being another. And that's a great thing. This movie has several stages to it, all tied together by a terrible airplane accident. And tied together by alcoholism, plain and simple.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington takes on the lead role with the kind of intensity Daniel-Day Lewis did for his Lincoln--it's not surprising they were both nominated for best actor. And this is Washington's movie, top to bottom. Yes, there is yet another offbeat and hilarious and commanding smaller role by John Goodman (see ""Argo"" for starters), and a strong if overly restrained lawyerly performance by Don Cheadle. In truth the whole cast is believable in a contemporary, mainstream way (we can skip the woman at the start who unfortunately ends up being purely provocative and decorative, and we can admire the heroin addict played by Kelly Reilly). <br/><br/>The director? Robert Zemeckis, who has been trying for years to carve his own way to some kind of populist stardom, like a more fun Spielberg. And his movies often fall short, I think because of their very populism--they want to be liked be everyone, and you can't quite do that most of the time. (Frank Capra comes to mind, but he's another order of director at his best, which he wasn't always.) Zemeckis is smart and competent, however, and he makes this movie roll right along with a quiet fascination for the process of NTSB investigators and alcohol tests, not the most exciting material.<br/><br/>Don't let me leave out the plane crash--this is no spoiler, I think--which is terrific and harrowing, and with the final smartphone footage from the ground you'll be gasping. (This movie won't be used for in-flight entertainment, that's for sure.) It's exciting stuff.<br/><br/>By the way, when you get to the end and you see what the investigators decide about the plane (not about the pilot), remember to think back to the first moments of the flight, not just the last moments. There are some questions that you might have to answer anew. A movie that bears scrutiny and some reconsidering is good stuff.<br/><br/>Enjoyable. This is kind of routine movie-making, but well done, well done!"
"alsumrall2001","4","3","5","24 February 2013"," Flight is a ""Flight of Fancy""
","Not sure if a spoiler in here but out of an abundace of caution decided to add the warning. I very much disliked this film although Denzel Washington was very good in it. It is a cautionary tale, but it goes way over the top in terms of taking a real issue and turning it into a Flight of Fancy. Nothing in the film is real, everyone is a enabler, everyone things pilots are ""special"", which just isn't so, and drug abusers are nice and clean. The world of Flight is a journey to Oz where the brick road is paved with whiskey bottles and cocaine but the characters are flat. The real nastiness of alcoholism and drug addiction is ignored, the only beautiful women are those who abuse drugs and alcohol and alcohol only produces a hangover that can be cured by more abuse. Religion is recognized in this film but it hovers only in the background like a watchful but uninvolved presence, like the Fairy People of Oz who have no strength, no real character. The film itself has no courage, no heart,no intelligence, not even a Toto (unless you count John Goodman's character), as it stumbles along. It gives no revelation, it stands for nothing."

As that clashes with his own issues and troubles.<br/><br/>We see Whip being such a jerk but also how alcohol can ruin not just him as a person but, his relationship with his friends and family. With the upcoming NTSB hearing pending.<br/><br/>Will Whip lie more in order to save himself and his freedom, or will the truth come out before then? You have to see this movie to really know what a person with an alcohol and drug problem goes through and how it messes them up and how at times, they will lie to do anything and everything to save themselves like Whip.<br/><br/>Whip is his own antagonist, not just protagonist in this movie. John Goodman is funny and always scene stealing as the drug dealing friend of Whip's and Melissa Leo could have had a bigger role. But she is great nonetheless in what she is given as the tough, no-nonsense NTSB head investigator.<br/><br/>Movie will make you think of what alcohol and drugs does to people and to relationships. I have a family member that is an alcoholic even though he won't admit to it. Hope that he will see this movie as what he is doing to his family. It will make alcohol and drug addicts see the harm they are doing to themselves and to others around them!"

","If Oscar's had a category for a best start in a movie, Flight would make the all time short list. And after the first 15-20 minutes, it is all downhill (pun intended), filling no promise it had committed, moving from one story to another, never deciding what it wants to be at the end, but shooting off not quite subtle messages/discourses all along the way. The tempo falls, every next scene becomes predictable, acting becomes extreme to save a bit of the catastrophe, clichés run on top of one another. And in such long, slow moving movie, there are still bits and pieces left untold. Actually you realize in afterthought, what you perhaps hoped a pinch of thriller added into movie was just simple, humor error, without which this movie could not come to an end, which itself was a lame message.<br/><br/>Gosh, this is simply one of the big disappointments of 2012."

"bdgill12","6","5","11","7 November 2012"," Zemeckis is a Bit Rusty
","It's been a while since Robert Zemeckis has been on the set of a life- action film. After 2000's Cast Away, Zemeckis dedicated himself to the art of motion capture animation, a bumpy road that brought about three relatively unsuccessful films (The Polar Express, Beowulf, and A Christmas Carol) and the shuttering of his studio. With that in mind, I think it's only fair to give Zemeckis, the creator of such beloved films as Back to the Future and Forrest Gump, the benefit of the doubt if Flight, his first foray back into the realm of live-action cinema, shows a few signs of rust.<br/><br/>When his commercial aircraft experiences a massive mechanical malfunction, Captain Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington) goes above and beyond to save the lives of his crew and passengers, taking evasive maneuvers that perhaps no other pilot could have managed. He awakens in a hospital room as a hero, having lost only six of 102 souls on board in spite of tremendously long odds and a harrowing crash landing. His story takes a turn, however, when it becomes known that Whitaker has a serious issue with alcohol and drug addiction and was in fact drunk at the time of the crash. As investigators close in on his condition and the heaping pile of lies he's told to cover it up, Whitaker's drinking problems reach a whole new level, alienating his only allies, heroin addict Nicole (Kelly Reilly) and company lawyer Hugh (Don Cheadle), and bringing himself closer and closer to a breaking point.<br/><br/>There are moments of sheer brilliance in Flight that reminded me of just how good Zemeckis can be when he's on his game, especially in the early going. The man is a special effects whiz and whereas someone like Michael Bay uses effects in a, ""Look how shiny!"" sort of way, Zemeckis has always used his visuals to add drama, tension, and/or intensity to his films. (Example: the plane crash and subsequent struggle for shore in Cast Away.) The sequence of events that take place on the plane in Flight, which takes up about the first 20 minutes of the film, are extremely tense and very well put together. It's both exciting and terrifying and in these moments you get to see Captain Whitaker at his very best, perhaps a look at what the man would have been without the backbreaking influence of chemical dependency. Following this opening sequence, however, the brilliant moments come along less frequently and before long I found myself getting bogged down in the narrative, lost somewhere between apathy and outright disdain for the protagonist.<br/><br/>Addiction is not an easy thing to portray in a film. If you go too soft, you end up with an unrealistic story that doesn't resonate. Go too far in the other direction, however, and you're likely to end up with a character that begins to grate on the nerves of the audience. Christian Bale's performance in The Fighter I think stands out as the prime example of how to bridge the gap between the two. That character is completely realistic down to the very last detail and yet he plays it in such a way that you truly do feel sorry for the character even when he is doing horrible things. Whip Whitaker doesn't quite fit that bill for me. Zemeckis takes the narrative of Flight so far and does so much to show him to be a miserable human being that Whitaker becomes a wholly unsympathetic character. I guess the object of all of this would be to drag Whitaker down to his lowest point so that his redemption will seem all the more fulfilling but instead, I reached a point nearing the film's climatic conclusion in which I said to myself, ""This guy sucks and I hope he either dies or goes to jail."" At that point, there's really no coming back; Whitaker could have gone on to find a cure for cancer in the film's final scene and I still would have harbored some dislike for him. <br/><br/>As part of this process of breaking down the lead, Flight asks much of Washington while simultaneously putting him in a hole that he has a tough time digging out of. Like everyone else with a pulse, I love Denzel Washington and consider him to be one of the very best Hollywood has to offer. But whereas Flight requires a great performance in order to make the movie work, Washington's is only a good one that holds some real strength but doesn't measure up against the man's better works. It is unfair to demand an Oscar-caliber performance out of anyone, even someone as accomplished as Washington is, but I think that's the sort of portrayal Flight requires in order to hit its mark and as a result, both parts of that equation come up short. The supporting cast, including Cheadle, Bruce Greenwood, and American Treasure John Goodman, also struggle to excel and at times come off a bit uneven. I found only Reilly and James Badge Dale, in a short but excellent appearance, to be particularly strong performers. This is disappointing as, given the names attached to this film, Zemeckis could have done considerably more with his cast than he did.<br/><br/>Flight represents a good effort from all parties, though perhaps a little too far-reaching for its own good. Its better moments shine quite bright but they are too often blotted out by a hard-driving narrative and an uneven tone that struggles to strike the right chord at the right time. And in the end, I was left with the feeling that Flight could have been much better than it ended up being.<br/><br/>Please check out my reviews at thesoapboxoffice.com"
"ElMaruecan82","9","2","3","16 October 2019"," A Matter of Responsibility...
","""Flight"" is one of these experiences so intense and dramatic that you wish the movie to be over soon while not getting enough of it in the same time, like the immediate effect on some invigorating drug.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington is ""Whip"" Withaker, an experienced and respected pilot but also an alcoholic man who depends on cocaine-boosts to get back on the track. The first contradiction he embodies is how he's in total control of himself and fully confident about his skills while his whole life is a wreck, to say the least. He's divorced, hardly sees his son, doesn't even bother calling, definitely no father of the year material, and he's a party animal enjoying the side pleasures of his professions, including sleepovers in luxurious hotels with the sexiest flight attendant.<br/><br/>When we first see him, he's lying around on a bed, visibly hung-over, while his night playmate gets up, in all frontal nudity and puts on a sexy G-string, there's something sleazy about this man and yet when he pulls on his sunglasses and uniform, we're reminded that it takes a lot to make Denzel Washington 'pathetic', he looks like the man of the job. He might be a prick, but he sure is a pro. And so the film embarks us to its most gripping part and what must be one of the most spectacular crashing sequences ever, the one I feared the most as someone who took the bus the last couple of years, dreading the take-off and turbulences more than anything in the world.<br/><br/>Right now, I'm ready to kill three days of my next holiday to travel by bus just to avoid a few minutes of turbulence. ""Planes are safer than road transportations"" say everybody, well, I give a chance to the road anyway. I'm not mentioning my personal phobia to make myself interesting but to highlight how the crash part operated in my mind and body. I was shaking like the passengers; I could sense the nervousness of the co-pilot each time Whip was acting weird. And like many people who fear flying, I'm drawn into crash stories and I couldn't get my eyes off the screen during the take-off and ""landing"" sequence, one where Whip assembled all his skills to allow the plan to slide on the ground while a few minutes earlier, it was simply nose-diving.<br/><br/>I expected some investigation-thriller whose climax would be in the reveal that Whip's condition didn't cause the crash or maybe a more slowly-driven study in guilt and trauma with Whip trying to make amends for his actions. When we see him throwing all his alcohol and drugs and getting sober in the trashcan, I was kind of disappointed to see that 'persona' leaving, I felt I didn't get enough of the real Whip, but it takes Whip a lot more to change, especially since the investigations' result come off quite early. It's a mechanical malfunction in the gear that didn't get repaired and caused the nosedive and if it wasn't for Whip's instinctive decision to cancel the fall by turning the plane upside down, a move that required three actions from Whip, the co-pilot and the chief flight attendant and a lot of guts and self-control, the plane would have crashed and killed 102 souls. As a matter of fact, ten pilots tried to prevent the same crash on simulator tests, all have failed.<br/><br/>Whip is the hero of the day, saving all but six people, including two flight attendants, one of them he got up with in that fateful day and who, he doesn't know it then, might work as a cover for the investigation on Whip's intoxication during the flight. The irony in Whip's state is that it didn't cause the mechanical problem, and might have given enough resistance to the pressure to bring out the best of him, it either had a positive effect or no effect whatsoever with Whip simply being an ace pilot. But it's not about responsibilities but about principles. The whole film doesn't involve the investigation but Whip's own introspection, just because he's not guilty, and he's not, doesn't make him any less accountable for his actions.<br/><br/>He could dodge criticism while he had a job but after the disaster, he couldn't prevent the convergence of his professional and private life and it's ironic that till the end, he could maintain a cool façade, being hailed as a hero while destroying himself with booze. The second act is a character study of self-questioning and the aspects of our persona we refuse to confront because they undermine our path to success, how far we can go by disdaining the values we should proudly stand for. It doesn't do that with patronizing speeches or heavy sentiment but under the psychological endurance of Whip, who seems full or resentment but resists and vents his anger on his ex-wife, his son and Nicole (Kelly Reilly) drug-addict with enough guts to fight her inner demons and empathy to help her lover... Whip insists that drinking is his choice, he's got nothing to blame himself for and that goes until he's driven to the one extreme that could compromise his self-esteem, when he must answer for one little action during that ill-fated flight.<br/><br/>And when it does happen, we finally see the edifice crash, and not through tear-jerking artifices because Washington is such a charismatic presence he doesn't need that. His character is a rock of man who seems to resist the eroding effect of his own insecurities, until he found out that admitting your weaknesses is the liberating force and the ending couldn't have been more satisfying.<br/><br/>Robert Zemeckis is back at form with this ""Flight"", honorable mention to Don Cheadle as a sleazy lawyer capable to toy with the bureaucratic intricacies to save a client he actually hates, and John Goodman as a fixer that gives a little edge to the film. Not that the film needed any."
"clacura","10","2","3","28 July 2019"," Very Real Character Study of the Human Condition
","This is a movie folks and never tries not to be a movie. It must play like a movie otherwise it becomes a documentary or serves for some social or political cause. Yet within the lines are very realistic character studies of addiction and ego. Denzel portrays the bliss and blister of addiction or better yet the addict personality. Addicts take risks! They can be very smart in an unconventional way. Think about it, to get high is to lose control. It is to go way out from sober. Accept it or not, skills are developed. An addict can face being out of control (plane is crashing) and not lose control because they are familiar with loss of control. Maybe, often, they are drawn to careers that are high risk and walk a fine line. Sometimes they live straight as an arrow and when they are in the sky can feel that ""high"" until they land. Pilots that can balance this are usually very good. Those who cannot cross boundaries like Whip Whitaker did. As for surprise performances, James Badge Dale did more with seven minutes of screen time than a lot of actors do in a career! It is one of the great performances in movie history! He had to lose 20 lbs for the role and worked at it for weeks before the one day shoot. He was instantly believable as a cancer patient. He should have won an award of some kind for this performance. It was a role that should have been forgotten, a filler role yet after the movie I thought about him. That is impact! John Goodman is on par with his performance as the savay drug dealer. It bordered over-the-top, but he got away with it and it was very entertaining. This movie needed some levity and I am sure Zemeckis allowed him to go for it to balance the ride out. This is a great movie to show with addicts and anyone wrestling with an addiction, pause for coffee break and open discussion in small group. It's just a matter of willingness to become vulnerable...the step that is the most difficult!"

However, upon drug test reposts it is realized that he was indeed inebriated and then the judicial system comes into play. This is a good movie and features a harrowing plane crash sequence.

So bad is the situation that his wife has left him and his sons do not have an iota of respect for him. Also, he drinks on the plane- a plane he is piloting! The crash sequence is quite jarring and anyone knowing the work of Robert Zemeckis would know he is a master in creating realistic looking CGI sequences. This is a great scene but what follows is equally fascinating. The pilot is brought to the court in charge of manslaughter(he manages to save most but not everybody on board). Washington is great as the central character. Go watch flight to see a nuanced character study of a flawed individual."
"Gideon24","7","2","3","16 December 2015"," Outstanding direction and a solid lead performance make this one work.
","Despite a preachy screenplay delivered with sledgehammer-like intensity on a well-worn cinematic subject, 2012's Flight is a riveting and emotionally manipulative drama that effectively showcases the horrors of addiction on a surprising canvas and delivers the goods, thanks to polished direction and a powerhouse lead performance as a very unlikable character.<br/><br/>This uncompromising drama stars Denzel Washington as Whip Whitaker (terrible character name), a veteran airline pilot who we meet the morning after an evening of sex, booze, and cocaine with a flight attendant who is glanced snorting a huge line of cocaine and then seen boarding a plane that he is actually scheduled to fly. After navigating the plane through some brief initial turbulence, Whitaker actually has another drink while assuring the 102 passengers aboard that everything is going to be all right. Whitaker then returns to the cockpit and the plane malfunctions and is forced to glide to an emergency crash landing. Thanks to Whitaker's expertise and experience as a pilot, the crash only produces six fatalities, four passengers and two flight attendants and Whitaker is initially proclaimed a hero until the toxicology report reveals that he was under the influence of alcohol and cocaine while flying, which could result in four charges of manslaughter and the rest of his life in prison.<br/><br/>This film angers almost immediately because it seems like we are supposed to sympathize with Whitaker, but I found that impossible. What is made clear here is the denial, rationalization, and justification that goes through the mind of an alcoholic, but there is no excusing it here because Whitaker's actions resulted in the loss of life. It is further exacerbated by the fact that Whitaker knows he is wrong and and actually tries to cover up what he did. We watch in horror and disgust as Whitaker is released from the hospital, escapes to his family hideaway and spends hours throwing away all of the liquor that he has hidden in the house, a lengthy and effective scene filmed with a hand-held camera that shows the lengths an alcoholic will go to cover up what he's doing. We then watch Whitaker try to save his own ass when he realizes it is on the line by looking for crew members, including the co-pilot who may never walk again because of the crash, to have his back when they are asked to testify against him. Any sympathy the character might have evoked disappears during the scene where he asks the head flight attendant (Tamara Tunie) to lie for him.<br/><br/>Director Robert Zemeckis has mounted a familiar story on a unique canvas that will make the viewer give pause for a myriad of reasons...watching Whitaker's story is properly disturbing as it makes us think twice, not only about drinking and drugging, but about ever boarding a plane again without seeing the pilot's toxicology report that an airline's attorney (Don Cheadle) actually tries to bury in an attempt to save Whitaker's undeserving ass, but even those actions turn out to be pointless and Whitaker eventually must suffer the consequences of his actions, which seems to be the underlying theme of this story, but the really disturbing aspect here is how long it takes for these consequences to surface and the deep denial of Whitaker's addiction.<br/><br/>Zemeckis directs with a master hand again...the plane crash he presents here is as harrowing as the one he mounted in Cast Away. The shots of the plane completely inverted are dizzying and frightening. Washington completely invests in a completely unsympathetic character and delivers a performance of such power it merited him an Oscar nomination. Cheadle is solid as the attorney as are Bruce Greenwood and John Goodman as professional and personal allies of Whitaker and mention should also be made of Kelly Reilly as Nicole, a pathetic heroine junkie who becomes Whitaker's enabler up to a point. Yes, the message here is delivered with a sledgehammer but it works and the climax doesn't quite ring true considering what we have witnessed prior, but the denouement is somewhat satisfying as we do see Whitaker pay for his actions, though his alleged redemption implied near the ending is a bit much. Still a riveting film experience thanks to a harrowing story and one of our greatest actors delivering the goods."
"mattgammon-97-695445","Null","2","3","11 February 2015"," Flight review
","With Flight, director Robert Zemeckis has made a solid, unshowy character drama, the kind of film cinema-goers of a certain age will tell you the studios don't really make any more. It reminds me a little of an Eastwood movie - specifically, with Eastwood in his capacity as a film director, that is. It's a sober piece about a man's moral choices, built around a creditable central performance from Denzel Washington as Whip Whitaker – an alcoholic pilot who, still drunk and high from the night before, manages to land his airplane after a mechanical failure sends it into a 4,800 ft dive. The crash itself is amazing; a 10- minute nose dive, with Zemeckis barely moving his camera out of the cockpit. Whitaker emerges a hero – ""you're a rock star"" – before he is called to account. ""Death demands responsibility,"" Don Cheadle's lawyer explains. ""Six people died. Someone is to blame."" Flight is essentially a study an intelligent man living in denial. The film revolves entirely around Washington: sweaty, puffy, slow- eyed when down, very much The Man when the booze and the coke kick in. Zemeckis – who hasn't directed a live action film since 2000's Cast Away – shoots the film as straight as possible. But that's not to say it's without wit. There are artfully handled moral ambiguities here: could Whitaker have saved that plane if he hadn't been blasted on vodka and cocaine?<br/><br/>This movie was a blast to work on. I was a stunt double and had a great time on set. I love the final product."
"MattyGibbs","8","2","3","16 September 2014"," Good study of addiction
","Rather than the straightforward action film I was expecting, Flight is really a character study of one mans addiction. <br/><br/>The crash scene is very well done but this is really a small part of the film. The remainder of the film is taken up with the crash investigation as the case against the pilot grows.<br/><br/>The film is carried by Denzil Washington who plays a refreshingly flawed anti-hero. Your sympathies for the character swing wildly throughout the film which is something you don't normally get in glossy movies. It is always absorbing as the case builds towards the conclusion of the investigation. I know some people did not like the ending however I found it to be very satisfying. <br/><br/>The only real negative for me was a strange and wildly over the top cameo from John Goodman which I found out of place with the rest of the film. <br/><br/>Flight is an intriguing film with a superb lead performance from Washington and well worth watching."
"RJBurke1942","6","2","3","15 September 2014"," Where we learn that success in life sometimes requires a near-death experience.
","This story is, essentially, a one-man show, about a crack commercial pilot who is also an alcoholic and cocaine addict, maybe even a crack-head. In taking on the role of Whip, Denzel Washington delivers a cracking good performance about a character that you eventually almost love to hate. But, not quite....<br/><br/>In a nut shell, the plot begins with Whip's hangover as he prepares for his next flight. To cope, he snorts some coke before he leaves the hotel, and after manhandling his passenger plane on takeoff like a P51 Mustang, he hands the controls over to the young copilot while he covertly mixes a double screw-driver in the galley and as his crew is calming passengers after the turbulent takeoff.<br/><br/>Then: disaster. Something breaks in the rear elevator mechanism, the plane goes into a dive, Whip whips back to his seat, grabs the controls which he uses manually (overrides the computer systems) to perform a miraculous maneuver to prevent the plane from drilling for oil - and instead glides it to a belly-flop in a lush green field where the plane breaks up and everything goes black for our hero....<br/><br/>That sequence is the best part of the movie - the first twenty minutes: great CGI, excellent editing, fast paced, exciting, even thrilling and entertaining BS. And, it's worth seeing. Arguably, the rest ain't.<br/><br/>You recall Denzel in Training Day? Sure, he was a bad guy, but he was so cool, soooo likable, right? Well, Whip's a totally untrustworthy, no-good, dirty, rotten, drunk liar. In his personal flight from reality, he knows it, he denies it to all and sundry, and you can see he's heading for his own hell. Unless something happens to change his ways. Well, your mission, should you want to proceed, it to watch the movie and find what that something is.<br/><br/>And, if you do, then think about this also: why on earth was this story ever made into movie? I'll tell you what I think. Instead of some production company making a documentary about all the real-life stories we hear/read about pilots with certain problems who still fly daily, let's put it all to fiction to avoid any possible law suits from a dozen real airlines. But ... but we still get the message across, see: hey, you pilots, listen up - toe the line or, no matter how good you are as a pilot, you are expendable, you are a criminal, and you are going down even if you do save every sorry passenger's life!<br/><br/>Hey, now ... it's not often we see an important, pertinent, societal message masquerading as passably good entertainment.<br/><br/>There's a good supporting cast with familiar faces. The direction and editing are top-notch. The music's too loud. There's a lot of cussing, and a lot of alcohol and coke, both of which will turn off some viewers. Still, I give it six out of ten and a qualified recommendation, mainly because I like Denzel's (and John Goodman's) acting and his courage for taking on such a lousy, stinking role.

","""Flight"" stars Denzel Washington as Whit Whitaker, a hotshot commercial pilot. During one flight, Whitaker wrestles his plane to the ground after severe mechanical failure. Though Whitaker is commended for his gutsy landing, news that he was intoxicated during the incident lands him in hot water; he's convicted of manslaughter.<br/><br/>Unsurprisingly for a film directed by Robert Zemeckis, a protégée of Stephen Spielberg, ""Flight's"" action sequences are thrilling. But like Spielberg, Zemeckis is also incapable of directing swearing, nudity, sex or even human beings. Most of ""Flight"" is thus cringe-worthy, Zemeckis trying desperately to reinvent himself as an ""edgy"", ""gritty"", R-rated film-maker after a string of PG13 flicks and children's animations. The result is a film which is one part popcorn thriller, one part indie movie and one part message movie.<br/><br/>""Flight's"" final act, in which Whitaker admits he's an alcoholic, sees Whitaker journeying from train wreck to redemption. The film itself is awash with Christian symbolism (Zemeckis is Catholic) and continues the cliché of alcoholics and/or depressives hooking up with beautifully dysfunctional women (Kelly Reilly).<br/><br/>As he's borne of the Spielberg school of directing, Zemeckis plays each note with a sledgehammer. Whitaker drinks entire kegs of alcohol, raids entire hotel rooms for booze, the film's soundtrack is distractingly literal and Zemeckis' forays into R rated territory (swearing, drug use, nudity, porn sets etc) are resolutely awkward; like watching your grandparents having sex whilst your mom tells you about her first boyfriend. Zemeckis is not only a kid trying to grow up, but, like Whitaker, one who is trying to convince us that he already has.<br/><br/>Stylistically, ""Flight"" resembles Zemeckis' ""Castaway"", with its spectacular plane crashes and solitary men. Thematically it resembles Zemeckis' ""Contact"", in which a tightly wound atheist wrestled with questions of faith, spirituality and control. Whitaker undergoes the same narrative arc, relinquishing illusions of personal choice, personal judgement and bowing down instead to real conditions. ""I have control,"" Whitaker utters, both in the cockpit and out, but he doesn't. The film's plane crash encapsulates his nosedive into realisation. ""God help me,"" he then utters, before letting others (and Jesus?) take the reigns.<br/><br/>""Flight"" stars John Goodman as a flashy drug dealer. He looks like he stepped out of a Tarantino movie, his character odd in what otherwise seems like an anti-narcotics flick. ""Flight's"" best scene? Whitaker flipping a plane over and flying it upside down like a casual blaxploitation hero. While every white boy on-board is wetting his pants, Whitaker looks like he's grooving to Miles Davis. The film's been accused of racism - the first major black pilot in cinema being a drunk criminal? - but outside of Spike Lee's flicks, Washington's always been white.<br/><br/>6/10 – Worth one viewing."

First there is a shaky take off, then the plane clears it and it's clear skies, then it goes out of control. Exciting.<br/><br/>Afterwards is the second part of the film, the more serious part, which is following an alcoholic. It turns out the pilot, Whip, is an alcoholic and was drunk on the plane but mechanical failure is what caused the crash. But that don't mean he can't get in trouble too. The ending was unbelievable because I don't think a life time liar would just tell the truth like that.<br/><br/>Also, John Goodman has a cameo as Whip's supplier of anything.

"Mr_Sensitive","7","2","3","16 June 2013"," Trust no trailer, this is a good serious drama on alcoholism
","There are so many reasons why I wanted to watch this movie – first it is directed by R. Zemeckis, second it is starring Denzel Washington and third the trailer look pretty cool. And as usual R. Zemeckis's live action film never a disappointment though it might not be for everyone since the trailer is misleading and you end up expecting something else.<br/><br/>Flight is about an alcoholic pilot who saves hundreds of live when his plane went malfunctioned. Though dubbed as ""hero"" he is being after by the National Transportation Safety Board as they suspected him of his intoxication that led to plane clash.<br/><br/>This is a drama of a man abused by alcoholism and how it affected his life. Not a thriller of CIA chasing around people trying cover-up plane clash. The story itself is pretty much slow but very well written (though a bit overlong). <br/><br/>But it was actually Denzel performance that truly brings out the best of this movie and so is the rest of the cast. It is good to see a good old fashion movie rely on great acting, good script and great direction. It is really that good.<br/><br/>Overall it was a good movie, very well done. But sadly it is not really the kind of movie you going to re-watch it again and again. A good film that you hardly watch it again like Sleeper / Seven years in Tibet/ Gandhi/ Master and Commander/ The way back etc. (I hope you understand what I meant)<br/><br/>Recommendation: Worth a try<br/><br/>Rating: 7/10"

But people need to get their drugs somewhere. And how lovely was Nadine Velazquez? Wow! But come on, the addiction thing has been done to death.

"Charlottedry","Null","2","3","2 June 2013"," Awful
","This is an awful film. Why couldn't a good lawyer have suggested that the two vodka bottles were opened prior to the suspension of the bar service? They were ordered by a customer. Then the bar service was suspended and the bottles and contents discarded. It could then have been argued that the .17 blood alcohol level of the dead stewardess was therefore unexplained. Perhaps she had a drink in the airport bar? This would have saved her relatives embarrassment and prevented the need for another lie from the central character. This is only one of many flaws in this film. Since when does cocaine not make someone's nose run? Could anyone put in a formal appearance in that state? Why was the hotel room door not secured? Couldn't they have paid someone to sit with him through the night, after spending tens of thousands on the legal work? Or given him a sleeping pill and got him to the hearing in a reasonable state? <br/><br/>Because the film had so many flaws - including the fact that aircraft being flown inverted is at the remotest edge of possibility - I found it unwatchable. . To play around with and sentimentalise alcohol abuse and forget that all legal successes involve some degree of lying, unknown factors and 'no comment' is to portray the central character is very different from the everyday person when he is in truth behaving rationally. A reasonable outcome which was satisfactory to everyone could have been achieved by the lawyer."

","Enter destination. Purchase tickets. ""No outside food or drink"". Second door on your right. Take seat. Await the journey that lies ahead. Once the ambiance is set and the morale of the cinema-goers is lifted at the conclusion of thirty minutes of abundant previews, Flight commences in a dramatic, surprising and frankly rather entertaining fashion. For the most part, the first half hour of the Robert Zemeckis film is everything you wanted and expected following your presumed consumption of the trailer beforehand. Unfortunately however, it becomes evident throughout the 138 minute feature that we are victims to a cinematic bait-and- switch, by which I mean our expectations become decreasingly fulfilled and the film's title only supplements the key theme of substance addiction, that is ever-present in the character Whip Whitaker's life.<br/><br/>The first 30 minutes of Flight are cared for with a great deal of delicacy. We encounter THE scene of the film; the title scene, the scene that most likely sparked 90% of the viewers' interest to actually go to see the film in the first place. How does this sequence levitate against our expectations? Above and beyond without question. The entire scene engulfs the theatre seat occupiers as much as it does those in the plane seats. You feel you are them. Almost all camera shots are interior, enforcing the claustrophobia, panic, and gasps in the environment, all of which are difficult to differentiate between the characters in the film and the cinema-goers surrounding you. Other incredible gripping scenes later in the film focus entirely on drama and realism. Protagonist Whip's battle with alcoholism is treated as the primary focus of the feature, and if not for the strong performances, the film would have fallen apart from the opening credits, like the runner who forgot to stretch or the student who was too lazy to take notes. Something that may be taken for granted is in fact the key component which helps bring Flight home safely and satisfactorily. Denzel Washington's role as an intoxicated and irresponsible pilot makes the film alone worth seeing. Every time he makes a morally questionable decision, we the audience react in a manner that parallels the game show enthusiast's desire for gratification. You almost want to scream and the screen each time Whip makes a decision you are not fond of, though still wish to see where it takes the film. You never want him to succeed in the sense that he desires, but more achieve success through facing his responsibilities. He is a broken character, a tragic hero, perhaps relatable to some, but certainly intriguing to all.<br/><br/>Regrettably, from takeoff Flight suffers from instances of turbulence and an unwanted delay. Kelly Reilly injects a fine performance as Nicole, who eventually meets Whip and their mutual difficulties with substance abuse elicit a romance that should have never boarded the Flight. Her existence in the film is irrelevant and increases running time also, though there is never a dull moment in the 138 minute picture, therefore the integration of this romance will probably please some, though I most definitely declare my slight annoyance at its unnecessary presence. <br/><br/>Zemeckis rectifies the troubling turbulence by securely landing into a graceful and exceedingly fulfilling conclusion. He essentially does what Denzel Washington's character does, by taking control over his line of work and doing a great job of it, until some slight mishaps that needed correcting, otherwise they both would have headed for disaster. The director saves his film with a remarkably powerful conclusion that really could not have given you anymore that it provided. Hopefully Zemeckis was not under the influence of any illegal or physically altering substance during principal photography, though if he was, he sure did a fantastic job of completing a very fine project."
"TxMike","Null","2","3","14 February 2013"," Examines the inner battle of an airline pilot and his alcohol and drug dependency.
","I suppose the first question many of us might have after seeing this movie, ""I wonder if one of my flights ever had a drunken Captain in charge?""<br/><br/>We have known for a long time that Denzel Washington is one of our finer actors, but many of his roles don't really require him to stretch very much. This one does, and it is no surprise that he has been nominated for ""Best Actor"" in this role.<br/><br/>He is Whip Whitaker , former military pilot and now for some years a very good and very well-respected airline pilot. On this day he is flying from Florida to Atlanta, a fairly short flight leaving at 9AM, he didn't really sleep the night before, having his own personal booze and sex party with one of the flight attendants. He nearly oversleeps but gives himself a ""kick"" by doing two lines of cocaine.<br/><br/>Now that's not a very good vision of how airline pilots prepare for work, but we DO hear periodically that a drunken pilot is removed from the cockpit, fortunately right before the flight leaves.<br/><br/>But Whip is an artist at the controls, he pulls a non-approved maneuver right after takeoff to fly through a seam in the severe weather, then hands the controls to his young co-pilot, one he has never flown with before, and takes a nap. Only to be abruptly awakened when a loud thump is heard and they lose the ability to control the plane.<br/><br/>As has been widely publicized via trailers for the film, the only way Whip could hope to salvage the plane was to invert it, so the ""dive"" would turn into a ""climb"" and achieve ""level"" via throttle control. The crash landing in a pasture outside Atlanta only resulted in 6 deaths among the 102 on board. Whip was a hero.<br/><br/>All this transpires during the first few minutes of the movie, which runs just over 2 hours. The flight and crash-land are only there to set up the real story, whether Whip can ever admit he has a problem with alcohol and drugs, and whether he can ever pull himself out of it. There was no question about the cause, the investigation pointed to improper maintenance, failure to replace a control-surface screw in a timely manner, and its failure in flight caused the problem. Nine other pilots were asked to try to pull the same airplane rescue in simulators, none of them could. Whip really was a hero, had any other pilot been in charge all 102 likely would have died.<br/><br/>But there was still that matter of alcohol and drugs found in a sample of Whip's blood, and the several empty small bottles of vodka that were unexplained.<br/><br/>The movie, by Zemeckis (Back to the Future, Romancing the Stone, Cast Away, and many others) is very well structured and acting is top-notch. A very worthwhile film about drug and alcohol demons and how difficult they are to slay.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: With the help of a good lawyer and some testing irregularities, Whip appeared ready to escape legal consequences. All the had to do is testify that he suspected his flight attendant girlfriend, who died in the crash, has consumed the alcohol. He would be free. But his conscience finally kicked in, he was tired of lying his way through life, told the truth, and as the movie ends he is in prison running an AA group, and in a visit seems perhaps on the way to a better relationship with his teenage son."

When defective machinery causes the malfunctioning plane to go into a tailspin, Whip heroically and miraculously averts a catastrophe saving almost the all passengers and crew. Nonetheless this event causes inevitable blow-back, when it becomes apparent that Whip was flying under influence, thus complicating the entire issue, when all persons potentially responsible attempt to avoid responsibility...<br/><br/>""Flight"" is a movie to be watched for two reasons. The one is the spectacular opening crash ordeal, which is arguably the best action sequence of the year, an enticing, dreadfully thrilling occurrence, bound to have everyone on the edge of the seat. This is further underlined by the standout performance by Denzel Washington, a pilot drunkard with skewed perceptions of responsibility and self-control. Nonetheless the plot attempting to hold the proceedings together falls apart all too easily, tacked together with a spit of contrition and lack of conceptual cohesiveness.<br/><br/>Nonetheless ""Flight"" remains a hard-hitting drama and engulfing character study of a flawed hero, a coke sniffing drunkard, but with the sense and skill to become a man of the hour. Does the drinking somehow undermine her moment of heroism? Even if it does, how far can it whitewash his drinking issues? Masterfully cast down into a conflicted grey area by Denzel Washington (every movement and tick conveys emotion, showing just why he is one of today's top actors), the story manages to show how contradictory a person can be, when the public hero has inner demons which he is unable to cast away. Nonetheless the ending seems to suggest that while saving the plane was pure instinct and skill (courage under fire), true courage comes from owning up to your faults, taking responsibility for all that transpired, both the good and the bad. The path to this isn't easy, as he has to dispose of the cover of lies, which has clouded his own reason, just like in any alcoholic who must first accept that - despite his claims - he doesn't control his addiction. The layered and well presented acceptance of guilt (even if somewhat overly long presentation) often times fails to mesh smoothly with the plot of the ongoing investigation, at times bringing in characters and situations seemingly imported from other movies (such as the stylistically incompatible appearance of John Goodman), thus creating a conflicting tension, which does however nicely bring about comeuppance (even if a bit garrulous). With the power of the story strongly imbued on Washington's face, but with lacking conviction surrounding this astounding performance the overall payoff fails to be as hard-hitting as it should be."

","FLIGHT is a film that attracts devotees of Denzel Washington - and for good reason because he gives a convincing performance as a conflicted alcoholic cocaine addict who despite the fact that he wastes most of his life and relationships with his substance abuse, he still is one of the finest pilots in the air. And if that is the reason for watching his overly long attenuated movie then the rewards will be there.<br/><br/>The story as written by John Gatins and directed by Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump, Back to the Future etc) begins correctly enough with a wasted Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington) still drunk and drug addled with his flight attendant girlfriend Trina (Nadine Velazquez) interrupted by a telephone call form Whips ex-wife requesting tuition, money for their son. The two snort cocaine to get going from their hangovers and they are off to a flight to Atlanta. Once aboard Whip's instability is noted by his anxious new co-pilot Ken (Brian Geraghty) but despite poor weather the flight takes off only to crash a bit later: Whip manages to pull it together enough to bring the airplane down in a field losing only six people in the crash (one being Trina). The rest of the film is an endless diatribe of Whip recovering, getting control of his substance abuse only to repeatedly lose if again, meeting a pretty junkie Nicole (Kelly Reilly in a stand out role) who becomes his lover, meeting a terminal cancer patient Tiki (Charlie E. Schmidt), being counseled by his best friend Charlie (Bruce Greenwood) who brings in a lawyer Hugh (Don Cheadle) to attempt to cover-up the fact that the investigation of the crash has shown that Whip was impaired by his excesses. A 'resource' Harling Mays (John Goodman) keeps Whip supplied with drugs up to the last moment and it is only at the hearing (finally) that Whip confesses to investigator Ellen (Melissa Leo) that he was indeed drunk during the flight and in turn pays for the guilt with which he has been struggling in his semi- sober moments.<br/><br/>The cinematography during the airplane crash is excellent and the supporting cast is very strong, but despite Washington's performance the movie misses on so many levels due to incomplete working through of sidebar plot lines. The salvation for the film is in the last five minutes of fine acting by Washington, but by that time the audience is very tired of the manner in which a gifted pilot has wasted his (and everyone else's around him) life that clock watching takes over. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"
"doug_park2001","7","2","3","6 February 2013"," Despite Some Unlikehoods and Ambiguities, FLIGHT Is Far from Being a Disaster (ha-ha)
","Washington is at top-form in the role of an anti-hero: alcoholic, cokehead, ladies' man airline pilot Whip Whitaker. The other fine actors--too many to mention here, but Kelly Reilly's performance is especially noteworthy--also contribute a great deal to FLIGHT. The air altercation is harrowingly realistic, one of the many ways this film puts you right there.<br/><br/>On the other hand, FLIGHT tries to compensate for its grittiness (including a gratuitous scene of female nudity at the very beginning) by becoming a sort of 12-step morality play in the middle and latter portions. Alternatively, all the sex, dope, and vulgarity, it seems, are intended to keep the film from being too heavy-handedly moralistic, an odd combination that doesn't entirely work. While FLIGHT is not of an outwardly religious nature, there's much mention of God, which--though as a believer, I like it--hints at some agenda on the part of the film's own creators.<br/><br/>FLIGHT becomes repetitively melodramatic toward the middle portions. More on the FTSB's investigations/legal entanglements and less on the turpitude of Whitaker's life would have made this an altogether more interesting film; a more distant point of view focusing less on Whitaker personally and more on the whole big picture would also have been a probable plus. Some choice editing probably could have cut 20-30 unnecessary minutes. There are also a number of ""too easys,"" e.g., some of the stuff the pilots' union attorney is able to accomplish with a seeming flick of his hand. Finally, several characters don't contribute all that much to the plot--FLIGHT's a bit too crowded. (I just mentioned Reilly's fine performance, but I'm not sure the character she plays is even that necessary.) <br/><br/>Still, for all my criticisms, I can't give FLIGHT anything less than 7 stars. The good aspects of this film (polished acting and cinematography, a number of small but well-earned surprises, its entire generally compelling nature) are good indeed, and those with a little patience should enjoy it."

For the first half-hour or so, ""Flight"" keeps us rapt with thrilling action and a troubling moral quandary. You strap yourself in for the next two hours and prepare to give yourself over to the in-flight entertainment. But after ""Flight"" descends from its high-wire act, the film reshapes itself into a fairly standard story about substance abuse, and the life-long endeavor of maintaining sobriety. Not incredibly entertaining or consistently compelling, but Denzel's Oscar worthy performance alone makes this worth the watch. Denzel does a perfect job giving us just enough to empathize for him but never enough of a reason to condone him either. To Robert Zemeckis credit, he directs a well-crafted film, loosely based on actual events. An interesting character study of a flawed hero we sympathize with throughout despite reoccurring disappointments.

"pfgpowell-1","6","2","3","3 February 2013"," Good in parts but not what it could well have been. But Washington is excellent
","Flight is an odd film, which takes you along for the ride, but which soon has you asking pertinent questions almost as soon as the credits roll.<br/><br/>That notwithstanding, what is outstanding about Flight is Denzel Washington in the main role as an alcoholic, coke-snorting pilot in denial who might well have saved the almost 200 lives through his flying skill but who faces several years in jail when a toxicology report shows up the booze and coke in his blood while flying. But Washington aside – though it has to be said that the performances are of the highest order – there seems in retrospect very little 'plot' or 'story' to Flight. In a nutshell it is that 'brave alcoholic pilot finals admits to himself that he is an addict'.<br/><br/>So did we need nigh on two hours of this and that to get to that point. Well, no we did not. And that is to say, apart from the obvious reason of making money for the studio, there seems very little reason to make Flight. Outstanding is the crashing of an airliner which, more or less, opens the film. And if you saw the trailer, which, I understand, makes great use of those crash scenes, the film will undoubtedly come as an anti-climax. What is not so good is the putative nascent relationship with a recovering heroin addict – and boy do Hollywood junkies still look good and if they are women, pretty. I didn't buy it, although what with Washingon being black and the lass who falls for him white, Flight should at least be praised from being – in 2013! – one of only a handful of films which show that love is colour blind. Usually, the black hero has to have a black woman.<br/><br/>Another weak point, another exceptionally weak point is including John Goodman as an in-your-face, larger than life dealer who supplies Washington with his uppers, downers and everything in between. As played by Goodman – that is Goodman playing the one role he seems these days solely hired to play – the dealer character seems like an intruder from a different film. And don't even start to ask why an airline pilot who has a lot to lose should his addictions become public should ever consider throwing in his lot with a loudmouth dealer as portrayed by Goodman. In fact, the Goodman character strikes me as a production decision, an element to jazz it all up a little. But it doesn't, it just diminishes the film. And the final scene in which Washington is apparently reconciled with his son is simply hamfisted and probably tacked on to elecit a tear or two from the daytime TV generation who like a little ersatz emotion.<br/><br/>How many stars to give Flight? Well, five would be unkind, because in many ways, not least the spectacular crash and Washington's performance, it is better than average. But if I give it six, be warned that it could have been a lot, lot better had someone somewhere had a little more courage and made the film which should have been made."

What if the pilot had been sober, would the tragedy have been worse? And, conversely, was it the alcohol/cocaine cocktail in his blood enabling him to risk 100 people? To sum up, a different kind of movie from director Robert Zemeckis."
"Ryan_MYeah","7","2","3","11 January 2013"," Lifted almost singlehandedly by Denzel Washington's strong performance.
","Robert Zemeckis has got to have one of the oddest careers in Hollywood. Known for his much respected live action films like Forrest Gump and Who Framed Roger Rabbit, he's spent the last twelve years specializing in films entirely made through motion capture. He makes his return to live action with Flight, a movie that centers on an airplane pilot under investigation after a drastic plane accident, where he saved the lives of 96 people on board, but was discovered to have alcohol in his system at the time of the flight. This guy's got to be the best drunk driver ever...<br/><br/>Flight is the kind of movie that doesn't get to be made often, and Zemeckis intends to treat it in the best way he can. This is certainly his most stylistically restrained film yet, as he wants to place more focus on the writing. Screenwriter John Gatins was inspired to write this film due to his own history of addiction, and he confronts these issues head on. He also takes time to examine the balance between what happens as a result of the hands of God, and what happens as a result of man's hand, but not always very well. The narrative and pacing still have their uneven tendencies...<br/><br/>...but when you get down to it, this is an actor's showcase. The main role is perfect for Denzel Washington, who has unfortunately spent the last few years in sub-par action films. Here, he's allowed to release his full talents. His character can be sympathized with just as much as he can be detested. Washington never overplays or underplays one or the other. Both elements work hand in hand to excellent effect. Credit should also go to co-star Kelly Reilly, wonderful in a sympathetic role that works well with Washington's more unpredictable nature, and that's what really makes this movie take flight.<br/><br/>***1/2 / *****"

","Quite good Oscar bait directed by Robert Zemeckis, who hasn't made a live action film since Cast Away in 2000. Denzel Washington stars as an alcoholic, drug addicted pilot. On a routine flight, some troubles occur and cause him to have to crash land the plane. Six people die in the crash, and it was only due to Washington's ingenious maneuver that anyone survived. The accident is clearly due to a mechanical error, but Washington's substance abuse problems come under scrutiny, and if they come out publicly, it will mean being charged with manslaughter, no matter the mechanical problems. This is mostly a standard story of alcoholism, but it's very well done, and Denzel is as good as he's been since his Oscar win back in 2001 (though I'd rank this performance far below his work in Training Day). Kelly Reilly is also excellent as a heroin addict whom he meets in the hospital. She wants to escape substance abuse herself, and Denzel's pigheadedness doesn't help. John Goodman, Bruce Greenwood and Don Cheadle, amongst others, also give great performances. The plane crash sequence is one of the best, most harrowing sequences of the year. I can't imagine any person seeing this in a theater and not gripping the hand rests tightly."

","A routine plane flight encounters a catastrophic malfunction, but the alcoholic, drugged pilot miraculously saves many lives. Now the question is: How will his additions affect the crash investigation?<br/><br/>Denzel Washington plays the pilot and gives an outstanding performance. He's utterly charismatic, sympathetic, and a pleasure to watch. Though his character is troubled and weak, I was rooting for him. The plane emergency is so real and scary, you'll never want to fly again.<br/><br/>On the down side, I found the prolonged nudity in the opening scene and the nonstop profanity to be completely unnecessary and degrading. Also, John Goodman's comic-relief drug dealer is viewed as an amiable and even helpful man, which is off-putting.<br/><br/>Washington is such a fine actor, I wish he had had a better script that didn't rely on the shock value of gutter language, nudity, and drug abuse."

","After an amazing display, the world hails you as a hero. But, even with that, you still might spend the rest of your life in prison. What do you do? Obscure the truth and save yourself or admit the truth and face the music?<br/><br/>Captain William ""Whip"" Whitaker (played by Denzel Washington) is an airline pilot with impeccable skills and a personal life in shambles. After a night of intimacy and intoxicants, Whitaker and flight attendant Katerina Marquez wake up and prepare themselves for a scheduled flight to Atlanta. Whitaker greets his co- pilot, the naÃ¯ve and devoutly religious Ken Evans (played by Brian Geraghty), and flight attendant Margaret Thomason (played by Tamara Tunie) and then prepares for take-off. After deftly piloting the plane through turbulence, Whitaker mixes himself a drink, turns on the auto- pilot, and goes to sleep. The plane goes into a steep dive as it approaches Atlanta which rouses Whitaker from his slumber. Both Whitaker and Evans attempt to halt or at least slow the plane's descent, unsuccessfully. Whitaker then decides to roll the plane so that they might glide in at a safer angle. During the maneuver, Katerina (Whitaker's companion from the previous evening played by Nadine Velazquez) unbuckles her seatbelt to help a child who's been unseated thanks to the maneuver. In the interim, the engines flame out and the plane is now gliding to earth. Whitaker turns the plane right side-up, the plane crashes, and Whitaker loses consciousness. Now injured, Whitaker wakes up in an Atlanta hospital and is met by a friend and representative of the pilots' union named Charlie Anderson. Anderson (played by Bruce Greenwood) tells Whitaker that of the 102 people on board, 96 survived the crash. Katerina, with whom Whitaker had spent the night preceding the crash, was among the six fatalities. Whitaker's injured but will leave the hospital in a matter of days. While in the hospital, he meets another patient named Nicole Maggen while smoking in the stairwell. Maggen (played by Kelly Reilly) is in the hospital as a result of an overdose that occurred as the plane was crashing. After the hospital releases him and he is picked up by friend, neighbor and dealer Harling Mays (played by John Goodman), Whitaker elects to avoid the press by staying at a farm owned by his deceased father that he has been trying to sell. He drives to a meeting with an airline where a lawyer named Hugh Lang (played by Don Cheadle) tells Whitaker that a blood test performed after the crash showed Whitaker was under the influence and that he could face prison time, no matter what the ultimate cause of the crash. <br/><br/>Whitaker is the very definition of an anti-hero. While he succeeds in saving the majority of the crew and the passengers, he struggles with a myriad of personal issues including alcoholism and cocaine addiction. Goodman's character, while he is a supplier, is hardly a salesman. He simply serves the needs of a demanding customer. The character of Nicole Maggen offers little more than perspective as we watch her turn her life around while Whitaker continues down a dark road and attempts to take her with him. Cheadle and Greenwood play morally ambiguous characters who know Whitaker broke the law but hope to keep that a secret. While this may not be as triumphant as director Robert Zemeckis's last live-action film, Cast Away, it's a well-made, well- written, well-acted film and I'm glad I saw it."

","It is amazing to me that you can take a chunk of metal, mixed in nuts and bolts and attach some engines and you can fly pristinely across the sky. More importantly are the pilots that guide these crafts through the air. Flight is quite a movie, it chronicles the self assured pilot Whip Witaker (Denzel Washington) as he takes the controls of a typical flight from Orlando to Atlanta. Along the way, the flight hits some turbulence and begins a free fall. Whip keeps the calm and uses all his skills to guide the craft. The scene is riveting and I caught myself closing my eyes, is it going to crash or not? After the big event the investigator come in and seek a scapegoat, was the incident caused by mechanical malfunction or pilot error. This movie is full of suspense and is one hell of a ride."
"cultfilmfan","8","2","3","25 November 2012"," Flight
","When, I first started seeing trailers for Flight, back in the summer, it looked like a much different movie then it actually turned out to be. I think Denzel Washington is a good actor, but over the years I have not gone to see him in much, simply because a lot of the films looked like loud action films where he displays none of his acting talent and is basically doing those type of films for a paycheck. I much preferred him in dramas such as Malcolm X, The Hurricane, or even American Gangster, from a few years ago. I am happy to say that while nowhere near a perfect movie, Flight is better than I thought it would be and Denzel, is able to show off his acting abilities in a film where there is no real action, or adventure, but rather a fairly well developed character study that deals with the issue of substance abuse and in this case, alcoholism. I found a lot of Flight, did work well. The acting from the whole ensemble cast was quite good and the performances seemed real and believable. The screenplay often as well seemed realistic and charted what I would imagine the ups and downs of an alcoholic would be without sentimentalizing it too much. At one point during the film, I was afraid it was going to go in a certain direction that to me would ruin the whole film and more, or less be an ending that would perhaps appeal to many, but to me would ruin pretty much everything the film had going for it, or was trying to say, but much to my surprise the film did not take that way out and I appreciated it for that. When, I think of powerful and realistically done films dealing with alcohol abuse, two films that come to mind are John Cassavetes' Opening Night and John Huston's Fat City. Both films included powerful performances and were not shy in showing the pain, struggle and heartache that alcohol, or basically any type of addiction could have on a person and also their work life, their performance and how it affects their health and the ones around them as well, whether it be co-workers, family, or friends. Those films were hard hitting and made not as pieces of entertainment, but rather as character studies were we walk away from seeing them having learned something and gone for quite a powerful ride feeling the tumultuous and often draining experience of what it would be like to be these characters, or even to watch them. I would have to say that Flight, does not have the same impact, or delivers in quite the same way. Yes, Denzel Washington is very good here and most likely he will be nominated for an Oscar for his performance, but at times I didn't always feel that Denzel was the right choice to play this character. Denzel, is a very popular actor and with a few exceptions like Training Day, we are mostly accustomed to him playing the roles of clean cut heroes who more, or less save the day in whatever type of situation the film he is in calls for. He is a little too famous, handsome and well known for this type of role and that is one of the reasons why it does not work. I remember back in my school days hearing the testimony of a man who lose almost all of his family due to drug addiction and he wanted to stress that people who are addicted to drugs did not look glamorous, or cool as they have been made to look in the movies. His example was John Travolta and Uma Thurman in Pulp Fiction, and how while they did a lot of drugs in the film, they always had glamour and a certain style to them and I would have to agree with that remark. There are certain scenes in Flight, that are a little more gritty and feel a lot more realistic, but there are also scenes where sometimes things happen and it feels like they have been done that way to overemphasize things and make everything a lot more dramatic, whereas to me it felt forced and did not always work. Instead of an over 30 million budget, make a smaller film with lesser known actors and try to make it gritty and intense and not like a glamorous 30 million dollar Hollywood film. One other aspect of the film that I did not appreciate was how it seemed to portray Christians, or basically anyone religious in the film as fanatics and while the audience laughed at them, the film seemed to be as well. Truth is that if Denzel's character had paid even the slightest bit of attention to them, or what they were trying to say to him, he most likely would not have been in the situation he was in. Flight, works as an intriguing and entertaining story, but it is not as powerful, realistic, or as well acted, or researched as it could have been. Worth seeing as entertainment, but only offers minimal food for thought."

The character he plays is a departure for him because from start to finish he is a very unlike able person because he is unable to except consequences for his actions. John Goodman is another standout in his two short scenes as Whips drug dealer, he provides some comedy for this dark story. Kelly Reilly plays Nicole a drug addict who meets whip leading to the two starting up a relationship. She becomes wasted after some time and just disappears from the story for no reason.<br/><br/>The film overall is a let down because the ending was did not match the storytelling.

"jaxbubba","7","2","3","16 November 2012"," Another fantastic performance by Denzel Washington
","Denzel Washington has a knack for selecting roles of on-screen personalities that possess serious character faults, flaws, and deflects. Whether it's Detective Alonzo Harris from ""Training Day"" or Frank Lucas from ""American Gangster"" or even Tobin Frost from ""Safe House"" it is usually very difficult for the audience to ever fully embrace the actions that his characters are engaged. Whip Whitaker from ""Flight"" is no exception.<br/><br/>Whip Whitaker (Washington) is a phenomenal pilot, highly decorated veteran with thousands of flight hours logged; however, Whip Whitaker is also a drug addicted, cocaine snorting, over-indulgent, uncontrollable, yet ""somewhat"" functioning alcoholic. After a night of drunken debauchery, Whitaker is scheduled to pilot a routine channel flight to Atlanta. A structural integrity mishap with the plane's tail flap (elevator) causes the plane into a free-falling nose dive, and impending disaster. If not for the exceptional piloting skills of Whip WhitakerÂ… the plane, the crew, and the 102 passengers would have all perished. Whitaker was able to successfully crash land the plane in an open field, but not without fatalities. So is Captain Whip Whitaker a hero, or the scapegoat? <br/><br/>In the approximately 105 minutes that follow the accident, we (the audience) are introduced into the world of Whip Whitaker. This is not the glamorous world of the aviation pilot, but rather, the seedy world of the abusive alcoholic. Whitaker is helpless to his addiction, and even though he has been warned of pending prosecution and life imprisonment if he is found guilty of pilot negligenceÂ… Whitaker is powerless to the monkey on his back. It is actually quite painful to watch this character spiral out of control; while a credit the Denzel Washington's acting ability to loathe and detest this character so much. In the events with lead up to the film's climax, I was absolutely flabbergasted as I watched (and knew) what was about to happen as Whip Whitaker (and his inability to maintain self-control) was lured into temptation. Again the disgust and resentment that you have towards this character is a testament to Washington's incredible talent.<br/><br/>I do recommend seeing this film; however, it's serious in nature and has very dark overtones. Another terrific performance by actor Denzel Washington, worthy of another Best Actor Nomination; however, I believe that trophy will be going to Daniel Day Lewis for his role as ""Lincoln"" this year, which I cannot wait to see.<br/><br/>See More of My Reviews on FB @ ""THE FARIS REEL"""

","I wasn't going to write anything about this film, until I saw a blog entry linked to Roger Ebert's Sun Times site. That reviewer posited that Whip, wouldn't have done what he did to save the passengers unless he was uninhibited â€“ i.e. â€“ drunk. I think that was accurate and felt so viscerally when I watched the film. This was a film about the relativity of morality. Whip saved those people and Whip is a drunk. What do YOU make of that. In real life ALL of us would rather have an effective drunk at our side, rather than a failed angel. Whip's transformation at the end was about his personal survival going forward, not about the rightness or wrongness of his past behavior. That drunk was a hero."
"cultfilmfreaksdotcom","7","2","3","4 November 2012"," Performance
","In the first five minutes of FLIGHT, we learn Denzel Washington's commercial pilot Whip Whitaker is a man with a problem â€“ he's got a really bad hangover and needs to fly a plane. It's his job, after all. He does some coke and struts down a hotel corridor to Traffic's ""Feelin' Alright"" â€“ winding up aboard an airliner with more problems than he has. <br/><br/>Director Robert Zemeckis provides two suspenseful scenes within the essential baseline: first when the plane takes off through a thunderstorm and then that crash we payed to see. And with the impressive special effects aside, most of the ""action"" remains inside the cockpit as Whip takes creative measures, including turning the plane upside down, to avoid a nosedive.<br/><br/>But FLIGHT doesn't entirely live up to its name â€“ much of the film takes place after the crash as Whip deals with two problems at the same time: his own alcoholism that could result in a long prison time. Whip's addiction issues, and a steamy romance with a beautiful junky, would seem somewhat clichÃ© without the impending court date continuously established by Union rep Bruce Greenwood and sneaky lawyer Don Cheadle: each trying their best to keep Whip sober long enough to skate outta trouble... here's where the post-crash suspense occurs.<br/><br/>Meanwhile John Goodman's Harling Mays, a jovial drug dealer with his own theme song (The Stone's ""Sympathy for the Devil""), tries too hard to steal scenes â€“ but when he's called back to save Whip from another hangover, you won't help but smile (even for the wrong reasons). But what really matters is Denzel Washington's genuine performance that, despite the talented cast and the impressive special effects around him, feels like a one-man show. He plays a narcissist with only one care in the world: himself. And with so many problems lurking around him, this makes for an intriguing two hours where even the slow moments count.<br/><br/>For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com"
"richard-1787","8","2","3","2 November 2012"," A very well acted movie, but not without problems
","This movie has a lot to offer, especially once it really gets going. (You do NOT want to watch it if you are about to fly somewhere. The scene leading up to the plane crash is very well filmed, and will make you fear flying even if that has never bothered you before.) What this is, at its best, is the story of an addict, alcohol and cocaine, who is still completely functional. (I don't know if that's possible.) He pulls off the miraculous landing of a small jet when there is a mechanical failure, using a presence of mind that seems surprising from someone who drinks and drugs so regularly and heavily - but since I don't do either, I don't know if that is realistic or not.<br/><br/>Thereafter, once his addition is discovered, most of the movie deals with his efforts to cover it up so he will not lose his license and be sent to prison for years. He is not necessarily admirable in this.<br/><br/>Washington gives a first-rate performance of an interesting but far from perfect man. He's a first-rate actor, and he makes us interested in his character even through we don't really like him.<br/><br/>A few things bothered me about the movie, though.<br/><br/>First, if the one flight attendant, Margaret, who had known the pilot for years, knew about his drinking problem, would she really have been so tolerant, and willing to fly with him? That seems hard to believe.<br/><br/>Second, I didn't like the end in prison. It was heart-warming, yes, but almost like an ad for AA. I would have been happier if: a. he had let the accusation of the flight attendant pass at the inquest, and then been bothered by the fact that he let the woman's name be tarnished - leaving us bothered by the thought that an addict pilot could in fact get out of such inquests and go on flying.<br/><br/>b. he had admitted that he was the one who drank the vodka, and we had been left with the fact that he would then serve a prison term.<br/><br/>Third, when the story of the drug-addicted prostitute is first introduced, once the flight starts, I had NO idea how that connected to what was going on. It really went on much too long - the porn director going on about Nicole playing Desdemona in a porn version of Othello, with a Moor who didn't look at all Moorish, at least from the back, etc. A short scene establishing her situation would have been better, though it still would have been confusing until later, in the hospital, when we see her again and realize that her story will intersect with the pilot's. Frankly, we could just have met her in the hospital, without any of the preceding scenes with her, and still have figured out her situation just as well without any of the confusion.<br/><br/>Still, it's a good movie, and definitely worth seeing for Washington's performance."

But at the end, hallelujah, he sees the light and changes his ways. The scenario and acting are excellent. If anything is wrong with the aeronautics, it's well beyond me. However, while I had a full buy-in to the story as it went along, I had a growing sense of unease. It's Hollywood values that are the problem. Drunks and drug dealers are apparently fun, entertaining and colourful characters. Over-the-top substance abuse is normal and inevitable.The sober and responsible characters are prim-lipped boring folks. It's all of a piece with the Hollywood films which are gun-totin' shoot-outs - it normalizes and glamourizes behaviour which should really not be seen as entertainment. I don't have a solution nor can I dictate boundaries, it just feels wrong. What I'm trying to say is that Hollywood likes to be moralistic but is really profoundly hypocritical and compromised. Other than that small (!) matter, I'd like to complain that much of the dialogue in ""Flight"" is either muttered or drawled in heavy accents, so that I missed at least half of what was said, not that it really mattered."

","""Flight"" is movie that, albeit having scenes involving a flight, is about a man more than an object.

Denzel Washington's acting is OK but, in my opinion, the one who steals the show is Brian Geraghty; the scene in which Whitaker comes into his hospital bedroom proved that Geraghty KNOWS how to perform a serious scene, mixed with a lot of feelings. Directing and soundtrack are just regular, and maybe that's why ""Flight"" doesn't seem to impress spectator in any moment. I believe that a stronger directing and a louder soundtrack could have made this film a lot better.

The only interesting part is that where the pilot mention he is alcoholic and had drunk that day.

","After making a series of motion capture films, Robert Zemeckis returned to live-action filmmaking with the drama Flight, which earned two Oscar nominations.<br/><br/>William ""Whip"" Whittaker Sr. (Denzel Washington) is a pilot with alcohol and drug issues. Before a flight from Orlando to Atlanta had spend the night with a flight attendant, Katerina Marquez (Nadine Velazquez), undertaking his vices. When the place suffers from a mechanical error Whip miraculously rolls the plane and clashes it so that only six people lose their lives. Whip is hailed as a hero but the investigators of the clash discover Whip's alcoholism. With his legal team Whip sets out to prevent himself going to prison and being open to lawsuits and forms a relationship from a recurring drug addict, Nicole (Kelly Reilly).<br/><br/>Flight is at best in the first 30 minutes where Zemeckis treats us to a brilliant sequence as the place suffers technical failure and nosedives with Whip taking controls of the situation. It is a tense, exciting sequence as the plan has to role in the sky and shows Zemeckis' skill with both big special effects and drama, showing why he has such a good reputation as a director.<br/><br/>After the excitement of the first act Flight turns into a pure drama about a man with an addiction, playing it believable as a man who says he can give up any time but continually drawn to alcohol as a crutch. The other element is the legal drama as Whip and his legal team tires to prove it was mechanical error and not pilot error.<br/><br/>Washington gives an excellent performance, being believable as this dark character, even when he is acting for good, such as defending Nicole. He did deserve an Oscar nomination and he is ably supported by a excellent cast, Don Cheadle, Kelly Reilly (best known role in the Sherlock Holmes films) and Bruce Greenwood.<br/><br/>John Gatins was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and he does tell an interesting story, using a big event to draw us into a character study and a Zemeckis drama. But Gatins and Zemeckis do go very heavy handed with the religious themes of redemption and forgiveness, with the plane clashing into a church, the members of church continuing to pray at the site of the clash and many conversations about God's will. It was the conversations about religion that felt particularly forceful and chucky and needed a rewrite to make it work better.<br/><br/>Flight is a solid drama thanks to the performances from its cast and an excellent first act from Zemeckis."
"siderite","7","1","1","3 February 2014"," A bit different from the trailer, but just
","The story was interesting and worth telling, the people in it played well - indeed, it should have been a movie I appreciated. However most of the plot was spoiled by the trailer, leaving the film just going through the motions. The rest was the story of a man addicted to alcohol. In the end, none of the conflict between heroism and drunkenness that is implied in the trailer actually happens, they are just two different and simultaneous things.<br/><br/>Some questions are raised, perhaps, yet they are not technical, but about the personal experiences of the lead character, one that I couldn't empathize with. Had it been a film with a completely different backdrop, say a bus driver or a mountain guide or a teacher, the story would have been very much the same. So, then, I have to conclude that the plane angle was not that important to the value of the film. Then the slow pace gets you, the two hours and a quarter length.<br/><br/>To wrap it up, I felt like the movie was intended for people who already understand addiction and that I missed some important lesson from it because I didn't go through that myself in any severe manner.<br/><br/>Obviously it was a decent film, but not above average, I am afraid."

"davideo-2","7","1","1","11 June 2013"," Glossy, brave big budget character study that doesn't feel completely the sum of it's parts
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning<br/><br/>Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington) is a respected, seasoned airline pilot who presents a respectable image to the public, but behind the scenes leads a debauched life of drink, drugs and wanton women. He ends up flying a plane while drugs and alcohol are still in his system, which just so happens to crash. However, Whitaker's actions on board undoubtedly save more lives than could have been taken. But the powers that be need a scapegoat and as investigations in to his private life begin, he starts to spiral madly out of control.<br/><br/>It remains an undisputed statistical fact that air travel is the safest form of transportation, although ironically it's still probably the most unduly feared. It may be the grand scale of a plane's design that gives people the heebie jeebies, making the thought of crashing in it more than any other form of transport more daunting. With this in mind, a grand Hollywood picture would have to make a crash scenario as realistic as possible, and not just play on people's fears. Flight does a good job of doling out the tension in the build up to the big disaster, allowing time to pass and a relaxed mood to settle in before the impact hits. With this out the way and the rest of the movie to contend with, Robert Zemekis's film lays out it's grand ambitions and intentions on a plate, and despite basically doing nothing wrong, still comes off not feeling quite the sum of it's parts.<br/><br/>In the lead role, Washington has as solid and commanding a presence as ever, portraying a flawed, weak individual, whose undoubtable ability and dedication juxtaposes with that to present someone who just seems on an unexplainable path of self destruction. And, maybe that's the problem. Despite it's sprawling length, the film never really tries to delve in to the psyche of it's protagonist, and offer glimpses in to what might have happened before that makes him tick like he does. Instead, we are left to glare at this tragic figure as he stumbles in to a friendship/romance with recovering addict Norma (Brit girl Kelly Reilly) and fail to stay off the wagon for the inevitable public relations duties he will face, leading on to a slushy, sentimental TV movie ending that will feel cheesy and dated to some. The rest of the support cast includes John Goodman and Don Cheadle, supporting players who end up feeling as un/explored as the lead character.<br/><br/>Zemekis undoubtedly presents an intriguing, ambitious character study here that aims for something higher than your typical Hollywood yarn, and he has phenomenal talent to pull it off. Sadly, while far from a failure, it just doesn't feel as much of a success as it could have been. ***"

The rest of it is a waist of time.

"s_campanale","8","1","1","8 February 2013"," The Parable of Whip...Or the Sinner Redeemed (with nudity, drugs and a plane crash)
","Robert Zemeckis, like his contemporary Steven Spielberg, is a director who has built his reputation as a master of dark tinged family fantasy that side lines in ""serious drama"", dramas that however carry over certain romantic, sentimental and even sugary aspects from their family friendly works into dark hard adult dramas. <br/><br/>""Flight"" is Zemeckis first live action movie since 2000s ""Castaway"", a film with which it shares many aspects. Both feature a terrifyingly realistic plane crash, both isolate their protagonists in a Hellish personal purgatory where their sins are cleansed by graphic suffering, and both end with redemption and the promise of life renewed. Both also have a sort of ""spiritual undercurrent"" which hints at a hidden hand behind events, of a destiny meant to be, a ""divine plan"" unfolding. It also bears some semblance to the 2007 reimagining of ""Beowulf"", in which the epic tale of the flawless hero became a story of hubris and excess being tempered by realisation, and of sins cleansed and redemption won with suffering. And like ""Beowulf"", this features some superficial ""Christian bashing"" (here in the form of the Christian co-pilot and his bizarre cult like wife) as a clever bluff to avoid them looking too ""Churchy"" for secular audiences. <br/><br/>The story of a brilliant but hopelessly alcohol and drug addicted airline pilot whose inebriated/high state actually saves a plane from certain disaster, a man whose Hero status comes under scrutiny as investigations reveal his many weaknesses could have gone in many different ways. Here Zemeckis has chosen to go with the ""Castaway""/""Beowulf"" sinner redeemed arc, and so concentrates almost entirely on Whip Whittaker (Washington)'s destructive addiction to booze and drugs, something he superficially tries to fight but actually accepts as simply part of who he is, despite the destruction it causes in his own personal life and the obvious danger it puts his passengers and crewmates into. We get hints at greater events happening around this, the investigation into the crash, the media frenzy and the building up of a folk hero who is then systematically demolished, the political blame games being played by Airline, Manufacturers and Pilot's union, the trauma of the survivors, lover Nicole's battle against Heroin and her forging of a new life etc, but they are all happening elsewhere, in another movie perhaps. <br/><br/>Around the fallen sinner Whip we get a circle of interesting characters played by brilliant actors. Principal among them is recovering Heroin addict Nicole (played by Kelly Reilly, best known as Mary Watson in the Downey jr/Law Sherlock Holmes films) who in many ways is a more fleshed out version of the troubled sculptress that Tom Hanks eventually ends up with in ""Cast Away"". Here also the opening act suggests a synchronicity between their stories, a joint destiny working its way into being. A jovial Cancer patient who crashes their ""chance"" meeting in hospital all but spells out that their meeting is no coincidence. We get the sense that Nicole is the star of her own dramatic story, happening contemporaneously to this one, but all we see of it is the parts that intersect with Whips leaving us naturally wanting more. Then there is Whips friend and dealer Harley (played by ""Fallen"" co-star John Goodman, who is introduced to ""Sympathy for the Devil"" perhaps as a knowing wink) who has little screen time but always saves the day with Cocaine (the film seems almost like an advert for the miraculous properties of Coke, which is bizarre to say the least!) There's Whip's old buddy from the Navy Days Charlie (the ever brilliant Bruce Greenwood) now his Pilot's Union rep who tries to save his career, the hotshot lawyer Lang (Don Cheadle) who goes from antagonist to supporter who does likewise, Nadine Velasquez as Katerina, the hot Latino hostess who shares Whips bed and vices, dies a heroine in the crash and eventually becomes the light beyond the grave that inspires his final redemption, and Margaret (Tamara Tunie) the only surviving hostess who helps save the day during the crash but becomes a stern moral voice in the days after. Melissa Leo also appears at the end as the chair of the inquest, but her character never escapes being a symbolic gatekeeper to paradise rather than a realistic hardnosed investigator. <br/><br/>The film takes many liberties with reality in both the flying and airline politics scenarios (as pointed out by many industry professionals here on IMDb) and the actions of many of the characters are often contrived and illogical. Whip himself is a heroic soul who nonetheless also has to be a prize asshole and unlikable defecation for 90% of the film's running time in order to enact his final redemption, so he is a protagonist we can't really like or warm to. As mentioned, everyone else is dropping in from completely separate stories so they are not really fleshed out personalities.<br/><br/>The opening crash is brilliantly shot (if fantastical) and the stuff of nightmares for those scared of flying. The film is also shot through with moral ambiguities, none of which are actually addressed, leaving the audience to make their own minds up about it. In order to fully do justice to the scenario here, we would need a mini- series that covered all the angles, but this is a stand-alone film so we only get one real story, Whips. Washington is excellent of course, showing his acting chops again after years of headlining moribund actioners (with an Oscar nod to show for it) as are the co-stars. <br/><br/>I suppose how you feel about the film's message will depend on your personal beliefs, but as a human drama it can be enjoyed by anyone who has the stomach to watch largely self-inflicted agony for 2 and a half hours."
"jaapeelman","5","1","1","10 February 2013"," Very unrealistic
","This is a very unrealistic movie concerning the aviation part as well as the alcoholic part. If something is wrong with the aircraft-stabilizer and you can not control the pitch-attitude you will never be able to control the pitch all of a sudden when you fly upside down. And a drunk pilot is flying better than a healthy and fit pilot trying to do the same thing in the simulator? Also: if you'r a strong alcoholic as this pilot you will never be able to leave the booze alone for 9 days without any help. And during the final hearing he only has to respond ""yes"" to get off the hook. How many people would do/say the same thing as he does? But besides this all the movie is slow and boring. Only the first 15 minutes are interesting (the crash) and the minutes of the NTSB-hearing. The whole dramatic middle-part could have been shortened by the half to make this movie at least not as slow as it is now. A disappointing movie and almost a waste of the time watching it."

","Welcome back Robert Zemeckis after his actor-animation capture ventures, FLIGHT heralds his first time return to a real live feature after a dozen years. Great relief he is still excelling in instructing a debatable moral tale with a back-to-his-top-form two-times Oscar-winner Denzel Washington. <br/><br/>The narration has its gradual and clock-wise temp in scrutinizing a heroic pilot's personal quagmire after landing a doomed-to-be-crashed plane with minimum casualty by virtue of his alcoholic addiction (what's worse is the fact that he was cockeyed even when he was at the helm during that dreadful accident). From a legitimate angle, although his valorous action deserves raves from the mass, and the pivotal cause of the accident largely lies in an outdated plane part, he still unavoidably should assume his liability. There is no ambiguity in whether or not he should get away with it, and eventually the case evolves into a self- awakening resolution to reshuffle one's life from his damned addiction (there is a more-than- enough trek leading into the thematic revelation, thanks to Washington's instinctive charisma, if falls into other thespian's palm, which would induce an over-dramatic and self-conscious bravura just to appease the good-over-evil expectation from well-prepared audience. The final twist is histrionic but Danzel's telling confession is superbly visceral even though has been fermented overlong. <br/><br/>The Kelly Reilly tributary also negotiates through an engrossing damsel in mistress plight, until it emerges (a shade bluntly) with the main narrative, prompts the salvation-evoking meeting between a compulsive and recurrent drunkard and an inveterate junkie, it is not a fatalist love story of LEAVING LAS VEGAS (1995, 8/10) although neither of them is another's messiah. Ms. Reilly, a rather under-used British actress, after many years of endeavor in Hollywood, finally grabs a much meatier role in a mainstream flick and she is never daunted by Washington's suffocating presence, infuses a secular savor tallies with the formatively square film. <br/><br/>Robert Zemeckis shoots the most matter-of-fact airplane crashing process except the final collision, when CGI unavoidably reveals its tail, but the film stands unyieldingly on its ground as a preachifying morale parable, its motley spectators will never feel being offensive when it tries too much and many cliché settings keep hopping up, anyhow it is a laudable feat from Zemeckis, whom I feel spontaneously send my tip of advice (definitely I'm not a loner here), stopping meddling with the pricey animation gizmos and going back to the fertile soil where germinates FORREST GUMP (1994, 9/10)"
"the_only_warrior","8","1","1","4 February 2013"," Wonderful character movie
","This is a very difficult movie to review without spoiling, but I think I've managed it.<br/><br/>The basic premise is this: Whip, an alcoholic pilot is woken up the morning of a flight completely hung-over and snorts cocaine to wake up before having to fly the plane.<br/><br/>The plane takes off and it's immediately apparent that something is wrong with the plane and Whip, a very experienced and accomplished pilot manages to crash land the plane against next to impossible odds. Six people die, but over a hundred passengers are saved.<br/><br/>Whip is greeted as a hero, but also needs to face the official inquiry about the plane crash, which bothers him due to the fact he had been drinking.<br/><br/>Flight has many other stories running through it, but the actual main thread of the film isn't the one that is most obvious at the beginning, and that is Whip's own personal demons. Denzel Washington does a stellar job in the role - as close to perfection as you can get.<br/><br/>It's a very messy movie, and deliberately so, because one of the other central themes is that life is never predictable and under your control and sometimes things just happen for no reason. Although this sounds Tarantinoesque, it is actually pointedly highlighted in the script, particularly with a religious theme - sometimes poignant, sometimes comic and therefore never preachy.<br/><br/>All the characters are very humanised and sympathetic, even the flawed ones. It was a very intelligent script, in that there is very little that comes across as contrived and fake.<br/><br/>It's also very nicely balanced - it could have been intensely dramatic the whole time were it not for some wonderful over-the-top moments provided by Harling Mays (played by John Goodman).<br/><br/>Coming home an hour later my head is still spinning about this movie, which is a wonderful thing - worth a look!"

Whip, is in denial, comes a bit better, goes a bit worse, karma catches up at the end, with added gravitas from support by Cheadle, Greenwood, and Goodman.<br/><br/>But it's more than that, it's a tense movie, with a really strong opening act, and a performance from Washington that really deserves the academy award.<br/><br/>If your not a fan of the lead, I doubt.

This movie tends more to be about addiction and how it is more a disease then a problem. Kudos to John Goodman who i thought was simply brilliant as Whip's drug dealer Harling (Laughed at how he presented himself you have to see the movie yourself to see why) Aside from that most of the all-star cast did pretty solid acting jobs.<br/><br/>With award season almost under our noses i can definitely see this as being a strong contender with Denzel more than likely garnering yet another statuette for his shelf at home in the best acting dept."

"Robert_duder","7","1","1","30 November 2012"," Certainly a critical darling. Well made drama with some pacing issues
","There are a few films releasing now that it is plain and simple they will receive the Oscar nods. I think Flight is certainly one of those. It reeks critics favourite. Strong cast, male lead that everyone loves, brilliantly talented film maker, and an ethical debate for the ages wrapped in a strong emotionally driven story. All those things including the fact that critics love it doesn't necessarily make it a good film. It is, however, a good film. I don't feel like its a great film but it is definitely good. The story is excellent but the pacing for the film just seems off. I think some better editing to bring the film down to even a tidy two hours would have been plenty. The massive 2 1/2 hour length was simply not necessary. I felt like there was a number of scenes that simply could have been avoided. As many reviewers pointed out, and even a lengthy thread in the forums, the opening scene where Nadine Velazquez walks around completely naked making sure we see her at every angle. It was gratuitous and completely pointless and I'm really surprised that Zemeckis bothered with the scene.<br/><br/>I enjoy Denzel Washington. However, I often find his performances as of late very egotistical. Fortunately for him this particular role required exactly that. His character is a damaged, egotistical man with very little redemptive qualities. He really does a great job and will likely get an Oscar nod for it. Kelly Reilly is Washington's love interest and a recovering drug addict. She does alright although her performance lacks the same depth as Washington's does. They have good chemistry and I understand why her character was important and yet her entire story arc was more fodder that could have been cut or reduced significantly. Tamara Tunie does an excellent job in her role as a respected flight attendant. I would have liked to have seen more from her character. She was really great. Bruce Greenwood nails his performance as Washington's friend and mentor. The two of them play off each other easily and with excellence. Don Cheadle is very good as the straight laced brilliant lawyer. This is one character they should have spent more time on and gotten rid of some of the other filler. As much as I like John Goodman I thought he played one of the characters that was simply unnecessary.<br/><br/>Robert Zemeckis is probably one of the most brilliant directors. He has created two of my favourite films of all time and a handful of other truly brilliant classics. This, in my opinion, was a far cry from a Zemeckis film. It was a powerful story and had some really moving moments but there just felt like so much there that didn't need to be. The pacing was simply off. The crash scene was intense and brilliant and so well done and parts of the film are extremely well done. It could have been huge and for me, entertainment wise, it was just good and falls short of really great. 7/10"

","As a kid, I've always been interested in planes, big and small. I later discovered a truly fascinating series called ""Air Crash Investigation"" and have watched almost every episode there is. So when I caught the trailer for this film few months ago and also noticed Denzel Washington was involved, I was instantly hooked! <br/><br/>This film is a tale of two flights: the first is there for everyone to see. A take-off in thunder and lightning which soon descends into mid-air chaos, then certain disaster only to be mitigated by the heroic, if unusual, actions of the Pilot-in-Command, Capt. William ""Whip"" Whitaker (Denzel Washington). In an inspired move (a clear nod to the doomed Alaska Airlines Flight 261), he decides to fly upside down to overcome a steep nosedive and completes a landing which is nothing short of miraculous. Capt. Whitaker is regarding a public hero, on the verge of a certain recognition from his pilots association, and apart from the crushing loss of his coworker-mistress, Flt. Attendant Marquez, is in good shape. Until things take an ugly turn and the second flight takes off.<br/><br/>A broken marriage with a past history of liquor abuse has left Whitaker a chronic alcohol and drug addict. Routine procedures following the immediate investigation into the accident have revealed higher than permissible BAO levels, which his attorney Hugh Lang (Don Cheadle) and rep Charlie (Bruce Greenwood) are confident can be overturned. However, Whitaker's guilty conscience prompts him into making repetitive arrogant claims (""No one else could have landed that plane!""). One such outburst causes a bad rift between him, Charlie and Lang, with a formal hearing only days away. Consorting with a hippie (Kelly Reilly), Whitaker tries to find some purpose but with the demons fast closing in, his crew caught in the crossroads of whether to support their savior or bring the truth to life, Whitaker's life nearly derails when he's thrown out by his ex-wife and son. Left with nowhere to go, he seeks asylum at Charlie's. The day before the hearing, his addiction gets the better of him, but somehow, he manages to ""breathe"" his way to sobriety and walks in.<br/><br/>The hearing is faithful to reality and hard-hitting. Melissa Leo shines in a great cameo as an investigator with pointed and charged questions. What follows is not entirely surprising, but the exchange between an investigator who is out to seek the truth and a pilot with a dark secret is not unlike many courtroom dramas we have seen before.<br/><br/>The story is pretty unique and decently authentic. The crash scene is superbly shot (couple of scenes inside the plane are not for the fainthearted!). The supporting cast do their job but it is Washington who ""flies"" this engrossing film with high-class acting. Not every seasoned actor can pull off a conflicted professional but so good is he that you see the pilot, not the actor when he dons that slick blazer with the shades and sticks that smirk on his face. His is a performance worthy of several award nominations. Maybe his third Oscar, who knows! If you are a Washington fan, do not miss this Flight!"
"katiebear801","4","5","12","3 November 2012"," Flight - What happened here?
","******MAJOR SPOILERS****** <br/><br/>Honestly, I was disappointed. Never mind my distaste for action/war movies – when I saw Denzel Washington's name, I thought 'How bad could it be?' It was pretty bad. This movie takes a (pardon the pun) nosedive when the character development begins to resemble a yo-yo. Up, down, up, down, back and forth, until sooner or later it gets tedious and boring.<br/><br/>It becomes boring to the point when you can't believe you bought it to begin with.<br/><br/>Whip Whittaker is a man with a serious drinking issue. Oh and by the way folks, he crashes a plane. Now let's just think about this for a moment (I know I had to in the beginning - I was sure I was missing something).The movie is called ""Flight"", not ""The Man Who Attempted to Stop Drinking but Just Couldn't Help Himself"". Seriously, this movie had the odd, twisting plot line of your average pretzel, crunchy or otherwise. It wasn't the fact that he couldn't make up his mind. Even though that was pretty annoying, it wasn't nearly as irritating as how the plot never moved forward. He quits, he starts again, he quits, he starts again. And then he goes to jail. What's up with that? Don't even get me started on Kelly Reilly. She's an alright actress, but she played a pointless character. I understand she was added for moral – or in his case sexual – support. I, as your usual movie fanatic, was hoping maybe she would be an influence on him because she quit and he obviously needed to get sober. However, when it became evident to the watcher that she wasn't helping, she as a guidance device fell flat. I think the writers realized this too, because after one little argument she leaves. And that's the end of ""Nicole"", of whom we spent half an hour figuring out the background of. What the heck were these guys thinking? As for Mr. Washington, this was definitely not his best movie, but even when he sucks he's good. Don Cheadle was the same way.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what I was supposed to think about the whole 'prodigal pilot' thing. He must be immensely talented if he can manage to save 106 people from a plane that went from nose-dive to a somewhat typical crash. He lost control, and it seemed like it was only a faulty part, but even I was skeptical of that. Which was it that really caused the crash? Could he have saved everyone if he was sober? So there's the flaw they forgot to at least cover: Cliffhangers. A good movie would leave you with interpretive questions, not actual plot question you need the answer to in order to appreciate . . . whatever it was they were trying to accomplish.<br/><br/>The crash scene was very well directed. My heart was pounding and I was barely able to refrain myself from screaming out loud ""This! This is how drinking ruins your life!!"" I saved myself from many glares of the people who probably thought this movie was the greatest thing since Forrest Gump. Really, it seemed to me like the director (Robert Zemeckis) did what he could with what he had to work with. This movie would have completely crashed (pardon the pun again) and burned. I mean, this wasn't the worst movie ever invented, but it irked me that everything I thought it was going to be never showed up.<br/><br/>In summary, it was alright, but a HUGE step down from the ""fabulous"" I thought it would be. So, maybe I'm just the insensitive schmuck whose opinion is characteristic of someone who doesn't know what they're talking about. I suppose that's true. Still, won't change this movie. ""Flight"" is yet another piece of living proof that it is indeed possible to go the wrong direction with a movie that could have easily been saved. I was disappointed because I waited through two hours of a circular plot to see something – anything – different happen. I waited because I thought he would change, making the writers able to transform him from an alcoholic accused of manslaughter to a lost man who travels down the long, self-restraining road to soberness. I thought this movie would be different, but I was wrong and walked from the theater disappointed but glad I had free movie passes."

","this movie is not a good movie. I've seen quite some good movies, and this is not one of them. I'm a big Denzel Washington-fan, but this movie makes me dislike the man more than I could dislike Carmen Elektra in Disaster Movie. Denzel Washington was not acting at all, he was just repeating his act of Man on Fire. at least he must have listened to my comment on that movie and played here on constant 'I'm on overdose'-scale/-attitude. at least the best part of the movie came in less than a second at the beginning, when Denzel wook up next to a very beautiful woman. at that point in the movie (the beginning, thus), I simply knew that this movie was gonna be dynamite; it didn't get any better than that. be careful with movies that show a naked woman at the beginning; it is all they have to offer. the rest of the movie will be in most of the cases one big bugger. this movie proofs this theory once more. if you want a nice television movie, sure, you have to be here, but for the rest, not worth a single price. if this movie does win any price, it just would show that Hollywood has nothing more to offer. the movie goes down, long live the plane. unfortunately just a bit too little scenes of the actual flight, and no mystery, but big time disappointment. show it again and I'll puke."

The accident is a minor issue only used to set up the controversy: It could easily have been a car accident or construction accident or anything. In the end, the whole FAA investigation was a total sham - Not even remotely realistic - I'm sure the technical adviser threw a tantrum. He must have been so frustrated. Instead the move is a two hour anti-drinking sermon. The only purpose for this move was to push 12 step programs and encourage people to force their ""Friends"" to go to AA meetings.<br/><br/>I want my two hours back.

So if you have a problem with nudity (you shouldn't, but I know some do and that's OK), be aware of that fact! The rating should indicate the reason for it getting an R, I'm sure.<br/><br/>Having put that out of the way, let us concentrate on the essential. You might have read about this movie and might have a picture how this is. Denzel Washington might be one of the few people who will be able to blow away those expectations.

","Somewhere in Flight, there is a good movie waiting to pop out. Unfortunately, we never really got to see it. What could have been a nice display of the unraveling and the unveiling of an assumed hero becomes the typical drama about a broken man---except with an exhilarating turbulence sequence. Although the acting was fine and the directing was spot-on, the editing was convoluted and the movie was a bit lengthier than necessary. <br/><br/>Denzel Washington is one of the most dependable actors arguably in the history of film. So of course, he is the outstanding factor on this film, and kept the movie from becoming too unbearable. He is supported by a great staff that includes the also-reliable John Goodman, Don Chedele, and Kelly Reilly. The movie may have the Lifetime feel, but definitely doesn't have the similar acting. During the darkest moments of the film, the staff delivers and deserves all the accolades it can get. <br/><br/>If anything hampers the acting, it's partially the writing but mostly the editing. What really prevents Flight from becoming something special is that it reveals all its cards before having a chance to bluff. Detail scattered in the first third of the movie could have been hidden to not only subtract some predictability but could have also added some suspense and mystery into the movie. Knowing where Flight was going to go just a dozen minutes in was not a good sign. <br/><br/>In terms of writing, you must always be one step ahead of the audience, must always have a decent trick up your sleeve if the story ever lingers. Flight being over 120 minutes and already treading down a familiar road from the getgo, there was no way the decent directing from the amazing Robert Zemeckis or the great Best Actor nominated performance of Washington could save this from being a bit of a bore. By the time we get to the finish line, the Zs will start developing in your system. <br/><br/>When the most thrilling and most entertaining sequence of the movie occurs within the first half hour and three half hours to go, we have a problem. <br/><br/>Mayday mayday, this movie is going down."

I like Denzel. I really do. But he too much of a likable guy to carry off the druken pilot character that the entire film hangs it head on. You can figure out the story line and the ending way before it happens. The characters are lifeless and cardboard cut outs. I cannot understand why FLight was nominated for any awards.

A very memorable opening scene followed by intense action. At this point, ""Flight"" was living up to my high expectations. All of a sudden, it plummets, literally.

"guchrisc","Null","3","6","5 February 2013"," ""He was some kind of a man"".
","Paramount picture, so we see that lovely mountain.<br/><br/>Lead male is played by Denzel Washington. As film opens we see him waking for an early morning flight. The opening scene sets the scene for what is about to unfold, and so is not to be missed. Film moves quickly on to the flight, which encounters difficulties, to be blunt the plane nose-dives. The plane is going down (even while some stragglers are still coming into the cinema!).<br/><br/>Plane crash is done well by film and pilot. This is no rugby team crashing into the Andes Mountains. It is as dramatic, though the forced landing is not as destructive. Main theme of the film is how the crash effects Denzel Washington. In an interview, Washington says the film had nothing to do with the story of the plane that landed in the Hudson River, rather the story is about ten years old, and is based on a real-life event, thus the engineering and flying aspects are technically correct and actors used a simulator in preparation for the role.<br/><br/>Washington is a man with a good heart, but not a stout one, instead he is rather weak-hearted. After the crash, he meets others who have some effect on him. Washington is very believable as he deals with the emotions and situations that beset him. Nothing else however is to be expected from this great actor. Those who have seen him as the senior policeman in 'Training Day' or playing the gangster Frank Lucas, know he gives great performances of real depth, showing real human emotion, showing the bad in the good, and the good in the bad.<br/><br/>Some humour is injected with the appearance of John Goodman. Goodman who showed much pathos as Babe Ruth, who graced TV screens as the stage husband of 'Rosanne', is now gracing the screen with lovely cameo roles. However those who loved him in 'Argo' may have difficulty in spotting him. Not since Sean Penn was lawyer Dave, to his client Al Pacino, in 'Carlito's Way', have we seen such a transformation. It is as if that Argo film producer had been doing his own make-up for this film. Goodman is in only briefly but plays to the hilt his larger-than-life character. Supporting cast give good performances, but a special mention should go to a stalwart from the 'Law & Order SVU' TV series, who gives a very strong performance. There again, you don't spend years on a TV series without learning how to act.<br/><br/>In the main thread of the story, and the other threads, this film deals with adult themes. In the UK, it is rated 15. These adult themes are not hidden, and are central to the plot.<br/><br/>This film surpassed my expectations, and finding no fault with it, I must give it a 10/10."
"medguy42","4","3","6","27 January 2013"," An Overrated Flight (Spoilers)
","*SPOILERS* Precisely because the average rating on Flight is so high, I feel the need to add my thoughts about the movie (and script.) The definition of ""spoiler"" isn't all that tight, so I'll alert you to what I think are mild spoilers, below.<br/><br/>Early in the movie, Denzel Washington's character, pilot Whip Whitaker maneuvers his commercial aircraft through what looks like great turbulence than I can imagine a non-military flight taking off in, in real life. It looks like the plane is taking off in a hurricane. Unlikely. During the same flight, Whip manages to wrestle the un-flyable, defective plane to a heroic crash landing. And he does all this with a blood alcohol level that makes him legally drunk. Even for Hollywood, this is too much. Alcoholics -- especially those with decades of heavy drinking under their belt -- do not tend to think that fast, or have lightning quick reflexes. Some athletes hit home runs while hung over, but that's while actively drunk. The kind of clear thinking and super-fast analysis of complex situations that this hero demonstrates aren't compatible with alcoholism.<br/><br/>*SPOILER (in the next TWO paragraphs) Movie-goers tend to like and respect bright, highly capable characters. And while Whip is a super-human pilot, he is super-weak and/or super-dumb when it comes to his actions following the crash landing. Despite being told not to drink in the coming weeks or months by the lawyer assigned (by Whip's union) to help him, Whip immediately proceeds to indulge in heavy drinking. It's dramatic alright, and makes us wonder how things will play out, but that character wouldn't be that stupid. Yes, he would probably have to drink, but this man knows his blood will be tested soon and that he may be facing a long prison sentence if convicted of causing deaths, so a bright guy like Whip might go to a doctor, try to get meds and other treatment to help him stay sober in the immediate future. The devil-may-care attitude we see throughout much of the movie is unrealistic for this character.<br/><br/>*SPOILER* He abruptly stops drinking after years of heavy drinking -- and no withdrawal symptoms? Probably possible (everyone's body reacts differently to things), but unlikely. He'd have tremors, maybe hallucinations, alerted mental status, etc. Going cold turkey is dangerous. People going through it seldom look and function like Whip does for a few days.<br/><br/>(END OF SPOILER) Whip's relationship with a down-and-out drug addict/hooker is kind of a cliché at this point. How many more movies do we have to endure where the troubled hero gets the help he needs from a hooker with her own problems? No points to the writer for this cliché.<br/><br/>John Goodman plays a supremely confident drug dealer who is a long-time friend of Whip's. He does a fine job in a colorful role, but for my taste, the cartoonish nature of that character is out of tune with the rest of the movie. It wakes us up and makes us laugh, but if the movie and its message are to be taken seriously, Goodman's character robs the film of some of its gravity. It comes across as a self-conscious attempt at pandering to the audience by making sure we get a few laughs thrown in.<br/><br/>Bottom line, this is not an Oscar-worthy script. One of director Robert Zemekis's biggest movies was ""Forrest Gump,"" whose mentally-challenged protagonist was able to rise to the top of several pyramids (like ping-pong, the food business, etc.) It makes sense that he would also like the idea of an alcoholic pilot who saves many lives with his heroic actions. The ending was satisfying, but it felt contrived. I think ""Flight"" has been the beneficiary of over-enthusiasm."

","This is another dime in a dozen ... and it seems that one sure way to get an Oscar nomination will always point towards playing an alcoholic, an addict or a prostitute.<br/><br/>Denzel does not disappoint and gives a decent portrayal of an alcoholic. Sadly it is no longer original. To spend over two hours looking at addicts and alcoholics is sad in any case. What makes this particularly boring is that this has been done umpteen times before and brings absolutely nothing new.<br/><br/>Leaving Las Vegas with Nicholas Cage and Elisabeth Shue was the first (and best) in its kind.

Afterward, the plot meanders around, detailing the seamy excesses of its main character and doing little else, until it reaches its highly unrealistic, highly unsatisfying climax. I thoroughly disliked Denzel Washington's character, which shows, I guess, what a good job he did, since I like the actor himself very much. But his skill isn't enough to redeem this dud of a story. Halfway through the climactic scene, I realized what was coming, and I felt very much ripped off, as though I'd been treated to a preachy and inferior remake of ""Days of Wine and Roses.""

That's our lead, ladies and gentlemen. What's scarier is that he's about to fly a plane full of passengers. However, he just passes out and the plane malfunctions all on its own. His co-pilot just freaks out but Whip keeps it cool, leveling the plane... and then inverts it. Weird. But what's cool is that we get to see from a cockpit perspective. Honestly, never before have I seen a film that really captures the whole flying thing. I never flown before so this was a close experience.<br/><br/>Sure enough, he lands the plane but it crashes. Luckily, most everyone survived except six people. Still, people want blood and because Whip has an alcohol and drug problem, they want to put him away. So instead of, oh I don't know, staying off the booze, he keeps drinking. Everyone who is trying to help him tells him to stop, but he keeps drinking. So throughout the film, he copes with that but he just can't stop and pushing away everyone around him. <br/><br/>The performances were excellent in this movie. Some of the conversations felt very real, and I sense Oscar nods coming their way. It helps when the writing is superb. The only thing about this movie that it doesn't really have the charm as some of the other Zemeckis films. I don't see repeat viewings or anything. Also, product placement galore!"

","Anyone who thinks this is a disaster film (something like ""Airport"") will probably be surprised, and possibly disappointed. The end of the doomed flight is a perfect piece of suspense and tension. But that episode is not the theme of the film.<br/><br/>This film is actually about addiction (including alcoholism), but it is definitely not a sermon. Anyone unfamiliar with the illness may not notice what is being presented--so light is the touch here, and so excellent are the performances. There is an early scene of the dismal effect of addiction, and that is contrasted with a view of someone equally addicted but who is still ""functioning."" Is substance abuse not really a problem until something horrible happens as a result? Decades ago, Ray Milland won an Oscar for playing an alcoholic in ""The Lost Weekend."" And then there was ""Days of Wine and Roses."" There have been harrowing films exploring the depths of drug addiction, and the withdrawal from it. Denzel Washington makes the same point, without having an extended scene of excessive ""drunk"" behavior. While prior films on the subject had casts and situations which really punched across the message, this film opts for a more subtle message in an interesting story.<br/><br/>For example, when Nicole puts a blanket over Whip and leaves him, rather than helping him to his feet and tucking him in bed. When she is on the porch and Whip takes a quick glance at the book she has with her. Some of us know what she was reading and it's not a Bible).<br/><br/>Note the various contexts of ""act of God,"" and not just as a legal term: such as the members of the church returning daily to the crash site, the meaning that some survivors take from the fact that they survived, the issue of any divine intent behind cancer.<br/><br/>There is also a great paradox in this film. Examine what you wish to happen in the final hearing. Who are you cheering for? The exchange between Whip and Ellen Block (the terrific Melissa Leo), is one of the most powerful scenes in quite some time. Without shouting, antagonism and wild emotions, Denzel and Melissa put it across. That final silent look she gives him has so much in it. I need to see that again.<br/><br/>I won't say anything about the plot except this: anyone who laughs when the second refrigerator is opened has totally missed the point."

Not all pilots know how to fly inverted, in fact very few do. The hotels were a little high price for a regional pilot and crew.<br/><br/>Things that the film got right: Horizontal Stabilizer causes the exact situation portrayed! Very good job.<br/><br/>Things the film got wrong: If one of the pilots smells of Gin, the other officer is honor bound to report him at the time of recognizing the issue. That's OK though. Also, there are no co-pilots they are first officers for cockpit control situation. But so what, minor detail.<br/><br/>Overall, the technical detail was close enough to reality that it didn't move into ""Airplane"" situations. <br/><br/>Do not see this movie if drug use bothers you, there is a lot of drug use with needles, cocaine and so forth. So beware. Also Christians are shown respect and made fun of at the same time, but if you are a Christian you are use to the poor portrayals by Hollywood.

","First, Denzel was unsympathetic and bordering unlikable, which isn't a good start to have as a lead character. Not sure if there were anyone in this that was sympathetic and likable.<br/><br/>It was like the writer was writing two different movies and then merged them into one, but they were unrelated at its core. Was it about a flawed substance abuser or a mystery into a plane crash? Not that it can't have both elements, but they just weren't executed in a way that they did go together. So, in the end, it felt distracting and lacked focused.<br/><br/>When you finally thought Denzel would stop his degenerative behavior, it got worse. Cheadle's character was almost unnecessary. The Goodman character just came and went. Just bizarre.<br/><br/>You can have bad lead characters, but don't make them so unlikable that you root for them to fail. When he is about to get saved or triumphed he decides to ""f"" it up.<br/><br/>And the little potential it had was squandered by meandering and underdeveloped storylines and characters. Like the son went from total anger to forgiveness without any build-up or explanation. Like Nicole just disappearing. Too many characters.<br/><br/>What's most disappointing is it was done by a great director. 50% of the movie was basically Sully, the other was Leaving Las Vegas. Put together and you get Flight. The ending was just ridiculous. The acting wasn't even that great, so there wasn't much to save this disaster. It was just too predictable."

","This movie captures the essence of addiction and any review that says otherwise is simply a reflection of those who do not get it or refuse to get it. And the movie captures this essence as well. We are always the last to see ourselves. The music score is perfectly layered.<br/><br/>The casting for this movie was perfect. Kelly Reilly was brilliant...I mean really brilliant. John Goodman was slightly over-the-top but used with precision to lighten the mood. Peter Gerety as the owner of the airline was instantly believable. Don Cheadle use of subtlety in his performance noteworthy. Alan Silvestri's soundtrack haunting. Mr Washington is amazing. Denzel just knows his craft. When someone is this good, I just relax and like a beautiful sunset, I can only admire and give thanks. Yeah...I dug this flick!<br/><br/>There are millions of alcoholics and even more so in denial of living the illusion of being in control. Add the addicts of other forms of substance and we have a whole lot of people addicts to something.<br/><br/>How any review can be negative about this film is beyond me. The film portrays the insanity of addiction, that despite a crash, the desire to drink is not quenched, in fact, it escalates. Guilt and resentments fuel addiction. Denzel was brilliant here as was the writing and direction.<br/><br/>Arrogance is the only power a guilty man can stand on, and once that ladder is climbed, the top is about to peak, and quickly. Then there is a time when the lies must stop. One must accept the consequences. This is like the person arrested and says they are glad the police showed up. They were ready to let a ""power greater than them self"" take over.<br/><br/>Many reviewing this have addictions, but with different consequences. Shopping, gambling, sex, food (the number one addiction) can be equally as powerful in a person's life, but with different outcomes. At the core, the addiction is fueled by the same elements, some form of brokenness. Life in a fallen world. The key is repentance or a change of heart to seek God. We do not seek God out of His love for us, but out of pain and the need for rescue. Our hearts are that hard. Do you understand that? If not, continue on, by His grace you might have life.<br/><br/>When one says I am a grateful alcoholic, they mean if it weren't for that addiction they would not have found grace, so in a twisted irony, those with the ""lesser"" addictions might be worse off for they believe they are in control and live in their illusion."

"eshwarmail","9","3","7","14 January 2013"," Denzel Washington show in a compelling character study with Zemeckis sensibilities
","Disturbing character portrayed in a drawing performance as a stubborn alcoholic immersed in false pride and ego was so absorbing, involving, connecting and could not take my eye off for a second in what I thought was a too lengthy movie when I saw the runtime. Denzel Washington gives the best performance of whatever I have seen of him and carries the entire movie on his broad shoulders. The special effects in the initial flight crash is on par but not to the extent of the hype surrounding it. The supporting cast deliver apt performances to keep the quality of the movie consistent throughout.<br/><br/>For long I have been a sucker for Zemeckis sensibilities as a director. Having watched most of his movies, Zemeckis was involved in a wide array of genres be it science fiction, fantasy, children, drama, horror, thriller etc., some more successful than others, none showed his lack of ability (maybe horror to an extent).<br/><br/>Captain Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington) is an experienced airline pilot and an alcoholic. On a stormy day, he comes to duty high on alcohol and cocaine but skillfully guides the plane through turbulence. A little later the flight encounters a mechanical malfunction and goes for a nose dive. With an instinctive mind, he inverts the flight to control the decent and miraculously crash lands it in a field. What could have been a total disaster with more than 100 passengers on board is averted and leads to only 6 causalities. Then the investigation starts.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington was so natural as the stubborn drunk who is always difficult to deal with. His mumbles when drunk were nothing short of legendary. So are the scenes when he tries to meet his family, initial scenes at the hospital etc. Kelly Reilly was excellent in 'Eden Lake' and she is nothing short here too. She has a unique voice diction and I love it. John Goodman is quirky and lightens some intense moments while Bruce Greenwood and Don Cheadle give apt performances.<br/><br/>During the initial part of the movie, there is a little sequence in the hospital between Washington, Reilly and another cancer patient. That was the instant I got drawn in until which it was mostly the terrific flight crash sequence. The movie tend to go spiritual at times but only lingers as long as you can stand it. With only Washington's difficult character to focus on, the screenplay does a tremendous job in holding the viewer's attention when the protagonist stumbles from one depressing scenario to another. The epiphany and the climax is a tad predictable and could have done well without. No faults to find in editing and background score is apt and elevates in some scenes. It is not everyones cup of tea but once you sink in with some patience, I don't see anyone regretting it.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington show in a compelling character study with Zemeckis sensibilities."

"ironhorse_iv","6","3","7","11 November 2012"," it's turbulence to watch
","It's hard to say that this was a airplane movie by the opening scene which has close shots of nudity. The movie seem more like a porno at the first 5 mins, rather than a serious film. It had way too much nudity in that scene alone, that didn't serve no value to the plot, but shock value to the audience. It's here we meet, Captain Pilot William ""Whip"" Whitaker (Denzel Washington) awaking up after having rough sex, and drugs with flight attendant (Nadine Velazquez) at a hotel room. Whip and Nadine then goes to their job, where it's turns into a frequent flyer's worst nightmare – trapped inside a plane in mid air that suddenly plummets towards the earth at an uncontrollable speed AKA Alaska Airlines Flight 261 type. The flight itself was intense, perfectly extremely realistic sequence shot for a few minutes ruin by horrible acting by Whit's co-pilot Ken Evans with over-dramatic laughable screaming. It was Whip that save the day miraculously maneuver the aircraft towards a crash landing. It's odd in a way, despite several vodkas and a line of coke, Denzel as Captain Whip Whitaker, pulls off some extraordinary maneuvers to glide the airliner to earth. It's out of place, as it's seems that Captain Whip can seem sober and orderly in some scenes, and other scenes, badly mumbling, stumbling and out there. The film shows the addicts in a way, by showing how raunchy and dirty they are, but also shows them as a cartoonish way too. Whip tends to able to drink large amounts of alcohol, that is unreasonable too much. Anybody who drinks as much as he portray to, would die of alcohol poisoning. Commercial U.S flight crew are regularly subjected to being breathalyzed and drug tested by the FAA but logic tossed that away, so we get the post-crash investigation instead. Conducted by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), lead by Ellen Block (Melissa Leo) the investigation begins to reveal some troubling revelations about Whip and his higher than permissible BAO levels, which his attorney Hugh Lang (Don Cheadle) and Union rep Charlie (Bruce Greenwood) are confident can be overlooked by his public hero status. Don Cheadle as the wise-cracking lawyer, whose own moral values may be tested in exchange for corporate and criminal immunity, is great against Denzel's character. It's never establish why Whip really drinks, and I think it's hurts the film, a bit, not explaining it. We just see the negative results of it. Whip so unlikeable as a character, and most of the time, the film serve its audiences, disappointments after disappointments after he continues to fall from grace, and fail to live any moral value. He does try, but it's a lose and lose to the audience. We don't know whether to cheer for Whip to beat the rap, or be exposed as the fraud. Very difficult to sympathize with someone who would put his passengers in constant danger by being a chronic substance abuser. Though finely acted by Denzel Washingto. His character has few redeeming qualities and it's flat out hard to root for him, even in the clichéd ending that hurts the film. It's 'that' disappointment, that makes the film really hard to watch: 3/4 cruising altitude of the film, is nothing of lying his way after the plane crash. The supporting cast seems out of place too. Nadine's character serve little to the plot, odd to see her get top billing, as her character seem to be only there to be a sex object that Whip to screw. She's killed off quickly in the film, giving us Nicole (Kelly Reilly) a heroin addict for Whip to sleep with. The first quarter of the film, waste a lot of time for back story about her life, that wasn't needed as Kelly's character will tell us later in the film about when Whip starts to care for her. Their relationship seem rush, as both quickly falling in love seem out of place. Cancer patient character Derek Hogue (Dane Davenport) that comes and disappears for a few minutes for no reason to deliver cleaver funny and tell the addicts his new perspective on life. John Goodman as Harling Mays, Whitaker's Big Lebowski-esquire drug dealer that brings comedy. There is a horrible use of symbolism as the plane crashing into the church, the act of God, and the co-pilot beliefs. Christians are shown 'out there' and the film made fun of it. Although clever, dialog can be offend certain audience groups. Those who may be sensitive to alcohol situations may also be offensive with the film stereotypical visuals. Some of the dialogue, laced with some cursing, also may cross the line to make you very angry and distracted. Some people can handle a movie with foul language but there are a few scenes where it was just so vile that you couldn't help but feel awkward and cringe. Other than offensive stereotypes though, there are some other weaknesses to this movie. The pace of the movie is also slow. Anyone who thinks this is a disaster film will probably be surprised, & possibly disappointed. The end of the doomed flight is a perfect piece of suspense and tension. But that episode is not the theme of the film, and it's sadly tossed away in the first couple of minutes. Rather we get a standard-issue hard-luck story, but by the end you might not care whether the main character overcomes his obstacles or not, and that's not good."

","It's a frequent flyer's worst nightmare – trapped inside a plane in mid air that suddenly plummets towards the earth at an uncontrollable speed which is exactly what happens in new Paramount Pictures movie ""Flight"" directed by Robert Zemeckis, starring Denzel Washington, John Goodman, and Don Cheadle.<br/><br/>Washington plays a self-indulgent character named Whip Whitaker that has an addiction to alcohol who happens to be a commercial pilot. During a flight, Whitaker gets his crew and passenger on the plane through a bad weather storm consisting of extreme turbulence. Once pulling the plane successfully through it, Whitaker gloats to his passengers while sneaking a couple of mini-vodkas with orange juice before going back into the cockpit with a fairly new pilot. It seems to be smooth sailing from there on out, until the plane starts to lose pressure and starts to plunge to a rapid descend. Going on pure ""instinct"" Whitaker would later say in a hearing, he flipped the plane upside down in order to bide some time for a smoother than ordinary landing into an open field which ironically was the grounds of a church with members praying as the plane fell down.<br/><br/>Upon the plane's safe landing which took lives of three plane crew members and four passengers, it is quickly discovered that no other pilots tested in the same conditions could land the plane safely. His new found heroism is spiked with a personal addiction that he isn't aware that he has.<br/><br/>After missing various signs along the way that he needs help, Whitaker reaches his personal rock bottom moment inside of a hotel room the night before his hearing to convince his innocence of any negligence to the panel. His moment of clarity comes in an unexpected place and a very well played, suspenseful scene at the end of the film.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington is truly dedicated to his character Whip Whitaker. So much so that you forget you are watching Denzel Washington play this part. He really becomes Whip in the film. Other strong performances included John Goodman (""the mobile 7-11″), Keilly Reilly who plays Whitaker's love interest, Don Cheadle who portrays the lawyer that is brought-in by the airline union for his trail, and Charlie Anderson who plays Whitaker's union rep.<br/><br/>""Flight"" is an incredibly strong character piece with real human stories and emotion. Whip is the dark horse that you shouldn't be rooting for, but you are. When he finally takes responsibility for his actions knowing what the consequences are, it's this raw realism that makes the movie that much more intriguing and powerful while giving every viewer something that they can relate to. It's these moments in each individuals' life that defines their character. For Whip, he ends up gaining more respect for it.<br/><br/><ul><li>HollywoodJunket.com</li></ul>"

Other than this fact I thought the movie was very good. I don't understand the purpose of showing this type of nudity in the film. To me it had no purpose and detracted from the overall movie experience. I for one didn't appreciate it and when going with my boyfriend was offended.

","A key function of a film based in the real world is 'plausibility'. If the characters you are watching do things that don't make sense, it compromises and spoils your enjoyment of the film as you can't really believe it any more. 'Flight' falls firmly into this category. Here are some examples:<br/><br/><ul><li>Whip's toxicology report is successfully rescinded by his lawyer on the basis that the hospital blood and hair test process used out of date and unchecked processes. All the other crew members had their samples tested at the same time, so why were they not rescinded too? Why did no-one in that huge conference room full of intelligent people question that?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>John Goodman's drug dealer character is (somehow) brought in to rescue Whip from his drunken stupor on the morning of the inquest, and the two people looking after Whip just stand by and watch as large quantities of drugs are consumed without even questioning what this will do to their client. Any normal person would go 'Hey! Won't this make him even worse?' Not only that but they then unquestioningly give him the $500 he demands, just happening to have that much cash on them of course.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Whip shows absolutely no ill effects from all that drinking and drug taking. Every morning he looks fit and healthy again without the enormous hangover you would expect. He swigs vodka as he drives yet his driving seems fine. He is the epitomy of prefessionalism as he crash-lands the plane. Not only does this not seem that plausible but it is also not a good message to be sending out.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>People like his attorney are trying to help Whip ensure he is not prosecuted. Yet he keeps turning on them, shouting and swearing at them even though all they are doing is assisting him. Why on earth would he do that? He is not even drunk at the time. Just doesn't make sense, why bite the hand that is feeding you? It's just stupid.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Whip is asked the question: 'in your opinion, did the stewardess drink the vodka?'. Simple question. The subsequent not answering, mumbling, looking away, asking for the question to be repeated etc charade was just ridiculous, no-one would do that as it so obviously implies some form of guilt. Then, instead of just saying ""I don't know"" (simple!) he suddenly confesses for no reason. Completely implausible. You could also question why the question was asked in the first place as it wasn't going to prove anything but that got subsumed by the ridiculous response that had me screaming at the screen at how daft it all was. It completely ruined what for me was already not a good film. And just to get the usual saccharine Hollywood ending where he serves his time, goes dry, re-unites with his family, and no doubt lives happily ever after.</li></ul><br/><br/>The film started well, but after the plane crashed it went down almost as fast and for me ended up as a bit of a smouldering wreckage. Frustrating."

","...to this film!<br/><br/>Denzel Washington was seriously robbed an Oscar for this role because we all know the Academy is racist... (just kidding? Will Smith/Jada did not force me to say that. Go easy on me). But honestly, Denzel gave so much incredible performance range in this film that the Academy really take him for granted. Daniel Day-Lewis won Oscar that year instead (for playing Lincoln), but it's a shame because, underneath that high quality cosmetic makeup and all, playing Lincoln is just really being a lethargic person! It's really nowhere near Denzel's level of incredible wide range of emotions portrayed in his character, where he so genuinely pulled off in this film. Actually, everyone in this film is fantastic. <br/><br/>You will not believe the female actress in this film, Kelly Reilly, is actually British! Wow. Also the guy playing the smoking cancer patient (James Badge Dale), a very memorable powerful scene (he deserves some sort of award just for that scene!), is extremely convincing; it really doesn't seem like he's acting at all! <br/><br/>While the beginning flight scene has the most incredible intense action sequence, if you're expecting to see just a film about a pilot and airplanes and have low attention span/just want more action/blowup action/Air Force One film, this is NOT for you. <br/><br/>If you enjoy character study and deep psychological discussions, this is for you. <br/><br/>This film is about addiction (alcohol and drugs) and has some interesting religious undertone to it. Do things happen for a reason? We all question it. If you are or know someone in denial living a lie, this can be a compelling film for you too. <br/><br/>The climax of the film does NOT need any explosions or action to give the viewers an emotional ride - the whole dilemma the character has to face is just very intriguing. <br/><br/>This is really a beautiful engaging film. This film is dark, but Zemeckis really knows how to throw in comedy too. There were some cheesy moments (the fridge scene), but overall, it's a very powerful film. <br/><br/>Robert Zemeckis is a genius. He also directed Back to the Future and Forrest Gump... Flight is easily another classic. I really love how Robert Zemeckis is not just a director that knows how to make great action and comedy, but really understands and shows the viewers the deeper levels of human emotion."
"anaconda-40658","9","2","4","16 December 2015"," Washington Takes Flight.
","Flight (2012): Dir: Robert Zemeckis / Cast: Denzel Washington, Kelly Reilly, Don Cheadle, John Goodman, Melissa Leo: Surprisingly tense drama about a flight that goes terribly wrong but the title also references the idea of freedom of sin. In this case Denzel Washington plays a pilot whose plane goes down within the midst of a nasty storm but the aftermath is a media frenzy over the news that he was drunk and had done cocaine the evening before. What is truly intriguing is that the screenplay avoids the regular straight forward storyline and examines two individuals. Washington gives a top notch performance as a pilot lying to himself about his addictions. He is estrange from his ex-wife and son and addresses anxiety through alcohol. In a great supporting role is Kelly Reilly as a drug addict whom Washington encounters at the hospital after he awakens. She rooms with Washington when her landlord becomes aggressive. It is interesting to view the transgression between the two individuals. In other roles are Don Cheadle as a lawyer out to present this as an act of God and avoiding any presentation of alcohol. John Goodman provides comic relief as someone who provides drugs to Washington particularly during one hilarious revival scene in a hotel room. Melissa Leo also steals moments in a smaller role as an investigator. The religious elements regarding the co-pilot is weak and overly corny but director Robert Zemeckis provides a tremendous first act of a plane going down and a man who must comes to terms with his situation and take flight from its stronghold. Score: 9 / 10"
"juneebuggy","9","2","4","20 October 2015"," I talked about the crash sequence for days afterwards
","I really liked this, especially the first hour. The section with the plane in a nose dive and the ensuing crash was super exciting and really well executed. I actually talked about it for days afterwards, how calm ""Whip"" was as he tossed out instructions to his panicking co-pilot and stewardess, inverted the plane and crash landed in a field. It was amazingly well done.<br/><br/>The movie floundered a bit after that, still an interesting and for the most part heart wrenching story, heavy on the drama side of things. Denzel Washington gives a fantastic performance as a veteran pilot who successfully lands a commercial airliner following a disastrous malfunction and is then hailed a hero by the public, but a subsequent investigation threatens to expose his history of substance abuse.<br/><br/>I was also impressed by a terrific back up cast. John Goodman's character provides some (much needed) comic relief as Whip's buddy Harling, the man with the goods, also (as always) enjoyed Don Cheadle and Bruce Greenwood. Someone I didn't know before but who managed to captivate while she was on screen was Kelly Reilly as Whips girlfriend/recovering addict. I'd initially been wondering why they were showing her parallel story arc.<br/><br/>I did find this movie interesting in how all sides get their lawyers together and try to blame each other; the airline, the parts manufacturer etc all hoping not to have to pay and trying to blame the pilot who regardless of if he was drunk or not, the plane broke and he saved lives.<br/><br/>And in an alcoholics fantasy sort of way all the shots of the alcohol look particularly delicious; as its poured down the sink on the farm and the Shangrila-ish mini bar in the hotel. Great movie. 10/5/15"

","Denzel Wahington once again reminds us why he's such a great actor in this drama. Flight is not a film about planes or a pilot's life, but it is an amazing character study about the demons of a man. This man, portrayed almost flawless by Washington in an award worthy performance is a man of addictions trying to overcome these. And that is what the movie is basically about, a man trying to fight his disease and how the people around him react to his actions. What's so great about the movie is how you actually sympathize with the character of Denzel Washington: I mean there are literally many times during the film when I actually was talking to Denzel in my head like ""Oh don't do it man, don't drink that stuff, come on"" And I believe that says a lot about the movie, cause you actually care for the characters in this. Flight has great performances, a great story and it is beautifully told. Robert Zemeckis' epic comeback, indeed."
"Lejink","6","2","4","13 January 2014"," Up and down
","I'll try to avoid aviation clichés in this review but it will be tough. Denzel Washington was rightly Oscar-nominated for his leading role (indeed, he's almost never off the screen) as a troubled airline pilot with a broken-down marriage and pretty much broken-down life with an addiction to drugs, alcohol and sex as the first five minutes alone make clear. Still hungover on drink and drugs he pulls off a miraculous flight manoeuvre to save dozens of lives (although not all of them) when the plane he's flying almost literally falls apart on him in stormy weather. <br/><br/>Despite his heroics, his physical state in the cockpit becomes obvious to incident investigators who then seek to try him for dereliction of duty whereupon he escapes to a remote bolt-hole, bumping into drug addict Kelly Carey with whom he strikes up a tempestuous relationship which takes them both further down until reality bites giving them both a shot at redemption.<br/><br/>For me, the film peters out after the dramatic scene-setting plane crash, itself a wonder of special effects. I didn't buy into his relationship with poor-white-trash Carey and felt his own struggles with his demons were overplayed. That and his character's name being ""Whip"" Whitmore! Sentimentality is thankfully shunted pretty much out of the way but there's nothing edifying in seeing Washington's character go to the dogs. He's not very likable from the start and by the time he reaches his epiphany in the courtroom, it's too late to start caring anyway.<br/><br/>This is more serious stuff than I'm used to seeing from ""Back To The Future"" director Zemecks and he does reasonably well with it. Besides the crash scene, there are other memorable scenes including one in the opening minutes when Washington comes dramatically to life after snorting cocaine. <br/><br/>In the end though the movie tails off into melodrama and never regains altitude thereafter, the use of which clichés tells me to wrap up this review before I introduce a squadron's worth."
"lochircof","4","2","4","21 December 2013"," Huge Letdown
","Apart from a terrific performance by Denzel Washington and an amazing flight crash scene, this movie lacks depth. As it centers around Whip, a troubled alcoholic/ drug addict who also has had some family/ marriage issues-- not to mention the plane crash that the film is supposed to be centered around is being blamed on him-- the films seems to ONLY pay attention to Whip. This has to be one of the slowest movies I've seen in a while, mainly because it only characterizes Whip, and it even does a bad job of that. As for everyone else, most could be taken out of the movie and no one would notice. On top of all of this, the film is extremely inappropriate. Apart from the fact that the main character is a alcoholic/ drug addict and we drinking and snorting, there is nudity (including the set of a porno because one of the characters tried to be a prostitute for the money), and lots of swearing (30 some ""f""s and ""s"" each). And such it is such a slow movie, these scenes are very uncomfortable to watch-- not because of the content, but because the scenes quietly come along like no big deal, making a rather awkward feel for the viewer. To be honest, I maybe would have given this movie a 6 or even 7 is I hadn't come in expecting a 8 or 9, for there is still quite a few solid aspects of this movie. However, the bottom line is that the films slowness almost bored me to sleep. I call it a no-go, unless you like being patient with your movies; in that case, you might enjoy this"

Will the NTSB find out the truth about Whip's drinking, or will a heroic act by a flawed pilot obscure the truth of his alcoholism and drug use? <br/><br/>I did not like Flight. This is an example of a very good premise that goes awry, a hero pilot with very big personal flaws, must face his addictions or possibly face jail time. This is an excellent starting point, but the movie gets so weighed down with its overwrought melodrama that it forgets to answer one of the basic questions posed in the film. Why does Whip Whitaker drink? In over two hours of what becomes a tedious morality play, the central question is never even addressed. Many of the movies subplots are simply unnecessary, and add nothing to the central idea in the film. Once again Hollywood has a strange take on religion, and the way down the plane clips a Pentecostal church, and the crash was somehow God's will. Instead the movie should be saying that all of us despite our many flaws are capable of heroic things, and that is through God's grace. The movie of course makes the co-pilot a fundamentalist Christian, whose wife's every utterance ends with the phrase, 'Praise Jesus.' It's sad that Hollywood wants to pigeonhole an entire religion as judgmental Bible thumpers, but they do. If that's not bad enough, the 'evidence' that the movie hinges on is silly. The plane is destroyed, people died, but two vodka bottles are unscathed. Really? Finally, this movie has an interesting take on alcohol detox, take drugs. Not a good idea.<br/><br/>The acting is not great. Denzel Washington, who I like, and think is an excellent actor, has gotten into something of a rut lately, playing a grizzled anti-hero a tough talking guy with all the answers. This take no-prisoners attitude was first and display in the movie Training Day, and it was eye-opening. Denzel could really play a bad guy with the face of a movie idol, but he played a similar role in American Gangster, Unstoppable and now Flight. It's time to put this character away for a while. Don Cheadle plays a lawyer in the dullest, most uninteresting way, I'm really tired of seeing Cheadle give another lifeless, bland performance. John Goodman was at the very least funny, but totally unnecessary . Goodman essentially serves as Washington's drug supplier.<br/><br/>Flight is very slowly paced and inexplicably long. The director Robert Zemeckis, who made the very successful Back To the Future films and writer John Gaitains are responsible for the pacing and length of this film, a lot of editing was required to get to the essence of the film, but that was not done. The movie has nudity and numerous scenes of drug taking. This is absolutely not a movie to watch with kids.<br/><br/>For more high-flying reviews,visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com"
"bg11215","1","2","4","14 November 2013"," This flight didn't even make it off the runway
","I don't know why this film garnered an average 7 star review (as of this post). First of all, the movie was way way WAY too long for the subject matter. At least 30 minutes could have been cut, easily. Even still, the material as written was not suitable for a feature film; a TV movie perhaps. Maybe it was DW's performance that was lacking, but his character was pretty superficial and didn't have an arc worthy of a motion picture. So he's a man who gets drunk all the timeyeah and??? What's the big dramatic premise in that? <br/><br/>He doesn't seem to be on any particular journey (except from addiction to sobriety, but again, who cares?), therefore the audience has no reason to care about him or his predicament. I was completely indifferent to what happened to him. Then they threw in these random characters that didn't seem to serve any purpose to the story, such as the drug addict whom he meets in the hallway at the hospital and later has sex with.<br/><br/>I just didn't think this film was worth watching. I only did because it was on Netflix streaming. If I had paid money to see it in the theater, I'm sure I'd have felt cheated. They took what happened to the Alaskan Airlines flight off the coast of CA several years ago (the jackscrew failed due to inadequate maintenance) and tossed it in with an alcoholic pilot and some randomly stuck in characters; again I ask, who wants to see a pilot get drunk? It obviously wasn't the reason for the crash, and he was able to save the plane in spite of being drunk. This leaves only his personal battle with alcohol addiction as the sole dramatic driving force if the story, and that alone just isn't enough to carry a film. Two thumbs down."
"jonkun227-55-86655","3","2","4","19 October 2013"," Not the worst movie I've ever seen
","I didn't look this up before I grabbed it on a whim at Redbox. I have enjoyed most movies I've seen with Denzel Washington so I was relying on him to only sign up to do a show worth watching. I really should have done my homework. <br/><br/>This is the most heavy-handed morality lesson I've ever seen come out of a major movie studio. From the first scenes my wife and I were already remarking, ""Well they aren't trying to be subtle, are they?"" From the specific focus (camera angle & movement, for instance) on drug and alcohol use in the first (second?) scene to the soundtrack selection which is probably the least subtle part of the messaging, we felt like we were getting hit over the head with theme, plot exposition, and what passes for character development in this film. <br/><br/>I don't drink alcohol and I don't use drugs. I never have. I am not interested, and I don't think anyone else should either (by choice, not by legislation). I don't believe the benefits even come close to outweighing the risks. So I really have no objection to the concept of a ""don't be an alcoholic/addict"" type message in a movie. The issue is just the way it is handled. <br/><br/>There were numerous plot points that did NOT make sense and elements that did NOT seem realistic. I'll describe a couple that I remember now, a week after we watched the movie, but trust me when I say that there were MANY. I'm not a pilot or an aircraft engineer, but I don't think that plane could handle the stress of a barrel roll. I'm not an aviation incident investigator, but I don't believe the NTSB conducts official hearings in hotel banquet rooms. If they do it seems unlikely that they would take the time to mount a MASSIVE NTSB seal on the wall in the back, or go to the work of setting up live video feeds of the hearing to be shown to the people who are present in the hearing. I'm not an alcoholic or medical professional, but I don't believe someone who consumes THAT MUCH alcohol in an single night would survive, nor would someone who apparently drinks that much on a regular basis still have a functional liver. I also have trouble believing that the NTSB wouldn't interview the pilot of the aircraft early and often in an investigation, saving all questioning for a hearing. The 3 question formality they did in the hospital was not an investigation. <br/><br/>Again, I'm not an expert in these fields. I realize I could be wrong. But these kinds of issues were so frequent and disruptive that we could not maintain any suspension of disbelief. All we had was disbelief. We almost turned it off, but we decided to bet on the ending instead. I lost that bet. (I thought he would lie his way through the hearing, be let free, and not learn his lesson so the last shot of the movie would be him getting a drink. My wife, on the other hand, did not underestimate the heavy-handedness of the lesson and called his jail time.) <br/><br/>Basically this feels more like a bad after school special or ""a very special episode of Blossom"" than a major motion picture. I was floored at the end when I noticed that it was directed by Robert Zemeckis. That may be the most unbelievable part of this movie."

","""Flight"" was one of those movies that, the more you watch it, the worse it gets.<br/><br/>Sorry, but Denzel's character was so absurdly self-destructive, it was like watching a cartoon character. The sad part is, once you stop rooting for him (and he is so annoyingly narcissistic, how can you after the umpteenth grab for the bottle), the tension saps out of the movie quicker than the plane nosedived.<br/><br/>The gratuitous breast shots in the beginning were pointless (no pun intended). The relationship with the red-haired heroin addict was ultimately pointless. But he does ultimately develop a painful-to-watch artificial relationship with his son. <br/><br/>Sadly, there was not a single relationship in this movie that seemed anything remotely realistic. Worst was the ridiculous John Goodman caricature, and the co-pilot and his stepford wife in the hospital.<br/><br/>Ultimately, after the initial crash footage, there was no reason to watch. One of the worst screenplays I have seen in awhile. How Denzel got an Oscar nomination is beyond me."

The viewers can only hate him because they see themselves in that plain, suffering that accident but just after having seen how many drugs and alcohol the pilot had taken... During the film the director wants you to change your mind because at least HE LEARNS THE LESSON and stop with that horrible life and began to teach others how drinking and drugs is a kind of chains for everybody.

"whitdraper_89","3","2","4","2 August 2013"," I have never cared less about the plot of any movie, ever.
","In the beginning, the movie was confusing, but somewhat exciting. After the crash scene, things started moving so slowly that I found myself literally checking the clock to see how much time was left of this plane wreck. The plot is slow and feels watered down. It is drawn out for no apparent reason. The characters are underdeveloped to the point that I cared so little about them, I could hardly remember their names. I think the movie was so boring that I was actually unable to pay attention and therefore things seemed confusing. For instance, the opening scene with close ups of a fully nude woman (who we never really learn anything about) is confusing and feels like it was put there just to spice things up, seeing as it has absolutely no relevance other than to illustrate that Whittaker sleeps around...? This movie is about a guy who has a drinking problem and seems to have no control over his own life. He's not admirable or likable - at all. There's really no aspect of Captain Whittaker that I could get attached to. I'm a little shocked at just how bad this movie was. But if you're into full frontal nudity mixed into a concoction of heavy cursing, binge drinking, and a hodge podge of boring story lines that reiterate themselves over and over again in the most lifeless way possible, then this is your movie."
"HelenMary","8","2","4","30 July 2013"," Brilliant acting by Denzel - a powerful heavy film that isn't Hollywood-style redemptive
","Flight is superb. It's a dark treatise in alcoholism, desperation and addiction and Washington is superlative. He portrays Whip the pilot as both genius and attractive but also pathetic, broken and fallen. He deserved his Oscar nomination. The film is absorbing, engaging and completely compelling. I couldn't look away it was so gripping. Up to the last you didn't know how it was going to end up - you can see how it could have gone either way but he demonstrates a strength despite it all.<br/><br/>Nadine Velazquez, always beautiful and engaging, for a small role showed commitment to character, bravery at such exposure (there is total nudity in this film) and her physicality on the plane was great. John Goodman was comic relief given the seriousness of the story, and was really amusing. Kelly Reilly who played Nicole was also brilliant - another exposing and vulnerable role and understated believability - a really likable character. Tamara Tunie (Snr Flight Attendant Margaret), Co-Pilot Brian Geraghty, Lawyer Don Cheadle and Bruce Greenwood from the Union and Adam Tomei as the despicable landlord were the back up players - all of whom were brilliant. Everyone brought their A-game ensuring that the film is nigh on flawless. I don't think I can fault it and it only loses points really for how depressing the film is. Despite the religious overtones which were uplifting to a point, and not too overplayed, it's a dark film and whether there is redemption and whether the outcome is good bad or controversial is the genius of the film. The end doesn't tie up loose ends entirely satisfactorily and leaves it open for discussion and personal opinion. Overall a superbly performed, written and produced film. It is real, gripping and immersing. I defy you to watch it and not want to discuss it. Brilliant film for adults, I may be a bit out of touch but I would have put it at an 18 not a 15 although all of the ""adult"" bits are real, relevant and not offensive or gratuitous. Really powerful film."
"jan-tromp","6","2","4","16 June 2013"," Wrong ending of a very good movie (SPOILER ALERT!!)
","This is a very good movie with great acting by Denzel Washington! The problem is the ending of the movie. I guess they tested more endings and the public preferred the ending of a feel-good movie. That is a shame. A alcoholic would never had admitted. That is impossible. A better ending would have been Denzel going free, going home and flying away in his fathers little plane (maybe crashing). <br/><br/>With a good ending I would have voted a 9/10. Now it must be only a 6. The system used by producers to test a film for an audience will, of course, ruin most movies. Still I recommend the movie. Go see it yourself as Denzel is acting at his best and forget about the ending and make up your own."

"nrbarton","3","2","4","28 February 2013"," 'Flight' needed more brains on board
","There's a lack of genuinely great airline disaster films, especially on a large budget, and, as a disaster movie fan, I was excited about 'Flight'. Unfortunately, whilst the disaster aspect is impressive, the movie itself is a bit of a disaster for anyone who doesn't subscribe to the beliefs of Writer, John Gatins. The movie is actually a rather heavy-handed propaganda piece for Christianity, and, even worse, alcoholics anonymous, who are a despicable religious organisation, who target vulnerable people to brainwash them into Christianity. Don't believe me? Check out their 12 step program.<br/><br/>Despite these monolithic flaws, there are things to like about 'Flight'. The opening thirty minutes with the disaster are tense, thrilling and almost worth the entry price alone. I also have no issues with a personal redemption story, and in that respect it works very well, but the whiff of Christianity is all over it from the imagery to the dialogue, and subtle as a brick to the face.<br/><br/>When troubled by heavy turbulence, the co-pilot prays ""Lord Help us,"" and hung-over, coked-up pilot, Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington), responds ""He can't help you now."" When the plane crashes , not only do they knock the steeple off a church, but they fly directly towards a huge wooden crucifix in the ground. It really spells it out for you that Denzel Washington's character is a lost man who doesn't believe in God, and, through this accident, he will find God and sobriety. At this point you know how the movie is going to proceed, and it never offers much in the way of surprises.<br/><br/>The survivors and fatalities aren't referred to by officials as people, but ""souls"", which just comes across as odd. Something like ""There were 96 souls who survived and 6 souls lost."" Then when his lawyer speaks to him, he says they're going to pursue the case that it was ""an act of God"". Do crash investigation officials and lawyers in America really talk like this? I just looked into it and apparently ""act of God"" is an actual American legal term, which is pretty messed up. Religion should have nothing to do with the law. I know America is a really religious country, but the religious dialogue from officials just didn't ring true with me; it seemed to be from a world that only exists in writer John Gatins' head.<br/><br/>Pilot Whip Whitaker even says, ""God help me"" at the crucial turning point of the movie, so it's very much a religious movie and there's no debating that; a good religious movie, but it being religious is not something I can just brush aside like it doesn't matter. One weird scene is when Whip Whitaker visits his co-pilot in hospital, who talks about God in an over the top manner whilst his wife chants, ""Praise Jesus."" This scene just comes across as mocking the religious, which isn't in keeping with the rest of the film. If it was deliberate to have them come across as a pair of freaky extremists, then I think it was just a red herring, attempting to throw the viewer, as the movie is otherwise rather predictable.<br/><br/>All the crash investigations and progressions are very interesting, so I can't say I was bored, just all the more disappointed. I'll try not to spoil the ending of this rather predictable movie, but let's just say it ends with a redeemed, sober man and a close up shot of a religious prayer on his wall_ with a dove above it. *Vomits everywhere* The lack of subtlety even extends to the soundtrack, where the songs used literally describe the events taking place on screen.<br/><br/>By being so unsubtle it makes it impossible for the non-religious to ignore the religious aspects, therefore alienating a huge proportion of the audience. If you're Christian and think Alcoholics Anonymous is a swell organisation, then the chances are you'll love 'Flight', because it is an engaging and intoxicating film. For everyone else, watch 'The Grey' on Blu Ray or DVD instead.<br/><br/>I'm very disappointed in Robert Zemeckis for wasting his time on such a script. He's brought us such perfect movies as 'Back To The future' trilogy, 'Death Becomes Her' and 'What Lies Beneath'. This is a painfully obvious, religious redemption movie and just isn't up to the expected standard. The fact that there was actually a great disaster sequence and it was an involving film throughout just makes this missed opportunity all the more frustrating. I can't help wonder how great 'Flight' could have been with more brains on board.<br/><br/>(See more of my reviews at http://www.facebook.com/EnigmacryptMovieReviews and http://enigmacrypt.blogspot.co.uk/)"
"harry_tk_yung","Null","2","4","26 February 2013"," Scruples
","I am not sure if the social board game ""Scruples"" which is based on ethical dilemmas is still as popular as it used to be. While this game is intended to test how well each player knows the other players, the situation facing the protagonist in ""Flight"" Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington) would be a very interesting challenge that can be used in the game.<br/><br/>Whitaker is an alcoholic and a darn good commercial airline pilot, and believe it or not, the two are not mutually exclusive. While my extremely modest knowledge of getting rid of hangovers stops at Alka Seltzer, apparently a sniff or two of coke does a far better job. That is what Whitaker relies on and it works every time in getting him through early morning short haul (less than an hour) flights. Not only that. In one of those flights when poor aircraft maintenance caused his plane to launch in an unstoppable nose dive, he saved the day with his superb skill, in a crash landing in an open field saving nearly a hundred lives on board and probably a lot more if the landing had not been steered away form an urban area. While there were still six deaths, he was hailed as a hero.<br/><br/>But the problem is that while the cause of the accident has been proved to have nothing to do with him and despite his heroic feat, he could be facing jail term if his alcoholism is unveiled by the inquest. To cut a long story short, to protect himself, he needs to lie and implicate a hostess who has died. It does not seem too difficult because her blood test for alcoholism is positive. But he knows that she didn't drink the stuff in the two empty bottles found on board. He did. Moreover, she was his lover.<br/><br/>ADDITIONAL SPOILER WARNING - The movie strongly suggests that Whitaker threw everything away in the last minute because this was the last straw on the camel's back – he had reached a point when he could not tell even one single more lie. But I can't help be reflect that if the deceased hostess that he had to betray was not his lover but someone he disliked, would he have still done the same. ""Scruples"" is not a simple game.<br/><br/>Watching Washington perform any role whatsoever is always a sheer joy, and some critics have considered ""Flight"" his best performance to-date, with which I can agree. And there are other good performances. As a drug addict that through a purely chance meeitng becomes his love object, and then drifts away, Kelly Reiller in her dreamy beauty brings together vulnerability and resilience convincingly. If you cannot recall immediately, the last time you saw her on screen could be as Doctor Watson's wife Mary. Bruce Greenwood, somewhat aged and lean, plays his good friend and unwavering support. Looking entirely professional and composed is Don Cheadle as his crafty but sincere-looking defense lawyer. John Goodman supplies his unique brand of comedy as his outlandish drug supplier. Justin Martin invokes pathos as the estranged teenage son with whom he finally finds reconciliation. Three very good support actresses are Nadine Velazquez, Tamara Tunie and Melissa Leo, playing respectively the alluring, lovely hostess who died in the accident, the role-model head hostess who helped him land the plane and the tough member of the inquest whose sharp questioning finally brings him to reveal the truth."
"witchfantasy","2","2","4","14 February 2013"," Flight
","I feel this movie TRIED to prove a point, but with all the excessive drug and alcohol use, it was basically like watching a few people I know constantly crash and burn. I think honestly the best part of the movie was when he was in prison. The rest, pretty much sucked. It may have been meant to send a message, but if anything it'll show people how they can try and beat the system for being irresponsible. I'm just glad he finally showed accountability in the end. The portion about the redhead Nicole and her drug use and doing whatever she can to stay clean after ending up in the hospital was a little refreshing. However, again, far too much drug use.

"RainDogJr","9","2","4","13 February 2013"," A serious piece about alcoholism, with some punk rock touches and a phenomenal lead performance
","Last Friday my girlfriend and I went to the movies and decided to watch two movies instead of the usual one; we didn't think much in our double-feature, I mean in the selection which certainly needs always to be featuring two similar films but not for the obvious reasons (like for instance just because both were directed by the same dude, as Tarantino once remarked), but we just based our selection in the show times: FLIGHT at 17:00 hrs. and THE IMPOSSIBLE at 19:30 hrs. <br/><br/>We knew both were not feel-good experiences, but the similarities we found between them were more than we expected and luckily the double-feature was just damn right, with those magic movie moments – going out from a film that shows and is based upon an air crash to enter to one that begins with a sequence inside of a plane (not to mention that only a couple of a weeks ago I had enter a plane for the first time in years!). <br/><br/>FLIGHT (Robert Zemecki's comeback from ""motion capture"") and THE IMPOSSIBLE (Juan Antonio Bayona's first feature since 2007's EL ORFANATO) are about the consequences of, respectively, an air crash and a natural disaster. The structure in both is quite similar and none takes much time to show us the disaster (the big, important sequence we all know exists and therefore are waiting); in fact, both do it in a not very different way and at the moment of the impact (of both the plane with the surface and the tsunami) everything gets confused, the lose sound, certainly they are trying to put us in the victims' perspective. <br/><br/>Both films bring us hard and sad issues during almost the whole time to end in an optimistic note (the characters that suffered find some light). ""Classic Hollywood style"" you might be thinking, and yes, both are comforting for the average viewer (especially THE IMPOSSIBLE) but at the same time never forget that their subject is a tragic one – in FLIGHT the main character doesn't have the best ending (even if he finally finds some peace) and in THE IMPOSSIBLE the horror of the 2004 tsunami is always well exposed. <br/><br/>The first sequence of FLIGHT, with the pilot ""Whip"" Whitaker (Denzel Washington) waking up together with sexy flight attendant Katerina Marquez (Nadie Velazquez) after a night of sex, alcohol and drugs and just before a commercial flight, left no doubts we were seeing something not very common – this film takes no more than 10 minutes to end with the idea of security and professionalism we have or want to have of a pilot and a flight in general. <br/><br/>With FLIGHT I recalled the good but overrated ARGO, not only because here too we have John Goodman in a little yet very important role but also for its tension. And personally, seeing Washington trying to save his plane from a crash turned out to be as tense, if not more, as seeing Affleck and the group of Americans trying to get out from Iran. Contrary to what happens in ARGO, here the big tension arrives soon; the central theme of FLIGHT is in fact a common issue that has been explored by cinema many times before: alcoholism. FLIGHT, I dare to say, is destined to become a referent of the subject and is definitely one of the best movie about addiction in recent memory. <br/><br/>We also have a look at the world of heroin; yes, one more, and maybe what we get isn't something new but still Zemeckis is doing it right and, for example, gave us a perfect musical selection, in a scene that should have been longer: ""Under the Bridge"", a song by the Red Hot Chili Peppers that's about the consequences of drug addiction, is used to illustrate the character Nicole (Kelly Reilly), a heroin addict. The soundtrack, by the way, is full of other iconic songs like ""Sympathy for the Devil"" and ""Gimme Shelter"" by the Rolling Stones (Marty Scorsese, anyone?) and ""What's Going On"" by Marvin Gaye – not a surprise since Zemeckis did of the GUMP soundtrack a compilation of classics. <br/><br/>The film puts together those characters (Washington and Reilly) and with this move we get to see the two extremes of an addiction case (besides the romantic side of the picture). With Reilly we have the case with hope, the addict with desires of moving on and remain sober (classic situations like the visit to help groups are featured). On the other hand, the pilot falls in the worst period of his life after the accident, drinking tons of alcohol (few cinema characters drink as much as ""Whip"") and going through a constant fight (internal and external). <br/><br/>Washington is absolute golden; his performance as an alcoholic can't get more believable, and he is too a ""bad motherf*****"" at times. And precisely, that ""punk rock"" touch ends being the extra of a very complete piece. The external fight of ""Whip"", for instance, offer us an interesting enough argument for a good climax, even when we know it will be done with the classic ""audience at a jury"". The key here is the previous sequence to the one of the audience at the jury – one that's totally punk rock, that will surprise you and make you laugh with a John Goodman shining like in the good ol' THE BIG LEBOWSKI days, and a cool as hell Washington completing the circle and repeating the first sequence. Great stuff!<br/><br/>*Watched it on 08 February, 2013"

","Emerging from the fertile mind of noted writer John Gatins, comes this enlightening introspective study of ability, courage, arrogance and reckless denial. The main actor for this dramatic high flying film is non-other than Denzel Washington. He portrays Whip Whitaker, an experience, but flawed commercial pilot with hundreds of hours of flight time and who's expertise has been adequately proved with past military deeds. Directed by Robert Zemeckis, this movie lays the foundation for what should be a role worthy of an Academy Award. The story follows Whitaker through a scheduled routine flight to Atlanta. Encountering a sever storm, the plane suddenly becomes the center-piece in every pilot's worse nightmare. The plane finds itself tossed about in the sky and despite the incredible efforts of it's crew, the planes plummets into the ground with loss of life and injury. It also initiates a Media frenzy, a Federal Board of Inquiry and a gigantic personal problem for Withaker. With his best friends running interference for him (Bruce Greenwood (Supurb acting) and Don Cheadle (Superior role)), provide a life and career saving out for him. What then follows is the making of a Classic movie for the entire cast. Indeed, John Goodman who plays Harling Mays is a scene stealer and he too should earn a Best Supporting actor award. All in all, this is one film that will become a Milestone for Washington and a recommended movie for anyone looking for an extraordinary movie for our time. ****"

","Much as I like thrillers, especially films involving planes, I was disappointed in ""Flight"". This was not much of a thriller - not much suspense here. Without resorting to spoilers, let me simply say that I found the plot riddled with clichés, and oversimplified improbable situations. In particular the ending was so banal, so neatly tied into a pretty ribbon, that it ruined any saving graces the film had for me. Perhaps I am too cynical, or too unfamiliar with the effects of alcoholism to be that sympathetic to the ""hero"". This film left me with the feeling that it could have been much, much better. Nevertheless, having said that, kudos to some good (but not stellar) acting, although it was hampered by unfortunately weak writing and and even weaker plot. The plane crash was the best film portrayal I've ever seen. Fearful flyers, be forewarned!"

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>""Flight"" is a great movie. Terrific performance by Denzel Washington and great supporting stuff from all involved around. This is a movie making at it's best. The opening sequence is breathtaking and also it has amazing production. Flight, a terrifically exhilarating film, hits all the right notes as a thriller and as a complex drama. A large part of the praise for this film goes to Zemeckis' professional direction (hey, this guy's roots are in Lithuania!)<br/><br/>Not usually we see great addiction dramas with performances like in ""Flight"". Outstanding, A must see."

","Flight brings two talents under one roof- Robert Zemeckis and Denzel Washington and when you hear their name out , you can exactly expect a wholesome entertainment with some power packed performance and superb direction.<br/><br/>Known for his alcoholic addiction , Whip Whitaker(Denzel Washington) fights the case for which he is accused of crashing an airplane and killing 6 people on board.<br/><br/>After a long time , Robert Zemeckis returns to reality cinema , taking break from live-action animation movies, and gives us a path breaking film never attempted before. The premises of the movie about a pilot doing justice by saving 100 people on a plane but is unable to save himself is the highlight. Opening scenes have been directed gallantly with plane crashing scene to be among the best ( similar to the Cast Away plane crash scene). From high-octane action sequence , the film divulges into series of drama which has been performed very well by Denzel Washington and rest of the star cast. Couple of scenes still embedded in my mind after I left the theater. The scene where Washington tires had not to consume alcohol , the court room drama where he finally confesses to be alcoholic has been excellent. It is always wonderful to watch Robert Zemeckis movie and this one stands no different. The director has excelled in his cinema and result is fruitful. Screenplay is tight keeping you engrossed. Art direction is amazing. Dialogues are well-written. Cinematography is breath-taking. Editing is fine. Denzel Washingtion gives in yet another knockout performance. The actor is so natural that he smoothly fits in the role of Whip Whitaker. It is hard to imagine anyone else doing this part. Watch out for him in the climax where he meets his son. He is excellent.<br/><br/>Flight is one of the best movie i've ever seen. Given a chance , I can watch it once again. Highly recommended 4.5/5"
"johnnyinmtl","6","2","4","24 December 2012"," A good film. NOT great. NOT awesome. NOT perfect. NOT his best performance.
","I enjoyed this film. Really. But to place it as high as many reviews here do simply does not make any sense to me. When I go see a film I want to be entertained. It doesn't have to be simply random violence. It doesn't have to be full of sex. It doesn't even have to be a true story.<br/><br/>Without giving away any spoilers I find the film comes across with a very simple and overused formula. Man with addiction. Man causes death. Man struggles with addiction. Man can walk away from the incident without harm, but man decides to be noble at his own risk of harm. Quite boring actually.<br/><br/>Like I said. I enjoyed the film. It could have starred ANY other and even unknown actors and it would have been the exact same. The stars in this version did not add anything in particular that would make it memorable.<br/><br/>I am a big fan of Denzel, but his portrayal here is nothing spectacular as to when I compare it to most of all his other films. It was just fine.<br/><br/>Go see it, but do not expect the hype that this film seems to get."

","The plight of ""Flight"" could have been more focused on the disaster of an airplane going down in fuels and how it impacted the crew and the passengers, in more of the ""disaster"" genre category. But I am glad that renowned Director Robert Zemeckis kept the movie more focused on depicting one man's denial of his profound alcohol dependency problem. And no, this movie is not a sequel to Zemeckis' ""The Polar Express"" so you can take out ""The Polar Beer Express"" as a title that could have worked. Anyways, that man is airline pilot Whip Whitaker piloted to perfection by the great Denzel Washington. Whip likes to whip it good on the bourbon, whiskey, beer, vodka, and the occasional line of cocaine. The only problem (actually, not the only problem) is that Whip gets a potential whipping when its revealed through toxicology reports that he piloted a plane more than legally drunk that took the lives of six and injured many, including Whip. The first portion of ""Flight"" is on how Whitaker was able to maneuver a defected plane from crashing; and due to his expert piloting skills, he was able to land the plane in an open field even through its rough landing. But when you are high in the skies as a kite, and you are drunk as a skunk in the pit, it's just not a good thing. After the crash, Whitaker befriends a heroin addict Nicole in the hospital where he is staying due to his injuries in the crash. Nicole is a ""down & out of luck"" woman who has no one else to turn to; that is until Whip takes a liking to her and invites her into his own cockpit, I mean secluded farm home of course. Whip is in a whip of trouble due to the negligence of piloting the plane drunk, so his lawyer buddy Charlie Anderson contracts the services of Union Counsel Hugh Lang so he can Lang I mean land himself out of this mess. Zemeckis takes some great shots of ""Flight"" in focusing on a man's constant denial of his alcoholism even though the protagonist's dire situations get worse and worse. And that is what maneuvers ""Flight"" into authenticity, even through a bit of predictable forecasting of how it all turns out. Kudos also goes out to Zemeckis' co-pilot, who would be Screenwriter John Gatins for his strong scribe of ""Flight"". Denzel Washington's starring performance is one the best of his stellar career, and should land him yet another Best Actor Oscar nomination. John Goodman yet delivers another show-stopping supporting acting performance as Whip's drug dealer pal Harling Mays. And the rest of the supporting thespian crew of ""Flight"" was not half bad. Kelly Reilly was solid as Nicole. And veteran actors Bruce Greenwood and Don Cheadle added more to their impressive thespian resumes with their legal & good work here portraying lawyers Charlie Anderson and Hugh Lang. Oscar-winner Melissa Leo was sturdy in her brief role as a hardball investigator. ""Flight"" is not dead on arrival and in the ends in departs into a satisfying trip even with the heavy subject matter. So book your next cinematic trip on this ""Flight"". ***** Excellent"
"Hellmant","9","2","4","5 December 2012"," Denzel Washington gives one of his best performances to date!
","'FLIGHT': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Denzel Washington gives one of his best performances to date in this dark and disturbing drama about an alcoholic airline pilot who saves nearly a hundred people from dying in a plane crash but then faces possible charges of negligence due to substance abuse. It was directed by none other than Robert Zemeckis (who hasn't directed a live action film in 12 years or an R-rated one in 32 years) and written by John Gatins. It co-stars Don Cheadle, Bruce Greenwood, Kelly Reilly and John Goodman. The music was scored by Alan Silvestri (who is a constant partner of Zemeckis). The film is intense, frustrating and extremely depressing at times but it's also inspiring in important moments as well. Washington's performance is definitely the highlight of the film. <br/><br/>Washington plays Whip Whitaker, an extremely skilled veteran airline pilot who also has a substance abuse problem. The night before a big flight to Atlanta Whitaker stays up most of the night having sex with a flight attendant from his plane (Nadine Velazquez) and drinking an excessive amount of alcohol. He does a line of cocaine to wake himself up and then has a couple more shots of vodka while in flight. The plane suffers from turbulence upon takeoff and then has a mechanical malfunction towards the end of the flight. Whitaker manages to keep the plane from crashing (through some amazing piloting maneuvers) and saves all but six lives on board. A toxicology screen finds the alcohol and cocaine in his system and an attorney, named Hugh Lang (Cheadle), makes it his mission to keep the blame of the crash off Whitaker. The stress only drives Whitaker into drinking more though as his life spirals out of control. His new romance with a fellow drug addict (Reilly) is the only thing which keeps him sane. <br/><br/>The movie is extremely hard to watch. It really drives home it's message about what it's like to be depressed and suffering from addiction. It's frustrating to watch Whitaker dig a deeper and deeper hole for himself while still rooting for him (despite his shortcomings). It's interesting to see Washington play a somewhat unlikeable and extremely flawed character again and still manage to make the audience care for him so deeply. Zemeckis's directing is once again topnotch, Gatins screenplay is brilliant, the supporting cast is all effective and Silvestri's music works magic once again as well but it's Washington's performance that really makes the movie work. He commands every scene he's in and makes the movie a near perfect dark but thoughtful character study. He definitely deserves all the critical praise and award recognition thrown at him.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne8a_WCFo3A"
"atank678","8","2","4","5 December 2012"," About a troubled Pilot who can't get his life in order.
","Academy-Award winning actor Denzel Washington portrays one of his more complex characters, William ""Whip"" Whitaker, in the new movie Flight. Washington takes you through the life of a first-class pilot who is under the influence of the demon drink. Flight took me on a wild ride, taking dramatic and unexpected turns throughout the story. The power of Washington's performance coupled with the dramatic twists of director Robert Zemeckis makes Flight one of the best movies of 2012.<br/><br/>Whip Whitaker is a top-of-the-line ex-Air Force pilot. However, in the opening of the movie, Whip wakes up with a younger woman and it appears they did not get much sleeping done. It is presented immediately that Whip has his family troubles as he is on the phone with his ex-wife arguing over financial issues with her and his son. Even after a morning of drinking and drugs, Whip pilots a commercial plane full of over 100 passengers. During the flight scene, I was taken through one of the most extreme and wild rides I have seen in cinema. The booming explosions and screeching of the people in the cabin made the crash even more dramatic. The enthralling ups and downs kept me on the edge of my seat and in a whole different world. The flight scene alone is enough reason to see this drama-filled thriller. The camera angles really added to the scene as well. Zemeckis did a good job of getting multiple points of view of the chaos. Whip miraculously lands the plane in breath- taking fashion despite the near catastrophic outcome. Shortly after, Whip is a nationwide hero, but as the crash is looked into, investigators find that things may be more complicated than originally thought. The majority of the film follows the devastation following the crash. <br/><br/>The development of Whip Whitaker and his supporting cast is very intriguing and keeps your stomach churning throughout the movie. The theme of recovery and overcoming adversity seems immanent for Whip, and this battle points back to a moment on the plane when he says, ""I have control."" He said this when the plane was in its moment of malfunction. It was not until I watched for a second time and thought it was ironic how Whip has control of the plane, but not of his own life. Washington's supporting cast was also a superb feature of the film. Don Cheadle portrayed Hugh Lang, the slick lawyer of Whip Whitaker who devotes everything for a man that hardly seems to respect him. Cheadle and Washington had great chemistry as two sides that were fighting the same cause, but also fighting each other. Denzel Washington has a very interesting twist of his character. What I found that was remarkable was that Washington was able to convey a deep and disturbed addict, that somewhere in him had a conscience that told him what he was doing was wrong. In the movie he says the whole time he knows what he was doing and everything was okay, but he let me know that he was in trouble. Despite the drama, John Goodman brought some comedic light to the story. As Harling Mays, the friend and drug supplier for Walt, Goodman played the guy that walks into the room like he owns it. It was as if I knew him on a personal level after seeing him for only a few seconds. The cast may be one of the biggest attractions of this movie. Following Whip throughout his battle is both riveting and heartbreaking. However, at times it can be a little clichÃ©. The idea of a drunken father estranged from his family has been a reoccurring theme in cinema. In Zemeckis' film Forrest Gump he also uses the estranged father theme with the Gump father, and the father of Jenny. When I saw Whip confront his family, it felt like a scene that has been done before. Overcoming the struggles of alcohol, drugs, and even lying has been done many times. Washington's portrayal of Whip Whitaker should be nothing short of award winning. The movie however may not have grossed as much as expected as it came in 2nd in the box office behind the Disney film Wreck It Ralph. It made just south of $25 million. This fell below my expectations as it was also advertised as one of Washington's best performances. Despite the fact that there are moments that are relatable to other movies, Flight is a movie that I would recommend to anybody who appreciates Academy-Award winning movies. Washington's job with Whip is impeccable. Flight is now in theatres and is rated R for drug and alcohol usage, language, and sexual/nudity scenes."
"nickmesafilms","9","2","4","3 December 2012"," Flight (2012) - Denzel! Denzel! DENZEL!
","""Flight"" is the film that marks the long-awaited return of acclaimed director Robert Zemeckis, known as the man behind classics such as ""Back to the Future"", ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"", and ""Forrest Gump"", making it his first live-action feature since ""Cast Away"" nearly 12 years ago, after becoming involved in some motion-capture work. ""Flight"" stars Denzel Washington as Whip, an alcoholic, and divorced jet airplane pilot who is forced to take dramatic matters in his own hands, after some mechanical failure occurred on the plane, sending it into a nose-dive. But, Whip was able to accomplish this great miracle, by rotating the plane upside-down while going for an emergency landing, to prevent the plane from crashing. Almost the entire majority of people on the plane survived, while a few died, but he is now looked as a hero to the public, praising him for his work. But, on the dark side, what the people might not know is that he's mostly a booze-loving alcoholic and a liar, who was separated from his family, living a rough life on drugs and booze, living a very dark life. But, that's when a certain investigation starts to happen. People were wondering many certain things: Was he feeling okay during the flight? Was there any alcohol involved? Was he drunk on the flight? What actually happened? If his toxicology report states it was true that he was drunk on the flight, considered responsible for the deaths of the 4 or 5 passengers, he'll be sentenced to a full life in prison. After a brilliantly filmed opening plane crash, the film then suddenly turns into a realistic life drama about this one man trying to quit this alcohol addiction, trying to fix different stages in his life, trying to put it back together, and trying to keep himself away from this problem he has. Do we have an Oscar contender, here? Denzel Washington is that rare actor that is always never taken for granted. It doesn't matter if a movie he's in is either bad or good, but he always deliver a perfect performance, no matter what. But, compared to his Oscar-winning work in ""Glory"" and ""Training Day"", ""Flight"" is no exception. This is one of the best, and one of the most challenging performances that Denzel has portrayed on screen. While doing a good job in holding in all his emotions, he perfectly portrays a real-life broken character that needs fixing in his life. It's an excellent, and jaw-dropping performance that will hopefully score him another Oscar nomination. John Goodman, Kelly Reilly, Bruce Greenwood, and Don Cheadle all nail their supporting roles in the cast ensemble. Goodman, especially, having one hell of a year, delivering one great performance after the next. Last seen as the real life John Chambers in the film ""Argo"", Goodman is even more funnier in this film playing Whip's partner-in-crime, providing Whip with certain things that will help him live through the moment. Although he only appears in three full scenes, without any development to his character, he still nails it in this movie. Kelly Reilly plays a drug addict who befriends Whip, as they help each other through their own life issues. Unlike the other characters in the supporting cast, Reilly's character isn't really fleshed out well, and I didn't think that her storyline felt quite finished, but she still provides good work to the material, though. Directing his first R-rated picture in over 30 years, Robert Zemeckis adds tons of unique charm and style to this 139-minute drama. His choice of soundtrack, the way he knows how to work with his actors, and most importantly, he knows how to take a harsh and realistic topic, and execute it in such a way that no other filmmaker like him can do. He sometimes makes you forget you're watching a movie, but instead, you're looking at the real world, through the eyes of a damaged person. I believe that the title of the film, ""Flight"", means so much to what the movie is trying to teach. The movie is not really about the flight that starts everything, but it mostly means that Whip has gone through so much in his life, and he tries to flee himself from this alcohol problem he has. In the very end of the movie, when he reveals the truth to the public that he was drunk on the flight, and being sent to jail, he delivers a moving and heartwarming final monologue that really set the tone of the movie. ""Flight"" is one of the most memorable movies of the whole year, from the stunning performances, flawless directing, and the incredible message behind it. It's impossible to not tear up at the end of the film, and walk out with a giant smile on your face. ""Flight"", in my review, ""a stunningly realistic addiction tale, brilliantly executed and thought-provoking""."
"caiged","6","2","4","7 November 2012"," Interesting but a little long in the tooth
","First off, whoever made the trailer for Flight should be slapped in the face, and then fired... It certainly would have been nice to have experienced first hand how Denzel Washington's character averts a mega disaster. Even though the trailer ruined the surprise it doesn't reduce the heart thumping moments of the airplane scenes.<br/><br/>Flight is mostly interesting but it is also quite long and if you're one to fidget the time is going to go by slowly. It tells the story of a flight captain averting a major air disaster and concentrates on the consequences afterward.<br/><br/>This movie relies on two things: Denzel Washington and the special effect. Both deliver but it's the effects that get the nod because you can barely tell, if at all, when it's all blue screen. My heart was thumping wildly in the beginning of the movie, as if I was in the plane. Amazing stuff.<br/><br/>Denzel succeeds too, that is if you want to loathe his character, who's essentially a selfish scumbag, and a drug induced alcoholic to boot. It's interesting that Robert Zemeckis went down the path of having a lead in such a negative role. Washington is in great form, as a charmer and as someone in denial.<br/><br/>It's a decent movie to watch, especially if you're in the mood for drama. Action hunters should avoid it, unless you're a Denzel fan. Just beware that it does drag at times."

","FLIGHT (2012) ***1/2 Denzel Washington, Kelly Reilly, Bruce Greenwood, Don Cheadle, John Goodman, Melissa Leo, Tamara Tunie, Nadine Velasquez, Garcelle Beauvais, Justin Martin. Washington gives a superb performance as a barely-functioning alcoholic pilot whose heroic act of saving his airliner from a catastrophe leads to an criminal investigation and has him on a path of salvation or self-destruction. With the unlikely aid from recently sober heroin addict Reilly (sublimely perfect) a fellow traveler and questionably moral support from colleagues (Greenwood as an airline rep and Goodman as Dr. Feelgood enabler), Washington's troubled anti-hero has some stumbling blocks to overcome: namely himself. Craftily and cannily directed by Robert Zemeckis (welcome back from the dead zone of motion captured animated crap) and an unorthodox screenplay by John Gatins incorporates state-of-the-art CGI (one dilly of a plane crash-landing) and moral turpitude."
"the_grand_lebowski","8","2","4","4 November 2012"," Come Fly the Friendly Skies with A Drunk Pilot!
","Robert Zemeckis returns to the world of live action film with Flight, the story of a plane crash that has grave consequences for the pilot. Denzel Washington embodies Captain Whip Whitakerâ€”an alcoholic whose life was spiraling before the accidentâ€”in a harrowing performance. Flight is a tense character study that will resonate with addicts, and impress audiences.<br/><br/>When we first meet Whip, he has just awoken from a bender. He is disheveled, sluggish, and recovering from a night of ecstasy with a member of his crew (Nadine Velazquez). The room he inhabits at a cheap motel is completely in shambles, similar to the present state of his life. A snort of cocaine rouses the captain, and sends him off into his element: flying. During the beginning of the flying scene, the audience witnesses the passion which drives this being. Whip is an incredibly talented pilot. He handles himself less than professionally, and his staff is quick to realize it, but the man can fly a plane. A mechanical failure sends the plane into a nosedive, rocketing all the passengers to a sure grave, but Whip commands the situation and brings the plane to a secure landing. However, casualties are unavoidable. The film then details the ensuing fallout from the accident, placing a focused spotlight on the behavior of the pilot and his part in the catastrophe.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington is outstanding as Whip. He exudes such a level of magnetism in this film that it is difficult to dislike him, even when you realize how obnoxious he truly is. Washington is a master of facial expressions: When Whip is thrilled, his smile gleams like sunshine, but when sorrow creeps upon him, the full brunt of pain is evident in his eyes. He is a character drowning in his own disastrous tendencies, and the film is very careful to remain vague on whether or not he will be vindicated. Washington deserves limitless praise for his portrayal, but other actors do actually manage to steal the spotlight, if only momentarily. John Goodman is a wrecking ball of charisma whenever he is featured. Goodman plays Whip's confidante and dealer. He's covered in grime from head to toe and enjoys every moment of it. Kelly Reilly is apt in her role as a former user, who develops a romantic relationship with Whip and strives to pull him from the wreckage of his life. Don Cheadle plays Whip's lawyer to smarmy perfection. He has less than pure intentions, but zero reservations about gaming the system and clearing his client. John Badge Dale shows up as a cancer patient for a brief scene, but he completely steals the show for the few minutes he spends delivering a palpable monologue. This film soars due to the remarkable cast assembled.<br/><br/>Since this is a film about the subsequent events of a plane crash, it would be irresponsible of me to exclude the crash from this review. Zemeckis films the crash in such a manner that you are nervously anticipating the conclusion. To say that the scene is intense would be egregious; the scene is thick with emotion. Dread clings to each twist and shift that the plane makes. The focus is mainly on the plane's cabin, but when the turbulence begins to fling passengers it is difficult to keep your eyes on the screen. Anyone who suffers from aerophobia is advised to arrive fashionably late to a screening of this movie. <br/><br/>The film is very well done. It is certainly not Zemeckis' or Washington's greatest achievement, but is a fine character study none the less. The only grievance I had with the film was its tendency to become unnecessarily preachy. While I'm sure Alcoholic Anonymous is a worthwhile organization for many struggling addicts in the world, the film seemed to fervently promote AA and its philosophy. The film was very subtle in presenting Whip's realization of his faults, so it makes the ham-fisted AA propaganda all the more obvious. Addicts definitely need help: I hope this is the message derived from this film, and not that you need AA to surmount your short-comings.<br/><br/>Flight is quite a spectacle. It is great to see Washington at the peak of his abilities. I hope that he garners some recognition for the extraordinary effort he committed to this role. Flight has a phenomenal crash scene that is terribly gripping, but the fierce unraveling of the film's protagonist is equally severe."

","After opening with one of the most terrifying flying scenes I've witnessed, in which an airplane is saved by being flown upside down, Robert Zemeckis' ""Flight"" segues into a brave and tortured performance by Denzel Washington - one of his very best. Not often does a movie character make such a harrowing personal journey that keeps us in deep sympathy all of the way.<br/><br/>Washington plays Whip Whitaker, a veteran commercial airlines pilot who over the years has built up a shaky tolerance for quantities of alcohol and cocaine that would be lethal for most people. At the film opens, he's finishing an all-night party with a friendly flight attendant named Katerina (Nadine Velazquez) and jolts himself back into action with two lines of cocaine. His co-pilot (Brian Geraghty) eyes him suspiciously, but Whip projects poise and authority from behind his dark aviator glasses.<br/><br/>Their flight takes off in a disturbing rainstorm and encounters the kind of turbulence that has the co-pilot crying out, ""Oh, Lord!"" But Whip powers them at high speed into an area of clear sky, before a mechanical malfunction sends the aircraft into an uncontrollable nosedive. Zemeckis and his team portray the terror in the cabin in stomach-churning style. Acting on instinct, seeming cool as ice, the veteran pilot inverts the plane to halt its descent, and it flies level upside-down until he rights it again to glide into a level crash-landing in an open field.<br/><br/>The field, as it happens, is next to a little church, and the way Zemeckis portrays an outdoor baptism on the ground below captures the hyper-realism with which I imagine we notice things when we think we're about to die. Only six people do die in the crash, and Whittaker is hailed as a hero.<br/><br/>Will this close call bring an end to his drinking? He retreats to his grandfather's farm where he was raised, pours out all his booze and is dry for a time - until he's told by his union representative (Bruce Greenwood) and his lawyer (Don Cheadle), that blood tests show he was flying drunk. A government hearing is fraught with hazard (he faces a possible life sentence). Meanwhile, he is befriended by a woman named Nicole (Kelly Reilly), who he met in the hospital, and she takes him to an AA meeting, but the program is not for him.<br/><br/>It becomes clear that intoxication is more important to Whip than anything else; it cost him a marriage and the respect of his son. One of the most effective things in Washington's performance is the way he puts up an impassive facade to conceal his defiant addiction. ""No one else could have landed that plane!"" he insists, and indeed tests in a flight simulator back him up. The fact remains that he was stoned.<br/><br/>One of the most gripping scenes takes place in a hotel room where Whittaker is being held essentially under guard for the week before his official hearing. At a crucial moment, his drug supplier Harling Mays (John Goodman) turns up, marching toward camera in one of a series of garish Hawaiian shirts, ready to battle a crisis. I don't have any idea if cocaine can snap you back from a killer hangover, but I wouldn't count on it.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington is one of the most sympathetic and rock-solid of actors, and it's effective here how his performance never goes over the top but instead is grounded on obsessive control. There are many scenes inviting emotional displays. A lesser actor might have wanted to act them out. Washington depends on his eyes, his manner and a gift for projecting inner emotion. In the way it meets every requirement of a tricky plot, this is an ideal performance.<br/><br/>Among the supporting performances, Don Cheadle projects guarded motivations, Greenwood is a loyal friend, Goodman seems like a handy medic, and Brian Geraghty's panic in the co-pilot's seat underlines the horror. ""Flight,"" a title with more than one meaning, is strangely the first live-action feature in 12 years by Robert Zemeckis, who seemed committed to stop-motion animation (""Beowulf,"" ""The Polar Express,"" ""Disney's A Christmas Carol""). It is nearly flawless. I can think of another final line of dialogue for Whip Whitaker's character (""My name is Whip, and I'm an alcoholic""), but that's just me."

","Flight is a brilliant, engrossing, well-acted (and very long) movie. For entertainment value, I'd give it 10. But overall, 5. Why?<br/><br/>Pilots have criticised the actual flight and crash sequence for being unrealistic. They have a point. For what must have been a very high budget movie about flying, it's a major fault to not have involved pilots as aviation consultants in ensuring this sequence was more realistic. For example, real pilots apparently do not *ever* get into any kind of smart talk or chat during the takeoff phase; they stick 100% to business. There is also no 'Mayday' call during the emergency. The emergency sequence can well be (and has been) criticised on a technical level, but in terms of movie excitement is second to none. Indeed, it is overwhelming and tear-jerking. I applaud the movie-makers for this, and can excuse most shortcomings on the basis of drama.<br/><br/>The majority of this movie though is stick-to-your-seat non-stop enthralling. What bugs me about it though is the heavy Hollywood narrative. African Americans are the greatest lovers, the greatest aviators, although flawed (like all of us), ultimately the most moral and truthful people. White men, exemplified by the co-pilot, are weak, emotional idiots, or white women attracted to supposedly gorgeous African American men. P-lease! I'm just so sick of this being rammed down my throat no-stop."
"rooprect","Null","0","0","24 May 2019"," Powerful, well-acted drama watered down by a Zemeckisy ending
","All the way until the ending I was eating this up. ""Flight"" is a tense, character-driven drama about a heroic pilot who averts an epic disaster only to be caught in the crosshairs of a long, ugly investigation of his life. It presents a highly complex story, weaving themes of heroism vs. arrogance, good intentions vs. bad results, and bad intentions vs. good results. For 80% of the film, ""Flight"" is on par with the greatest character studies since ""12 Angry Men"". However, be prepared for a less than fitting ending, or at best an ending that was rushed so quickly that it leaves you wondering ""did we miss an entire scene where the ghosts of Christmas past, present & future showed up?""<br/><br/>That's the only negative I have, although it's a big one. For the rest of my review I'll focus on the positives. The biggest positive is, of course, Denzel Washington as pilot ""Whip Whittaker"". He certainly doesn't disappoint. The role is a challenging one: a man whose personal life is a disaster even though his professional life is spotless. His professional arrogance leads him to deny the failure of his personal life, and this is the conflict that makes the film riveting.<br/><br/>Although this film is squarely about him, there were some peripheral characters who really added to the pot. British actress Kelly Reilley pulls of a convincing southern accent (though southern sticklers may spot it as more ""Alabama"" than ""Georgia"" haha) and more importantly gives us insight into the mind of a damaged person who is genuinely trying to better herself, unlike our hero who denies his faults. Another great character, though minimal, is John Goodman who shows up as a bizarre, surrealistic ""fixer"" and adds tremendous color and humor to the show. The attorney for Whip Whittaker is excellently played by Don Cheadle who balances slick legal professionalism with utter frustration at his client's self-sabotaging acts.<br/><br/>Even the action scenes were incredibly done, using a full sized commercial jet cut into sections and hoisted up on a weird contraption that made it flip around for the cameras. This is a first class production from start to finish.<br/><br/>It only falls shy of monumental because of its Zemeckisy ending, a trademark of many 80s directors like Spielberg and Ron Howard where everything has to be neatly tied up in a bundle with a moral ending, even if it seems out of left field considering the characters' personality. But that's just my opinion and the reason why I docked ""Flight"" a few points. You may find it perfect. Regardless I think everyone can agree that most of the film is phenomenal."

Not due to his fault the plane hits some issues and ends up floating upside down before being landed by him, an act for which he is considered a hero. However, upon drug test reposts it is realized that he was indeed inebriated and then the judicial system comes into play. This is a good movie and features a harrowing plane crash sequence.

","Flight is a great example of everything coming together- screenplay, characters, acting and special effects. This movie is about addiction and the main character who happens to be a pilot and a raging alcoholic. So bad is the situation that his wife has left him and his sons do not have an iota of respect for him. Also, he drinks on the plane- a plane he is piloting! The crash sequence is quite jarring and anyone knowing the work of Robert Zemeckis would know he is a master in creating realistic looking CGI sequences. This is a great scene but what follows is equally fascinating. The pilot is brought to the court in charge of manslaughter(he manages to save most but not everybody on board).

And with all those drugs swirling around in his liver, he can expertly maneuver a disabled airplane upside-down (to be clear, it's the airplane that's upside-down.

"dentrex","7","0","0","1 November 2015"," Even Denzel can't carry the team alone
","I've watched it twice. I didn't know what to think the first time.<br/><br/>Such an interesting premise: You have a dangerous job where you are responsible for people's lives and millions of dollars worth of equipment. You know that, as a piece of machinery, anything can ho wrong no matter how many times you check. Parts fail. People fail. Stuff just happens - whether its in an operating room or on a commercial jet.<br/><br/>Here, its of course the latter. Yet the nagging question: Did the parts, the people or both fail? And here the answer is the parts. The part failure shown brought down two real life airliners with grievous loss of life and two trashed expensive airplanes. Yet here, Whip (Washington) shows us what pilots, sober or not, can do in an emergency. I loved the way he played the incident through, so totally on top of everything. I was brought to mind of Chesley Sullenberger's feat on the Hudson River in NY city, no heroics, no drama just fly the plane down as gently as you can. And Whip does it on dry land with only 6 deaths.<br/><br/>Amazing? Yes, and he's hailed as a hero. But he knows he was lucky - as they say, you're okay until you run out of altitude, airspeed and ideas - and he knows he was drunk and high on cocaine too. So it's not as landing the plane was the miracle, the miracle was that in his condition he was able to think the problem through.<br/><br/>This is all so deep, and a hard subject to cover in a film without being trite. But TRITE it becomes at several points. The addition of the female character, for example, who gets and stays clean, tells you right off that some sort of confession or redemption is scheduled. The addition of the John Goodman character really put spice in the film and I dare one of you to tell me that anyone but Goodman could have pulled this role off. He was just so slick, he slid in and out of the scenes and that's amazing considering how incongruous his character is. Perfection! And as it is clear that our hero is going to get off the hook, which he could have done easily - without ANY harm done to any protagonists - he instead gives us a steaming pile of Hollywood horse**** on a silver platter with a candle on it. The following scene in jail is gratuitous, and leaves us to wonder if a better ending would have been for Whip to say ""I don't know"" - which I kept repeating out loud - and when he didn't I knew we were in for the typical studio ending. To heck with loose ends and continuity, right? The son? The Girl? Who what when where .... its not good when you walk away with those questions.<br/><br/>And because of this tomfoolery, completely lost here is the exquisite direction, cinematography and editing. All you film students, this is an exercise in perspective and composition. Zemeckis has a Kubrick like sense of photography - and a great DP, like Kubrick had, didn't hurt. But watchable and yes, enjoyable as it was, it could have been better."

","I expected more. Denzel's acting was great but the story left much to be desired. We could have had a close to real like story but it strayed. It went well until we find Denzel able to drink massive amounts of alcohol and yet still be alive. He was also able to elude the press for days and all the while boozing it up. He apparently had few friends except for Nicole he found while smoking in the hospital. Yes, we see much time in denial.<br/><br/>The role by John Goodman seemed to be an after thought cameo appearance with high billing as the over the top drug provider and friend.<br/><br/>As for the ending, I have never seen a hotel refrigerator stocked with such alcohol and again he would not be alive if he had consumed it all. But we see him coherent after a few snorts of cocaine. Why did the writers do it this way? <br/><br/>It could have been a much more complex closer to real life story of a pilot with an alcohol and drug problem dealing with the tragedy, the press, the investigation, and strained personal relationships."

","The first 20 minutes of Flight are fantastic and riveting. Denzel Washington gives an amazing performance of an alcoholic airline pilot with incomparable flying skills, who gets caught in a sticky situation. The rest of the cast, including Don Cheadle and Bruce Greenwood, are rock solid. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, after the first half hour or so, it begins sliding into a color-by-numbers, overly formulaic script that contains more coincidences, improbabilities, and absurd events than any script should be expected to withstand. Then adds quite a bit of schmaltz on top of it.<br/><br/>I won't give away any details, but will only say that those improbabilities grow so extreme that by the last 20 minutes of the film, it's absolutely groan worthy. And it's a shame, because Mr. Washington gives such a strong performance, and Mr. Zemeckis is a top-notch director. However, it seems that no matter how much the screenwriter or director wanted to do an edgy movie, they both find a way of cleaning it up and sanding down any rough corners."

","Who would have thought that Robert Zemeckis would be capable of making a film of such emotional power? A lot of that has to do with the script and the fantastic performance by Denzel Washington. Kelly Reilly was outstanding too in her role of companion to Whip. Her character is compared to Desdemona in an Othello reference near the start of the film, which is ironic as I had the pleasure of seeing her play Desdemona in a production of Othello in a London theatre. Anyway, Flight is a very powerful, emotional character study of a man who I would call a ""functioning alcoholic"". The reason why I only gave this 9 instead of 10 stars is that the ending felt a bit trite. However, I would highly recommend this film to anyone, the flight scene was amazing and you really felt like you were on the plane about to crash. Watch and enjoy this near masterpiece!"
"brett-donald","6","0","0","6 February 2014"," It's not about a plane crash
","Okay, so my preconceived notions of what this film was about turned out to be totally incorrect. The movie does include a plane crash, but the central story is Captain Whip Whitaker's struggle with alcohol addiction. Overall it was good thought-provoking entertainment, thematically dark but interesting, and I always love watching Denzel Washington work. I disagree with some comments that it was too long; proper character development takes time.<br/><br/>My main complaints are that the film stretches credibility in several areas. The idea that an alcoholic could be a successful airline pilot is scary, although I suppose not impossible. The idea that any pilot could successfully crash-land an aircraft following a mechanical failure of the type depicted in the film is just nonsense, with or without the inversion manoeuvre. The NTSB investigation being pressured by lawyers? I doubt it. The NTSB making statements on causes at a public hearing? Nope. But perhaps the biggest credibility gap is that Whitaker decides to come clean part-way through the hearing ... it's a dramatic device, but too predictable. I would like to know the alternative endings which the team considered when planning the film, because I suspect I would have chosen a different one. Part of the reason I chose to watch the film was Robert Zemeckis, director, but this is not one of his best."
"mgruebel","6","0","0","2 January 2014"," Solid drama
","This film reminds me of solid 1980s TV dramas: the decent man with a drinking problem who saves the day, but whose problem comes to haunt him. The estranged wife and son, the girlfriend who abandons him because he won't quit, the people who manipulate him, the guilt that flares up intermittently and then comes to roost at the bitter end.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington pulls it off well as Whip the alcoholic pilot, and singlehandedly holds the film together through the FAA investigation following a plane crash caused by an 'Act of God', during which Whip, even drunk, saves most souls on board through skilled piloting.<br/><br/>On the downside, the film shares the easy symbolism and predictability of solid TV movies. Speaking of 'souls' and 'Acts of God,' there is a lot of religious symbolism (from a born-again co-pilot to a clipped church tower during the crash), but it fails to provide depth. It's clear at every moment where this one is going to steer, although at least the pilot union man made sure there are only soft drinks in the fridge in Whip's hotel room the night before the big hearing; but of course fate has the door to the adjoining empty guest room unlocked. An FAA hearing brings epiphany, and a sit-down with Whip's estranged son a certain closure.<br/><br/>The R rating is well deserved with all the nudity, drugs and booze, yet the film almost has the flavor of a family movie. In fact, if it were edited for network TV like the old days to remove 'questionable material' as they used to call it, it would fit right in. Tight editing from 130 minutes down to 95 would have brought this up by one star, and make it fit into 2 hours with the commercials added."

","In this 2012 film, Director Robert Zemeckis shows-off his filmmaking chops in the film's first forty-five phenomenal minutes. The plane crash in Flight is spectacular and original. A fresh new take and a welcome addition to the genre, it's unlike any other plane crash I've seen before.<br/><br/>Preparing for its final decent into Atlanta the MD-80 aircraft of Southjet Flight 227 severely malfunctions. The elevator, the hinged wings on the plane's tail stick downward, sending the plane into a steep dive. A disastrous crash is almost certain, but with ace pilot Captain Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington) at the controls, he and his crew pull off a remarkable feat and save hundreds of lives.<br/><br/>After the gripping first act, the rest of film the film is propelled forward solely by Washington who is in fine form, yet despite this, the film mostly drags on. Many long, unnecessary, and awkward scenes could have easily have been cut, and the film would have been better for it. Parts of the back-story of Whitaker's life work great, while others are just too convenient to be believable.<br/><br/>Flight tries to be more than just a plane crash film. The film delves deep into the destruction alcoholism can cause, and also attempts to tackle the question of what it is to be a hero.<br/><br/>While drudging up some very interesting and heavy material, considering the film's length of 2hr 18min, a much clearer statement of intent would have been nice. Since Captain Whitaker is an alcoholic, there is a ton of backlash against him, but the dialogue on the subject of whether or not a drunk can be a hero, is far from concluded.<br/><br/>More reviews at getthebonesaw.blogspot.com"

","Flight on the outset is a movie about an airliner crash and the investigation that follows. The movie however revolves around life of an unstable airline pilot, Captain William ""Whip"" Whitaker who is piloting the plane on the fateful day of the crash.<br/><br/>The character of Captain Whip has been essayed by Denzel Washington who was nominated for the ""best actor"" category at the Oscars this year. Flight is a Denzel movie all the way and he admirably carries the story from start to the end on his capable shoulders. The movie starts with Captain Whip getting up on the morning of the flight, hung over from excessive drinking and doesn't mind sniffing a few lines of coke before a flight, as he says ""to get in line"". The characters around him, some aware of his alcoholic streak and some intimidated by it, take solace in the fact that he is an extraordinary airline pilot.<br/><br/>The first 20 minutes of the movie which depict the crash are extremely riveting and very well shot. The captain (even under the influence of alcohol) exhibits amazing calmness and innovative decision-making trying his best to save the plane. The crash sequence will keep you on the edge of the seat, even if you know what is going to happen and you are in awe of the pilot throughout it. The transition from awe to doubt to sometimes hatred, combined with the idiosyncrasies of Captain Whip is what forms the basis of the plot.<br/><br/>Nadine Velazquez plays a drug addicted single woman who despite needing help herself helps Captain Whip to confront his demons. Don Cheadle as the Captain Whip's lawyer plays a focused man and as always delivers a crisp performance. Bruce Greenwood as best friend and confidant supports brilliantly. The surprise element of the movie was the loudmouthed coke dealer and friend of Captain Whip played by funny man John Goodman. His character is independent of Whip's character and lightens up the mood in the otherwise heavy drama.<br/><br/>Directed by Robert Zemeckis, who we all will remember as the director of Back to the Future series, he makes a mark with this one too.<br/><br/>Flight works on various levels of human relationships, faith, inner peace but for me the crux of the movie was not the obvious, which is the airline crash, but Captain Whip's flight to freedom. A must watch for all Drama lovers."

","Spoiler Alert.<br/><br/>Okay, aside from Denzel's co-pilot who had us laughing our ass off through the plane crash sequence, the movie is not that bad. This is NOT the movie pitched in the trailer. If, like myself you're thinking you're going to see a big scale Zemeckis action/adventure - throw that idea out the window and picture instead Nicolas Cage in Leaving Las Vegas - aside from the shopping cart full of booze, there are few differences.<br/><br/>Zemeckis, I understand the narrative requirement that Denzel be cool and calm and in control when the plane is going down, contrasted with a more panicky co-pilot - BUT, an eight year old girl would be less panicky than the one played by Brian Geraghty. I cannot possibly imagine that at the screenings there weren't others laughing like us and not sure why Zemeckis let it through. The first three times he squeals like a ninny you let it go as it seems to be a serious film. But the eighth time you can't help but burst out laughing. EVERY time the plane makes a move in the final minute of the crash sequence he squeals like a stuck pig. Does a guy like this EVER make it through flight school? Okay, the plane crashes, then its basically two bloated hours of Denzel getting wasted sucking on bottles of Vodka and getting his ass saved by an even more inebriated John Goodman ( not sure how many 60 year old 300lb coke addicts are alive but this one is Denzel's right hand man ).<br/><br/>If I would have read reviews first I probably wouldn't have seen this film. I don't really like Denzel and the only reason I saw this was because I love Zemeckis ( I forgave him for the snooze-fest 'Castaway' ). The movie plods along and is actually kind of boring but the next day or two Denzel's performance really sits with you. He may win as it is very difficult to play drunk and he's drunk for all but a couple of scenes.<br/><br/>Major continuity gaff is in the prison scene where Denzel addresses a group of prisoners about sobriety - he's wearing a big gold chain and watch. Ridiculous there isn't ANYBODY on set on a Hollywood movie with an Oscar award winning Director and Actor who didn't notice this. Fire someone."

","Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington), a former pilot in the Navy, has an early flight after a long night of drinking with flight attendant, Katerina, Marquez (Nadine Velazquez). After finishing a beer and doing a line of cocaine, the two get ready and leave to catch the flight. As Whip boards the plane, he asks Margaret (Tamara Tunie) for a cup of coffee and two Advil. Co-pilot, Ken Evans (Brian Geraghty) appears worried about Whips condition to fly, as he warns him that it is close to departure time. Shortly after they take off, bad weather kicks in and the plane and passengers experience severe turbulence. When Whip announces to the passengers that the bar service will be suspended for the flight, he pours two bottles of vodka in his orange juice, then returns to his seat and falls asleep. He awakens to Ken frantically trying to regain control of his side of the plane, right before they go into a complete dive. Whip takes control and inverts the plane to level it out before rolling it back and crashing into a field behind a church.<br/><br/>When Whip wakes up he is in a hospital, hooked up to machines and has bandages on his eyes and ankle. He is informed at that time that out of the 102 passengers on the plane, 96 survived the crash. At first, Whip is considered a hero for saving as many lives as he did – soon after, his blood results come back showing that he had alcohol in his system. The airline's lawyer on the case tells Whip that if he cooperates, he could make the blood results disappear. Dispute this, the two empty bottles of vodka were found in the planes trashcan and the question was who consumed the alcohol. If found guilty, Whip could potentially be charged with murder for the six lives that were lost on the flight. With so much going on, whip leaves town to stay at his late father's farm. When he arrives, he disposes of trash bags full of alcohol and flushes all of the drugs on the property. This is where the theme comes into play, which is facing your demons. Throughout the duration of the film, Whip tries to convince his friends, family, and the court that he doesn't have a drinking problem and that the plane did not crash because of alcohol related issues. Although he says this, he is drunk throughout the film and cannot function without the use of cocaine as well.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington nails his performance as an alcoholic in denial. His role in this movie is somewhat similar to his roles in both He Got Game and Training Day. In He Got Game, he plays a father who does not actively participate in his son's life, similar to how he is in this film. In Training Day, he plays the role of a police officer who is involved with drug misuse on the job, similar to his drug and alcohol problem in Flight.<br/><br/>The camera angles were one of the best technological aspects of the film, because they showed the insecurities and vulnerabilities of Whip and other characters, especially during the plane crash and scenes where Whip over drinks. This relates to the theme because you could see the internal pain and struggle associated with drug abuse and other problems. The low-key lighting was effective as well, because it affected the emotions of the audience. The shadows cast from the lighting set a mood of uncertainty and worry. The film ends with Whips court hearing, which he shows up drunk and high to. When asked the question of who drank the vodka found on the plane, Whip will be forced to either face his demons or continue down the path of destruction."

","After spending the entire evening partying with Katerina Marquez (Nadine Velazquez), SouthJet Airlines pilot, Captain Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington), begins his day as usual by abusing drugs and alcohol. He then boards flight 227 en route to Atlanta, where he and his copilot Kent Evans (Brian Geraghty) fly the aircraft despite the harsh weather and turbulence. In mid-flight, the pilots lose all control. The aircraft and all 207 passengers on boards are spiraling to a certain death. Despite all of the circumstances, Whip is able to fly the aircraft upside down and make an emergency landing. Whip awakes in a hospital to see an old friend Charlie Anderson (Bruce Greenwood) whom complements Whip on his piloting skills and emergency landing. Whip now realizes that his life has been changed drastically. Although Whip may seem like a hero, Charlie Anderson works with the pilot's union and Whip's negligence will be questioned. In efforts to maintain Whip's innocence, Charlie hires a lawyer (Don Cheadle) to evade all of the allegations. While the trial is underway, Whip is tortured with both internal and external conflicts outside of the courtroom. He and his newly acquired and troubled girlfriend Nicole (Kelly Reilly) are forced to undergo trials and tribulations that many addicts endure. Finally, Whip must confront his problems and make an ultimate choice between innocence or freedom. <br/><br/>Flight shows that although ""functioning alcoholics"" may seem to live manageable/successful lives, underlying issues and problems will eventually reap horrible consequences. Much like the film Bad Lieutenant: Port of New Orleans starring Nicolas Cage, the main characters have honorable/heroic careers but they take advantage of the public's trust. They both are responsible for thousands of civilian lives while operating under the influence of drugs and alcohol. Their addictions seem to be much deeper than their control. <br/><br/>The filmmakers of Flight use the camera angles to enhance Whip's internal conflict. In one scene, Whip enters a bar after being many days sober. Whip orders an orange juice, but the bartender unintentionally urges Whip to order alcohol. The camera zooms in on Whip as he struggles to refuse the bartender's offer. The viewers see the pain and lack of determination in Whips' eyes as he relapses into his addiction. The filmmakers also use story structure to contribute to the theme. From the beginning, we see that Whip has a poor relationship with his ex-wife and son. However, the viewers are not aware of how serious the situation is. As Whip begins his descent into addiction, we become more aware of how troubled Whip has been. Finally, Whip starts to contemplate recovery. Once Whip enters into this new chapter in his life, we become fully aware of his problems. <br/><br/>Flight brings the viewers into the life of an alcoholic. As Whip numbs his pain with alcohol, the viewers are also unaware of the seriousness of the situation. However, the film expresses that addicts may seem to have it together, but underneath a false exterior; they are desperate for recovery. Viewers will see just how troubled Whip is, while witnessing the transformation of a human being."

","At the absolute high points in this movie, I was mildly amused - or should I say, not bored. At its low points however, I felt irritated with the characters, exasperated with the story and the way it was unfolding, and generally just not interested. The problem with Flight is that there seem to be more low points than high points.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington plays Whip Whitaker, yes that's his name. It's almost like they put a proxy name in the screenplay drafts and then couldn't be bothered changing it at a later point. Anyway, Whip is a pilot with a drug and drinking problem. If you can get over the fact that pilots go through extensive physiological, psychological and personality evaluations in 'real life', and as a result it would be extremely rare that a man like 'Whip' would ever be licensed to begin with - you might not mind this movie. I got over that part, I also begrudgingly got over the fact that Whip has apparently had a drinking problem for 11 years, yet it seems he's managed to stay licensed this whole time - completely unlikely as it is.<br/><br/>Seriously - I'd believe this character could get away being a bus driver, but not a pilot bu a long shot.<br/><br/>Then there is the flight sequence, which doesn't even last that long. Now that I think about it, it's good it didn't last that long. This film was supposed to be a realistic drama accomplishment. Yet the flight sequence that basically kicks off the events of this movie is something you might see in an action film written by stoned high school drop outs.<br/><br/>It's hard to enjoy the movie to it's potential when you can't really feel sympathy for any of the characters - especially not Whip. The other characters are all one dimensional. Kelly Reilly plays Nicole, who for poorly explained reasons is also a junkie. Her story is touched on at the beginning but seems to falter near the end. Probably for the better, she was a character with an inconsistent background and the movie was already 2 hours long.<br/><br/>The story is a mess and many plot points are not explained in detail. They are just briefly skimmed through in the hope that audiences would get the gist of it by themselves. The point of the story is completely lost on me though. This is not a character study as other reviewers would have you believe. Why? Because most of the characters are only touched on briefly - ""Hi I'm Whip, I'm a Pilot, and I like to drink"". That sums it up, so how is that a study of a complex character? It's also not an exploration into addiction, because the characters addictions in this film are painfully one dimensional - ""I'm an addict"" - OK, why? What made you an addict? What made you decide to stop?.<br/><br/>If the 'point' you were trying to preach to us for 2 hours was that addiction is bad - you could have tried with a little less cigarette and alcohol product placement. By a little less, I mean cut down from having brands appear every 2 minutes, to every 5 minutes or something. <br/><br/>The ending is painfully forced on us. Throughout the film, Whip is convinced that his drunken state didn't cause the crash, and goes out of his way to harass people into relaying the same thoughts to interviewers. Yet at the end, he tearfully admits he was drunk so as to avoid having a (dead) stewardess who he had a relationship with be painted in a negative light. I mistakenly took this same stewardess for a hooker at the beginning of the film due to their lack of chemistry. Whip didn't seem to care for her either, yet if you watched the ending without seeing the first 5 minutes of this film - you would think he was deeply in love with her.<br/><br/>While Flight doesn't crash and burn, it doesn't ever really soar to it's potential either."
"CelluloidRamblings","8","0","0","3 February 2013"," Flight soars
","After almost 10 years of fannying about with motion capture technology, Robert Zemeckis returns to live action with Flight, a tale about a plane crash and the subsequent investigation into the pilot of the ill-fated crash. Said pilot is an alcoholic, which as you can imagine is where the majority of the drama spins from.<br/><br/>If anyone knows how to make great blockbuster entertainment, it's Zemeckis. The man is responsible for Back to the Future and Who Framed Roger Rabbit but also some fine Oscar- bait in the form of Forrest Gump and Cast Away. Flight somewhat melds both sensibilities, being in some instances a terrific adrenaline-fueled spectacle whilst also being unashamedly dramatic. Much like his previous work, special effects are fully exercised to their potential but more importantly grounded firmly within the structure of the story, the air crash never quite being the centre of the movie. <br/><br/>The centre of the film comes in the form of Denzel Washington, an alcoholic, cocaine- snorting womaniser, who is found at the scene of the crash with alcohol in his blood. What follows the initial roller-coaster of the disaster is a more low-key depiction of his troubled psyche. His fragmented family life, his alcoholism and his uncommunicative nature are all portrayed with a delicately which makes this a cut above the rest in terms of blockbusters. On the other hand, Kelly Reilly's character verges on the 'pointless sub-plot' category, her caricature of a heroin addict contradicting the otherwise convincing dramatisation of addiction. Thankfully, the remainder of the supporting cast make up for it; Don Cheadle and Bruce Greenwood playing their roles with enough understatement to let Washington shine through, and John Goodman popping up every once in a while to provide laughs and take the lime-light off Denzel.<br/><br/>Flight can best be summed up as an above-average blockbuster with a terrific performance at its heart. It surprised me with how serious it too itself whilst still lacking pretension. Highly recommended."

","The movie bears a very relevant theme, needless to say.One would be forgiven for getting taken aback on realizing that most of the action features the aftermath, the inquiry into the pilot's conduct during the days before the actual flight and during the flight.Having watched Denzel in such a high-powered role as his in Training Day, one would have expected a similar act. Suffice it to say that the plot can hinder the full expression of an actor's capability, much like The Manchurian Candidate obscured Denzel and let Meryl Streep have all the ascendancy.<br/><br/>The flight scenes are nail-biting and exhilarating, making the rest of the movie a denouement of sorts.It's almost as if the movie begins proper after the crash-landing. Granted, just as nobody else could have landed that plane the way Whip did, nobody could have portrayed the action the way Denzel did. <br/><br/>This overburdening dullness that engulfs the movie all the rest of the way is atoned for by the theme of addiction, which by itself is quite a sombre theme, almost in sympathy with the bleakness. The only bright moment is borne by the surprise ending when Whip confesses to being an addict, admitting that he was high three days prior to the flight, on the morning of the flight, and that he drank the two vodka bottles on the flight, capping it all up by saying that he was drunk even then during the inquiry hearing.The last scene is a desperate attempt at coaching the audience; the movie should have just ended with the prison scene."
"MattJJW","7","0","0","3 February 2013"," Highly entertaining, if implausible story of a brilliant pilot battling with alcoholism.
","*spoilers*<br/><br/>Denzel Washington puts in a solid performance as Whip, a brilliant but flawed airline pilot, in this tale of a man trying to make peace with himself.<br/><br/>Within five minutes of the film starting, we've pretty much got the low-down on the darker side of his character – Whip is an air hostess banging, coke snorting, alcoholic with a failed marriage. His has a couple of redeeming features, mainly an easy charm, and his ability to land an aircraft upside down, after it suffers a catastrophic mechanical failure.<br/><br/>The early scenes of Flight, leading up to the air craft crash landing in a field, are white knuckle stuff.  This is one film you definitely do not want to catch on an in-flight entertainment system.   After he saves the lives of most of the passengers, in a seemingly  implausible air born manoeuvre, Whip wakes in a hospital to find the authorities have already carried a blood test, and are likely to find him guilty of flying while under the  influence, and of the manslaughter of the five or so passenger and crew that didn't survive the crash. The remainder of the film centres around him trying to straighten out, and face up to his responsibilities.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington puts in an accomplished performance, and while gaining an Oscar nomination, it's not likely to rob Daniel Day-Lewis from taking home the silver ware come late February.  He's ably supported by Don Cheedle and Bruce Greenwood, as the lawyer  and union rep trying to keep him out of jail.<br/><br/>John Goodman makes a barn storming appearance as Whip's drug buddy, and seems to have wandered in from an entirely different film. While I love John Goodman, it was at this point that I started to dis-engage from the film emotionally – one minute you're being asked to sympathise with Whip's plight, the next you're plunged into an Argo meets Big Lebowski mash-up.<br/><br/>Overall, it's an entertaining ride, ably helmed for the most part by Robert Zemeckis, but veers into a unlikely romantic sub story involving Whip and a Heroin addict in the middle, and is, like many Hollywood films, way too long and a suffers from a very American ending.  For all that, it's a great watch<br/><br/>Mattwhittingham.com/category/film"

","The first 45 minutes of ""Flight"" are breathtakingly good. Sure, the opening scene might have been exhibit A in Jennifer Jason Leigh's reasonable assertion that women are there (in movies)to make the stars look heterosexual. But then the film takes off (pun utterly intended) and those thoughts are lost in the appreciation for the artistry on show, as are the thoughts that questioned a modern airliner's ability to survive inversion. Did you see the TU144 accident at the Paris airshow? And then we reach the (Samuel)Becket-like scene in the hospital stairwell and you're wondering why this film didn't make history. The answer comes quickly as we watch Denzel Washington descend into a cartoon character of an addict and stay there for the next ninety minutes. Hollywood (and America) will probably never get over its obsessions with addiction and redemption but everyone needs to find a new way of expressing it. The final scene in which Denzel tells a group of fellow-inmates that being banged up for ten years is the best thing that could have happened to him is beyond ridiculous. The sad thing is that there was a great film to be had here. The exploration of the tension between the various vested interests after an air crash as well as the real moral dilemmas posed were touched on but never explored. Business as usual for mainstream Hollywood. Shame on you all."

","I thought this film was going to be about the moral issue of drunk pilot saves the day, so is he a hero or not? But it wasn't. It's about alcoholism and how it will destroy your life. The flight part of it is just meant to be some kind of metaphor for the need to flee, escape, to fly away from your problems, I guess. Just as drugs are, or religion being used as an excuse of what happened.<br/><br/>In a way that's the thing that this film said to me, whatever your fix, alcohol, heroin, God, we all have our own fanatic way of dealing with stuff in life. But it's not very interestingly shown.<br/><br/>I found it quite a disappointing but well made Hollywood take on alcoholism. I think they could have done more with it but chose to really hammer you down with the alcoholism story until you felt fed up with it (a bit condescending) about three quarters into the film. A repeating pattern of promises and disappointments by the lead character that becomes quite boring almost.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington does a great job, but even he can't save the film.<br/><br/>And then there is the end, in a typical Hollywood way, I felt numb and wondering, why I had to watch this."

","I'm a Denzel's biggest fan, I watched this movie with high expectations, but unfortunately it was a disappointment ! it contains a message for the alcoholics and the community, but for me, this message was presented in the most cliché way possible. the struggle with alcoholism was fascinated, with a touching and mind blowing performance from Denzel. The story in general was good, but the ending was more like a high- school essay written by a teenager to make every thing good. It was confusing, for me, life doesn't make sense, and there is no ultimate good in it, in this movie, a man, who was really a superhero fell into the illusion of common sense, he made a very stupid decision at the end. The writer can reach to that message in a more clever, out-of-the box way, but he, the writer, intentionally took a direct and a trivial approach. at the end, Denzel's performance was amazing, the plane scenes were very professional, the overall story-line is OK but the ending ruined everything."

First off, Let me say what a brilliant piece of work this is. I was going to put this movie off and wait until it got to DVD because I thought it was going to be one of those movies where all of the good stuff happens at the beginning of the film and the rest of the movie falls flat. I'm glad I took a chance and saw the last showing of this movie. This movie kept me involved from beginning to end! There was not one uninteresting part of this film.<br/><br/>The cast. Victoria Burrows couldn't have done a better job with the casting on this one.

For instants, Whip(Denzel Washington) struggles with his demons throughout the film, it is done so perfectly intense you find yourself talking to him even if you normally don't talk to the screen while watching a movie. Don Cheadle's high profile lawyer part was excellent, John Goodman's I'll be there when you need me part, although he didn't appear in the movie much, was good too.

And that's it! <br/><br/>Ofc, I can't say that movie is boring as hell and that don't deals with every aspect that surrounds addiction. Like, there is no heroic act that can save you from yourself and irresponsible behavior or you can hide truth from everybody, but you cannot hide it from yourself!

They probably suppose to be two persons that represents his two roads, one (Harling Mays) that brings fun and his personal destruction and one (Nicole) that brings love and personal salvation, but they was so dimly described like they was completely irrelevant.

","Bob Zemeckis got a hold on Forrest Gumps' Jenny. That poor little girl who got catched up with illegal things and sadly died from her illness. I think he based the whole movie ""Flight"" upon this character in a way. And then, exploited it. With no less than success, because this is a movie full of human (and machine) mistakes.<br/><br/>Denzel is the man. Absolutely, he's back on the road. Whip Whitaker is the portrait of a pariah, an incidental hero. Despite his good will, he 's not the reliable man, or pilot (though he manages as a brilliant one). A lot of big big struggle. Alcoholism is a harsh reality in our times. ""Flight"" is maybe the best example on screen. An alcoholic portraited perfectly by our man Denzel. It can be very moving sometimes, and I think it is one of the movies you'd show up on an AA meeting. The story of a guy who cannot get rid from his addiction.<br/><br/>As ""Cast Away"", we have the memorable aviation incident. But this is only the beginning. Denzel unfolds a very complex character in search for the booze, and lastly, in search for the truth.<br/><br/>A moving drama with good and bitter elements. John Goodman appears only a few minutes, but he's the relie on a very touching situation. ""Flight"" reveals the hard fight about our very demons, even though you sprinkle the situation with altruistic moves. Even though you are the best man in the world; you have flaws, and those flaws are what you may become. He was not a hero, but after seeing this brilliant film, many people can stop and think about the issue. <br/><br/>Alcoholism is a silent disease, mostly denied by those who suffer it, and by the society. Finally we have a naked truth about it, and it is very welcome on mainstream films. <br/><br/>Sometimes I though it was a little dull in passages, but the whole experience was although, satisfactory. <br/><br/>Because of the issues that are put on screen, the acting of the man, Denzel Washington and more than good supporting roles, I give it an eight. I liked it, very much. And I'd see it again, without hesitation.<br/><br/>Cheers from Argentina."

","After seeing the previews for this movie, it seemed like it was billed as a suspense/drama, with intrigue. Let me tell you that it was none of these things. Flight is a movie about addiction/alcoholism for people with addictions, people in AA, and people in Al-anon or living with addicts. It is nothing more and nothing less.<br/><br/>As movies about alcoholism go, it was as good as any and probably better than most, and if you have ever had this problem or lived with someone who did, you may enjoy it, but don't think for a moment that this movie is about anything else. it is not an action/suspense/intrigue/thriller or anything of the sort. It is a profile of an alcoholic dealing with his alcoholism. The story is exactly the same as every movie on the topic that came before it; only the character's names and jobs have changed plus the budget and actors are bigger.<br/><br/>If you do not have issues with addiction and addiction is not a part of your life, I expect you will find this movie as boring as I did, except for the few minutes in the beginning where the plane takes off and crashes. Don't let the previews fool you into thinking that there is some kind of intrigue with the damage to the airplane; there is not. A screw stripped its threads and that's it. The whole big secret was the alcoholism.<br/><br/>So, I think a lot of people will love this movie, but I am writing this review as a cautionary tale to those people whose lives are not affected by addiction, so that you do not waste over two hours of your time, as I did, watching another movie about an alcoholic who finds redemption."

They also don't really go in depth of how the plane actually started falling until the last 15 minutes, and by then it was really dragging along. Great concept but poor execution. <br/><br/>I felt like I wanted to stop watching at about the halfway mark, but I kept watching. The movie takes off well, but falls flat in the middle. The ending picks back up slightly as our main character takes a turn for the worst. Generally, however, he isn't a very likable character, and I feel that plays a major role in why I didn't enjoy this film a lot.<br/><br/>Is it worth it to see in theaters? Possibly.

When the scenario is repeated in simulation, all 10 pilots who take the simulation fail and kill everyone on board, here's the catch....Whip was both drunk and high on coke when he landed the plane. The remainder of the movie is about that aftermath and from there some may say the movie tones down, some may even find it boring, but me, I thought this was a well-done film. It's Robert Zemeckis' first live action film since 2000's Cast Away, in which he really depended on one actor. Flight hangs on Denzel's performance, which is nothing short of Oscar-Worthy. It's his best work since 2007's American Gangster and The Great Debaters, both for which he was recognized at the Golden Globes but snubbed at the Oscars. Flight at first starts off like this will be a story of Whip's redemption, and it is, but it takes a long long detour getting there....Whip quits drinking and doing drugs immediately after the crash, but then he starts again upon finding out he is being investigated in the crash. Whip's relapse is worse than ever before and I for one was getting mad by near the end the movie because it looked like the movie was going to be all about Denzel beating a major alcohol and drug related rap and doing so in complete arrogance and presumption......however, Whip does the right thing in the end. Whip's alcoholism provides a diversion for the audience to what is inevitable, much like thew way it also diverts Whip from the inevitable if he does in fact do the right thing, that Whip will go to prison. Which is what makes Flight such a great but very sad, movie by the time it is all over. I had tears uncontrollably streaming down my fact at the climax of the movie. Flight draws you in, it draws you in to the messed up life that is Whip Whitaker's played Oscar caliber well by Denzel Washington."

Upon waking up, Whitaker discovers only six people died in the crash and that he is now being hailed as a national hero. However, Whitaker's blood work taken upon his arrival in the hospital reveals that he was drunk and also high on cocaine. Now Whitaker is facing a trial that could put him in prison for the remainder of his life and destroy what little remains of his tarnished legacy.<br/><br/>Flight is truly one roller coaster of a film that gives audiences an insight on the demons of a man who is completely controlled by his severe addiction to alcohol and drugs. The performance of Denzel Washington is the vessel through which we are given said insight. Washington's performance is nothing short of spectacular and should land him several nominations come movie awards season. The thing which makes his performance so great, in my opinion, is that this role differs completely from any of the other characters that Washington has portrayed over the last twenty years. The way he portrays his characters emotions and struggles to overcome his addiction captivated me in such a way that it was difficult to take my eyes off the screen. Also, the film did a masterful job depicting the encounters that Whitaker has with people like his family, lawyer and another addict that he befriends while in the hospital as well as the denial or taking for granted of the help that they offer him was really interesting to watch unfold on screen. Washington's performance is one of the best of the year and is definitely one that cannot be missed this holiday season.<br/><br/>As if you need another reason to go, Flight is also brilliantly directed by Robert Zemeckis, director of Forrest Gump. Flight marks the end of a Zemeckis' ten year absence from directing live action films. Known for his breath taking special effects, Zemeckis has created what may perhaps be the most intense opening to any film this year. The film opens with a breathtaking crash sequence, including a portion where the plane is actually being flown upside down as well as the nerve-racking crashing of the plane in an abandoned field. The crash grabbed my attention immediately and kept me glued to the screen for the entirety of the film.<br/><br/>Flight presents audiences with a disturbing, intense look into what it is like to battle an alcohol addiction. It contains scenes that made me laugh, while at the same time it had several scenes that made me cry. With a great script, brilliant acting, and great usage of breath-taking special effects, Flight is a film that shouldn't be missed this film season!"

It's arguably as riveting as the beach storming opening in Saving Private Ryan. The movie focuses heavily on Whip's alcoholism and substance abuse. He struggles to abstain from drinking even when it made clear to him that it could cost him his job and his freedom. <br/><br/>In the end, Whip does what many will consider to be the right thing, but doesn't really give the reason as to why.

","It's hard to believe that Robert Zemeckis' last live-action movie was Tom Hanks' survival drama CAST AWAY. And that was like 12 years ago back in the year 2000. Ever since then, Zemeckis devoted all his time exploring a series of motion-capture animations with varying degree of success including 2004's THE POLAR EXPRESS, 2007's BEOWULF and 2009's A Christmas CAROL. Now I'm personally glad that Zemeckis has finally returned to his first live-action movie with FLIGHT. At the first glance, his much-anticipated comeback seems like a guaranteed success: FLIGHT has a knockout, Oscar-worthy premise about a disgraced airline pilot who has miraculously landed a heavily-malfunctioned aircraft safely onto the ground, only to find himself being haunted by his own personal demons. Then there's the ever-reliable Denzel Washington in the lead role. And of course, the spectacular opening 20-minute which featured one of the most frighteningly believable plane crashes ever seen in a movie.<br/><br/>In the opening act, Robert Zemeckis starts out well with the introduction of Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington), who wakes up in a hotel room at the American Value Suites while a comely nude woman (Nadine Velazquez) is getting dressed beside the bed. Then we see Whitaker overcomes his morning hangovers by downing an alcohol and snorting a line of cocaine on the coffee table, before he gets dressed up in his flight uniform and heads out of the hotel room. Whitaker turns out to be an airline pilot captain for SouthJet Air and he's actually a couple of hours away from his latest flight, Orlando to Atlanta. Once on board, he still have time to sneak three miniature liquors into his orange juice. Everything seems to be under control, even though Whitaker and his co-pilot Ken Evans (Brian Geraghty) are facing ugly storm ahead of their bumpy take-off. But thanks to Whitaker's quick-minded expertise, he insists they fly through at an overwhelming speed in order to break above the dark clouds. They successfully overcome the danger zone. Then comes an unexpectedly severe mechanical breakdown that sends the plane into a nosedive. Instead of getting all panic, Whitaker quickly made decision by inverting the plane to level out their descent and subsequently forced to crash-land in the field somewhere beyond a church. What Whitaker has done is miraculously enough to keep everyone alive except for the unfortunate six casualties.<br/><br/>So far, so good and credit goes to Zemeckis for the sheer intensity he has successfully created during the opening act. For a while there, the movie is truly an exhilarating cinematic experience.<br/><br/>However, once Zemeckis and screenwriter John Gatins takes a far different direction by shifting the story entirely into an old-fashioned addiction drama, everything starts to become bumpy. As a movie that deals with alcoholism, it's hardly as good as THE LOST WEEKEND (1945) or even LEAVING LAS VEGAS (1995). Problem is, John Gatins' screenplay is awfully clichéd and too melodramatic. At 135 minutes, the movie also feels overlong with too many heavy-handed moments involving Whitaker's on-and-off battle against alcoholism. The movie spirals further in the preposterous third act involving Whitaker's federal hearing with the NTSB (National Transportation Safety Board).<br/><br/>Cast-wise, FLIGHT is actually blessed with a strong ensemble that deserved a few praises. Denzel Washington is coolly charismatic and gritty in his impressive turn as Whip Whitaker. As Whip's love interest, Kelly Reilly is stunning and remarkable in her fearless performance as the heroin addict, Nicole. Both Bruce Greenwood, who plays Whitaker's best friend and Don Cheadle who plays Whitaker's lawyer, are equally fine while John Goodman is top-notch in a perfectly quirky and laid-back performance as Whitaker's drugs dealer."

","For me, finding out that in real-life actor Denzel Washington is, in fact, a devout Christian certainly cleared up much of the meaning behind a lot the bull that prevailed in Flight's flighty story.<br/><br/>If one bothers to pay really close attention to the underlying message in Flight, there can be no denying that this is, in reality, a religiously biased tale that centres around the holy deliverance and redemption of a contemptible louse (sinner) who transforms into a glowingly sober saint.<br/><br/>The one scene of holy pretentiousness that totally killed me was when Wimp... (oops!)... I mean, Whip Whitaker went to visit co-pilot Ken in the hospital.<br/><br/>Even though this dude would never walk again as a result of the plane crash, he beamed at Whip and said that the Lord Jesus Christ had ordained the crash (that killed 6 people) just so that Whip could see the errors of his philandering ways and now walk the path of total righteousness. (Spare me!)<br/><br/>Personally, I thought that Whip was a truly despicable character, from start to finish, who wasn't worth any sympathy or consideration, whatsoever.<br/><br/>And, speaking about despicable characters, I thought that John Goodman as the stinking, loud-mouthed, drug dealer, Harling Mayes (who always had the answers for everything) was a total ass-wipe of the highest order.<br/><br/>This easily forgettable film also lost itself some significant points for its blatant product placement of both Corona & Budweiser beers."

","Whip is the greatest pilot the universe has ever seen. He's also an alcoholic and a junkie. He's divorced and estranged from his ex and his son. He has a relationship with a flight attendant. One day he has a flight from Orlando to Atlanta with a rookie flight officer. He pulls a dangerous maneuver to get the plane out of heavy turbulence. Later he drinks some more vodka from the trays. Suddenly the elevator gets stuck driving the plane into an uncontrollable descent. Whip decides to flip the plane to regain some control and crash lands it in an empty field saving almost everyone on board. Among the dead, his flight attendant.<br/><br/>He ends up relatively unharmed in the hospital. His union representative offers all the support, some goofy NTSB show up for a preliminary interview. First thing he does is call his pusher to supply him with all sorts of goodies. During a smoke break at the hospital stairwell he meets a junkie girl. We've also seen her before, she's down and out on her luck.<br/><br/>Whip leaves the hospital to the family farm, gets rid of all the drugs and booze, visits the girl and takes her with him. The union gets him a lawyer that manages to suppress the toxicology report that shows that he was on alcohol and cocaine the day of the flight. He start drinking again. The girl tries to help to no avail. The union tries to help, to no avail. He starts manipulating the surviving crew to testify that he was alright that day. The day approaches when he will testify under oath in front of the NTSB. Will he straighten out or lose it? <br/><br/>Flight has a very compelling aircraft crash scene and interesting insights by a terminally ill cancer patient, but it has a lot of uncompelling, pointless scenes, too. And lots of loud obnoxious music. Knowing what we know about Whip, it's impossible to root for this guy in any way. Which leaves you without a character to care for. And frankly this movie features mostly ugliness, drug addiction, and lies. It makes pilots, the airline industry, and the pilot unions look terrible. Performances by secondary characters are particularly strong- Bruce Greenwood, Peter Gerety, James Badge Dale standout, as well as Nadine Velazquez's body. I guess, if addiction is your thing, Flight might be worth looking into. Near the end it finally gives you some meaningful lines. Otherwise, don't be fooled by the cast or the semi-interesting premise, Flight is mostly empty and ugly."
"MartianTom","10","2","5","24 May 2013"," Denzel does it good...
","This isn't a film about a plane crash. This is a film about addiction: the horrors, the lies, the regrets, the distortions, the destruction. And Denzel does it so, so well. Take it from an addict who's been there and who knows.<br/><br/>The symbolism at the heart of the film is at once obvious and profoundly convincing. The plane represents Whip's life, and the passengers are the people he takes with him on that journey to his literal and metaphorical rock bottom. Most survive - but a few die. Such is the life of every addict.<br/><br/>Ultimately, it is the story of redemption following acceptance. That acceptance leads to physical incarceration - but it also leads to freedom of the most important kind: freedom from guilt. The freedom that only comes through honesty and a form of spiritual awakening.<br/><br/>'Who are you?' That's the question asked at the end - the question that the movie sets out to explore and answer. It's the question all addicts - if they survive long enough to embrace recovery - eventually have to ask themselves.<br/><br/>I'm so pleased to have seen this film. It's renewed my own sense of purpose in recovery.<br/><br/>The message of the film is very powerful. It gives me hope.<br/><br/>Well done to all concerned - but especially to Denzel. Here's an actor who knows his stuff."
"3xHCCH","6","2","5","16 February 2013"," The Trailer Already Tells Us the Whole Movie Except for the Ending
","The trailer pretty much tells us already what ""Flight"" was all about. An ace pilot saves a crashing plane from a worse fate by a daring yet skillful inversion maneuver. However, as public adulation for his miraculous feat builds up, the pilot had to face investigation for the alcohol and drugs found in his post-flight blood exams. Thus, the question is set up: will he get away with it all or will he own up to his personal demons? That is all that the trailer does not tell us.<br/><br/>I watched ""Flight"" mainly because of Denzel Washington's Oscar-nominated lead performance as the pilot Capt. Whip Whitaker. He deserves this citation because he was able to convincingly navigate the emotions that are eating up this troubled, tormented and broken man. While we admire him for his piloting skill, we also detest him for his uncontrollable addiction to alcohol, the lies he makes up to cover up for it and the personal relationships he ruined along the way. I do not particularly enjoy watching movies about people who destroy themselves, and this is one of them.<br/><br/>Alcoholism had been a favorite subject for Oscar winners, both for males and females, including Lionel Barrymore (""A Free Soul""), Ray Milland (""The Lost Weekend""), Robert Duvall (""Tender Mercies""), Nicolas Cage (""Leaving Las Vegas""), Vivien Leigh (""A Streetcar Named Desire"") and Susan Hayward (""I Want to Live""). Denzel's performance in ""Flight"" would have been a shoo-in to join that illustrious list of winners in any other year, except that this year he was up against stronger nominees.<br/><br/>The Oscar nomination for Original Screenplay was a nice bonus for this production. I thought the subplot about another drug addict Nicole (sympathetically played by Kelly Reilly) was not really too important in the main story arc, and just prolonged the running time beyond two hours. It was also good to see Robert Zemeckis back in a live action film (after ""Beowulf"" and ""Polar Express""), but his directorial style seems to be stuck in the 1990s because ""Flight"" did have a sort-of ""dated"" TV-movie feel to it."
"dbrown1793","8","2","5","21 November 2012"," A Superb Character Study
","Chances are you will not see this film as your in-flight movie the next time you fly the friendly skies. And for good reason, too. The opening sequence includes perhaps the most hair-raising plane crash scene ever, so spectacular that even if you know what to expect, that won't prevent you from crushing your popcorn box from the tension of it. This scene alone is worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>At the wheel of the stricken jet is Captain William ""Whip"" Whitaker (Denzel Washington) who pulls off a landing only less miraculous than the real life exploit of Chesley Sullenberger who landed his own craft in the Hudson River in 2009, losing not a soul aboard. There is one major difference however. Whitaker is both drunk and stoned when he is piloting the craft although his condition is not the reason the airliner malfunctions.<br/><br/>It is the twin truth, acknowledged by all involved (including the viewer,) that Whitaker is both a self-centered alcoholic AND the only pilot with the chops that could have saved the 96 passengers on Flight 227. However, six others perished, including a crew member with whom he was having a fling with, and so the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is called in to investigate.<br/><br/>Despite his heroics, Whitaker is under suspicion for the high level of alcohol found in his system and the two empty vodka bottles retrieved from the airliner's trash compartment. It having been a non-beverage service flight, only the crew is suspect although we had seen Whip empty them into an orange juice container right before the airplane lost control.<br/><br/>As Whitaker waits for the NTSB hearing that will either clear his name or place him in prison for manslaughter, the audience is torn between sympathy and revulsion. Sympathy because he did indeed save the plane and revulsion because he is a classic addict, living a life encumbered by lies and excuses.<br/><br/>What transpires at the hearing and the night before is the watershed moment of both the movie and the life of Whip Whitaker. The subsequent ending, based on what transpires, contains an ambiguity that is both justified and satisfying.<br/><br/>Washington is flawless here, his acting abilities never put to better use. He is ably aided by John Goodman (as a jolly scenery-stealing drug pusher), Don Cheadle as his hard-pressed lawyer and a sweet turn by Kelly Reilly as the waif-like heroin addict who is Whitaker's moral conscience. Melissa Leo appears at the conclusion in a somewhat muted role as the main NTSB investigator.<br/><br/>In conclusion, there are many movies out this holiday season. ""Flight"" is worth the hype as long as you aren't about to board an airliner to spend Christmas with your far-off relatives."

","It's been ten years since Robert Zemeckis made a live-action film, and it's good to have him back! Along with a brilliant performance from Denzel Washington, ""Flight"" is a departure from the director's sugarcoated sentimentality in films like ""Forrest Gump,"" and is an arresting morality tale that explores faith in the darkest corners of the human soul.<br/><br/>Denzel's character Whip Whitaker is an alcoholic airline pilot who miraculously saves a doomed airplane from crashing. While initially hailed as a hero, there's more to be revealed as Whip's personal demons may or may not be responsible for the catastrophe.<br/><br/>Zemeckis goes for a polished yet subdued approach and places the weight of the film on Washington -- who proves why he's one the greatest living actors today. His nuanced performance channels the intensity of Sidney Poitier and the haunting madness of Nic Cage in ""Leaving Las Vegas."" He's very much an anti-hero, and his choices generate the suspense that leaves the audience guessing.<br/><br/>What ""Jaws"" did for the water is what ""Flight"" will do for flying -- and while the crash is a horrifying visual spectacle in itself, the two-punch combo of Washington's performance and Zemeckis' balanced direction keeps this film exciting, awe-inspiring, and a sure thing for awards season."

","From the director of Forrest Gump, Back To The Future, and The Polar Express comes a brilliant drama starring Denzel Washington as a pilot, one day while flying his plane gives out and he is forced to crash land, while several passengers die, he is able to save most of the people onboard. Now, the blame for the crash has to fall on someone and unfortunately he is that someone. From there on, Flight chronicles the aftermath of such a traumatic incident and what effects it has not only on the body and mind, but also the human soul. This is the best story I have seen in an film all year, and considering all the movies I have seen in 2012 that is saying something. You are truly invested in this character, you care about what happens to him, and Denzel brings the characters to life in a way only he can. While Denzel is the one who steals the show, everyone else in the cast do a terrific job as well. And it also helps that they are backed by a smart script that takes its characters in directions that help make their struggles all the more interesting. It is also very dark, yet it is not all up ""in your face"" dark, but when you look past it's surface and just look at it's themes... well you'll see what I mean. It all moves at a good pace so that you never get bored, and you got to appreciate that. Flight in my opinion is truly one of the best films of 2012, I LOVE this film."
"Tweekums","8","2","6","10 July 2013"," The pilot may have saved the plane but he was drunk!
","This film opens in a hotel room where a man is seen drinking and taking cocaine the next time we see him he is boarding a plane he is pilot Whip Whitaker. He takes off through extreme weather and manages to find calmer air before continuing towards the destination. Just as the plane is due to descend something goes drastically wrong leaving it is a steep descent and not responding to the controls. It looks like they are doomed until Whitaker attempts a daring manoeuvre; he inverts the plane to bring it under control before landing in a field. Miraculously only six people were killed and it looks as if he will be hailed as a hero until a routine blood analysis shows he was far too drunk to drive let alone fly a plane. The pilot's union provides a lawyer who believes he can save Whitaker's reputation but it won't be easy as he won't stop drinking. While in hospital he befriends a woman who survived a drug overdose and she tries to help him but he doesn't seem to want help.<br/><br/>Rather unusually the most spectacular scenes take place at the start of the film; the scenes on the plane as it first passed through extreme turbulence then later on when it crashed were pretty impressive and looked pretty real. After that exciting opening things get a bit bleak; Whitaker isn't the most likable protagonist but Denzel Washington, on top form, makes us believe in his character and constantly will him not to drink even though he inevitably does. He is ably supported by Kelly Reilly, who plays drug addict Nicole and by John Goodman who brings some humour to the situation as Whitaker's drug supplier. Overall I'd say this film is well worth watching; just don't expect it to be action all the way!"

","I cannot believe this movie gets above 7 stars. I am a HUGE fan of Zemeckis (Contact was really an awesome piece, not to mention some other memorable ones), I quite like Washington, and I am fond of airplane movies. Regarding the aeronautical side of the story, the accident is simply unrealistic to say the least; plus, the script takes for granted that the audience doesn't understand anything about anything to do with planes, physics, flying and so on. So why bother ?<br/><br/>A crash investigation is not conducted like shown in the movie. Who cares, right ?<br/><br/>Let us admit that, the plot and some of the characters (Goodman) are mere caricatures that I laughed in a few occasions. <br/><br/>The religious insinuations, the idiotic ending and the heavy handed addiction problematic made me wonder how such a good director, a gifted actor and so much money could be wasted on this kind of projects. But, hey ! Looks that a lot of people liked it !<br/><br/>Good for them. Even better for the Hollywood mediocrity factory."

","'It's not what you know; it's what you can prove'. Remember that great line? Denzel Washington said it in Training Day, his last Oscar-nominated (and Oscar-winning) performance, 11 years ago (that long!). It's a line equally relevant in this film, in which he plays Whip Whitaker, an alcoholic pilot who is hailed for a miracle crash landing, but then vilified as his addiction is exposed. <br/><br/>I had my reservations. I thought DW looked again to be masking his genius in another Unstoppable-type debacle, until I found out that Robert Zemeckis, not Tony Scott, was directing. DW has rarely been better. He delivers one of the most visceral portrayals of alcoholism I've ever seen, right up there with Jack Lemmon in Days of Wine and Roses and Nic Cage in Leaving Las Vegas. Booze is filmed in such a way as to seem demonic. <br/><br/>The CGI isn't dominant; merely assistive. The famous inverted plane scene is quickly forgotten; not because it's unmemorable, but because the plot, acting and stylisation smoothly take over. <br/><br/>Some story elements are contrived, for example Whip's relationship with fellow drug abuser, Nicole (Kelly Reilly), and the references to God aren't too credible. John Goodman provides wonderful comic relief as Whip's hippy drug dealer, who's such a good friend that he waltzes into hospital, to the tune of 'Sympathy for the Devil', to supply Whip with smokes, booze and stroke mags.<br/><br/>Don Cheadle has an easy role as Whip's criminal lawyer, as does ex-pilot, Charlie (Bruce Greenwood), who looks exactly like a pilot, both of whom do all that they can to prevent Whip from going to jail. <br/><br/>Zemeckis – that chaste genius behind Forrest Gump, Cast Away and the Back to the Future films – opens with a very unorthodox shot: the heart- stopping naked beauty of Nadine Velazquez, who has a minor role and later a posthumous pertinence. Ostensibly designed to reflect Whip's wantonness, it turns out to be the most titillating opening scene since Philip Seymour Hoffman gave Marisa Tomei a bit of the old canine preferential in Before the Devil Knows You're Dead. It's a cheap shot but why else did I want to watch the film again?"
"DFClayton","10","2","6","14 February 2013"," Flight: ""Paging Capt. Jack Daniels.""
","Capt. Jack Daniels is the term my ground school instructor, a former USAF flight instructor and current airline pilot used when referring to the growing concern of alcohol and substance abuse among commercial airline pilots. Both he and I could never figure out what drove a person to such behavior. That is, someone who gets the fly jets for a living. Pilot, astronaut, or actor is the top jobs kids dream about doing when they grew up. And with training and education almost equal to that of doctors, it's truly a tragedy when someone throws that away. Why? This film won't answer that question for it's not the usual airline disaster movie or anatomy of a plane crash treatment. Although we'll be introduced to lack of maintenance, mechanical failures, and legal finger pointing, the main purpose here is the human story and the myriad of cascading consequences through very strong character development. Denzel Washington who plays alcoholic Pilot ""Whip Whitaker"" shows us very convincingly the struggles and denial associated with his character's addiction. I say convincingly because although I enjoy all his previous work some of his earlier journeys into darkness came off a little ""over the top"" such as in Training Days. But to me this is the first time I believe that ""damn, this guy's got some problems"" as he takes us through Whip's substance abuse journey of: Denial, grief, and finally redemption. Denzel's performance is definitely the strongest but he's joined by an excellent supporting cast who I empathized with as well. As a Sherlock Holmes fan I was delighted to see the pretty blue-eyed redhead, Kelly Reilly sans her stifling Victorian clothing. She plays a heroin addict ""Nicole"" struggling with a heroin addiction as well. She's Whip's love interest from a chance encounter while Whip was recovering from his ""physical"" injuries. Set in the Atlanta area this Brit's southern accent is just right for the ""most northern city in the south."" I was glad to see Nicole get cleaned up just before the ""southern fried hag"" transformation, a fate that (from my observations), befalls many 20-30 something's in the ATL area given just the right cocktail of smoking, drinking, and drug use. That some of the most beautiful women even by my jaded CA. standards can throw away their looks is another mystery in my mental rolodex. Next I was also treated to Don Cheadle in between his Ironman movies to portray legal eagle, ""Hugh Lang."" Bruce Greenwood's ""Charlie Anderson"" is an equally supportive character during Whip's downward spiral. I can't wait to see the next Star Trek's ""Capt. Pike"" performance. Law and Order SVU's Tamara Tunie is the religious Stewardess ""Margaret Thomason."" And John Goodman's ""Harling Mays"" is the good-humored drug pusher with a heart of gold as the dependable go-to person for a variety of non-drug related favors as well. (Check him out in Argo).<br/><br/>My only complaint? The story ends too soon. I'm left with the longing to see more of Whip and Nicole. Does Whip mend relations with his co-workers? Who else remains in Whip's corner besides the inner circle? After all, besides his personal faults which he's punished for, he did save 96 out of 102 lives and was elevated to hero status. However, it's said that to leave questions is more ingenious than answer all of them.<br/><br/>Special Features (iTunes Extras): The plane crash was semi-accurately depicted as the filmmaker's researched and spliced together actual accounts from different scenarios."

","One word reaction: wow. I'm not gonna lie, I went into the theater with high expectations. I had read Ebert's review in which he said it was, ""nearly flawless,"" and I went in expecting a film perhaps not nearly flawless, but excellent nevertheless. I gotta say, Ebert was right. Flight is nearly flawless. It's the best film directed by Robert Zemeckis ever, and the best film to chronicle addiction since Leaving Las Vegas all the way back in 1995, which was my choice for Best Picture that year. It wasn't nominated. <br/><br/>Over the years, I've had a lot of beef with Oscar. I'd say they really started to get on my nerves with their 1979 selection of Kramer vs. Kramer over Apocalypse Now. Most movie buffs recognize Apocalypse Now as one of the greatest films of all time. That's because it is. Two years later we have the same mistake, perhaps an even worse mistake. Chariots of Fire was picked over Raiders of the Lost Ark. The average person does not even remember what the hell Chariots of Fire was, and that's because it wasn't memorable. Many more mistakes were made throughout the 80's and 90's, but touching on those would take forever. In recent years, there have also been a few critical mistakes such as The King's Speech over The Fighter, The Artist over The Descendants, and so on.<br/><br/>Anyway, this is a review for a movie, not a bashing of Oscar, although after getting started, I think I WOULD like to devote a paragraph or ten to ripping those Academy basterds apart limb by limb. But that is a venture for another day. For now, I'd like to touch on some key elements of Flight that made it the excellent film it is. <br/><br/>First of all, we have Washington's performance. Denzel Washington is, in my opinion, one of the greatest living actors, and he shows his best in Flight. If he doesn't win Best Actor this year, Oscar needs a probe shoved up its ass. There I go again. Damn. But, to be serious, Denzel blew me away. His performance is FLAWLESS.<br/><br/>And now I ask you- the reader, what goes along well with a flawless performance. I'll answer that. A great movie, and, ladies and gentlemen, what we have here is a stunning accomplishment in cinema. The story begins with the most heart wrenching and surreal depiction of a plane crash ever caught on film. It is a long seen, but it is not PROLONGED. Ask Goldilocks. It's just right.<br/><br/>Now, you can whine about the idea that Flight leveled out and never reached the intensity it had to start with. Notice how I said ""idea."" That is because the ""you"" in my sentence would be wrong. Flight never allowed me to take a breath. Hell, I had to whiz like a race horse for the last hour and a half, but brain never acknowledged the signals my body was sending. It was too immersed in something beautiful. Flight is truly something to marvel. Denzel Washington is a hero here, not because his character in the movie landed a plane and was called a hero, but because this performance was a true act of heroism. Bravo."
"i-Shuvo","9","2","6","22 December 2012"," If acting was a religion, Denzel is a god
","Denzel Washington is one of the most sympathetic and rock-solid of actors, and it's effective here how his performance never goes over the top but instead is grounded on obsessive control. There are many scenes inviting emotional displays. A lesser actor might have wanted to act them out. Washington depends on his eyes, his manner and a gift for projecting inner emotion. In the way it meets every requirement of a tricky plot, this is an incredible performance.<br/><br/>If it was not for Daniel Day-Lewis, Denzel'd have gotten an Oscar for this in 2013! At least he's getting a nomination and that's one thing I know for sure.<br/><br/>""Flight,"" a title with more than one meaning, is strangely the first live-action feature in 12 years by Robert Zemeckis, who seemed committed to stop-motion animation (Beowulf, Polar Express, A Christmas Carol).

","Let me give you this situation; you're on a plane, everything is going smoothly until the plane begins to fail and suddenly you're on a nosedive down to earth, plunging at an increasing rate. Let's say the pilot pulls off a miraculous move, turning the plane completely upside down, before turning right-side up, making a rough but sufficient landing in a wide open field, that saves your life and dozens of others. It is later discovered that he was severely under the influence that day when flying the plane; would you take legal action, or would you be grateful to still be breathing? That's one of the many moral dilemmas in Robert Zemeckis' Flight, a terrifically exhilarating film, hitting all the right notes as a thriller and as a complex drama. Left to carry a lion's weight of the film, as usual, is Denzel Washington as the plane's captain William ""Whip"" Whitaker, a man who has battled severe alcohol and drug dependency for many years, even losing his wife and teenage son because of his choice to continue drinking heavily. After he manages to miraculously land the seemingly doomed aircraft, he awakens in the hospital to find numerous news stations and people regarding him as a hero. What those people do not know are the behind-the-scenes instances that make up a large part of the Whip Whitaker who climbed into the cockpit to fly that plane.<br/><br/>Toxicology reports taken from all five of the crew members on board the aircraft show that no one had any alcohol in their system except for Whip, who also put two shooters of vodka in his orange juice he was drinking while flying the plane. We see him before the film in a clearly rattled hotel room with a naked flight attendant as he is informed he will need to fly a plane in a matter of hours. Two cocaine lines and a sip of vodka later, he is out the door. The men who go through hell and high-water to hopefully skew this information from getting to the public and helping Whip remain a free man are attorney Hugh Lang (Don Cheadle) and airline union representative Charlie Anderson (Bruce Greenwood). While they're helping Whip more than anyone, the one supplying motivation and, not to mention, some drugs and alcohol is his best friend Harling Mays, played by an enthusiastically lax John Goodman, in one of his funniest performances in years.<br/><br/>The film's main subplot deals with a drug addicted woman named Nicole (Kelly Reilly), who is simply trying to get her life back on track after an accidental heroin overdose that left her nearly dead. One night, she speaks to Whip in a stairwell in the hospital, after both find each other sneaking out for a cigarette as they both exchange innocuous words about their life and why they're here. He serves as not a guardian angel to Nicole, but a person she can keep in her mind who is going through a similar time in their life.<br/><br/>This is Robert Zemeckis' first live-action film since Cast Away in 2000, after tackling monumental motion-capture animated projects such as The Polar Express, Beowulf, A Christmas Carol, and Mars Needs Moms, and without a doubt the most confident, assured work he has done behind the camera since Forrest Gump. Zemeckis takes the five minute scene of the plane crash in progress, rarely turning away from these characters during this time, and completely turning up the intensity and feeling of peril to make the most enthralling sequence of the year. I thought I felt intense and shaken after watching the plane crash in Final Destination and The Grey, and boy did I feel relieved during the plane sequence in Argo, but never have I felt so gripped, riveted, and restless during a scene this same year.<br/><br/>A large part of the praise for this film not only goes to Zemeckis' professional direction but Denzel Washington's sophisticated, nuanced performance as a man trying to cope with internal demons and personal grief. A friend informed me before I was off to see this film that the plane crash would only last so long and then would likely become a courtroom potboiler. What is too marvelous is how Flight avoids that execution but will not avoid that stereotype by those who haven't seen it.<br/><br/>I end on the note that this will be a difficult film to watch for many, many people; some of whom, I believe, will be turned off by the trailer if they were personally effected by addiction or they were effected because of a loved one who had an addiction. Flight pulls no punches at simplifying the process of substance abuse, and certainly doesn't pretend that getting clean is an easy road to go down. It shows its lead character as a deeply troubled man, who falsely believes he has everything under control and believes he, like in the plane, is the one manning his system, when in reality, he's, again, like the plane, on a roller-coaster with no tracks.<br/><br/>To end things and to try and sum this up simply and effectively, Flight is an enormously effective human drama, with terrifying sequences of peril, smoothly conceived scenes of emotion, fleshed out characters, wonderful performances (those by Cheadle and Goodman are sure to go under the radar), and the writing by John Gatins (of Real Steel fame) is extraordinarily sufficient and detailed.<br/><br/>Starring: Denzel Washington, Don Cheadle, Kelly Reilly, John Goodman, Bruce Greenwood, Melissa Leo, and Nadine Velazquez. Directed by: Robert Zemeckis."
"tomsage8877","9","2","6","6 November 2012"," Review of ""Flight""
","Denzel Washington was able to take control of a runaway freight train in Unstoppable and bring it fully under control. In his latest motion picture, Flight, he brings a crippled airliner in for an amazing landing, but has considerable difficulty bringing his own life under control.<br/><br/>And so, frequent fliers are introduced to the world of the alcoholic pilot, when their flight experiences severe atmospheric turbulence just after take off, which knocks something out of kilter in the tail section, and plunges the plane into an uncontrolled steep dive. Despite several vodkas and a line of coke, Denzel as Captain Whip Whitaker, pulls off some extraordinary maneuvers to glide the airliner to earth. <br/><br/>These scenes once again show the skill of director Robert Zemeckis to depict a plane crash with the same realism and restraint that he utilized in Cast Away—superbly edited, believable, and nowhere near the overwrought excesses of the crashes we saw in Scorsese's The Aviator or the 2004 version of Flight of the Phoenix.<br/><br/>Zemeckis has also guided Denzel Washington through this masterful screenplay to one of the finest performances we have yet seen this year. This story has brought out the best in the entire cast, whether portraying lawyers, colleagues, or those lost in the consequences of their many addictions. <br/><br/>I speak of Bruce Greenwood, Don Cheadle, Kelly Reilly, the wonderfully over-the-top John Goodman, straight arrow co-pilot Brian Geraghty, the conflicted flight attendant Tamara Tunie, the cancerous James Badge Dale, and the all-too-briefly appearing Melissa Leo. They all combine to make for the compelling drama which emerges from a truly thrilling and remarkable plane crash, well worth seeing at full scale in theater.<br/><br/>Review by thomasormsby.com"

"SimonJack","7","1","2","13 November 2018"," Washington nails the part of an addict spiraling out of control
","Denzel Washington gives an Oscar-nominated performance as Whit Whitaker in this dramatic thriller. The old adage that driving and drinking don't mix applies even more to flying and drinking - and drugs. Strict federal rules prohibit pilots from drinking alcohol within eight hours of flying. And, their blood alcohol can't be higher than 0.04%. That's half the legal limit for vehicle drivers on roads in the U.S.<br/><br/>""Flight"" is a film with two stories in one. The first and shorter tale is of an airline pilot who becomes a hero by landing a malfunctioning plane and saving the lives of all but six of the 108 people on board. Indeed, all consider it a miraculous event that no other pilot was able to do in 10 simulated tests of the same airborne crisis.<br/><br/>The second is the longer story and is about the life of the pilot, Whip Whitaker. He leads a precarious life. He is divorced, drinks heavily, uses drugs, and has sexual relations with a stewardess about whom he knows and cares very little. He is one angry dude, living an ever increasingly dysfunctional life, and slipping further a further into alcoholism and drug addiction.<br/><br/>As the two stories come together, Whitaker exhibits more and more the traits of an alcoholic. The drinking habits of alcoholics differ widely, but many characteristics of drunks are uniform and common. I'm a recovering alcoholic myself, and know the symptoms, behaviors and effects very well. The biggest and most obvious is lying. A drunk will tell lie after lie after lie. And, of course, deny that he or she has a problem. All the time, of course, the problem grows into more and bigger problems. Active drunks and addicts can't relate civilly or socially. They have short fuses and erupt at the smallest things. Many wallow in self-pity. ""Why is everyone against me?"" becomes a constant lament. Everyone else is wrong, never me.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington plays his part superbly. The only common trait that he doesn't show is paranoia. Instead, his alcoholism is self-delusional to the point of believing that he can drink and shoot up and no one will know the difference. People won't know he's high or drunk. When he confronts the chief stewardess, Margaret Thomason, he says, ""You know me."" He assumes that she knows him for his flying ability at the helm of an airplane. He wants her to attest that he was sober. But she says, ""It's a lie."" She did know him, and knew well that he frequently drank before flights. Whitaker was delusional in thinking that all those who worked around him couldn't tell or didn't know that he had a drinking problem.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't come to a full conclusion regarding the plane crash. The audience is left to surmise that the airline and/or plane manufacturer were found at fault for the crash, due to the mechanical failures. Instead, Whitaker's admission of his drinking problem in the investigation by the National Traffic Safety Administration (NTSA), leads to a quick ending where he is imprisoned for his drinking and drug violations. And, Whitaker finds freedom in losing so much, by finding sobriety with the help of others who are also recovering drunks and addicts.<br/><br/>This would be a good film for young and old to see and understand the devastation that substance abuse brings on lives and families. But, the use of explicit full female nudity in the beginning makes this film suitable only for very mature adults.<br/><br/>The script has an occasional line with wry humor. This seems to be a common aspect of the roles that Denzel Washington plays in many films. Here's my favorite example from ""Flight."" Attorney Hugh Lang (Don Cheadle) drives up to Whitaker's farm. As he gets out of his car, Whitaker comes out on the porch with a shotgun. Lang says, ""You gonna shoot me? Can and I come inside?"" Whitaker answers, ""Yeah, c'mon inside. I'll shoot ya inside."""

","Flight is a great example of everything coming together- screenplay, characters, acting and special effects. This movie is about addiction and the main character who happens to be a pilot and a raging alcoholic. So bad is the situation that his wife has left him and his sons do not have an iota of respect for him. Also, he drinks on the plane- a plane he is piloting! The crash sequence is quite jarring and anyone knowing the work of Robert Zemeckis would know he is a master in creating realistic looking CGI sequences. This is a great scene but what follows is equally fascinating. The pilot is brought to the court in charge of manslaughter(he manages to save most but not everybody on board). Washington is great as the central character. Go watch flight to see a nuanced character study of a flawed individual."

","I think it will neither add nor remove anything out of this movie. Initially, I thought it was going to be about a plane crash but as it went on, this story turned into a very true and moving story. <br/><br/>There were a couple of actings, specially from one of the flight attendants who survived, which I felt kind of too flat and expected. Otherwise, I liked the gist of story and also the behind-the-scenes investigations when there is an plane accident. <br/><br/>Apart from this crash, the whole story line about alcoholism and its consequences was very well developed and it touches deep fibers. I think this is a very didactical movie that can give a lesson to many people who struggle with this disease."

","Despite the safe and uninspiring title, 'Flight' is a surprisingly bold film that is unafraid of taking some big risks. This isn't your conventional, heart in mouth disaster thriller and, although it does contain the odd spell of suspense, it's actually more of a laid back drama and character study about a man battling his demons.<br/><br/>The action is limited to only the first half an hour or so, after which Denzel Washington's character becomes the focus of the film and the storyline develops into something unexpected, though still enjoyable.<br/><br/>As a character study, it's very well executed and never forces one feeling or another about the lead character, allowing the audience to make their own mind up. 'Flight' takes a lot on and not everything is totally clear in parts, but it's definitely worth watching."

The film was nominated for two Oscars. Denzel Washington's performance received praise by many critics, receiving the Oscar nomination for best actor. The film received some criticism from airline pilots who questioned the film's realism. This was a very good film. Washington did a splendid job as expected.

","Denzel Washington plays a thoroughly unlikable airline pilot who flies his passenger-laden aircraft while high on drugs and alcohol resulting in a crash which kills six people on-board.<br/><br/>After his chief executive and the lawyer he hired find out that Denzel was blitzed at the controls of the plane, they both join the Unlikable Club by trying to bury the truth so they can get the pilot off the hook.<br/><br/>Stupid 'only-in-the-movies' stuff includes Denzel flying the airliner inverted (upside down) and the co-pilot opting not to reveal what he knows about the pilot's impaired condition the day of the crash because the co-pilot is a religious fanatic who chooses God over conscience.... SCRIPTWRITER COP-OUT!!! <br/><br/>John Goodman is on hand (again) to over-act as a worthless drug dealer with a comic twist in his performance which fails miserably.<br/><br/>My one most important issue concerning this film is: Why didn't they make it on the level? What's with Denzel having swagger and an irresponsible attitude? Why not portray him as a real character, an airline captain who has a terrible secret? The way they did it, this movie is simply 'comic-book', incredulous, and dumb. It's a real shame.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend, that if you wish to see a realistic film about an alcoholic airline captain, watch 'The Pilot' (1980) starring Cliff Robertson, whom also directed. Now THAT was a realistic movie on this subject."

Pathetic."
"svikasha","8","1","2","19 May 2017"," We need more complex characters like Denzel Washington's Captain Whitaker from Hollywood
","Flight is an enjoyable film about an esteemed airline pilot struggling to overcome the alcoholism and substance abuse problems that have disrupted his personal and professional life. Although Hollywood has produced a number of films depicting substance abuse and addiction, very few have chosen to portray addicts in the manner that Flight does. Both mental illness and substance abuse are widely recognized as epidemic in America. Despite being so widespread, both are widely misunderstood. Even among health care professionals. This is precisely why Hollywood needs to make more films with complex characters like Pilot William ""Whip"" Whitaker in Flight.<br/><br/>Captain Whitaker, played by Denzel Washington, brings back the magic of other ""loose cannon"" authority figure roles from Washington's distinguished career. At this point in Washington's career, nobody can deny the man's acting credentials. However, Washington's role in Flight resembles some of Washington's other iconic roles such as Officer Alonzo Harris in Training Day and Frank Lucas from American Gangster. This alone makes the film worthwhile to watch. However, like many films, Flight sacrifices realism for entertainment. But this sacrifice pays off as the film develops into an emotionally- involving tale of redemption. At the beginning of the film, Washington's character pilots a commercial passenger jet upside down for an evasive maneuver after turbulence causes the plane's tail to malfunction. Apparently, this is actually possible. The famed Boeing test pilot Alvin M. Johnston once performed a similar barrel roll in a Boeing 367, the predecessor of the modern Boeing 737. But it is probably unlikely that a pilot could fly such a large plane, upside down, for as long as the film made it seem. Then again, Hollywood's job isn't to teach physics. <br/><br/>While Captain Whittaker embarks on the doomed flight that could potentially end his career, nearby a pretty heroin addict named Nicole Maggen played by English actress Kelly Reilly is on the verge of being evicted by her creepy landlord. After getting him to leave, she overdoses and is taken to the nearby hospital that just so happens to be the same hospital that Captain Whitaker is destined to end up in. The two characters eventually meet and share a cigarette in the hallways of the hospital in a touchingly profound scene where they are interrupted by a cancer patient who seems oddly complacent in his own mortality. There is no denying the on-screen chemistry between the broken pilot and the cute redhead from Bankhead. The two deeply flawed characters eventually form a relationship which helps each confront their own flaws. At one point, Captain Whittaker asks Maggen, ""And you say you're a masseuse. What kind of a masseuse? "". To her own amusement, she responds, ""I've been every kind of masseuse there is"".<br/><br/>The biggest thing that Flight does right is its depiction of depression and substance abuse. Neither depression nor substance abuses are always readily visible. Sometimes, extraordinarily talented individuals, such as surgeons, judges, and even airline pilots can struggle with substance abuse and still carry on in their professional lives. This portrayal of substance abuse is a refreshing and brilliant stroke of realism in a film industry that too often portrays addicts as self-destructive stereotypes with clearly visible moral failings. Flight reminds the audience of many important aspects of overcoming an addiction. It is usually not so easy and often takes multiple tries. Quitting cold turkey is impossible until one recognizes that they have a problem. Stressful events, like being told you might be held culpable for the deaths of six people in an airplane crash, can trigger a relapse. Sometimes one has to hit rock bottom, before one recognizes the extent of a problem. Unfortunately for Captain Whitaker, rock bottom is snorting cocaine to get sober from a night of heavy drinking right before a hearing before a federal agency.<br/><br/>The film's ending felt a little sudden and abrupt. Even the male lead tells the audience as much. ""That was it. I was finished. I was done. It was as if I had reached my lifelong limit of lies. I could not tell one more lie. And maybe I'm a sucker. 'Cause if I had told just one more lie, I could have walked away from all that mess. Kept my wings, kept my false sense of pride...My chances of ever flying again are slim to none. And I accept that. I wrote letters to each of the families that had lost loved ones. Some of them were able to hear my apology. Some of them never will...But at least I am sober. And I thank god for that. I'm grateful for that. And this is going to sound real stupid coming from a guy who is locked up in prison but, for the first time in my life, I am free"". The final line of the film is equally thought-provoking. As the lead's estranged son visits his father in prison to interview him for a college application, he coyly asks Whitaker, ""Who are you?"". Surprised by how difficult it is answer such a simple question, Washington's character responds, ""That's a good question""; a good question indeed."
"zkonedog","5","1","2","6 March 2017"," Realistic To Its Own Detriment
","The funny thing about the cinematic experience sometimes is that, for all that moviegoers seem to want more ""realism"" on the big screen (e.g. the dark, gritty, ""Dark Knight"" series, a movie completely steeped in reality falls a bit short. Why? Because, generally speaking, we go to the cinema to ESCAPE our own realities, not get sucked up in them once again. Thus, for all the good things that ""Flight"" accomplishes, it is just too ""grounded"" to ever real produce the kind of emotional response needed to make it truly great.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary (containing some minor spoilers), ""Flight"" sees pilot Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington) perform an incredible feat of flying by landing a large commercial airliner that is literally falling apart around him. The only problem? Mr. Whitaker is an alcoholic who also uses cocaine to ""rev himself back up"" and continue flying. When both substances are found on his toxicology report after the crash, Whip embarks on a personal journey that ultimately ends with him confronting his own personal demons.<br/><br/>There are some things that this film does very well. The direction from Robert Zemeckis is sound, Denzel turns in a great performance, and the airplane sequences are absolutely captivating. The plot and auxiliary characters are also just good enough to make it a solid effort despite my biggest critique:<br/><br/>I have never viewed a film so down-to-earth and utterly devoid of an ounce of contrived drama. Usually that is a good thing (as so many films go the opposite route), but in this case it just makes for a flick that doesn't really arouse any deep emotions or feelings towards the on-screen proceedings. Every step of Whip's journey is laid out for us, there are no surprises, and even the moments that could have been filled with drama are instead a bit anti-climactic because they have already been explained to us.<br/><br/>Overall, then, I can't rank ""Flight"" as anything significantly better than average. It is a good role for Denzel, but other than that it just fails to capture any emotion enough to be a huge success."

","This is a pretty intense, gripping movie, which I could definitely relate to, having had problems with an alcohol and a DUI in the past, and dealing with the consequences of my bad choices in the present.I believed Whip's breakdown in the courtroom: given that he was dead drunk and coked up, I knew that he was going to snap one way or the other, and if he was tired of lying, then that's what it was. Loved the powerful, tear-inducing moment of glance exchanges between him and Ellen Block after he said ""I am drunk right this moment"". <br/><br/>However, here are the reasons I am giving it 8 out of 10: <br/><br/><ul><li>In the end, Whip mentions that he sent letters of apology to the victims, even though it was proved that the plane malfunctioned because of a damaged part, not because of the pilot's actions, AS WELL AS that under given circumstances, he performed in the best possible way and saved most of the people except the ones who were not buckled up at the time of crash, compared to zero people in other pilots' flight simulations. YES, he has been drinking, and YES he should face the appropriate consequences for that, but he should not be taking on false guilt for something he couldn't have possibly prevented had he been a hundred percent sober and ten times more alert.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The whole moral message reeks too much of AA stuff, which I am not a big fan of. Of course, this is just one story and perhaps it worked for him, but it is just too preachy and cookie-cutter for me. (However liked the scene with his son in the end.) </li></ul><br/><br/>If you know an alcoholic, especially one with a DUI or two, gently suggest they watch this movie, it will at least get them thinking in the right direction. But don't force it, or the slightly skewed moral might get stuck in their throat."

Throughout the movie, he's the most hateful character in my opinion, but at the same time he's a hero. A really well balanced movie between two extremes. A movie that balances between divine and devastation. <br/><br/>He's probably the worst and biggest enemy of himself. He's many things but when the lies pile up that much, and when time comes to show if he'll once more let everyone down, he makes the right decision and gets rewarded for it.

However, things change after an investigation.<br/><br/>I think this movie shows how people can rise and fall and can be both a hero and a goat in the public's eye, especially after much scrutiny.

The film does throw in some spots of humour, to balance out the bleak subject, in the form of John Goodman.

"vsks","7","1","2","3 June 2015"," Awesome Crash of Man and Machine
","Netflixed this 2012 movie on the recommendation of a friend, and she was right that Denzel Washington gives a strong, persuasive performance as the alcohol- and drug-addicted airline pilot, Whip Whitaker. The first half-hour of the film, when his airliner gets in trouble, is ""the finest and most terrifying plane crash sequence ever committed to film,"" says The Atlantic (you can see the crash scene on Netflix). But the movie isn't really about that event, it's about Whitaker's descent into addiction. John Goodman, as Whitaker's dealer, is congenially over-the-top as only Goodman can do it. Though using the Stones's ""Sympathy for the Devil"" as the background music when he sashays in was excuse-me-heavy-handed. Excellent performances also by Kelly Reilly, as Whitaker's drug-addict girlfriend, Bruce Greenwood as the airline pilots' union rep, and Don Cheadle as the lawyer the union hires. Thankfully, director Robert Zemeckis and writer John Gatins chose not to include a lengthy and harrowing detox segment, which movies about addiction so often include (Ray, for example). I especially liked the solid contributions from the supporting cast—Melissa Leo, Tamara Tunie, and Brian Geraghty, in particular. Real pilots, of course, find much to quarrel with—or laugh at—in the flying sequences, but they are not the point of the movie, anyway. They're there to get your attention. The Atlantic piece objects to the theme that ""a miracle"" landed the plane, but I understood that it was Whitaker's creativity, skill and nerve, even when impaired, that accomplished it. What other characters thought was what they thought. And, yes, some people do talk about miracles and ""God's hand,"" because that's the way they see the world. If you missed this movie the first time around, for fine acting and a better-than-average plot, it's worth seeing."

The director had so many things to assume for the audience that at one point you really feel the movie is just made to feel dramatic. This spoils the mood of the watcher."
"arminhage","7","1","2","31 January 2015"," Awesome movie sending a wrong message!
","Screenplay was perfect, acts were perfect, flight sequence was nothing short of masterpiece. I totally loved this movie, started to watch it 30 minutes past 12 in the midnight, I never hoped to watch all of it in one piece but I did, it really hooked me. But speaking from a pilot's point of view (Of course I do not fly commercial jets but the concept is the same), It was obvious that he drove the plane over it's mechanical limits on the pretext of getting it out of the storm faster but I strongly suspect that it was an over excitement caused by high dosage of Cocaine he sniffed to converse the alcohol effect, to be realistic, he put everyone's life in great danger by unnecessarily overriding the auto pilot and manually drive that show in first place. Now at the end of the movie we find out that a part in the tail section was worn off and was never changed, ran on that condition for almost 2 years, obviously a negligence from the airline but It is very likely that the speeding on ascent and put unnecessary pressure on the aircraft caused the already defected part to suddenly cease to work at that very same flight some 20 minutes later. Yes, he was skilled pilot, he managed to avoid an all out crash but also it was his fault in first place that the part ceased to function. His Alcohol and drug abuse led to his speeding on ascent, that put unnecessary pressure on the aircraft, as a result, already defected part ceased to function and catastrophe followed. So button line, he was not a hero, he just cleaned his own mess. He belonged to jail. The crash HAD EVERYTHING TO DO WITH HIS DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE. This is the thing that was never mentioned in the movie. Everyone accepted that the crash was act of God and some bad law driven feds were trying to convict a hero who saved 96 lives on pretext of him being intoxicated while piloting the plane. In that regard, movie was sending a wrong message so everything was awesome but the message was questionable."
"Horst_In_Translation","6","1","2","8 January 2015"," Interesting movie with one of 2012's finest performances
","""Flight"" is the newest film by Academy-Award winning director Robert Zemeckis. You may have seen his work from the ""Back to the Future""-trilogy, Forrest Gump or one of his other Tom Hanks collaborations. Here, however, he directs Denzel Washington in his most recent Oscar-nominated performance. The film is written by John Gatins, who also managed to score a nomination. As Washington plays a character who struggles with alcohol addiction for the film's almost 140 minutes, you could certainly interpret the title as the subject to ""flee"" as well, apart from the obvious reference to him being an airplane pilot.<br/><br/>My favorite scene was maybe how he woke up after the crash in the hospital and sees the television reports on the happenings and also how he asks his friend how many people died and who exactly. Very intense stuff. This is where the film is at its best. Bruce Greenwood, Don Cheadle and Brian Geraghty deliver strong supporting performances. Also in the film is John Goodman, who I usually like a lot, but here he felt just weird and over the top and I did not feel he added anything of quality to the film. Oh and then there is Kelly Reilly, who played her part well too, although I personally found her sequences less interesting than the ones that had directly to do with the crash. That is also why I was a bit surprised to see her in contention for an Oscar nomination. She wasn't bad, but she wasn't great either.<br/><br/>Anyway, the main reason to watch this film is Washington's excellent performance. A true statement against alcoholism and I really liked the way he played his scenes early on when he knows he is in lots of trouble, even if the country celebrates him as a hero at this point. And even if there are scenes in the first half already where you feel slightly negative about his character, such as everything before the flight, for example how he calls it a video game etc., I felt for him and hoped he could get out of the whole affair without too much damage and preferably an acquittal. The intended flight to Jamaica was realistic, he just wanted to get away from all the troubles and I also really liked one reference at the AA meeting he is at. When one of the speakers talks about 2 beers, it happens that he just told the same lie to his stewardess minutes earlier that he only had two beers before the flight.<br/><br/>Then, in the final act, the fridge full of beverages is the first moment of truth for Washington's character and we don't really get a happy ending, at least not at this point yet. So Goodman's character (a poor man's Wolf from ""Pulp Fiction"") shows up to get him into shape again with the help of cocaine. This was maybe the worst scene of the film for me. It felt like the writers/directors tried to bring some comedy into the film (just like the first time Goodman appears), but it went totally wrong and sacrificed lots of realism. The only thing I kinda liked about it was how Cheadle's character manages swiftly to not get involved when they hand Goodman's character the money. The hearing afterward, however, is pretty nicely done again. It seemed to me as if the woman who asked these questions went pretty easy on Washington's character, maybe because he saved so many lives, but he realizes now is the moment to stand up to what he did, even if he will go to jail for it. No more denial. So he did not accuse the dead stewardess he had an affair with and instead admitted everything he did. I liked how a couple minutes earlier the remote was not working and the interrogator had to do it manually, a nice reference to what the central character did in the plane early in the film.<br/><br/>Finally, there was a quote that has him say something like ""some of them will forgive me, some of them never will"" and I thought some of them already have and as I saw later on the photos from his prison wall with Reilly's character, I was correct. While the central character becomes continuously more unlikeable and his alleged heroic performance loses more and more significance as the film goes on, I did not feel it ever reached true greatness in terms of emotion. However, thanks to its excellent lead performance and a couple high-quality scenes I already mentioned (add to that Washington and Tunie at the funeral), it is certainly worth a watch and does not drag at all despite easily crossing the 2-hour-mark."

","This guy is a functioning alcoholic and he has a flight problem that causes a life problem for some of the passengers. Gradually he comes to cases with his life long problem with booze and drugs. He's a gifted pilot and he gets away with his shenanigans for a long time. The reason that Washington was so good at this role is because he very likely is a stoner in real life. The opening shot features a beautiful actress stark naked, so that's an extra bonus. Later on it's another junkie chick who is there to illustrate something or other. The scene with the AA meeting makes me glad I don't attend anymore. But I still have almost 11 years. I also never operated anything but a dice layout when I was stoned, so, no worries there. In closing, this movie is okay and I have watched it twice. Fortunately it was not that memorable so watching it the second time was fairly interesting."

","I had high expectations for this movie before I watched it. I'm a fan of Denzel Washington and this movie was highly reviewed and nominated for two Oscars. I'm also a fan of the director Robert Zemeckis. I was mildly disappointed. The beginning of the film was very interesting. The plane scene was action packed and had me at the edge of my seat. I couldn't wait to see what would happen next. However after that, not much happens. The last 3/4ths of the movie is basically just Denzel Washington's character getting drunk all the time despite being investigated for flying a plane while drunk. I found it very difficult to relate or sympathize with his character. I guess he redeems himself in the end and owns up to his behavior, but by then I had lost interest in him and the film in general."

","This film is totally contrast throughout there are moments of absolute brilliance and also moments where I was so bored I wanted to turn the film off because I was bored. Denzel Washington stars as a pilot which lands a crashing plane while under the influence of Alcohol and the film documents the trials and tribulations he must endure throughout. Now I must say first Denzel Washington completely deserved his Oscar Nomination for his performance as his performance is the part of the film that you follow and he is the character that the audience needs to connect with. The side characters are all believable in their role and are superb in their performances. To properly describe this film the opening part where he is in the plane crash is heart stopping and fantastic but then it also stops and slows down a lot which is the boring part and then it becomes heart wrenching and tense towards the end of the film which makes this film a great film but not to the level of other similar films like The Wrestler."

","Powerful, moving movie. Probably the best movie on the effects of alcoholism since ""Leaving Las Vegas"" in 1995. <br/><br/>Original and unpredictable.

Even once the true aim is known, you don't know how it is all going to end.<br/><br/>Not perfect though. Certain scenes just seem superfluous. The relationship angle seems badly developed, and almost unnecessary. Some scenes, especially any involving John Goodman, seem to glorify Captain Whitaker's addictions.<br/><br/>Good performance by Denzel Washington in the lead role. Not sure it deserved an Oscar nomination, but a good performance nevertheless. Good support from Kelly Reilly, Bruce Greenwood and Don Cheadle. John Goodman possibly overdoes the cool-stoner-dude shtick."

","I wanted to like this movie; and from the start I thought it was going to be a good film. But it wasn't because it didn't make sense, and like a few other critics mentioned, they played it too 'safe' in the writing.<br/><br/>The crash scene at the start was intense, I thought for sure this would be an epic movie from that point on, it was a horrific scene.<br/><br/>But instead, the movie kind of played a sorrow on 'Big Baller Captain Denzel' - ""he's the best pilot and saved everyone, bangs tons of chicks and, he's just ripped all the time, poor Denzel"" -- One of his flight attendants ""Now, Captain - I've known you for 11 years, and you weren't OK - you never just have 2 glasses of wine"" - Basically implying, Oh, there's the captain; he's such a talented pilot but just shows up to work everyday ripped. Really.. uh, he's pilot? This could of been a good film, but it was really goofy and didn't make sense at all. After watching it, I just felt the whole story was to pity the ultra talented big balla Captain, who just happens to come to work a little ripped; then suddenly he's in Jail and happy at the end - keeping it politically correct.<br/><br/>Pretty lame -- I was entertained some, so I rate at 5.

For starters, it was one of the ""flattest"" movies I have seen in a long time, the characters were bland, predictable, and utterly Hollywood cliché throughout. The story line was just moronic and unbelievable. I am not a pilot, and know nothing of the technical aspect of aviation, but it just seems a bit far fetched. Although I could be wrong on that assumption. The storyline was not reliant on the believability of the aviation ""heroics"" anyways.

The plane obviously goes down due to technical failure, but the investigation reveals the captain had consumed alcohol and his alcoholism and stupendous flying capability get questioned. After a long time, I have been able to watch a genuine drama that tells a modern story; and ""Flight"" makes a lot of justice in that aspect. Though it involves the survival game and many improbabilities, psychological aspects of characters are revealed instead of stunts which makes the story awesome. Besides, the film is filled with nice performances notably from Denzel Washington for which I expect a deserving Oscar after ""Training Day."" Except few unpleasantness the film carries of modern aridities, the film is really engaging and would definitely make you think.

"dallasryan","8","1","2","10 December 2013"," A Very Fine Performance
","What I really like most about this movie is there is no cop out. The flight scene is one of the best ever executed. Another one up their with the ranks of this flight scene is the haunting United 93.<br/><br/>And with that, Denzel got nominated for this movie for his speeches toward the end of the film(in my opinion)that in fact brought his character to a full circle. I think a lot of us can identify with needing to spill our guts to someone in order to be free. Denzel's character finally had to spill his guts about all of his lies in order to live again, and I think we all need to do that whether it be with friends, family, or whether it be in front of a judge or jury because I think we all hold many lies within ourselves like Denzel did in this film.<br/><br/>I also like the fact that Denzel's character didn't cop out on what he was sentenced for at the end, he said something to the likes of(not exact)'I'm in here for 5 more years and I will never fly again, and that's fair.' That delivery was so honest and profound from Denzel. I think a lot of us like to have a cop out, feel sorry for ourselves and take no responsibility or make excuses for our actions.<br/><br/>This performance was an homage to fessing up and taking responsibility for your life. Kudos to a very fine performance from Denzel Washington for making us understand this fact in life."

","Wait, you mean I have to scrounge around for jobs, but other people get to make a living from this crap? Yes, Washington has a certain gravitas that worked well in this role. It's the only reason I made it through.<br/><br/>Unless you're just making a movie about nihilistic criminals like Reservoir Dogs, you have to give me a reason to care. Here we have some weirdo heroine-whore and a shallow drunk loser. We hear that he learned to fly in small planes on his dad's farm, yet he was in the Marines. Does this mean he was once a disciplined patriot or a naval aviator, or what? Do you want to watch a loser drink, pass out, fall down, and drink some more for over two hours? Then stay away from this clunker. There was one good scene with a cancer patient smoking a cigarette in a hospital stairwell. He gives a little perspective on life and does it memorably.<br/><br/>The worst cop out of this film and perhaps in film history, is waiting until the last scene to have a kid ask our mysterious character,who he is, and have him answer that he doesn't know. It's like telling us that the writer should be excused for the lack of character development, because the character doesn't know himself. Please.....<br/><br/>What could have saved this film, is if at least one time, the guy broke down and hysterically unleashed his guilt for a life ill spent.<br/><br/>I will admit that the initial cockpit scene had some decent intensity."

","Ever since the movie Flight came out, people have been raving about it, but I didn't understand why until I actually sat down to watch it. Denzel Washington is one of my favorite actors, so I was going to see it either way, but I wasn't expecting it to be what it was. The previews and commercial all focused on the crash and the hero who made an impossible move to land the plane safely, but in reality that's just a small part of the movie. The true focus of the movie is on the troubled life of pilot, Whip Whitaker (Washington), whose demons seem to find him wherever he goes. When he's in the air, Whip is at peace and away from a life of hardship and disappointments, but after the crash, he's unable to fly and has to face that life head on. The film itself was actually a bit slow after the thrilling introduction and the excitement on board the plane. At parts during this film, I was bored, but it's necessary to bring the story together into an unexpected conclusion. Sometimes, a film is slow and it's just not worth it to sit there, but Flight is different. The film may lack something in the middle, but it is well worth you're time. The story is out of this world and Denzel Washington shows that he hasn't lost a thing. This man brings such a strong presents to everything that he does, that often times I find myself overlooking the entire rest of the cast. There are a lot of big names in this film, that all become forgettable after the performance Washington gives. Even though this film came out at the wrong time, if he doesn't receive the Academies attention for this role, then there is a gaping flaw in their system. The story is fantastic, Denzel Washington is nothing short of amazing, and this story will stick with you long after the film is over, I can not recommend it enough!"
"cat_ranchero","8","1","2","5 October 2013"," Good!...
","Although I liked this film I did find it a little too long; in fact I have to admit that I watched it in two halves. From a totally stunning sequence at the start I felt it lost momentum for a while, that was until I became embroiled in the drama of Whip Whitaker's story. It's quite a tale and an excellent performance from Denzel Washington holds it all together quite brilliantly. I also thought Kelly Reilly did a pretty good job as well. But back to the opening sequence for a moment, for me it ranks as one of the best special effects driven sequences I've seen in a very long time and hats off to all involved. Taken as a whole, the film does take the audience on quite a journey and I know for some it couldn't quite live up to that crash sequence. For me I thought it held together pretty well, mainly thanks to the acting skills of Mr Washington. Over all, definitely worth a watch but don't get blown away by the crash sequence, there's a lot more depth to it than that.<br/><br/>SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED<br/><br/>My score: 7.8/10<br/><br/>You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster."
"agenericperson","4","1","2","2 October 2013"," Flight takes what would be a good movie and brings it crashing to the ground
","Flight takes everything and ""does it to the max,"" as people used to say. It's not enough that Denzel Washington's character is an alcoholic. He has to be an alcoholic who does cocaine and drinks while flying. Of course this is the initial premise of the film so it can be forgiven. Let's also overlook that Mr Washington's character is the only one who could land the plane. What comes next is a lot of drama about alcoholism and drugs that doesn't even bother to portray either of those things accurately. No, that's not enough. Instead it has to portray them ""to the max!"" This turns an otherwise interesting character piece into a generic paint-by-numbers melodrama. Even the music choices in the movie are the very songs you hear in this sort of movie. It sort of feels like they glued two movies together, a generic alcoholic melodrama and a plane disaster. Rarely do these two films seem to overlap or affect one another. It may as well have been two separate films.<br/><br/>Flight could have made a great film. It spends too much time on the generic alcoholism melodrama and not the part that makes it unique, the part about the plane crash! I'm not saying the whole film should have taken place in the sky. It would have been more interesting if Mr Washington wasn't the hero in the crash, if his drug abuse and alcoholism may have been responsible for the deaths of some passengers. Instead there could be an underlying uncertainty about whether his negligence killed those people or if it was truly ""an act of God."" They could have toned down some more elements to make it more realistic. Then the rest of the film could have been about his denial and acceptance of what he did; and also about whether he would be punished for his actions. Where it stands it's a very mixed messaged film that tries too hard to make Mr Washington into a hero and a villain without aiming anywhere in the middle. <br/><br/>I think Denzel Washington is an amazing actor... or at least he used to be. His movies have really gone downhill over the recent years and so has his acting ability. He doesn't make a very believable drunk or pilot in the movie. He relies on old clichés instead of bringing anything real to the film. Of course that may not be his fault. An actor is only as good as the script he's given and Flight has an abundance of problems.<br/><br/>Lastly, there are a few (I won't spoil them here) eye rolling sequences in the film. Doing everything ""to the max"" is fine but it doesn't work in a drama. It's more of a comedy thing and it's a another major reason why this film just doesn't work."

Lets face it this is a long drawn out movie and is entertaining in parts. There was no plot or subplot and it was easy to follow. Moral questions and thought provoking, but was justice forthcoming?

Unfortunately, it's a shitty day and his 'plane soon flies into a nightmarish storm and develops problems that eventually, after a hair-raising few minutes that might put a few million Americans off flying ever again, Denzel is forced to fly upside down to try to rectify them. Finally, he wakes up alive and is rushed to hospital where, horror of horrors, he faces an investigation. There is a way out by blaming it his dead co-pilot, but he does not take it and confesses to alcoholism, getting a heavy prison sentence that will wreck his life. The movie is really about alcohol and not flight, and the title should really be changed. A good outing by Back to the Future director Robert Zemeckis. It apparently made $60m profit."
"rachelandfilms","6","1","2","13 June 2013"," The trailer might fool you into thinking this film is something that it's not...
","If you've seen the trailer for Flight then you might be under the impression that this film is a thrilling all-speed-ahead drama, and while this is, in part, true, the film is more a searing character-study which explores important moral issues than anything else. Given its director, the acclaimed Robert Zemeckis (the brilliant mind behind Forest Gump, Back to the Future and Cast Away to name a few) this might not come as a surprise, because based on his repertoire of films he seems to relish a thoroughly thought-out character. Yet one defining difference behind this character Whip Whittaker (Denzel Washington) is that he is unlikeable, filled with hubris and infuriating to watch in his self-destruction. <br/><br/>To some this would be a justifiable reason to dislike the film, because without a character we can like or even empathise with how can we enjoy or begin to understand the film or its character? Despite the heroism and bravery of Whittaker in the first act of this film in which he manages to save 96 of the 102 passengers aboard his crumbling aircraft his actions and behaviour afterwards are despicable and colour the audience's perception of him. His aggressiveness to those that try and save him from his inexcusable downward-spiral makes for irritating viewing. You might question why I call it ""inexcusable"". You might think that this ""downward-spiral"" is the consequence of the traumatic events of the plane crash. It is not. His alcoholism and substance abuse, which is portrayed by Washington with astonishing reality, is a long-standing and widely known characteristic amongst his work colleagues, which is a shocking thought really. It makes you question not only your own safety, but also how such a character could exist that would put innocent lives at risk. <br/><br/>If you would like to continue reading my thoughts on this film then go here...

A theme which I feel was beautifully portrayed in 'stone' staring Robert Di Niro. However in this film its a mere sub plot, to the main story line. Of which, is far from what you would expect from the trailer.<br/><br/>I expected to see an intense court room drama, with cover ups and stories of the extreme and immoral lengths large corporations would go to, to save face. A young passionate lawyer taking them on, to win the day and save our hero pilots future. Because despite his wrong doings, he was not the fault of the crash. Something along the lines of, 'rules of engagement' staring Samuel L Jackson. <br/><br/>After watching this film, I felt a little disappointed that they did just go with that. Instead they made an attempt at a very tangled story line following the desperate actions of an addict. <br/><br/>This is a good film, and as usual Denzel Washington was brilliant. Unfortunately I feel writer John Gatins, was going in to many directions. Writer of 'Coach Carter' one of my all time favourite films. I believe Gatins has more in the bag, films that we will remember for decades to come. But 'flight' I am afraid is not one of those films. A great film to watch, but not one you will watch time and time again."

As a family physician and a suboxone prescriber, I have worked with a lot of drug addicts and alcoholics, and I found this movie to be one of the best portrayals of the struggles they face that I have seen. I liked the scene especially where he comes home and cleans out all the alcohol he has hidden; then, as soon as he is under more stress, he buys it all back. I like the way he got totally drunk the night before his big make or break hearing. That's what they do. (Even though it was a bit contrived; I have never seen anywhere near that amount of alcohol in a room fridge of a hotel; nor have I ever seen anyone leave a door open while closing the dead bolt; but whatever). Anyway, back to the praises, the writer here clearly knows his stuff and has been around drinkers; or maybe is one, I dunno.<br/><br/>It must be acknowledged that this is a great performance by Denzel Washington. I have never seen him act like this. I didn't know he was capable of it. He too must have been around drinkers, and knows their ways. The facial expressions, the lies, everything. He has it down, and is pretty much in character most of the time.<br/><br/>Now for what I think is the fatal flaw. OK, the thesis is that drinking and driving is bad, right, because it impairs our ability, and places ourselves and others at risk. This is accepted, and there is plenty of data to back this up. Motor vehicle fatalities are down as a result of stricter enforcement of DWI laws, etc. Except, drinkers know it ain't always so. In New York, for example, until very recently our limit was 0.12, and I many times drove over that. Today, if you are even at 0.09, you can become a felon. There is quite a difference in performance between someone who is used to drinking, and someone who is not. I have seen a man walking and conversing normally, who later had a 0.60 on a blood test! Kids have died from less than that.<br/><br/>The movie seems to be making a case for this unpopular viewpoint when it has Whip, sporting a 0.25, do a super human flight maneuver that 10 expert pilots tried later (on a flight simulator) to equal, and could not, and thereby save a 100 lives, more or less. At this point, the movie seems to be making a powerful argument FOR drunk driving, or at least, drunk piloting of passenger jets with disabled elevators.<br/><br/>Then the movie returns to its anti-alcoholism motif, as Whip slowly begins to fall apart, then in a heroic confession, owns up to it all and begins the painful process of taking responsibility and becoming rehabbed. This also didn't quite ring true; my alcoholics don't own up to anything unless they are absolutely forced, and he clearly still had an out here, and a rather easy one at that.<br/><br/>Well, which is it writers? Is alcohol really that bad, and if so, why did you have Whip save the day with this expert feat of flying. while drunk? (would that be FWI?)Why this uncertainty, writers, that results in such a confused message? I don't know. But my thought is that a more real life scenario, in which Whip crashes the plane, and the autopsy shows that he was drunk and died in disgrace, must have been unacceptable for some reason. Or, alternatively the co pilot takes control, saves the day, and again Whip is hauled off in tears into disgrace. That too, must have been deemed unacceptable for some reason.<br/><br/>I think that reason, for it having been written the way it was, is the phenomenon of THE STAR. Denzel Washington is a star, man, a celebrity, and a member of an historically denigrated minority. We can't have him playing a moral reprobate such as his character would have become, in either of the more realistic scenarios that I propose. Why, Hollywood could even have been accused of racism, having a drunken black pilot rescued by a sober white one, or killing all them white folks. An unacceptable bow to stereotypes! It couldn't be done.<br/><br/>So instead we come up with this far fetched and contradictory business of a drunken black pilot outperforming 10 expert (?white) ones, then heroically turning himself in, saying ""Boys, even though I just showed that drunks CAN fly, I am not saying drunks SHOULD fly!"", and going off nobly to prison, where he rehabilitates not only himself, but a bunch of others while he's there. And along the way, he also rescues a forlorn heroin addict that he happened to pick up looking for a little sex. The real villain of the plane crash? Those bad corporate guys, trying to make a little extra money by not doing the required maintenance. Oh, I should have guessed! Now that's a movie, and that's a star! Hollywood style. Don't make no sense, but it's good entertainment. And a great visual of a plane flying upside down."
"KineticSeoul","7","1","2","26 March 2013"," Predictable for the most part but still a good movie
","This is a predictable movie for the most part and if you seen the trailer it becomes even more predictable and yet it's a good movie. The plot is about a commercial pilot named Whip Whitaker(Denzel Washington) who uses his piloting skills when something goes wrong with the plane and crash lands the plane with 6 killed on board. But majority of the people surviving the crash to see another day. The only big problem for Whitaker though is that they did his blood test after the crash and found his alcohol level is just too high and they found 2 vodka bottles that can either belong to him or one other crew on the plane. And thus it becomes a movie about a man's downward struggle with alcohol and coke, while also dealing with moral issues. This flick sort of reminded me of the movie ""Courage Under Fire"" which also has Denzel Washington in it and him dealing with inner struggles by constantly drinking. Denzel Washington again shows off his amazing acting chops and is the one that really carries this movie. He really makes his character's inner struggles believable. And although his character is a arrogant drunk and a drug addict I couldn't help but have sympathy towards his character. When it comes to movies about a man's life spiraling downwards this is one of the good ones.<br/><br/>7.8/10"

","So, Flight is another movie that made me kinda mad prior to seeing it, thanks to the trailers.<br/><br/>From what I remembered – and now, rewatching it, the preview promised action, comedy, suspense, courtroom thrillingand when you see it, you will, indeed, get all thatfor about 10 minutes out of 138. Unfortunately, I was told this fact prior to seeing it, even though I try not to listen or read anything about films I see beforehand, and they were dead on.<br/><br/>That said, at least I was prepared. This movie is a big-screen Lifetime Film about addiction first and foremost and the slight background is that action-packed plane tipping scene in the trailer. Oh, and that ""courtroom scene""? Well, it's really not a courtroom and that disappoints me since I do love the very few courtroom movies produced since the birth of cinema.<br/><br/>And after I've already wrote, I actually kinda liked the finished product. Perhaps, because I was prepared? Or perhaps, I understand addictionfartoowell.<br/><br/>Drunk pilot Whip Whitaker – really, that's his name, and with the star's name, (Denzel) Washington playing him, we got the WWW – takes the pilot's seat to what could be a dysfunctional plane. Sort of like him, I suppose. In order to save the ""102 souls onboard,"" Whitaker inverts the plane and lands the best anyone could've done.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for him, his life gets a lot worse following the crash landing as his defense team (including friends, relatives and attorneys) scramble to keep the alcoholic out of jail for flying intoxicated. Only, Whitaker's not helping at all.<br/><br/>Will Whip Whitaker wind up winning or wosing? (Sorry, that was bad. So what if I'm drinking right now while writing this? Ha.)<br/><br/>At any rate, I can see why Washington was nominated: he was, in fact, good, but not great enough to win. So that, Oscars, I agree with. And the movie, itself, was a tad bit confused on what it really wanted to be – and I am excluding the misleading trailer. At times, and even leading up to the climax, it threw in unusual humor that really didn't fit the scene or mood. It was almost as if they were trying to get us to side with the fact he might be able to get away with flying ""102 souls"" while drunk.<br/><br/>The movie's a tad bit long with his journey of alcoholism and only really perks in the finale scene that I really liked. Bookmarked, in reverse, that is, I liked the opening and exciting flight inverting. It's the middle part that's not necessarily bad, but doesn't even remotely hold up a second viewing ever.<br/><br/>Recommended? Eh. Sure, why not. Have a few drinks, thoughIt is a long film and I do love irony."
"jantoniou","7","1","2","8 March 2013"," Quite good adult-level drama... yet...
","...something is missing in this very finely-crafted but clearly imperfect film about a man struggling with his powerful, overwhelming addictions.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington hits all the marks perfectly as William ""Whip"" Whitaker, a seasoned commuter pilot captain for a small regional airline. We soon learn Whip has very serious personal problems. <br/><br/>In fact it isn't more than a few seconds into ""Flight"" that we know how bad Whip has it. The first shot of the movie is of his lover's - a flight attendant - fully-exposed breast, the next is of he snorting cocaine and drinking while she prances across the hotel room stark naked while he argues with his ex-wife over money. His lover, Katerina (a quite exquisite Nadine Valezquez who is there, apparently, to remind us husbands that women only have bodies like that in the movies), could make us think we're watching ""Traffic"" or ""Blow"" or ""Scarface"" save that Whip is an airline pilot. <br/><br/>After the hotel, Whip boards his jet and plops into the cockpit quite torqued on alcohol and drugs. He has a green co-pilot whom he has never met before and the weather is awful for take-off: Stormy, rainy, and windy, with rough cross-winds.<br/><br/>The take-off proves to be a challenge and the plane bucks like a bronco trying to get up in the air. A major ""sphincter event"" you might say but the seasoned Whip knows to drive the plane into a gap of the storm surrounding his jet. After a couple minutes of white-knuckling it Whip successfully finds clear skies on the short commuter flight from Orlando to Atlanta. <br/><br/>After things clear up Whip goes to the cabin to apologize for the rough take-off and as he does this manages to - out of view of the cabin, of course - drain two mini- bottles of vodka into a bottle of orange juice. He takes a few swigs and heads back to the cockpit. Bad enough he's flying while already drunk and high, but can you imagine an airline pilot drinking ON the flight? And that's just the beginning of how bad Whip's problems really are.<br/><br/>About 30 miles out from Atlanta the smooth sailing abruptly goes awry as the plane loses elevator control and hydraulics. The plane heads into a steep, almost straight-down nose dive with virtually no control for either pilot. <br/><br/>The extended action scene around the crash landing is easily reason enough to watch ""Flight,"" no matter how much it sags in the middle. Whatever may be wrong with William ""Whip"" Whitaker, however drunk he may be, there is NO question he is in command as the plane hurtles toward the earth. He knows exactly what to do, driven by years of experience that have been honed into instinct. He calmly, confidently gives orders to his co-pilot and flight crew to try to pull it out of a dive. None work but then he hits on a notion to try to invert the plane to pull it out of the dive. Insane, yes, but the alternative is sure death. Engines flaming out, oil pressure dropping, parts of the plane flying off, everyone screaming, the young co-pilot clearly out of his depth, flight crew freaking out - Whip is unflappable. He even reminds the flight attendant helping him to tell her son she loves him so it will be recorded on the flight recorder. <br/><br/>After the inversion Whip is able to right the plane and, too far from an airstrip still - at this point with both engines flamed out he is literally gliding - sees a large field he can try to ditch the plane in to. The crash landing is rough, but, miraculously almost everyone on the flight survives including, naturally, Whip himself. <br/><br/>The remainder of the film is focused on Whip finally coming to grips with the many demons of severe alcoholism that have plagued him most of his life. Most pilots would be ordinary heroes after such a miraculous crash landing but Whip's menagerie of personal problems are brought to the fore as his union rep, a criminal attorney hired by the union to defend him (played brilliantly by Don Cheadle, one of my personal fave actors, too), and a happenstance love interest whom he meets in the hospital - she's in there because she ODed on heroin - after the crash all try to come to his rescue. <br/><br/>Pardon my aerodynamic puns, but there's quite a bit of drag in this second act. As excellent as Denzel is as a man who is in deep denial about how bad his problems really are, the struggles of the addict feel familiar to moviegoers. He never really pulls it together until the end, which feels much like a typical Hollywood movie ending of a lost soul redeemed. <br/><br/>As an aside I would argue the crash scenario used in ""Flight"" was taken from Alaska Airlines Flight 261 that crashed off Ventura, California back in 2000 that crashed for a very similar reason to the plane in ""Flight"": a worn jackscrew. I remember it well because I happened to be traveling that day in the same vicinity, heading back from Southern to Northern California for my employer at the time and the plane crashed just a couple hours before I was scheduled to head home that evening. Trust me that whole flight was a bunch of nervous nellies. Though the weather was clear and the skies smooth that day I think every even slight change in altitude felt like we were going to fall out of the sky.<br/><br/>Regardless of the relatively slack second act and prototypical Hollywood feel to the ending, ""Flight""'s crash sequence makes it well worth a watch and the movie overall is well done and acted, even if the story falls short in several places."

","One of the things I hate the most about modern films is that they sometimes try to sell them as something they're not.<br/><br/>This film is a very good example of that because watching the trailer you tell yourself that this is a movie about a miraculous plane crash, and that the plot is going to be about how it was possible that Denzel Washington saved all these people. I was expecting anything, really, they even could've throw in some paranormal events into the story just for the sake of a plot like the one presented in the trailer. <br/><br/>Truth is, this film is miles away from it's advertisement. It has nothing to do with thriller and mystery, and the plane crash is only here to set up the real subject of the movie : the main character's alcoholism. I do have to give this film some credit for a very realistic and well- showed plane crash scene but this was still a big disappointment. Hope that trailers will change one day and actually sell a film as it is."

","A great movie, riveting from the first scene to well, the last 15 minutes or so.<br/><br/>The biggest let down for me was the typical Hollywood, politically correct ending, which in my opinion is very unnecessary and counter intuitive. Had the movie ended on the moment captain Whitaker walks into that NTSB hearing, it would've been just as effective and probably more moving.<br/><br/>As for Denzel Washington's performance, there's no doubt he's delivered one of the best in his career. He literally held the movie together single-handedly; you'd struggle to find a scene without him in it. It's like watching a heavy weight champ at work, he knows exactly when to deliver a punch and where to deliver it to. I'm glad to see him finally back in this kind of roles after so many forgettable ventures in the last 10 years."

","At the beginning it was like watching two different films... One about a plane, the other about sleazy women with drug problems who make porn for drugs. This was an absolute put off. The very first scene is of Washington laying in bed with a naked whore. This had no relevance to any of the film whatsoever and I couldn't help but think that the directors just threw that in as an extra thing to have in their film... nudity. I did not once think that I would be going to see a film so heavily full of alcohol, sex and drugs... There are more scenes of alcohol than the plane! Also, during the film, Washington has to have a walking stick due to his injuries... In different scenes he has it then it magically disappears. In all fairness I believed that the film would be about a flight that went wrong... Instead I watched a lot of hardcore drug use, alcohol abuse, sex and profanity. The film was good but lacked substance and as a result I found it to be quite shallow for the first forty minutes. However, after the first forty minutes were up the film started to merge its story lines together and it ended better than expected. A lot of the film was predictable but nonetheless there was some great acting and special effects in this film. Flight is nothing to shout about. The most thrilling part of the film is when the plane starts to lose control... I was clutching onto my chair! Very realistic but somehow I don't think it would be quite as possible in reality :) six out of ten."

","I am highly surprised to see that no comment has pointed out that this movie - that I have not seen yet - is the nearly retake of an oldie, made in 1980, and called THE PILOT. It was directed and starred Cliff Robertson, as the lead. A sort of celebrity pilot, aboard a 747 super jet, who had serious problems with alcohol. He hid the bottles in the men's room and always find a short moment ""off duty"" to go to the toilets and...The movie was about the suspicion around his strange behaviour, and the many tries of his hierarchy and colleagues to nail him.<br/><br/>I guess this film starring the great Denzell Washington is a bit different in the story itself, but I couldn't stop thinking of the Cliff Robertson's feature, when reading the topic of the Zemeckis' one. And I am sure that not so many movies talk about jet pilots and their problems with alcohol..."
"brefane","5","1","2","10 February 2013"," Flight gets derailed.
","At its core, this large scale Robert Zemeckis film has a provocative idea and a potentially fascinating character, but unfortunately the filmmakers have come up with an unnecessary and awkwardly introduced sub plot involving Nicole, a junkie who shoots up to the strains of Sweet Jane, and her sleazy landlord who along with John Goodman's flamboyant dealer belong in a different film. These three characters are total clichés, and they undermine the film's seriousness and focus. Flight would be considerably shorter and significantly better without them. Excellent support from Melissa Leo, Don Cheadle, Brian Gerahty(co-pilot) and Tamara Tunie(Margaret)help keep it real, and Denzel Washington is superb whether you like his character or not. Alas, there is also an over reliance on a jukebox soundtrack, and the film's spiritual/religious undertones are heavy-handed. The film is not a complete waste;despite excess baggage,it occasionally takes flight."
"mdnobles19","6","1","2","9 February 2013"," Oscar caliber performance from Denzel
","Flight is a powerful return to live action filmmaking for Robert Zemeckis, whose last live action film was the superior and more memorable film Cast Away.<br/><br/>The film's opening shows airline pilot Whip Whitaker, played by the one and only Denzel Washington, waking up from a one night stand with a flight attendant. Right away the film portrays him as a troubled and unlikable character as he snorts cocaine, just moments before he is due to fly a passenger plane. We are then introduced to a desperate junkie Nicole, played by the under used actress Kelly Reilly, her character soon overdoses which leads to a fateful encounter with Denzel's character later on. The film cuts back to Denzel's character as he takes flight, which soon leads to a terrifying, worst case scenario when Whip's plane has technical failures. The moments of intense fear and helplessness during the doomed flight will have you stunned and on the edge of your seat. Probably one the most realistic and electrifying depictions of a plane crash on the silver screen I've seen in a long time. It's a shame that the film doesn't have quite the same momentum once it hits land.<br/><br/>After the crash the film brings us to the hospital where Whip wakes up from a concussion, he doesn't remember much other than knowing the plane went down. Numerous of reporters and police agents surround the building wanting answers. He then meets Nicole who survived the overdose and instantly they bond and support each other during their hardship. Whip's flaws come to light as he struggles to admit and come to terms with alcoholism, the film throws you head first into that shady lifestyle. There is a rich character study throughout the rest of the film of Whip's constant battles with his own demons, coming to terms with the crash. The experience was distressing and frustrating and nothing you enjoy watching or find entertaining, but its gripping hold on you makes you glue to the screen to see how it's all going to end.<br/><br/>The performances were all great, but this is Denzel Washington's vehicle. He gives the most nuanced performance of his career; you believe every second of his portrayal and embodies his character. His Oscar nomination is much earned. Kelly Reilly is so mesmerizing to watch on screen and this is probably her most meaty role since Eden Lake. She has been on the back burner for way too long now and deserves a breakout-leading role. The film has an impressive supporting cast as well that include Don Cheadle, John Goodman, Bruce Greenwood and Melissa Leo.<br/><br/>Director, Robert Zemeckis has had such a diverse string of movies over the years, my favorite being Forrest Gump. This is proof that he can direct just about any type of genre, even though as a whole Flight isn't his most striking efforts, but he definitely hasn't lost his touch. Writer, John Gatins has the magic touch for human drama and has a pretty decent resume so far as he wrote screenplays for Hardball, Coach Carter, Dreamer, Real Steel, but Flight definitely is the film to put him on the map to hopefully even better films.<br/><br/>Overall, Flight isn't a film I will want to return to anytime soon and it leads to a too predictable and sentimental conclusion. Denzel's compelling and powerful performance, solid writing and a return to live motion pictures from Robert Zemeckis is granted at least one viewing."
"neil-476","7","1","2","8 February 2013"," Flawed, with an excellent central performance
","Denzel Washington plays Whip Whitaker, a pilot who pulls off an amazing bit of flying , saving 96 lives out of 102 on board when mechanical failure puts his plane into a dive. Unfortunately, Whip is an alcoholic and substance abuser, and was flying while loaded. What effect will this have on the enquiry into the crash? You will have gained this much from the trailer (if you've seen it). What you won't have picked up is that, after the stunningly realised crash sequence which takes up the first half hour of this film, the rest of it is more or less taken up with Whip wrestling with his demons. Washington is very good, but we never get to know Whip (which is reflected in the final sequence) - we only get to know the Whip who is being piloted by alcohol.<br/><br/>So I have a number of criticisms, but I'll stick with the two big ones. The first is that the script is a bit of a shambles. A number of the characters are there specifically to serve particular purposes (John Goodman's drug dealer is the embodiment of the evil done to Whip by drink and drugs, as symbolised heavy-handedly by Sympathy For The Devil on the soundtrack when he first appears, Kelly Reilly's sympathetic heroin addict provides both a reflection of Whip's possible redemption as well as a sounding board for this otherwise solitary character etc.), so there is a degree of obviousness, and certain elements are raised (the religious motif), referenced, and then not taken anywhere.<br/><br/>The second is that the trailer solidly sells this as an interplay between the crash and the effect Whip's condition may have had on it. And this issue (what would have happened had Whip not been high? Would the 6 who died have lived? Or would all have died?), though unanswerable, is never considered. To me, it is the question posed by the trailer and would, perhaps, have made a more rewarding 90 minutes viewing than Whip's denial of his alcoholism. The climax and what follows are, if a little glib, satisfyingly dealt with in a film which tries hard but, ultimately, fails to achieve its potential.<br/><br/>Honourable mention must go to Nadine Velasquez whose contribution to the first two or three minutes is quite spectacular."

","Didn't like portrayal of Christian flight assistant and wife as wacko bible-thumpers, while drug addicts are just misunderstood flawed people. It's certainly not Denzel Washington's fault, more the director and screenwriter. But the director put together a taut movie. Denzel Washington is subtle and superb in his performance. I have dissed him in the past for some of the characters he's played but this character and Denzel's performance are in a different category here. Denzel Washington deserves the Oscar. He's the movie. He's really getting better and inspiring for his mastery of his craft. This was not an easy character to portray. Denzel does it effortlessly. A real master turn for this top actor. The other actors were top notch also. In response to what someone else said, no Denzel's character wasn't responsible for the accident. Though, I think it would have been more interesting if they toyed with a different ending. But that's because I think the movie could have gone either way which is a nice thing to say about the director and screenwriter. Liked the movie, hated the nudity and porn stuff, but I get it -- the drug angle. Nevertheless, I can fast forward through that nonsense. But I think that subject matter will mean the Oscars are out of reach. The head guys can argue that it's for sake of realism but it's really for box office return."
"eonbluedan-1","6","1","2","6 February 2013"," Turbulent
","Denzel Washington plays Captain Whip Whitaker, a pilot who crash lands a plane in a way that, it is later proved, nobody else would even consider, let alone be able to execute successfully (it really is genius!); he saves almost everybody on board, and becomes a hero. How was he able to keep his head, while all around him were losing theirs, and perform this heroic and seemingly impossible feat? Was it being the expert pilot he is, or was his ingenuity and gutsy handling of the situation a result of being hopped up on cocaine, and enough alcohol to make driving a car illegal? Is his irresponsible action forgivable by virtue of the fact that, had he not been there, everybody would have died? This is the conundrum the movie explores, and it even ponders the possibility of higher power, divine guidance, and bigger plans than we can imagine for those in need. The latter theme may prove too lofty for some of the audience, and there are a couple of points, I must confess, where I felt it was a bit heavy-handed with the subject. Then again, it is a trait that seems to appeal to Zemeckis and so should come as little surprise; consider previous work such as The Polar Express, Forrest Gump and Cast Away. This, however, is not the only area that will feel familiar to Zemickis fans; the airplane disaster sequence is a few notched more frantic, bone-rattling and tense than the one we saw in Cast Away. It is also possibly the best sequence of its kind that I have ever seen, and I saw Peter Weir's Fearless, which says a lot! <br/><br/>After this incredible opening it becomes a psychological drama, a character study of a man with a problem. It was always going to be hard for the film to maintain its engagement level, but much like the plane, the second act does suffer more turbulence than I expected; Zemeckis certainly appears, at points, to be unable to marshal it all quite as well as has done previously. This is not to say there are not many terrific scenes and performances, indeed the film is performance driven, but there is no getting around the fact that some elements are mismanaged. A scene in which the co-pilot and his wife preach about God's plan for Whip comes off as a bit too humorous for the piece. John Goodman turns up a couple of times in a role which I would have dialled down a notch and developed more.<br/><br/>Other characters are underused, and relationships not given as much fleshing out as might have been helpful in adding dramatic weight; a great example here would be the flight attendant Margaret, who really should have had more screen time. Nicole, played by Kelly Reilly of Eden Lake and Sherlock Holmes fame, is a perfectly fine character who should have worked a bit like Marisa Tomei in The Wrestler, but unfortunately never has that sort of impact. The hour or so after the crash almost outstays its welcome by meandering a bit too much, which is ironic, given that there was a lot of under-developed story here. This is a shame, as there is a notable gear change for the final act of the movie, and we suddenly find ourselves back in a film that could have been flying high the whole way, had it been a bit more focused, and I daresay shorter.<br/><br/>All of this said, however, the most important element of Flight is the story and the arc of Captain Whitaker; casting the right man for the job was absolutely crucial to selling this whole thing. Washington reminds us, possibly for the first time since Training Day, how good he is at presenting not simply a good or bad guy, and not somebody we can easily say we like or dismiss, but rather the flawed human being. The heart of drama is conflict and this film is full of the stuff for all concerned, but most notably and interestingly, for us the audience. The study of the psychology of a man who will not, or cannot, face up to his demons is always compelling, and here we are brought to a point where we care about Whitaker, we want to see him redeemed.<br/><br/>Washington hits his highs and lows brilliantly, taking us with him; we find ourselves genuinely happy, and sincerely disappointed with him in equal measure, as we watch him struggle, wanting desperately to jump in and help him. It is a master actor who can get us to this point, and it is in fact mainly he, not the director, who pulls us through the muddy middle of the movie. The final forty minutes is a compelling performance, and the penultimate chapter showcases nothing short of a masterclass in acting. The finale of the story has been foreshadowed for some time through the film, we are ready and waiting for it, and so the fact Washington is still able to move us quite so intensely is a pleasant final lift. His delivery proves that the devil is in the details; there is no ""Hollywood-ing"" here, it is absolutely real, and as we watch him we see the quiet, subtle perfection that makes him worthy of his nomination.<br/><br/>Flight doesn't maintain its occasionally breathtaking altitude as consistently as I would have liked, but its star, and the phenomenal acts that sandwich a bloated middle, elevate it from the generic and make it one to watch."

","Spoiler ALERT-He ends up thanking god for getting sober. I'll never understand this: Where was god when he was getting drunk? And the co-pilot and his wife saying praise Jesus and praise god for saving them...What arrogance...like God choose to say F/you and die to the ones that died in the crash, but not to them. This movie is basically an advertisement for Alcoholics Anonymous. It plays like a cheesy morality driven movie of the week...total DRIBBLE! If you like that, you'll probably enjoy it. The flight crash scene was good and long and sort of interesting seeing the tricks he did. Only thing really good in the movie was John Goodmans performance and his character was humorous to watch, but still just another drug dealer so nothing original. For a man who wouldn't get sober for the love of his life (his wife) and his kid (who he also loved deeply), we are led to believe that betraying a girl he is having an affair with is this great precipitating event to get him sober...just AA nonsense, plain and simple. Sad cause I'm a fan of the director and of Denzel...oh well."

","In spite of the title, it would be a brave (or foolish) airline that screened this as an in- flight movie. It's not just the initial nudity, frequent strong language, regular snorting or injection of drugs, and repeated excess consumption of alcohol, it's that eponymous trip at altitude. A drunken lead pilot, a nervous co-pilot, a fierce storm and a suspected mechanical failure are not exactly reassuring motifs to flash in front of even hardened fliers.<br/><br/>Clearly this is the most adult movie of the career of director Robert Zemeckis who started with the ""Back To The Future"" trilogy and latterly has worked on motion-capture films for children. Equally it marks a new point in the acting trajectory of Denzel Washington, here playing the inebriated and arrogant pilot 'Whip' Whitaker, who first came to prominence in the role of secular saint Steve Biko and has, in recent years, portrayed a succession of less attractive and more morally complex characters as in ""Training Day"" and ""American Gangster"". This is one of the finest performances of his illustrious career.<br/><br/>The first half hour of the film is terrific and inevitably the remaining near two hours struggle to sustain the same grip and should perhaps have been a bit shorter, while the ending is possibly a little too moralistically neat, but this is a movie well-worth seeing - just not on your holiday flight."

","Flight tells the story of Whip Whitaker, a troubled man with an illegal substance addiction, who is an airline pilot. After a malfunction with the aircraft while in flight, Whip utilizes his piloting skills and saves 96 people of 102 on-board, in an ""act of God."" But after the crash, when he gets his blood tested, he tests positive for alcohol and cocaine. Whip must fight to avoid life in prison for accused manslaughter.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington stars as Whip Whitaker for which he received an Oscar Nomination and deservedly so in my opinion. I usually like Denzel and the films he is in, and this is no exception. He is fantastic and brilliantly portrays Whip. His ups and downs, his troubled life, he even implements the humor very well into his performance. The perfect pick for this role, in fact, the rest of the supporting actors were picked very well too, albeit their characters were generic and could've been played by most people, but they did well anyway.<br/><br/>Robert Zemeckis directs and is his return to live action after his stint into animated. And I welcome him back, the directing was very well done and depicting a plane crash is a hard thing to do, especially when it is done as well as it is in this, also considering it doesn't really last that long either. The writing, for which John Gatis received an Oscar is also well deserved. The film is filled with a lot of dialog ridden scenes and they are done very well. The jokes hit, the lows hit, everything hit me in the right places. A quick note that John Goodman was very good in his role and should have been in it more.<br/><br/>The plot is very good, very gripping and captivating. The character of Whip Whitaker is well done and I especially like the ending, I like endings like that. The ending was so impactive on me from the lines, directing and the deliverance of it all by Denzel. The film could have benefited a lot from trimming a bit of it off however as there was a point when it became a tiny bit dragged out. But aside from that it was fantastic and one of the very few films to attain my emotional involvement in a protagonist for a long time. Very well done."
"lazyaceuk","7","1","2","30 January 2013"," Denzel delivers
","To me 'Flight' is an intriguing film in that it was not abundantly clear as to its target audience. Overall the film does work partly because of strong performances by the cast and good pacing from the Director (Robert Zemeckis).<br/><br/>Denzel Washington plays Captain Whip Whittaker who it is quite clear from scene one lives life on the edge. Bearing in mind Whittaker is an commercial airline pilot this is probably not exactly something he would like to mention on his CV. And he does not. Whittaker likes drink, drugs and women but this does not appear to affect his ability as a pilot and it is clear that the in flight crew are used to the drill of 'coffee and headache pills' before take off.<br/><br/>However, on one fateful day, after another heavy night with his current 'squeeze' who is also one of the in flight crew, God appears to test Whittaker's mettle. He finds he is saddled with an unknown 1st Officer and conditions are not exactly conducive for taking 106 people into the air in a steel cigar full of fuel. Whittaker spooks his 1st Officer by some unconventional flying to find 'clear sky' and hardly keeps his confidence high by having a mid flight doze. All seems well though until the plane starts its final approach and things go badly wrong with the plane proving that it should never have left the ground in the first place, storm or shine. Even with his foibles Whittaker still proves that he is a top pilot and brings the plane in to land with minimum loss of life.<br/><br/>So that is that.<br/><br/>Well not really. This is the point where the film moves from action to melodrama and the other plot line which had been tracking that of Whittaker and his team aligns. Nicole (Kelly Reilly), an addict, and Whittaker meet on a stairwell of the hospital for a sneaky smoke. Relationships are formed and soon Nicole is living with Whittaker but it is an uneasy relationship as Nicole fights to lose her demons and Whittaker seems happy to continue along a personal path of destruction. Even more so after the crash.<br/><br/>Key to Whittaker's life choice is the impending court case that results from the four fatalities from the fated flight. Was Whittaker incompetent through intoxication or was it truly 'The Hand of God'? A rather queasy visit with Whittaker's 1st Officer in hospital hints at the latter, the National Transportation Board though has other ideas.<br/><br/>Zemeckis gets strong performances from his cast and also shows that he has a sense of humour in the placement of various songs within the film, with Marvin Gaye warbling ""What's Going On?"" as Nicole decides to unexpectedly seduce Whittaker and ""A Little Help From My Friends"" as Whittaker is spruced in readiness for the NTSB hearing. John Goodman as Harling Mays the supplier of Whittaker's vices (""I'm on the list !"") provides some excellent, almost scene stealing, cameo moments, but this is Denzel's film and he is worthy of star billing for his solid and certain performance.<br/><br/>7/10."
"alecwest","7","1","2","26 January 2013"," Great film but not without flaws.
","NOTE - THERE ARE POTENTIAL (and real) SPOILERS THROUGHOUT THIS REVIEW.<br/><br/>This is probably not going to be a politically-correct review. The politically correct part is that the film dealt with a pilot coming to terms with lifelong alcoholism and substance abuse ... admitting guilt perhaps due to an epiphany he had when he realized that he was possibly ""part"" of the problem that caused the crash.<br/><br/>The film's plot was well acted and well played out. However, given the known facts presented in the film, I was left with the impression that the crash (and fatalities) would have occurred regardless of whether or not the pilot was sober.<br/><br/>During the meeting between the union and management, it was clear that management considered the event a matter of pilot negligence. The union, however, pointed out that the toxicology test given to the pilot was invalid due to 3 critical errors made during the test. In short, the union was telling management that the NTSB could not use the test against the pilot ... and that ""management"" could not use the test for disciplinary purposes. But, the union also pointed out (rightfully so) that the aircraft had issues - and that they planned to pursue ""manufacturing defect"" as the cause of the crash.<br/><br/>Then came the surprise. During the NTSB hearing, they released findings indicating that the crash situation came about because a ""screw"" that should have been replaced a year earlier had NOT been replaced. This put the onus (blame) squarely on their airline for poor maintenance. And the intoxication of the pilot (or lack thereof) would have made no difference to that defective screw.<br/><br/>The thing that left me scratching my head was the NTSB testimony about the two tiny vodka bottles. It doesn't make any difference whether or not the pilot suspended drink service. Consider this.<br/><br/>How many of us have gone to grocery stores to buy candies, etc. - later going to a theater to see a film? I have, that's for sure - because I know that candy from Walmart is much cheaper than theater candy. Likewise, it's much cheaper to buy those tiny liquor bottles from a liquor store than it is on a plane. Individual passengers could have brought the tiny bottles on board ... and those two vodka bottles could have been put there by the flight crew as part of their patrol to pick up trash. With two flight attendants dead, there'd be no way to know for sure what they did or didn't do in that regard.<br/><br/>So OK, the pilot was intoxicated. But his grand admission near the end of the film did nothing to remove blame from the airline for poor maintenance on the screw that caused the accident. And whether or not one of the dead flight attendants had an alcohol problem is neither here nor there because the origin of the bottles could have been one or more passengers. And THAT is a possibility the NTSB didn't consider.<br/><br/>(Devil's advocate mode) - Had I been the pilot, and after knowing of the mechanical failure of that screw (and that it was the airline's fault), I wouldn't have felt guilty at all. Even the NTSB said his handling of the crisis was great (and people in the hearing audience responded with applause when the NTSB said so). Rather, I'd have seen this as a wake-up call. Due to the stress of the accident, I'd have requested a one-year leave of absence to deal with the stress. During that downtime, I'd have gone into substance abuse rehab on my own dime. And if successful, I'd likely have courted employment with other airlines who'd be more than happy to hire a ""hero.""<br/><br/>P.S. I'm a 64 year-old guy who doesn't drink or use any medication (even aspirin) ... outside of the glipizide I take for my type 2 diabetes. And while I see intoxication as a serious issue while operating any vehicle, I sometimes wonder if, in some cases, intoxication is used as a ""scapegoat"" to minimize the effect of other factors involved in an accident. Drunk is drunk and stoned is stoned. But broken is also broken.<br/><br/>This movie would have been much different if it had featured the inappropriate service record of the aircraft (and its ""screw"") as the overriding plot device ... with the pilot's alcohol/drug use as a minor player in the incident. Remember that even sober pilots recreating the incident in simulation killed every passenger on board. The ""affected"" pilot, on the other hand, saved all but 6 passengers. Clearly, without the defective part, the flight would have likely been uneventful ... even if the pilot was intoxicated (since a sober/trained copilot was also onboard)."

","Flight an investigation addiction drama staring Denzel Washington better then he has ever been. Flight an airline pilot saves a flight from crashing, but an investigation into the malfunctions reveals something troubling in a different long style. Flight from a high octane tense edge of your seat plane crash opening beginning things slow down as we learn about Addiction and one man's serious down ward spiral for which you think why is he doing this to yourself and that drink is the devils juice. Flight is very little on action or fun it is a drama that focus on Washington's character Whip Whitaker and his struggle with drink and drugs in a way that will have you gripped till the end. Flight is griping by all accounts it is not action and not full of planes crashing we just have the opening scene which is realstic and imaging if you were on that plane and what you would go through will be going through your mind (also I would advise that you don't watch this if your going on your holiday any time soon) and it is basically one man's fight to get out of the ditch he is in, but a good one. Flight the acting is on top form (Bruce Greenwood, Don Cheadle and many more) all praise must go to Denzel Washington who is amazing (even though I have to be honest and say I have not really seen many of his films but from what I have seen this is the best he has been) playing a complex character with major issues drink drugs, his wife and son leaving and crashing/saving the plane. Flight will leave you feeling good not overpowered as there is no light at the end of the tunnel but what keeps you hanging is the truth will he admit what he has done or keep living a lie. Flight is a 2 hour journey of a man's despair and self destruction but if you let this flick you will feel yourself hanging on till the accepting climax and it will leave you wish a strange feeling as you have not just watched an action packed flick you just feel good about this man's life once again. Flight in short it is a long well made flick of addiction but don't expect a blockbuster but do expect great acting and an intriguing story."

","Good but not great. The parts of the movie in the air plane are quite cinematic; the rest of the film feels a bit like a biblical story of redemption. IF it weren't for the in-flight sequences, I think this movie could have been a made for TV drama. I'm not sure if I'm doing justice to the movie with this review here, but it's a big movie and many critics probably have written a lot about the acting the directing the suspense, and yes the disappointments as well. Overall I felt the movie overshoots it's script by trying to cover a very complex issue in a very abridged way. Much like what my review is doing to the movie. Don't get me wrong, Flight is not a waste of time at all, but not the best vehicle for some of the great actors driving the movie...to me this film never quite manages to take Flight."

","Sometimes we believe those at the top of the chain are some kind of super humans, you know as in who am I to question a doctor of medicine for example. Truth is no matter how high one functions, that person is still a fallible human being. Flight is a look into man, who even as he surely saved lives in a situation where he was not at fault, ultimately failed himself as well as countless others. If this sounds uncomfortably powerful you sense the core of what makes the movie Flight, staring Denzel Washington, worth your time to watch and, hopefully, ponder.<br/><br/>Could a plane accident be avoided by better engineering of a several hundred dollar part? Could the strictest maintenance procedures correctly adhered to circumvent a preventable accident? Does any of this matter if the pilot of a doomed airliner performs a miracle of flying, one where many lives saved, yet said pilot is performing while under the influence of alcohol and drugs? These are the questions the viewer is forced to ruminate over. There is great discomfort involved because Denzel Washington's excellent portrayal of an equally likable/detestable flawed human being, who willingly has taken on this responsibility, but has miserably failed even while he has performed a statistically impossible miracle.<br/><br/>Flight is in no way a typical Hollywood vehicle for anyone. It is a picture of grievous loss in which innocent people are caught, some even dying. Flight isn't pleasant, but it is extremely compelling in its nakedness of the reality of the human condition. Big business makes less than perfect airplanes, airlines do not always do everything possible to catch impending disasters, and finally those in positions of utter infallibility still fail. Sometimes all of the above come tragically together for an outcome. Flight is the story of a very real possibility of this. I applaud all involved, especially director Robert Zemeckis and actor Denzel Washington (who turns in a performance worth of a Oscar), for bringing a extremely upsetting portrait of the confluence of events resulting in a absolutely avoidable tragedy.<br/><br/>Saving for the last, and quite powerful in its compactness, is a scene with Denzel, imprisoned yet finally being free of his addictions, begins to bond with the son he never really knew. A short segment that speaks volumes about a man facing his demons and starting to heal. This movie is worthy of your time, a powerful study in human frailty - don't miss it."

If you are looking for that type of Denzel Washington fare, this is not the movie for you. This movie has many underlying facets to the storyline. It is thought provoking in many ways.

I would recommend this movie to adults only and warn about the beginning scenes. I like movies where you forget you are in a theater and this movie fills the bill.

"msmith5484","8","1","2","5 December 2012"," A powerful performance
","Every addict in recovery will tell of their 'moment of clarity', that defining moment when they truly realize their life is unmanageable. For Whip Whitaker (Denzel)it begins with a plane crash, which Whip manages expertly, averting great tragedy with minimal loss of life. This sequence is well crafted and harrowing. In it's aftermath he cleans up... for a while. He meets Nicole(Kelly Reilly)an addict trying to straighten up after overdosing. Fortunately this 'romance' doesn't interfere with the greater narrative as they often do. Whip is divorced and estranged from his teen son who is more angry that Whip is a horrible father than he is happy his dad's not dead. Whip is also facing legal troubles as his drunken state may put him in jail for the deaths of several passengers. When Whip finally takes responsibility and accountability, it is then he is heroic.<br/><br/>Both Zemeckis and Washington are subtle with their craft in this movie, which helps ground it. Without this steadiness it could have veered off into melodrama. It's easy to see why addicts are able to destroy so much. We want to excuse Whip's or any addict's behavior because we can, or want to, see the better person underneath the alcohol and drugs and hope that they'll see it too and change. But you cannot reason with the physical addiction and the psychological compulsion and until presented with a mirror powerful enough to let the addict see themselves, they will not change."

","Anybody who ever goes into a job where your actions affect the public, such as a bus driver, a pilot or an Air Traffic Controller (such as myself), should watch this movie. There is a lot more to this movie than a pilot with exceptional experience and skill saving a plane and lives. It's about obtaining a position that is considered to be ""In The Public Trust"". I can assure the flying public however that there is drug testing and abusers are normally caught well before they get into the level of abuse that the character in this movie reached, or any substance abuse really. But there are those that may find a way to get around the protocols. Bottom line, this is a great movie and is extremely riveting. Denzel brings a level of credibility to the role that really makes it believable and I loved how when push came to shove, he proved he did have morals and did the right thing. definitely worth the money !!!!"

While some may find this plot compelling, I just found it sad. Almost the whole movie is sad and the ending was not uplifting enough for me.<br/><br/>This movie is about a single man, where it seems to me that it could have covered much larger topics.

But I recommend for people to see this movie. It is entertaining and the acting is fantastic. Of course, if you are afraid of flying, you might not want to see this movie because it will only confirm you fear. John Goodman's character is great. For those of you who use recreation drugs, his character is the one you want to be your dealer. He plays a small part, but he steals the scenes he is in.

"wricketts","6","1","2","11 November 2012"," Never really takes ""Flight""
","A watchable but decidedly not a great film. Washington is his usual opaque self here, and his struggle to convey actual emotion is at times more difficult to watch than are the tough feelings he's supposed to be expressing. For years I've had the sense that there was something slightly cold and detached inside Washington as an actor. It's a style that serves him very well in hard-ass, semi-sociopath roles such as in Training Day, but makes him hard to believe when he plays characters with real emotional depth and whose inner turmoil ought to make us weep. All in all, the pacing of this film is mind-numbingly slow and dramatic tension is diluted by too many inconsequential scenes, including most of the opening sequences involving co-star Kelly Reilly, whose parallel story of addiction turns out to have just about exactly nothing whatever to do with anything. A scene involving a conversation in a hospital stairwell among Washington, Reilly, and James Badge Dale as a mysterious, incoherent, smack-talking terminal cancer patient– which the audience is supposed to understand as A Deeply Meaningful Message – is one of the most glaring of the film's several painfully superficial shaggy dog stories. The film's moment of Great Moral Reckoning, which comes as Washington's Whitaker is on the witness stand during an NTSB hearing, is unbelievable from start to finish—first because the chief investigator would never have asked the question that results in Whitaker's epiphany and, second, because the film deliberately fails to provide the elements necessary to grasp why Whitaker behaves as he does in that moment. His decision seems arbitrary—as does his almost every act throughout the film. John Goodman, as Whitaker's pusher, reprises his Arachnophobia role to no great effect."
"warlund71","6","1","2","11 November 2012"," This film is destined never to be an in-flight movie!
","It's indisputable to say that ""Flight"" was deceptive in its marketing (as a previous poster suggested): where the trailers make it out to be a familiar something with a couple of surprises and maybe an original twist to it at the end. No, not really. Like with Zemeckis's ""Cast Away,"" the film was probably about 45 minutes longer than it needed to be. Regardless though, Denzel commanded the whole movie: was in almost every scene, and added dimensionality to what could have been a ho-hum/ been-there-done- that–type of movie. I think if they had more Don Cheadle and flashbacks of Washington's association with the flight attendant as opposed to the heroin-addicted girl (in where their boring relationship seems to be by-the-numbers of a recovering 12-step meets addict-in-denial), it would have been a far better film. Suffice to say, the supporting roles were just as good. Bruce Greenwood wasn't much different than in a lot of other films he's in, but Don Cheadle WAS! He didn't have much screen-time, and I wished he did. John Goodman was, well, good, and reminded me of almost a darker and more weathered version of Zach Garalflickisisisis (sic) from ""Due Date"" and the ""Hangover"" movies. Someone also commented how the co-pilot was a ""stereotype"" as well. I don't agree. I thought it was plausible for him to panic when the plane was going to crash- since in an earlier scene, he hints his inexperience when questioning Denzel's judgment to ""turn 30 degrees"" in order to get out of the clouds. When Denzel commandeered the crash-landing, his demeanor wasn't panic-ridden in which I also found plausible since he was a veteran military pilot in the Navy (as Bruce Greenwood later stated). He had a lot of flight-time behind him, but because of his mental state with the drugs and alcohol, who's to say (and paraphrasing Washington) how much of it and even when it felt like a ""video game"" to him? <br/><br/>Although there were predictable elements to it, they weren't badly done. All in all, ""Flight"" was good, but it could have been better. I think I'd see it again for the crashand the opening scene. But then afterward, I'd know my cue when to run out for more popcorn!"

The plot may not have been the hardest to follow or even predict but it was still very well acted and a pleasure to watch unfold. A good two hours spent and well worth the admission price. I think John Goodman and Don Cheadel also did fine jobs of playing their parts in this film. I wish Tamara Tunie had more of a role. I think she's an overlooked actress.

","Flight 2012 Robert Zemekis<br/><br/>Flight lands in theaters today and I just walked out of the theater on a high after seeing this modern day real life story. There will be no jet lag from this drama that portrays the main character ""Whip"" played by Denzel Washington with a performance to be talked about. Flight takes you on a journey about an addict coming to ties with his lifestyle and the need for the constant adrenaline rush and using substance to cope with life's trials and tribulations. . The story depicted closely resembles real-life events occurred in 2001, when Canadian Captain Robert Piche skillfully glided a fuel-less Airbus 330 to a safe landing, saving 306 passengers from a certain crash. Becoming an overnight hero, he quickly learned the other side of fame when a journalist exposed his long forgotten criminal past and private life. However the plane never flew inverted. The film mirrors his life story, not the events of the landing Robert Zemekis best known for Back to the Future, shows great use of symmetry between flying high in the air and needing that adrenalin rush, compared to getting high from chemical substances dealing with life. This is one of Robert Zemkis's first live-action movies since Cast Away as well as his first rated R movie since Used Cars. This movie has strong language, drug-use and sexual content, which is needed to show real life and what it is like to overcome drug addiction. Denzel Washington gives us an academy award performance from what I will think he will win over Daniel Day-Lewis in Lincoln. Although I feel Lincoln will probably take the best picture award this year, being directed by Steven Spielberg, Flight will defiantly be in the running. This may be the best performance of a drunk I have seen in a long time without the cliché slurring and stumbling over one's self. You can tell Denzel did his homework on how to play someone who just drank a case of beer and two fifths of Vodka. Flight is 2 hours and 18 mins long but you are glued to the screen from the very beginning and I even felt myself clinching to the seat as if I were on the plane itself. Flight shows the struggles and challenges of an addict and what can be lost from drugs and drinking. It shows how addiction will have its consequence without you even knowing it and that there will come a time when you have to come to grips with reality and stop lying to ones self. It is a movie of today and even has the first Iphone I have seen in a movie in a long time. I give this movie a 88 out of 100 based on my popcorn chart that I would like to start if anyone will give me a freelance job to review movies. I wish to one day have my own review in a paper such as yours with my own column. I am a recovering addict which I feel why this movie hit me so hard, but I am clean and sober now for 6 months and starting my new life.

And then his political affiliation was not desirable.<br/><br/>I think Denzel or his manager may finally be getting it....Denzel made a statement many years ago that he would not do any intimate or romantic scenes with a woman of another race. He stuck to it for many years but it lessened the staying power of some of the movies, i.e. ""Pelican Brief"". ""Flight"" and the scenes added to the movie, so that we could see how deeply he was in his alcoholism. He is a good actor and he did well in this one. I don't know if the statement is ""he is back""...but it may be more apropos to say he or his manager/agent have learned what it takes to make a whole movie. Flight was a little long, but in looking at each part I can't see what could have been edited to shorten the movie.<br/><br/>My only issues are; there seems to be a disconnect with his drinking and the flying of the plane versus the actual issues.<br/><br/>Yes it is absolutely not acceptable that he should drink, be drunk or high flying or driving any thing. In this movie, I fault the Air Traffic Controllers. Shouldn't they have known the weather was that bad and not allow the plane to take off? <br/><br/>Secondly, 40 minutes before it lands, ""he tells us later, the plane comes apart in mid air"" this is when we the audience thought all was clear with the weather..maybe there should have been scenes of a botched maintenance inspection, this part was a little disconnected.<br/><br/>I love the music score and I would be remiss if I didn't say ""Mr. Don Cheadle"" in this and as always is a great actor! and again he proves that in Attorney role. ""Flight"" may not get Denzel another award but its relatively entertaining."

","Avoid at all costs. This movie is nothing more than a Hollywood over-glamorized melodramatic weak-plotted alcohol and drug guilt-trip. Even Denzel's great acting can't save this dive bomb. It is in the toilet... flush it, and let it go. I watched this movie while there was a glitch on Netflix and could not access the movies on my saved list, or much of anything else. I even looked it up on IMDb and saw that it received a very high rating from many different reviewers and critics alike. How disappointed I was! The worst part is that this movie never even changes course. It is a dive-bomb from the beginning. The movie starts with nudity and partying, and then heads directly into one massive guilt trip. there is no development in the plot, or any of the characters. Even Denzel's character, which critics praised him for, is uninteresting and undeveloped. The entire movie is basically a glamorized guilt trip about a fictitious accident. A DUI in the sky.

","Having just watched this film I have to say that I was very surprised. I have long suspected that Hollywood has grown utterly incapable of producing a decent movie. Flight proves me wrong and I have never been happier to be wrong. Denzel Washington is and always has been 'the' reason to watch the movie, but Flight has such a compelling story and a very strong supporting cast (most notably Goodman) that the entire enterprise excels in every way. As movie watchers we want to be gripped, engaged. We want to empathize with the characters and feel that we know them almost on a personal level. Flight delivers that in spades. At first I thought this was just going to be another 'American hero' story, and then I suspected that is was just another addiction story like Clean and Sober, but in actuality this is a rare gem that keeps you guessing until you find yourself absolutely absorbed by the realism of Washington's lead. SPOILER: The moment in the hearing when he decides enough is enough was such a beautiful surprise. Overall this was a very good film and I strongly urge you to watch it. You will not be disappointed."

He far excelled both of the above actors in acting potential in Flight.

","Boy, Denzel Washington really uses his acting chops to play such a flawed character who's both heroic and pathetic! I mean, he's a pilot who manages to save most of his passengers on a plane that obviously wasn't very functional when he boarded it despite his drinking and having a snort just several hours ago. That's just for starters on what is perhaps the most compelling dramatic picture of the year directed with a sure hand by Robert Zemeckis in another of his surprise moves since he's usually associated with more commercially entertaining movies like Back to the Furure or Who Framed Roger Rabbit? Well, not everything here is meant for serious thinking as John Goodman is a great hoot as his supplier! But just seeing the range Washington displays here is enough for me to highly recommend Flight wholeheartedly. So if you like something more challenging for your brain, see it!"

","Director Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future, Forrest Gump, What Lies Beneath) had not directed a live action film since Cast Away, as he has spent time making motion capture computer animated films The Polar Express, Beowulf and A Christmas Carol, it was good to see him return with this one. Basically Whip Whitaker (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Denzel Washington) is an airline captain for South Jet Air, he is a cocaine addict and alcoholic, and he is having an affair with flight attendant Katerina 'Trina' Marquez (Nadine Velazquez), following the divorce from his estranged ex-wife. He one night spends his time in Orlando taking drinking alcohol and cocaine, and the following morning he pilots Flight 227 to Atlanta, and all of the sudden something goes wrong with the engineering during turbulence, forcing him to attempt to the fly the craft upside down, and spinning back over and crash land. He awakes in hospital with minor injuries, and he is told by his old friend Charlie Anderson (Bruce Greenwood) that ninety six out of one hundred and two people on the flight survived the crash, the four passengers and two crew members died, one being Trina, but for saving these many lives he is seen as a hero of sorts. But then he meets lawyer Hugh Lang (Don Cheadle) who informs him that he had high levels of alcohol and cocaine in his blood tests, so he and the union are investigating what really happened during the flight, and more specifically whether or not Whip was intoxicated. If he is found guilty of piloting a plane under the influence of substances he could face life imprisonment, so he does his best to stay sober for the next few days before going to court to defend himself, but his addiction gets the better of him. Having struggled with alcoholism and drug addiction for so long, during trial he convinces himself that he could get out of the situation, but in the end he accepts that he is guilty and is honest about his intoxication the day of the flight, so he does indeed go to prison, for five years, losing his pilot licence as well. Also starring Kelly Reilly as Nicole, John Goodman as Harling Mays, Melissa Leo as Ellen Block, Brian Geraghty as Ken Evans, Tamara Tunie as Margaret Thomason, James Badge Dale as Gaunt Young Man, Garcelle Beauvais as Deana, Peter Gerety as Avington Carr and Piers Morgan. Washington gives a fine performance as the man suffering personal demons and struggling to overcome his addictions, he is obviously the main reason to see this film and was a good choice for an Oscar nomination, Goodman is likable as his jolly drug dealer, and there is some small element of romance with Reilly as a recovering heroin addict. The most exciting part of the film is of course the plane going out of control and crashing, but it does get interesting as it goes on with the man unable to stop himself and the courtroom sequence, I admit it was slow for some time in the middle, but overall it is a relatively good drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Original Screenplay. Very good!"

Then, over the weekend, I got talking to a girl who worked on a plane, and she gave all the reasons I'd been looking for, too make ""flight"" not quite as awesome as some are making out.<br/><br/>For those that don't know. ""Flight"" is about an alcoholic pilot. Who saves a bunch off people when he pulls off some amazing moves too crash land a doomed plane too safety.<br/><br/>Now I'm not going to argue about Denzel Washington's performance. Denzels the man here, as always. He pulls off being a drunk probably better than most. Trouble is, I felt no sympathy for the character. Maybe that's not the films intent. But showing the main characters disregard for anyone other than himself, makes for some uncomfortable viewing. OK, he saves a bunch off people, but he also flies a plane while drunk/drugged up and then tries too get away with it! I guess looking at an alcoholic from a mixed up perspective like this is what makes ""Flight"" almost different, but making out that a pilot could even get away with such behaviour in such an important job, is totally unrealistic, and suggesting that anyone could fly a plane while intoxicated (Let alone fly it better) is almost insulting to anyone who can actually do it.<br/><br/>I Suppose it is just a movie, and it did hold my interest, so its not a bad one. Its worth viewing because it will no doubt be viewed differently by everyone. Though it could quite easily be viewed as promoting drink and drugs as a good things. A message a director off mostly kids movies, probably shouldn't be sending out there."

An addict, on the day of the tragic flight he wakes up after snorting cocaine the night before and mixes vodka in his orange juice aboard the plane. Not due to his fault the plane hits some issues and ends up floating upside down before being landed by him, an act for which he is considered a hero. However, upon drug test reposts it is realized that he was indeed inebriated and then the judicial system comes into play. This is a good movie and features a harrowing plane crash sequence.

"imseeg","10","1","3","6 August 2018"," Does one choose to drink, or NOT? Magnificent psychological portrait of a drunk. One of Denzel Washington's best performances of his entire carreer.
","I feel this is one of the best psychological portraits of a drunk. And simultaneously I believe this is one of the best performances of Denzel Washington's entire carreer. I have seen ALL his films, from the eighties till now. This performance just makes me silent, in awe... I wanna advice the fans of other very popular Denzel Washington actionmovies to think twice though, because this is not a regular fun packed action movie at all. It is more suited for the arthouse movie lover, who is into subtle portraits of human shortcomings. This is an intelligent, slowburning movie with lots of room for dialogues. I love it, but the masses might find it boring.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington's character is severely addicted to alcohol, but he is in full denial. While being drunk he shouts: ""I choose to drink, because I dont speak to my wife and son anymore. But I choose to not speak to them anymore and therefore I choose to drink"". Does this make any sense? To an alcoholic it perhaps does.<br/><br/>Booze is harder to get clean of than many other harddrug, like heroin for instance. Booze is everywhere. Temptation to start drinking again lurks around every corner. Only the alcholic himself can decide to make a clean start. First he must acknowledge though that he is a drunk. Then he must have something to live for, when being sober. Otherwise the temptation to surpress the inner mental pain wont go away after being sober and will trigger another drinking rampage. And another..<br/><br/>Director Robert Zemeckis isnt know for dramas at all. A few years later he made ""Allied"" with Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, another great subtle portrait of deceit. And deceit is what lies beneath any addiction too, because one has to fool oneself into believing that drugs are the cure to make any pain go away.It does for the short term, that's why drugs are so evil, they lure you in with their promise of quick relief of any pain, but drugs slowly destroy your soul in the long run...<br/><br/>I wanna give lots of praise for the soundtrack, editing, photography and direction. This is one of those dramas in which everthing just worked out perfect. Powerful and subtle. Doomed, yet still hopeful. Those extremes come to mind, thinking about ""Flight"". I believe this to be THE masterpiece of director Robert Zemeckis' entire carreer.<br/><br/>In memory of Ed Limato (1936-2010)"

I was invested in the film emotionally the whole way through and whilst toward the middle of the film I felt there was perhaps a little too much dialog and not enough actually happening that was all negated by the touching end to the film and the emotional response it created in me.

Airplane movies, where happens accidents and someone rescues the plane, that was my expectation at the beginning. The film started already very dramatically, the weather was bad, takeoff was heavy because of the turbulence etc. I enjoyed watching how Denzel Washington does an awesome job as a captain and so calmly. He saves the plane from the worse, doing professional movements. When he landed, things suddenly changed, he was accused of murder. Why? After this successful crash landing? The things took a new turn, when I saw that he was alcoholic, he had to answer the questions. Of course it was bit unfair, but seeing what was he able to do, to get his drinks and drugs, nothing was normal anymore. After being convicted, he was imprisoned. He told his story to his son, whom he was not in a good relationship. It was thought- provoking, it's hard to describe with words, these emotions...

"NateWatchesCoolMovies","10","1","3","22 July 2016"," Not at all what you would expect, in the best possible way
","When I saw the marketing and trailer hype for Robert Zemeckis's Flight, I was strongly under the impression that when I got around to seeing it I'd get a conspiracy style thriller. Some aviation intrigue, maybe a little government corruption, valiantly unveiled by Denzel Washington's hotshot pilot protagonist. How very wrong I was. To my credit, it wasn't my fault, but that of the severely misleading marketing. But then, how do you market a film like this? Hell, it's a wonder it even made it past the pitching stage! The airplane related fiasco one sees in the previews is but a tiny segment that acts as at catalyst for one of the most searing and honest portraits of addiction I've ever seen. Washington is Whip Whittaker, senior pilot, ladies man, assured professional and severe drug and alcohol user. Whip snorts and guzzles day and night, including during the job. He's functional and hides it well, but thats just another facet of his problem. When an onboard malfunction causes crisis on one of his flights, he takes a giant leap of faith, spectacularly landing the airplane upside down and essentially saving every passenger's life. End of story? Not really. From there the film throws a curveball, as we dig deeper into Whip's life, habits and history. An inquiry is launched into his mental state during the event, led by a stern and silky voiced Melissa Leo. His superiors do everything to defend him, but it becomes clear that he has been coming apart at the seams for sometime now, and the incident was one of the final rips. It's a journey into one man's refusal to admit his problems, and the often extreme ways in which life holds up a mirror in front of us and demands acceptance. Kelly Reilly is superb as a damaged girl he meets who tries to take his hand and lead down the way to fixing what is broken, but he's pretty damn far off the path. John Goodman is his charismatic self as Whip's groovy drug dealer, and Bruce Greenwood reliably steals scenes as an airline official determind to defend Whip to the bitter end. Washington is heartbreaking, especially in the scenes of alcohol abuse, which are tough to watch. He's never had a character arc quite like this, and it's one of the most special, vital gifts of acting he has ever given us. The look, feel and tone of the film is anything but gritty or depressing. It has a glossy, aesthetic sheen to it that barely hints at the commotion and strife which befalls it's lead character. Perhaps this was Zemeckis's intention: dazzle us out of the gate with crisp frames and bright cinematography and then blindside us with the darker elements, showing us in the process that such issues can befall any one of us in society, no matter how outwardly successful, confident or in control we seem. The film is as complex as it's protagonist and begs the audience to empathize with him on his journey, despite the glaring shortcomings we observe. It's one of the most human stories I've ever seen; two hours spent with a realistic person who is assured, broken, confused, scared, stubborn, strong willed, weak and deeply wounded all at the same time. Washington paints the picture for us momentously, and it's the best work he's ever done. You don't get too many films like this released by the studio system, and this one is some kind of miracle."

He is a favorite actor for me and deserves more attention for his work. The casting was excellent. Kelly Reilly has a certain kind of style to her acting and she fit the Nichole part well.

When you look at the trailer, you just think the movie is about a crash, and how a pilot saved the lives of many, but when you watch the movie it's so much more than that. Denzel Washington did another fantastic acting job in a role that i think no one else could play. Whip( Denzel's Character) has too much going on in his life and he can change up his outlook when he gets around a certain group of people. Throughout the movie you don't know if you want to see him make it or see his downfall, your opinion of him is always back and forth. There are multiple times in the movie when my opinion of him would change and it was like this from the very first scene, to the very last scene of the movie. All in all, i would recommend this movie for everyone. It's crazy that a movie like this could be filled with so much suspense; but then again, it is a Denzel movie."
"estreet-eva","5","1","3","4 December 2014"," Heavy right-wing ideological bent (if you like that sort of thing)
","""Flight"" takes us through some of the more conservative ideological elements you'll see in notoriously liberal Hollywood's output. The baddies come from the ranks of unionized workers - specifically the airline pilot's union. Bruce Greenwood's union representative gets portrayed as actively protecting the union's interest without regard to the flying public's safety from alcohol and drug-dependent pilots especially Denzel Washington's lead character here. Well below Greenwood's character on the morality scale lies Don Cheadle's union lawyer who delights in using technical arguments to squash evidence of Washington's ""Whip"" wrong-doing. White Southern businessman Avington Carr (Peter Gerety) gets to be the moral consciousness of the piece willing to let the airline go down rather than hide Whip's wrongdoing and outraged that it becomes clear that Whip will walk if he can just stay sober and keep up the lies. <br/><br/>As far as the actual movie behind the ideology, it famously received criticism for a marketing campaign portraying it as an action movie when it is very much a television-scale interior drama with a brief CGI-heavy plane crash as the only real action. Theoretically, staging the plane crash ate a lot of the budget as the remainder of the film seems distractingly cheap. Particularly in a scene where Whip drunkenly attacks his wife and son in the foyer of their Atlanta house, the audience is very aware they are watching a movie. Another major element that breaks the suspension of disbelief is Zemeckis' use of the Rolling Stone's version of ""Sympathy for the Devil"" in the scenes where John Goodman's drug dealer appears. Contrasted against largely silent scenes, the choice feels gimmicky. Not gimmicky but without real importance is the ""B-Plot"" of Katerina Marquez's drug addiction - she never really develops or plays a meaning part in Whip's coming to terms with his addictions and lies. <br/><br/>Having said all this, kudos to Zemeckis and writer John Gatins for a realistic and honest portrayal of a unpleasant anti-hero much in the vein of ""Mad Men""'s Don Draper and ""Breaking Bad""'s Walter White. The motivations feel real across the cast. The writing could have used a few light moments as the story is more something you get through (like Carson McCormick's ""The Road"") than actually enjoy. <br/><br/>In short, fans of realistic television dramas who do not need someone to root for and are comfortable with moral ambiguity (cleverly the movie leaves open the question of whether Whip's intoxication during the crash actually helped him stay calm and tap into his creativity to same the passengers), this may be a film you would enjoy."

Whitaker miraculously saves many lives, leaving six dead sadly. After being called a hero on national news, his medical tests show he had drugs and alcohol in his system causing him to be involved in a court case. 'Flight; is a very entertaining film. John Gatins powerful screenplay shows a very interesting main character. The story shows Whip's hard personal life as he deals with drug addiction and alcoholism as well as past family issues with his wife and son. Many metaphors in the title of this film make Gatins' screenplay brilliant and Oscar- worthy. Denzel Washington gives one of the best performances of his career! He helps portray an excellent character with rich emotions and he captures the struggles in humanity. Zemmeckis directs 'Flight' excellently. His plane crash scene is one of the most intense scenes in film history. While viewing this film, ask yourself if you need to take 'Flight' and change. That's the message of the film, and it shows how doing the right thing and redeeming yourself can lead to a smooth flight with no turbulence as you reach your final destination."

","Flight is stars Denzel Washington.It is a story about Whip Whitaker, an airline pilot who miraculously crash lands his plane after it suffers an in-flight mechanical failure and manages to save most of the people on board.The cast also includes Don Cheadle,Kelly Reilly,John Goodman,Bruce Greenwood,Melissa Leo and Nadine Velasquez.The Academy Award nominated screenplay written by John Gatins was loosely based on the actual events of the 2000 crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 that left no survivors behind. Robert Zemeckis directed the film.<br/><br/>Whip Whitaker is a seasoned airline pilot.While flying a plane from Florida to Georgia,the engines fails and got into a mid-air catastrophe.Realizing that they won't make it to the runaway,he decided to roll the plane upright and make a controlled landing in an open field at Clayton County.He loses consciousness and was taken to the hospital. When he awakens in an Atlanta hospital with moderate injuries,he is greeted by his old friend Charlie Anderson,who represents the airline's pilots union.After that meeting,the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) official informs him he manages to save ninety-six out of one hundred two people on board and they are conducting an investigation behind the accident.Aside from the NTSB investigation,we also get to see Whip coming into grips with reality particularly with his addiction to drugs and alcohol.<br/><br/>Too bad that many men would probably enjoy the first few minutes of the film due to Nadine Velasquez's nude scenes and find it the only reason to see the film.Others who disliked the film due to the fact that it only told the story of Whip coming into accepting the fact that he needs help with his alcohol and drug addiction.But there is more to reasons why one should see it.First,it was a thoughtful and provocative study of a dark character in Whip Whitaker.Aside from his addictions,we also get to see him develop redeeming qualities in the end such as humility and he becomes a better person particularly as a father who started to develop a better relationship towards his estranged son.Secondly,we get to see a movie that portrays the effects of addiction very well and how it damages one's character and the relationships with others.Finally,it consists of great performances from the cast especially Denzel Washington,whose Academy Award nominated performance is well-deserved as he portrayed Whitaker very well that viewers will definitely empathize with him and with the crosses that the character is bearing.He truly elevated this film into greater heights especially when he was caught in a moral dilemma while at the NTSB hearing. Overall,this is one good character-driven film about addiction that one should see."
"lavatch","Null","1","3","5 May 2014"," Great Intensity, Character Development, and Dialogue
","Denzel Washington is terrific in the role of the swashbuckling airline pilot Whip Whitaker whose external demeanor masks his internal demons. While the film is noteworthy for the opening section of the airline crash, the more quiet scenes are the most memorable.<br/><br/>There is a subdued, yet riveting, scene in the hospital when Whip meets a cancer patient and a young woman with a drug addiction. The dialogue was both well-written and well acted by the three performers. The cancer patient controls the conversation, subtly conveying that he has his ""act together"" more than the other two characters. It is at this moment that we first recognize the damaged inner side of Whip that is contrary to his surface personae of the ace.<br/><br/>Although it may not have been intended by the filmmakers, there was a revealing side of the film that depicted the government investigation of the plane crash. There was an efficacy about the team that resembled a military event on the scale of D-Day, including a general's platform and a pair of binoculars wielded by one of the officials. Why can't our government function this skillfully in all of its responsibilities to the people?<br/><br/>The scenes set in the serenity of the farm owned by Whip's grandfather are effective in the dramatic tension evoked as Whip seeks to resist the temptation of alcohol. Throughout the film, the excellent supporting actors keep the pace brisk and always engaging. Don Cheadle is especially dynamic as the attorney with clearly divided feelings about his troubled client Whip.<br/><br/>This film demonstrates that it is not necessary to have exclusively non-stop action, special effects, and daredevil antics worthy of an Eddie Rickenbacker. Washington's thoughtful character study is compelling and unforgettable as the core of the film."
"g-bodyl","9","1","3","2 April 2014"," Tough Film to Watch!
","Flight is a very tough film to sit through and I don't say that because it's a bad film, it just has a very tough subject matter. Alcoholism is a tough subject in it's own right and the effects people have from it is not pretty. That being said, this film is a moving portrait of a guy who resorts to alcohol but at the same time is being hailed as a hero. This film has one of the best airplane sequences in film mainly because of the inverted plane. Now that is special effects talent right there.<br/><br/>This film is a welcome return to live-action filmmaking by director Robert Zemeckis whose last live-action film was 2000's Cast Away. This film is about a pilot named Whip Whitaker who is an airplane pilot, but also a drunk. He is labeled as a hero when he saves many lives on a plane due to expert piloting. But he gets questioned when word gets out he may have been drunk when he crash-landed that plane.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington gives one of his career-best performances and with his resume, that is a hard thing to do. Despite what he does, you still feel a little sympathy towards his character and that's the kind of human being Denzel is and the kind of characters he portrays. Don Cheadle is very good as the lawyer who keeps things guarded. John Goodman is quite funny as Whip's right-hand man. Bruce Greenwood is also good as Whip's loyal friend.<br/><br/>Overall, Flight is a compelling character drama that takes an inside look at a condition that affects many people in the world today. People may not like this film due to the lack of action here. But as a character drama, it feeds us the emotion of the characters and we truly feel them. It's a very powerful film with one of Denzel's best performances to date. I rate this film 9/10."

","""Flight"" appears to be some object lesson of great moment about drug abuse, addiction and coming clean. At this it utterly flops. The upshot of the story in fact casts doubt on any notion that substance abuse had anything to do with the crash, and cockpit brilliance truly saves the day. The Nadine Velazquez character was utterly redundant and non- contributory to plot elaboration, and the father-son reunion is nothing if not trite. The character elaboration of Whip Whitaker is not worth the trouble because he is not an interesting character at all. This movie is devoid of nuance, of richness, of subtlety, and instead settles for hackneyed truths won with a false sense of effort."

","""Flight"", doesn't exactly crash and burn like the aircraft piloted by Denzel Washington, but it does hit heavy turbulence and has a tendency to stray off course.<br/><br/>The story is straightforward enough. Denzel Washington plays Whip Whitaker, a pilot who successfully crash lands a passenger plane. Only a few people are killed thanks to his incredible skill, but he is nonetheless investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board. It becomes clear that Whitaker is an alcoholic, but it is not so clear if this played a part in the accident.<br/><br/>The film is full of odd touches and characters. Whitaker meets a girl, Nicole, played by Kelly Reilly. Nicole is addicted to drugs and booze. Although it doesn't have much to do with the story we first meet her as she gets in touch with her drug dealer.<br/><br/>Many filmmakers seem fascinated by the drug scene, although I'm not so sure audiences share their passion. The film presents the perfect Hollywood drug dealer stereotype sprouting a lot of time-worn drug jargon.<br/><br/>Also thrown into the blender with all the other ingredients is the beginning of an orgy (or maybe the end of one) in the drug dealer's pad, plus a little full frontal nudity and some bare butt – just to make sure everything is covered – or uncovered as the case may be.<br/><br/>John Goodman has a role in the film as Whitaker's quirky friend, Harling Mays, who comes to his rescue, especially when he is boozed out. The performance is actually John Goodman parodying John Goodman, what it's all about is beyond me; it just reinforces the fact that this is a film full of ideas – not all of them good ones.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington is the real reason to watch this film. He has such a powerful screen presence that he almost pulls the film together despite lapses in other areas. He is believable as the pilot who keeps his nerve and brings the stricken plane down. He keeps in character throughout; a strong man, not easily intimidated. He even sticks to his drinking despite all the pressure to stop. However Denzel Washington projects a sense of honour on the screen and it's no surprise when in the end he straightens up and flies right – a little obvious and predictable though it is.<br/><br/>""Flight"" is watchable enough as it unfolds but I think the story was actually a bit thin to start with, and a lot of extraneous material was added to pad it out. Although the critics were fairly positive about this movie, I feel it is a long way from being a great film or even a particularly good one."

","This movie may well turn you off flying, or setting foot in a plane again. Here's the unbelievable true story of a lush and a drug taking pilot, who made a miraculous landing when his plane malfunctions, in an unbelievable manoeuvre to do so, though we can't escape the fact, the pilot in question still did the wrong thing, which sets a strong scenario for the rest of the movie. With only six not unfortunate people, that included two of crew, now begins a line of questioning for the recovering Whip, with a lot of questions to be asked. I liked the interesting direction the movie took from here, as reaching some more serious waters. The movie becomes quite engrossing with some little patches, that mainly have Denzel strangely forming a relationship with a younger drug addicted girl, an ex lush, he met at the hospital, during his recovery. We can see too Whip's predicament, where he may have to purgor himself, as encouraged by colleagues, (one his close pal, a solid Bruce Greenwood, along with his Don Cheadle, solid too) with a airline inquest coming up, where the possibility of him doing jail time, looming above him, isn't that remote. On one hand he's hailed as a hero, as a simulated test with ten other pilots, are done in a reconstruction of the October 14th crash, where the survival number of all pilots and passengers is nil. But on the other hand too, he's been indulging in the vices, where if he hadn't, would of the result been the same. Yes, is my analogy, but may'be too, he may of even landed it better, where may'be one more life would be spared, or that co pilot could of ended up with less of those crippling injuries. Who knows? I did feels sorry for Whip who refused to acknowledge his addiction, but in the end, he's forced to. And with the Q and A at the end, I could see how he was possibly trapped with that question, where I never saw the choice he made, coming. May'be too, this film could prewarn a few pilots on similar paths, to make amends or face their addictions. John Goodman who just keeps getting better, is a standout as Washington's rockabilly pill supplier."
"CinemaClown","Null","1","3","7 October 2013"," A Flat Drama Bookended By Great Moments!
","Marking director Robert Zemeckis' return to live-acting filmmaking, presenting actor Denzel Washington in yet another impressive role to which he does complete justice, and working as an insightful meditation on addiction & the difficulties faced when trying to cope with it, Flight is bookended by high moments but everything between the two ends simply falls flat.<br/><br/>The story of Flight follows an airline pilot who, after crash-landing his malfunctioning plane in a miraculous manner & saving almost everyone on board, is hailed as a hero. But when further investigation into the matter reveals the possibility of him being intoxicated during the flight, he decides to sober up till his day in court, but soon finds out how hard it actually is to let go of an addiction.<br/><br/>Directed by Robert Zemeckis, Flight is his first live-action film since his 2000 feature, Cast Away, and exhibits no major loss in his form. Zemeckis showcases a firm grip on the visual elements of the story but the script is all over the place for instead of focusing on just one character this film is about, it tries to cram in events that have no reason to exist, as can be seen in the added romantic angle.<br/><br/>The technical aspects are finely executed but the story hits a rough patch in the middle with some slow-paced moments, some of which don't add much to the whole plot. Coming to the performances, Flight is a one man show that benefits greatly from Denzel Washington's outstanding input for the grounded finesse with which he portrays his character certainly makes this feature a character study worth sitting through.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Flight began on an absolutely thrilling note but from there on, it heads in only one direction and while the climax is moving to an extent, it's a tedious road to get there. Nevertheless, the film works as an intriguing observation of a man struggling to cope with his addiction, is redeemed to an extent by a knockout performance from Washington, and while inclining more towards a disappointment as per my initial expectations, it does have its moments that may work out for you. Worth a shot."

After an initial climax the movie plods on and takes too much time to say too little. The cardboard characters deserve little sympathy and do not help to draw you in. The fact that the main character has questionable morals, to say the least, makes it extra hard. Washington does a commendable job, but the tame direction and the cheesy script make it awkward to watch somebody you just don't want to like or feel sorry for. The portrait is not strong enough for that.<br/><br/>Washington's sidekick will have trouble to build a portfolio based on her performance.

Denzel Washington delivers one of his best performances and that's saying something because he's one of the best there is or has ever been. The supporting cast of Don Cheadle, Kelly Reilly, Bruce Greenwood, and John Goodman is fantastic as well. The special effects were also done incredibly well. The plane crash was impressive and looked amazingly realistic. The movie, while really long, didn't drag either because the plot developed well and the characters felt authentic. So why the just pretty good rating? Because what's the purpose of a movie? To me it is to be entertained and I have always had trouble enjoying a film when the protagonist is such a detestable character, which Washington's was. There was also quite a bit of completely unnecessary nudity. Sure, Nadine Velazquez is absolutely breathtaking but was that opening scene really necessary? It seemed forced and more for shock effect than anything else. Nonetheless, this was still a very good movie and I think most people would enjoy it."

","I was pretty surprised about the fact that ""Flight"" doesn't have rating lower than 8. I have not seen that many movies which were carried by one character and still gave me such a powerful message and deep feeling.<br/><br/>I do not hesitate to say that this was one of the best films from Denzel Washington and quietly overwhelmed by his performance in the film. <br/><br/>The plane crushes and the police has found the evidence that there was a possibility that the captain Whitaker(Denzel Washingto) was drinking alcohol while saving almost all of his passengers during the crash. <br/><br/>The movies focuses on two characters - Whitaker and Nicole. Whitaker is widowed airplane pilot who is alcoholic and drug-addict. Nicole is drug- addict who cannot afford to pay neither for her bills nor the drugs. <br/><br/>During the movie, Whitaker said to Nicole that ""it is you who is addicted to drug ,not me. I chose to drink. I'm not addicted to anything."" This is the very common reaction from people who have addiction to something. They do not realize and do not want to recognize the fact that they are addicted. By saying these stuffs, they lie to themselves and family or friends. These lies hurt their relations with the people and the isolation leads them to fall into addiction deeper.<br/><br/>In the end of the movie, Whitaker decides to stop lying and say the truth. Even though he went to prison with many years and suspended from being a pilot, he was freed by recognizing he was drug-addict and alcoholic and recovered the relations with his family.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie as it shows the great performance and excellent message to the generation where many people are addicted to something whether it is computer, alcohol, smartphone, or drugs. Great Film!"

","Having found myself in the middle of situations created by alcoholics often during my life, I found Denzel Washington's portrayal of such an alcoholic spot on. From accentuating an amazing single accomplishment to the utter denial of his condition, I believe he was spot on. He is such a good actor, willing to play a heavy with a soft edge, yet stay true to character, that at times it is hard to dislike him. I truly disliked his character throughout; his arrogance, self satisfaction, and smugness really aroused my senses. If there's a criticism, it's more with the formulaic plot, the deck stacking, the carelessness of those who surround these people. Nevertheless, when one's greed and other motivations play a factor, they can lead to unpredictability, so I guess this is forgivable. This is a movie about contrition. When one gets to the brink it can go either of two ways. Decide for yourself if it works."

And don't give me any bunk about them using hand models for close-ups.<br/><br/>Putting that side, this movie absolutely crawls to an ending. The pace is so, so slow. Was the director trying to make a long movie? Was he paid by the foot of the film? The extraneous scenes did nothing to develop the plot.

","Robert Zemeckis's first live-action movie in over a decade poses a moral conundrum: what if an airliner starts nose-diving and the pilot manages to land it so that he saves most of the people on board, but it later turns out that he was drunk while operating the plane (and had cocaine in his system)? Denzel Washington is the alcoholic, cocaine-addicted hero whose actions threaten his career. Zemeckis lays out the action very well, although I'd say that John Goodman's character is actually the best one in the movie. In the end, ""Flight"" isn't a masterpiece as much as a good look at the choices with which one is faced in a very unpleasant situation. It's the sort of movie that any ethics course could use to discuss moral conundrums. I recommend it."

","When his plane malfunctions, airline pilot Whip Whitaker remarkably, no, miraculously, pulls the plane out of a nosedive by inverting it and then landing it in a field saving the lives of all but a few of those on board. He wakes up in hospital a national hero only for it all to go spectacularly pear-shaped. Whip, you see, is a drunk with a rather large snowdrift stuffed up each nostril.<br/><br/>Contrary to the opinions of many, based on comments splattered on certain chat rooms and networking sites, Flight is emphatically not based on true events. In the words of John Goglia, National Transportation Safety Board member, ""Flying upside down cannot possibly help you"", even if you're Denzel Washington.<br/><br/>Got that? Flight is not real, your pilot is not drunk and pilots don't generally snort cocaine.<br/><br/>What Flight is, however, is a very entertaining film. It isn't action-packed, it spends very little time on the crash in question and it gives us the opportunity to enjoy Washington in a rare unpleasant anti-hero role. He wrestles with, and loses to, his daemons while splattering his screwed up life across the screen. Whip is a man who should have everything but has shoved half up it up his nose and flushed the rest down the toilet.<br/><br/>The talent of Washington is that he allows us to like and root for Whip for the first third of the film. We watch enthralled and hopeful that somehow he'll be vindicated but slowly he unravels his internal tangle for us to see what a mess he really is. As the film progresses, he becomes ever more desperate as he sinks further into the quagmire of his own making and resorts to emotional blackmailing those who care about him most. It is both a tragic sight to witness and a marvelous performance from one of Hollywood's favourite stars.<br/><br/>But Flight isn't Washington's film alone. We are gifted a double whammy of eye-catching cameos from John Goodman (as Harling Mays, Whip's dealer, who munches the scenery in a bigger version of the character we've seen frequently) and Don Cheedle (as Hugh Lang, the defence attorney who could be working for the prosecution).<br/><br/>Beyond them is a solid supporting cast of colleagues, union reps and family that includes sterling turns from the likes of Brice Greenwood and Tamara Tunie in particular. But by far the stand-out is Kelly Reilly as Nicole, a heroin addict Whip meets on the hospital stairwell and is drawn to only to absorb into his maelstrom.<br/><br/>Reilly, so often doomed to playing bit-part in big flick (Sherlock Holmes) or principal in unseen gem (the fantastically chilling Eden Lake), is finally given a significant role in a big film and is every bit the equal of star name, Washington. Whilst Nicole's development may be a little too quick to be plausible, that is the fault of script and director (Robert Zemeckis) and we root for her. We want her to survive her own sickness and attachment to Whip and Reilly gives us a beautifully played character that gets under our skin. With three more films in the can or shooting, let's hope Hollywood finally catches up. And if it doesn't, at least we'll have the promise of her teaming with Brendan Gleeson in Calvary, from The Guard's John Michael McDonagh, to look forward to.<br/><br/>After the brace of turkeys (A Christmas Carol and Beowulf) and the ill-fated Yellow Submarine remake, Zemickis is back on solid ground and closer to the form he showed when he gave us Cast Away thirteen years ago. It is a brave move to eschew a crowd-pleasing 30-minute action sequence and instead focus quickly on the drama of character clashes instead and Flight is a richer film and far more worthwhile viewing experience for it.<br/><br/>Zemeckis handles his cast carefully to draw out sensitive performances from each of them, a little ham from Goodman aside, and directs the digital flight and crash sequences with panache so they are exciting and gasp-inducing without being gratuitous or flippant. He is also wise enough to keep them to a minimum to ensure we 'buy into' Flight not for the effects but for the performances.<br/><br/>Mid-way through, Hugh Lang tells Whip, ""The FAA and the NTSB took ten pilots, placed them in simulators, recreated the events that led to this plane falling out of the sky. Do you know how many of them were able to safely land the planes? Not one. Every pilot crashed the aircraft, killed everybody on board. You were the only one who could do it!"" It's a fine moment when we understand the brilliance of Whip beyond his addiction. And it matters not a jot that neither he nor the other ten pilots really exist! <br/><br/>For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page."

Denzel Washington's performance, however, not unlike the way his character saved his passengers, kept me engaged.<br/><br/>Without the distractions of stretching credulity it may have been an instant classic. Or maybe not? Sometimes the writer can't get around pushing believability to tie together set-ups or plot points. <br/><br/>The first, as other reviewers' have noted, was the plane crash itself. It wouldn't have been too much more far-fetched for Whip to have stuck his arm out the window to fix some mechanical part in flight. Later on, no one sighted a national celebrity getting smashed in public; I assume the tabloids would have had a field day if the miracle on the Hudson pilot was seen drunk in public. And, despite the cable news networks hot on the trail of the missing ""hero"" pilot, no reporters thought to go to his Grandfather's Farm, a locale known for generations in the area.<br/><br/>But all of that was eclipsed by the story, which was Whip's struggle to come to terms with his alcoholism.

And not in the way the film maker would've liked it to be, but rather in a way that just sucks.<br/><br/>The description says ""An airline pilot saves a flight from crashing, but an investigation into the malfunctions reveals something troubling."", however descriptions can be misleading.

There's no more flying after the crash scene. In fact, no exciting things happen at all after the crash scene, everything is just boring, predictable and really no different from watching someone talk about his salvation in church, because what follows is a miserable hour of watching a ""alcoholic"" ruin the rest of his life in an attempt to look inspirational and dramatic so that the film could get a good rating.<br/><br/>Bottom line is that the first part of the film up to the crash is really a scene you cannot miss, so watch it.

Then his past catches up with him and his career and life are in jeopardy. I was looking forward to this movie because of Denzel. After watching it I have to say not only was the movie fantastic but I am again amazed at how good he is in this. For someone of Denzel's stature usually you watch and only see the actor himself. For example I like him a lot but when I see Kevin Costner every once in awhile watching him I think that's him and it takes me out of the movie for a second. All that rambling is to make a point. The entire movie I didn't once see Denzel, all I saw was an alcoholic pilot who was trying to save his own skin. You aren't sure if he is a good guy or not throughout. I could go on and on about his performance but this is one that just needs to be seen. Besides the acting job the movie itself is great and affecting. This is an absolute must see. Overall, one of the best movies of the year as well as one of the best acting performances. I give it an easy A."

","This could have been good. But<br/><br/>After a ""sit on the edge and bite your nails"" scene where a drunk pilot saves the day and crash lands a doomed plane saving all but 6 souls aboard, this movie becomes nothing more than a not so subtle propaganda of all things godly. Although Denzel did obviously try really hard and portrayed his character really well, his efforts were overshadowed by the film's mission to preach at the audience about how bad alcoholism is, and how god is there to guide you and help you to become a righteous and responsible American citizen. <br/><br/>As I said, this could have been good. If they only stuck with the story. I don't even mind the amount of alcohol and drugs because they were part of the story behind this plane crash.<br/><br/>But boy, I am a grown up, as most of the viewers are(this is movie aimed at a grown audience) and I don't wish to have holiness and supernatural beings shown down my throat by American religious fanatics, who somehow mange to make it into most media, when I go and watch a movie in the cinema. A movie that is supposed to be about a plane crash and the broken man behind it. I just can't take this movie seriously<br/><br/>3 stars for acting efforts."

","When I start watching a movie, there is a vague moment where I know I'm gonna like it or not.

When that happens, everything falls into place and I know I have watched a great film, to say the least. - Denzel is just extraordinary, and although I still haven't seen the rest nominees for best actor, what a great surprise it would be to hear his name on that night! - Robert Zemeckis has a remarkable way to tell unbelievable great stories without straying from reality and he did it again here. I think he is one of the top three storytellers of his generation, and he hasn't lost the ability - although he should check what's with him and flying :) 9/10"

","Flight is all about living all your life as a lie & just coming out of that by saying one truth. The out line of the story looks so simple but let me tell you that it's just awesome. The narration and screenplay was no fun & entertaining but it is compelling for sure. It has been so long that I saw Denzel Washington in such a power packed role. It never looked like he was acting, he was just living in that character. This motion picture will make you feel what happens when you're addicted to drinking and drugs. The exceptional scene of the movie is when he confess. It's nominated for 2 Oscars this year. I hope it would at least get away with one."
"iheart_ny","9","1","3","8 January 2013"," A journey into the soul of an addicted man...
","Director Robert Zemeckis has enjoyed the lucrative and profitable business of animated films for the past decade or so - making wholesome family films like The Polar Express and A Christmas Carol. The director of Forrest Gump and Cast Away is back where he belongs with Flight, an insightful, mature and thrilling character study.<br/><br/>Flight documents the internal struggle of an addicted man. Denzel Washington gives an incredible and nuanced performance as William ""Whip"" Whitaker, a pilot who pulls a miraculous stunt in midair, saving the lives of 96 of 102 passengers on a doomed flight from Orlando to Atlanta. Thought of in the media as a hero, Whip's history of drug and alcohol dependency is completely ignored until it's shown through a blood test that he was drunk at the time of the plane crash, blurring the line between hero and criminal.<br/><br/>Zemeckis's last live-action film Cast Away is all about external struggle, beating the odds around you to save your own life. What's interesting about Flight is that it's about a completely internal battle. The actual plane crash lasts for about the first twenty minutes of the film, and from then on, it becomes a cautionary tale about addiction. Whip's problem doesn't stop at drinking too much. He's also addicted to cocaine, which he needs to wake up after a heavy night of drinking. Whip quits drinking and relapses many times throughout the film. He befriends a woman who he meets in the hospital, post crash, who is there because of a heroin overdose. She tries to ""save him"", but fails multiple times until he's faced with having to save himself.<br/><br/>Washington gives the stellar performance that his fans expect, and for the most part, his performance carries the film. However, some real talent lies in the film's supporting cast. Kelly Reilly plays Nicole, the junkie who Whip finds as a kindred spirit. At first it seems like she's nothing but a bad influence for this character who really needs to get his life together. However, her subtle performance gives an unexpected depth to the character. She's facing her own demons...she's not there just to be a tool in Whip's recovery. John Goodman is here for comic relief as Whip's cocaine dealer, who is a character straight out of The Big Lebowski.<br/><br/>One thing that might drive audiences away from this film is that the lead character is totally unlikable. He treats everyone around him like garbage, including the ex-wife who he doesn't talk to anymore, and the son who he neglects. The audience member knows that these strained relationships were directly caused by his alcoholism. But in the end, the damage he's doing to himself is the most inexcusable.<br/><br/>Washington's antihero reminds me of a similar character in a film I saw last year, Young Adult. Charlize Theron's character Mavis Gary is a writer of young adult fiction who hasn't grown up mentally at all since high school. Drinking heavy amounts of vodka and whisky just to get through the day, Mavis doesn't admit her addiction to anyone, not even herself. She ignores this as her big problem. Whip's story is a lot like this. However, the viewer doesn't have to be an alcoholic or a junkie for this story to resonate. Films like this illuminate the mental part of addiction, which I truly find fascinating. Its ending is a little too ""happily ever after"" for my taste, but it leaves a hopeful message. It also reminds me that a lead character doesn't have to be likable to be interesting. It's an old-fashioned melodrama, and it's all the better for that. The film's quality and resonance is what inevitably soars.<br/><br/>Grade: A"
"estebangonzalez10","9","1","3","2 January 2013"," Zemeckis is back and Washington is at the top of his game!
","¨Nobody could've landed that plane like I did.¨<br/><br/>I don't think Denzel Washington has ever made a bad film; he has created some wonderful and memorable characters and always makes every film he's in much better than it otherwise would've been. Flight would have been an average film, but thanks to Washington's performance it is one of the best films of 2012. This is Robert Zemeckis's first live action film since Cast Away after having worked on three animated 3D motion capture films (Polar Express, Beowulf, and A Christmas Carol) and he's back with a bang. I hope Zemeckis continues to work with live action films because this is what he's really good at. He has made a number of successful films such as Back to the Future, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Forrest Gump. Despite being one of the best directors in the special effects department, he also knows how to make great dramas and stories that ring true. In Flight Zemeckis manages to mix special effects in the plane sequences with some great storytelling delivering a serious and emotional drama about a flawed hero. Zemeckis found the perfect man for his film in Denzel Washington who delivers each line with sincere and humane belief. Even his facial expressions showed so much about his character. This made the job so much easier for screenwriter John Gatins who didn't have to shove every line of dialogue down the viewers' throats because Washington's performance made it easy for us to identify with him and his struggles. This performance has already earned a well deserved Golden Globe nomination for Washington and he simply continues to amaze me with his work.<br/><br/>I will be careful while I try to explain the plot because the film isn't actually what you expect it to be about. I went into this film thinking it would be exclusively an action thriller where you had Denzel Washington playing the pilot who's trying to save the day. The truth of the matter is that the thriller only takes place in the first few minutes; the rest of the film focuses on the drama that Captain Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington) faces once he survives the plane crash and deals with some problems of his own. This is more of a drama than an action thriller but it works really well thanks to Washington's portrayal of Whip. He turns out to be a flawed hero because despite saving about a hundred lives, he's an alcoholic. Despite the fact that no pilot would have been able to land the plane and save the passengers, fault has to be found for the incident and the few lives that were lost. Despite his heroic actions, Whip flew the plane under the influence of alcohol and drugs. This is where Hugh Lang (Don Cheadle) comes in as Whip's attorney who represents the Pilot's Association and wants to put the blame where it belongs: in the technical malfunction department. Whip also meets a recovering alcoholic in the hospital named Nicole (Kelly Reilly) with whom a love story ensues. John Goodman also has a supporting role as Harling Mays, a friend of Whip who's always getting him the drugs he needs. And so the story has been set for the drama to take place.<br/><br/>When I say that Flight doesn't turn out to be an action thriller and ends up being more of a drama about a hero struggling over his own addictions, I say it in a good way because it makes the film stand out above the rest of films in its genre. It is a film that is difficult to categorize because it goes to some unexpected places and instead of being a movie about a flight incident it really is a film revolving around a character who we sympathize with despite knowing he has some severe addictions and issues he has to face. It kind of deals with alcoholism in the same way that Crazy Heart did with Jeff Bridges' character. I have to say that John Goodman's performance was also really strong. Despite sharing very few scenes with Denzel he did manage to stay at the same level and delivered some of the few comic relief moments of an otherwise pretty dramatic and serious film. Flight is one of the top ten films of 2012 and Washington delivers his best performance since Training Day. This is a film you will want to see because Zemeckis knows what he's doing and he's at the top of his game. I hope he sticks with live action films and continues to work with Denzel because the two together are golden.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

","I am a recovered Alcoholic and even though I knew the kinds of stuff to expect that did not lessen the impact. I was like watching someones story instead of hearing it at a meeting. It was very true to the problem of addiction. Excellent plot and execution. Great acting. John Goodman was a perfect pick for this as was Denzel Washington. Doubt the Airline Industry will like it. You don't have to be and addict or alcoholic to like it but for those that are not believe me it can be worse than depicted. May give you bit of an idea of what it is like from both sides of the problem if you don't know one. I'd recommend this to anybody. Especially those thinking of trying booze or dope. Some people change after that first drink or fix and it lasts a lifetime."
"jephe91","9","1","3","4 December 2012"," A great film about the life of a drunk
","Flight is one of the few movies I've been waiting a long time from Robert Zemeckis (Cast Away, Back to the future, Who Framed Roger Rabbit) and Denzel Washington to come back to the screen. Denzel stars as a captain pilot who was able to crash a plane and injure many people and survive while under the influence of alcohol. Denzel the pilot of the film knows very well he had alcohol while operating the plane and was the cause of the incident. But meanwhile some lawyers one of them played by Don Cheadle, explains to him that they can get him out of this predicament he is in by saying that it wasn't him that caused the crash but rather say that the plane had some mechanical defects that were expired from 2011 that was responsible. And most of the movie is about Denzel trying to stay sober but has trouble in the process while under investigation from the police and media trying to get him to ask questions about his accident. <br/><br/>Some people that I have known have asked me was why watch a film that has airplane passengers that get severely injured and die. But that isn't really the focus of the film. The film is about what it should be, the main character played by Washington. He has got to be one of the worst drunks in movie history. He disobeys his orders to not drink while under probation, lies about not having alcohol in his system while flying the plane, yells obscenities in front of his girlfriend, he even shows up drunk out of his mind in front of his son and ex wife! He is just an intoxicated bastard who enjoys the pleasure of drunkenness and will do anything to get keep his addiction going. But in the end when the court asks him about if he did in fact have booze in his system while operating the plane at first his says he didn't but then he confesses that he really did cause the plane to crash and responsible for the deaths and injuries he passed on the passengers.<br/><br/>In a lot of ways what I liked is that he admits that he had a drug problem and actually takes punishment for it. He ends up in jail and says that he will never have a career as a pilot because of his behaviour. Which I can admire because in real life people even famous ones do crimes and yet walk away from them or get lawyers to talk them out of them. <br/><br/>Director Robert Zemeckis has done a great job of directing this film and even though it's almost as good as some of his earlier work it is still a great comeback after having a couple of movies that didn't do so well critically. If you're a fan of Denzel Washington or maybe of fan of movies about drug addiction I strongly recommend Flight."
"Rat_27","9","1","3","26 November 2012"," Outstanding movie
","The movie is not well showcased by the previews at all. However, if you find Denzel Washington at least a ""good"" actor, you will be very entertained by this film. Personall, I find him an exceptional actor, and I thought the acting was top notch throughout this film. I found the character development believable, and the overall plot engrossing. However, I made the mistake of watching this movie before flying from LA to Seattle, and I strongly advise against anyone EVER doing that. Do NOT watch this movie, and then get on an airplane. You will have a horrible flight. Now, if you do not have any air travel planned in the next 24 hours or so, this is a movie worth watching. I always like Washington in movies, and I thought that John Goodman and Don Cheadle played excellent parts as well. Solid film."
"griffolyon12","9","1","3","17 November 2012"," A New Kind of Film from Zemeckis
","Flight is a change of pace for director, Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future, Forrest Gump, Cast Away). After a decade of doing mo-cap animated films, Zemeckis returns to live action with a film that is decidedly darker than any other film he's ever made. <br/><br/>Flight tells the story of Whip Whitaker, portrayed by Denzel Washington. Whip is a drug addict, an alcoholic, and a commercial airline pilot. On the morning that his airplane experiences technical difficulties and starts falling out of the sky, Whip was drunk and high. While he made an emergency landing in a Georgia field, his condition leads to a criminal investigation as to why the aircraft really fell. <br/><br/>The crash sequence is as harrowing as any I've ever seen, and is a marvel of Zemeckis's directing and ability to get immaculate effects work out of the effects crew, however the rest of the film is about Whip and his addictions. Whip cannot stop drinking, lying, or being a man so unfitting of the word hero. He refuses to go to AA meetings, he cannot resist a drink when it's sitting there right in front of him, and the film goes to many places that are surprising and uncomfortable for the viewer. We witness Whip, fall down drunk, high as a kite, and lying with a silver tongue, ignoring his son and ex-wife for most of the film, and losing the few good relationships he still has left. Washington delivers a performance of intense depth, he plays the role with charm, but the kind of charm one has when they're trying to get everything to go their way. Though where his performance really stands out, is in the way that Washington's Whip refuses to admit that he has a problem, and he gives a good case for award's attention at the end when he finally lays down his alcohol addiction for the whole world to see. <br/><br/>Smartly, Flight never tries to answer the spiritual questions it raises, some might find a spiritual movie underneath all of this, about why things happen, and that's one of the best things that Zemeckis and writer John Gatins did, they don't try to push anything on the viewer, but let them make up their own mind. To me, the movie is about discovering one's faith, while it's also a movie about a man on a downward spiral, crashing both figuratively and literally in this film. The whole piece works thematically, and the acting performances are strong, in particular Don Cheadle, as the most believable lawyer I've seen on film in a while. While Flight loses some of its credibility when Whip's lawyer pays for him to get high on cocaine when he's spending his whole time the rest of the film trying to get Whip's toxicology report to go away, as a whole, Flight is a hard-hitting drama that is unlike anything else that Zemeckis has ever done. For a filmmaker who one thinks they've already seen all the tricks he has left in his bag, this is a refreshing experience to see him growing and delivering adult fare unlike anything else he's ever done before, but be warned, this is neither a feel good movie, nor a film for the faint hearted, as there is nudity, drugs, alcohol, and many different ways to use the f-word.<br/><br/>I give Flight a 9 out of 10!"

Flight is another instant Denzel classic. <br/><br/>Pros: Excellent dialog Very believable characters Excellent acting Excellent plot / storyline<br/><br/>Cons: R rated...the first 10 minutes is closer to X The story seemed to drag in areas. Ex: the visit to his ex:wife's house had been previously described in detail. There was no reason to drag that scene out at the time it was. The importance of the events had progressed beyond that point. <br/><br/>I gave it a 9 out of 10 because I could have stood to see another action scene also, besides the crash, which happened at the very beginning of the movie."

","I went in as an airplane geek of sorts so I looked forward to all the stuff about the plane and the crash. I needn't have bothered, as it had little to do with aircraft or flight. It was just a precipitating incident for Whip's hitting bottom with his addiction. The plot struck me as nothing new and very Lifetime Movie-ish. Very mellow dramatic and nothing we haven't seen before. <br/><br/>That said, Denzel was stellar, as was his supporting cast. Particular to that supporting cast were John Goodman as Harling Mays, and Kelly Reilly as Nicole. That the script was maudlin shouldn't take their performances away from them. So a 7 for the acting and a 5 for the script gives a 6 of 10 average."

"PWNYCNY","10","1","4","4 June 2014"," It's about taking responsibility.
","Denzel Washington gives a masterful performance as a poly-substance abuser who finallyis forced to confront the truth ... about himself. It is about a man living a lie until it catches up with him, with tragic results. For the story is a tragedy. It depicts a good man brought down by a serious character flaw. Nobody can help him; he can only help himself. The principal character, Whip, has many good traits and is actually an engaging character ... when he is sober. But his engaging personality is a façade that conceals huge emotional problems. Yet Whip is neither contrived nor implausible. Indeed, he is a metaphor for anyone with a serious substance abuse issue. Thus, the movie can resonate with any adult audience. Thus movie challenges the audience to take stock of their own possible substance abuse, a problem which, sadly, is all too pervasive in a society that not only condones but actively encourages people to drink and smoke. The movie's depiction of a man destroying himself is neither melodramatic or overblown. Instead, it provides a provocative dramatization of a problem that adversely effects so many people in so many adverse ways. For this story to be effective, the audience must be convinced that Whip is in fact culpable. This point the movie skirts. Did the plane crash because of mechanical failure or because of Whip's erratic, yet heroic, flying? This the movie never fully reveals. The audience must decide for itself who is really to blame. The movie also provides a realistic dramatization how various interest groups who could be adversely effected by the crash mobilize their resources to protect their interests, with the truth taking a backseat. The union, the airlines, the government, and Whip himself all act to protect themselves and transfer blame to others. Nobody wants their feathers ruffled, and it is in this context that Whip is finally forced decide if he will act like a man."

","Flight A Movie Review by Jonathan Azurdia Denzel Washington, in a strong, incredible performance, astonishes the viewer as he takes on the role of Whip Whitaker, a commercial airline pilot with a dark inner struggle. His dependency on alcohol and cocaine is forefront in the opening scene and sets the stage for what follows. Prior to taking off for the first flight of the morning, he takes a line of cocaine and drinks a substantial amount of liquor. During the flight, the plane malfunctions and disaster is averted as Whip's instinct kicks in and saves 96 of the 100 passengers. His secret life threatens to be exposed after a drug screen report shows that he was intoxicated. The questions begin to arise. Was he really intoxicated? Did the plane crash because of a malfunction or because of his state of mind at the time?<br/><br/>This is not a typical good versus evil type of story. Robert Zemekis has crafted a movie in which the main character is a hero with flaws, whose shortcomings are socially unacceptable and illegal. It creates an interesting dilemma for the other characters in the story as events unfold to the final scenes. The other characters include John Goodman as the unlikeable drug dealer and Don Cheadle as the pilots' union lawyer managing the crisis. The relationships and interactions between the various characters provide depth to the story as the social and ethical pressure builds. Though the other characters are not well developed, it is the performance of Washington that propels the movie forward. He presents a tragic character with immense skill and emotional depth. Zemekis's direction uses the timing and events of the story and the interplay of the characters to keep the conclusion from being easily predictable, and the final scenes are riveting. <br/><br/>The story and characters are supported by the cinematography and special effects. The plane crash is created with special effects that realistically portray the nature of the harrowing event. The cinematography and sets give a sense that this pilot lives in the everyday world. Whitaker's home is peaceful and inviting, but becomes part of the theme of the story as Whitaker struggles with his demons. The scenes of drug use are realistic and gripping, adding to the drama. The final scenes draw the viewer in as the camera focuses on Washington, in his final dramatic scene. It is a worthy performance, supported by the other actors and the skillful direction of Zemekis. This movie is well worth viewing, maybe more than once."
"Sergeant_Tibbs","5","1","4","26 June 2013"," Bland, overlong, clichéd and full of uninteresting padding.
","Flight is a well produced film of which all its problems stem to the script. But the production value, which is relatively adequate for Hollywood using a crane in every scene, can't redeem its bland aspects. To be fair, the first act is pretty good with the unbelievable yet polarising plane crash scene. Even though there's not much character personality, it's a very well directed and tense sequence, unfortunately cut in by the redundant side character of Margeret. Afterwards, we're treated to a 90 minute character study of cliché after cliché after cliché. It's slow, it's boring and I could've slept through it and missed nothing. Every time it tries to do something unusual, it's ridiculous and played as eccentric. The biggest problem is the excess of side characters, particularly John Goodman and Kelly Reilly. Goodman is the epitome of its overblown ridiculousness and Reilly is unnecessary and uninteresting padding. Washington is serviceable, but the material doesn't give him enough to play with. Frankly I don't find any of his qualities relatable so it didn't have much of a chance to connect with me, but I didn't sympathize either. However, it does have a fascinating moment in the climax, with a great moral dilemma that they could have milked much earlier. Flight is a film that thinks it's mature and edgy but ends up unengaging and very plain. Hope Zemeckis can make films with energy again some day.<br/><br/>5/10"

"Jackkrsk","10","1","4","29 April 2013"," ""It's the best inspirational film of 2012'
","Flight is a Drama film directed and co-produced by Robert Zemeckis. The picture stars Denzel Washington as Whip Whitaker, Kelly Reilly as Nicole Maggen, Don Cheadle as Hugh Lang, Bruce Greenwood as Charlie Anderson, John Goodman as Harling Mays, and Nadine Velaquez as Katrina Marquez. Flight marked Robert Zemeckis' an amazing comeback to live action films .The last film that Zemeckis directed before Flight was Cast Away and What lies beneath, which were both released in the year 2000.After Zemeckis directed Cast Away, he started to move on making motion capture computer animated films like The Polar Express (2004), Beowulf (2007) and A Christmas Carol (2009). Zemeckis also directed Back to the future trilogy (1985, 1989, 1990), Who framed Roger Rabbit (1988), Forrest Gump (1994) and Contact (1997).Flight is also the first movie that Robert Zemeckis and Denzel Washington worked together. <br/><br/>Whip Whitaker ( Denzel Washington) is an alcoholic airline pilot of the South Jet Air. Whip awakens in the morning at a hotel near the airport in Orlando with a very attractive flight attendant Katrina Marquez (Nicole Maggen) after a night of sex, alcohol, drugs and very little sleep. After Whip awakened, he snorted cocaine in the hotel room to make him active to get ready to fly the S.J.A airplane from Orlando to Atlanta. While the co-pilot Ken Evans flies the plane ,Whip was drinking orange juice secretly mixed with Vodka without other passengers and the people that work on the plane being aware of it. Then, the airplane started to have a mechanical problem and Whip crashes the plane into a field that is close to a church and he saves 96 of 102 people on board in the plane. One of the people that died in the plane is the two flight attendants that of course includes Katrina Marquez. When he wakes up from the hospital, his old friend Charlie Anderson (Bruce Greenwood) from the airline union came to visit him and later on, he introduces him to a defense lawyer Hugh Lang (Don Cheadle) to make him aware that he may have a life sentence due to his blood test indicates that he was intoxicated with alcohol and drugs. Charlie and Hugh also advise him to make him not drink alcohol in the next few days but, he kept drinking in the next few days and he is struggling to stop drinking alcohol.He even decided to stop drinking after he got out of the hospital but, he of course kept drinking. Whip realized that he was of course intoxicated while he crashed landed the plane due to drinking the orange juice mixed with Vodka. Whip also develops a relationship with a female drug addict named Nicole Maggen (Kelly Reily).<br/><br/>I honestly thought that the movie has a great moral. The moral of the movie is don't do drugs and drink alcohol.It's one of those movies that makes people stop doing drugs and drinking alcohol. That is the reason why I thought it had a great moral. Every moment of the movie when Whip keeps drinking alcoholic, the thought is my head keeps telling him to ""stop drinking too much alcohol !"".<br/><br/>I would have to say that the most humorous character in the movie is Whip's drug dealer Harling Mays portrayed by John Goodman. Pretty much every line he says is pretty funny, here's one of his lines ""That's what we have in common Nurse Ratched, we both hate me"". I said this to the nurse at the moment when he is at Whip's hospital room. The line referenced the movie character Nurse Ratched from One who flew over the cuckoo's nest. <br/><br/>I thought the acting was amazing and I especially thought that Denzel Washington portrayed an outstanding role. Well, the thing that made his role great is that he acted out like he is an actual alcoholic for his character, really well. Denzel Washington of course never fails at acting and thats is the reason why I think he is a very talented actor!. This picture is Denzel Washington's first academy award nominated role in 12 years. The last Oscar that Denzel won was for his role as Detective Alonzo Harris from Training Day (2001).No spoiler alert but, the very end of the film gets heartwarming. <br/><br/>My advice for the movie is definitely a must see for people in general ! It's also a perfect movie to watch for people who are or not struggling to stop doing drugs and drinking alcohol. The movie would inspire people not to do drugs and drink alcohol. I would specifically explain how the movie could inspire people not to do drugs and alcohol besides Whip struggling to stop alcohol but,I would not because if I explain the other reasons it would cause a spoiler alert. So you all have to watch the movie to see how the film could inspire people to do not do drugs and drink alcohol. I also highly recommend that movie for people who are fans of Robert Zemeckis' films .Flight is such a true Modern American Classic! 10 out of 10 stars."
"tomlinde","8","1","4","24 April 2013"," Watch for one especially riveting scene
","It seems hard us to discuss addiction without also talking about faith and the higher power. And so it is with Flight. <br/><br/>""Whip"", played by Denzel Washington is a pilot and alcoholic. I initially missed an important detail early on – that the woman he wakes up with in the first scene is an attendant on the flight he pilots later that morning.<br/><br/>The film doesn't hold back in its contempt for simple-minded religiosity. Whip's co-pilot, who later states that nothing happens unless God wills it, cannot summon personal authority when the need to do so is staring him in the face. The film's position is put bluntly when the wing of their plane neatly separates an evangelical church from its steeple.<br/><br/>I was transfixed by a magnificent scene in the stairwell of a hospital. With one eye bandaged shut, Whip's perspective is occluded as he encounters an angel of sorts, another patient with an addiction. She is positioned just above him. Soon they are joined by another sort of angel, clattering up from below with his IV stand. Doomed by terminal cancer, the Angel Below is struck by the beauty of the Angel Above. Dis-inhibited by a short life expectancy he bluntly asks her, ""Are you going to die?"" The other two make eye contact, connected in fear.<br/><br/>The Angel Below expresses the joy of life in a notable way: ""I wish I could bottle this feeling...about how beautiful every breath of life is"". The Angel Above assumes it must be the chemotherapy that makes him honest and euphoric. The scene is five minutes of movie magic.<br/><br/>Whip later allies with false angels.<br/><br/>As addicts will do, he stops at nothing to protect his alcohol use. Pious advice and testimony do not steer him from a flight path of destruction. Only when an NTSB inquisitor challenges him to bear false witness does he ""come to Jesus"" and confront an opportunity to bring his flight to an end.<br/><br/>A commercial pilot friend of mine assures me all the flying-related stuff is, in his word, ""booogus"". As a behavioral health professional, I'd say that the miracle Hollywood ending is bogus too (though with just one ""o""). The film was highly enjoyable just the same."

She made a great impression in the beginning of the film, but sadly, she only returned as the catalyst that brought about the change in Captain Whip (Washington).<br/><br/>Washington was amazing.

","This is an example of the Lesser Spotted Morally Ambiguous Screenplay in which we are solicited and even encouraged to feel sympathetic towards seriously flawed individuals whose flaws have already resulted in damage and/or death to others. A few years ago Kevin Bacon played a paedophile released from prison after serving his time and attempting to turn his life around. Here Denzel Washington plays a man who will surely wind up in prison as a result of taking the controls of an airliner knowing he was under the influence of both alcohol and cocaine. It is the fact that the plane gets into difficulties and must surely crash with none of the two hundred plus passengers and crew surviving - until Washington, still under the influence of both alcohol and cocaine, makes a miraculous landing resulting in only six deaths, that gives it the moral complexity. You could argue that this is luring an audience to a moral tract by sugar-coating it with some serious action in the first three reels but however you sidle up to the subject the film is attempting to explore serious issues and should be respected as such."
"christophe92300","5","1","4","29 January 2013"," Disappointment
","Let's say it first, Flight is a melodrama and not an investigative drama like the (misleading) synopsis suggests, and that could create a certain frustration and/or misunderstanding for the viewer.<br/><br/>The first 25-30 minutes are excellent and captivating, but once passed, you enter in the very long melo part (the movie lasts more than 2 hours), badly handled, very linear, little dynamic and turning out to be quite boring, relying especially on some of the most overused clichés and commonplaces of the genre.<br/><br/>As for the supporting roles, they lack presence and depth, and if Denzel Washington is solid, his character doesn't arouse much empathy.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Flight turns out to be a disappointment, the script being such classic and conventional without managing to convey the required emotions for that type of story."
"mreyno02","8","1","4","25 October 2012"," The Higher Power
","This is not exactly a preachy film, but although another hero in the world of aviation is introduced, it seems to at least have the finger of a higher power in it. Captain Whip Whitaker comes out a hero when he saves the lives of almost everybody on board a plane that takes a fatal dive. As the action unfolds, the wing of the approaching plane slices the steeple of a church where the congregants were outside praising God. It turns out that most of the passengers were miraculously saved after the impact, but the credit went to the pilot for a bold airborne move, who also survived. But, the movie is really about the the pilot's drug and alcohol problems leading the audience to begin to worry that evidence of the use will punish the wrong people. And that is where the deeper challenge lies -- will the resulting investigation show the crash was due to mechanical reasons, or will it show pilot error caused by drug and alcohol abuse? I will just say that while this 'higher power' seemingly comes out to settle things, there are some other points that the movie doesn't make that are critical to understanding the plot. <br/><br/>The first thing is that it is evident the pilot has lost some of his standing in the world of aviation. His employment opportunities may have been diminished by his behavior, but it is not clear. What is clear is that he had a job with a much larger airline, and that in the film he is working for a commuter airline, which offer smaller opportunities, and probably lower pay. Was this hot-shot pilot forced to leave Delta Airlines because of his drinking? Also, it is unfortunate that the crew-abuses by airline management is not featured more directly. These points may help the viewer embrace the events that are going on.<br/><br/>Let me just end with a description of a different pain. Several members of the audience gasped quite noticeably as large, thick, 'buds' were also forced down(the drain). It's not exactly central to the plot, but I did check the appropriate box. Yes, there were some other funny parts, too, and the humor was done from in a clever way."
"bennyhagen","8","2","13","23 February 2013"," Very well done movie and then there's also god
","As far as the script, the acting and generally the whole execution of the movie goes I have nothing to complain about. Robert Zemeckis is one of the few directors who still do the stuff that we once knew and loved Hollywood for and Flight reminds one of the good sides of American filmmaking. And then for some reason there is also a lot of god going on, an aspect of the movie that I can barely see any point to. Denzel Washington's character study is so sharp and authentic, at no point did I need any kind of religious input to make this movie more profound. So this part of the movie, from my point of view, is extremely obsolete and I felt kind of annoyed that it distracts from the movies essence. Now I can't really decide, but if this was supposed to be some sophisticated shot at Christian apologetics, nice try, but no thanks. While I would be able to see a message here that goes something like ""the lord works in complex ways"", the argument made by this story is still not valid from any logical point of view. Whatever happened here, you can see and do so in much detail, how it is pushed forward by the personal skills and decisions of the protagonist. At no point is the insertion of a god necessary or logically coherent. Washington's character does make a moral choice, but moral choices are not a copyrighted divine exclusives. I'm sorry Christians, I'm not impressed. However, while there's a lot of this going on, in the end it really doesn't do too much and fortunately doesn't overshadow an emotionally compelling, refined movie. I give this an 8/10."

","Why myself enjoyed the movie.<br/><br/>Most movies regarding alcoholism is written for outsiders, or for that matter how they perceive it. A good example - ""When a man loves a women"" For me this movie (when a man...) failed extremely, because yet again its a feel good movie where two people overcome an obstacle, through love and understanding. If ""when a man loves a women"" had ten more minutes Meg would have put another bottle of Vodka between her lips. <br/><br/>Flight on the other hand is EXACTLY how it plays out!<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this movie to all passive alcoholics out there. Passive Alcoholic? You indulge to forget, but strangely you remind intact an beyond believe focused in your career. (Hard to believe, but to those who's been there common sense)<br/><br/>Would it make a difference watching Flight - Hell No! It did however bring one thing to mind, one very important thing.<br/><br/>What ever is bugging you, YOU are the only one that knows. When Denzel decides not to blame a co-worker, he makes a choice that the better of another should be put in front of his own destructive ways. By doing this even OUT OF HIS MIND, he made the change that the bottle hidden underneath the kitchen sink would not change the man he is! He made the last sacrifice (in his world), and redeemed himself as the savior of his OWN soul.<br/><br/>Rehabs focus on alcholism, and I say we all started out as a kids with dreams. I say embrace your current state. If you choose that alcohol rules - then live what you have on those terms - but leave the rest to their lives."

","Denzel Washington's portrayal of a very flawed hero pilot which got him an Academy Award nomination in 2012 dominates the film Flight. All of his loved ones and all of his friends won't be able to help him with the jackpot he has himself in.<br/><br/>Denzel is an airline pilot who on a routine Flight from Tampa Bay to Atlanta encounters turbulence in the air and mechanical failure. He does a heroic job in bringing the plane in at all. Everyone agrees that most other pilots would have crashed with all on board dead. When he crash lands in a field only six fatalities occur. There are several injured however including our hero pilot.<br/><br/>But when he comes to in the hospital his toxic readings show traces of alcohol and cocaine. As we see later in the film he gets himself drunk and has developed a patented way of sobering up with a cocaine stimulant. Talk about living on the edge.<br/><br/>The whole airline industry from the pilots union to the airline to the FAA don't know what to do. Washington is a hero for what he did, but that addiction can't be hid. And he persists in his bad behavior.<br/><br/>This is one of the more complex portrayals of a character I've ever seen Washington do. In The Hurricane he's a hero who's been terribly unjustly wronged. In Training Day he gradually is revealed to be evil and corrupt. But here you don't know what to think. No doubt he's a hero, but he's also selfish and indulgent and can't even keep himself straight enough to get through a hearing on the crash. His own lawyer Don Cheadle is at his wit's end. <br/><br/>Melissa Leo has an interesting part as the hearing officer at the FAA, she's got a grain of toughness, but even she would like to give him the benefit of the doubt. But besides Washington, the one you will remember is John Goodman who has two memorable scenes as his drug connection for his cocaine cure.<br/><br/>The film Flight is a good one. But Denzel Washington might have picked up a third Oscar but for Daniel Day Lewis's Lincoln. He got more out of his role than most actors would have."

","Denzel Washington stars in Flight, a 2012 film directed by Robert Zemeckis. The film also stars Bruce Greenwood, John Goodman, Kelly Reilly, and Tamara Tunie.<br/><br/>Washington plays Whip Whitaker, a veteran pilot who is a cocaine-snorting alcoholic. During a flight, the plane he's piloting malfunctions and starts careening toward earth. Somehow Whip is able to land it, with six lives being lost, when in the hands of another pilot (as they prove in flight simulation), all passengers and crew would have been lost.<br/><br/>While Whip is in the hospital recovering, his blood is drawn, and the toxicology report shows that he has cocaine in his system and three times the legal alcohol limit -- if you're driving a car.<br/><br/>The airline lawyer and others believe that the manufacturer of the plane is at fault, but Whip's blood test complicates matters. Whip meanwhile denies he's an alcoholic, though he tries to stop drinking several times and fails. He has a chance to save himself from any malfeasance in the accident -- but will he take it? A good film with an excellent performance by Washington as a man who can't face up to the fact that he is a drunk, that he lost his wife and child because he is a drunk, and that his job is now in danger because he is a drunk. He meets a young woman, Nicole (Kelly Reilly) in the hospital who is trying to get clean from heroin, and her attempts to get him help fail as well.<br/><br/>This film isn't without problems, and in a way, it's a good thing the star is Washington because he saves it. First of all, the addition of the Nicole character is hackneyed, and one could see how it was going to play out right away.<br/><br/>Another problem I have is -- and this may not be a problem, but I don't know much about pilots - the fact that he was sleeping up until the plane started its descent and the copilot woke him up. Could he have noticed a problem beforehand had he been awake? The fact that he was asleep is never mentioned.<br/><br/>I have another problem but it's a spoiler, so I won't reference it here.<br/><br/>The fact that Whip performed a miracle while intoxicated isn't unheard of, as there have been reports of surgeons performing perfect surgeries while in an alcoholic blackout, actors line-perfect on stage while in blackouts -- and Whip wasn't even in a blackout. The fact that Whip did perform a miracle makes the situation all the more tragic, that he had so much ability and was willing to throw it all away by flying while intoxicated.<br/><br/>Definitely worth seeing for Denzel's performance and for the accurate depiction of the denial and power of addiction."
"thewillt08","8","1","5","26 February 2013"," Denzel at His Best
","The main reason I don't like going on planes is because of movies like Flight. Flight is a surprising story about a drunken pilot, Denzel Washington, who makes an impossible move in landing his damaged aircraft with 102 souls onboard. Denzel delivers possibly his best performance of his career and giving him an Oscar nomination. The story starts about a plane crash, but turns into a man's emotional problems with drugs and alcohol. This should be interesting.<br/><br/>I knew this movie was about alcohol addiction and not so much about the crash. In the very first scene, Denzel Washington wakes up in a hotel room with who I'm assuming is a prostitute. His room is a mess and he grabs a bottle and starts to slurp it down. His phone rings and he starts arguing with his ex-wife. While this is going on the woman is just walking around getting changed and he has to fly a plane in less than an hour. The scene ends with him doing a line of coke and then him leaving to fly the plane. That opening scene made such an impact I knew this movie was going to be good. This was the very first scene of the movie.<br/><br/>The actual sequence of the crash itself was very interesting. Washington keeps his composure and knows exactly what he is doing. You would never know he was drunk but the scene looked and felt real. The danger was intense and the shot of the plane flying upside down was a thing of beauty. He lands the plane and then the controversy starts. The whole idea of the movie is to keep him out of jail and blame the crash on the faulty equipment. This movie had strong acting, emotional scenes, and very believable throughout.<br/><br/>The drug and alcohol abuse may have been stretched a bit. They show how much he drinks all over the place. He gets into his car and takes out a handle of vodka and drinks straight from it like its water. I feel like if a man drank and did this much coke, he would be dead. He meets a girl who is a recovering alcoholic at the hospital and they create one of my favorite scenes I have ever seen.<br/><br/>It is a few days after the crash and Denzel needs a cigarette so he goes in the stairwell to smoke one. Who does he see, but the recovering alcoholic and heroin addict. They start talking and a cancer patient comes up the stairs and joins the conversation. The conversation these three have lasts about 5-10 minutes but when it ended I remember thinking I could have watched that for another few hours. It was so entertaining and what6 they were talking about was so real and true.<br/><br/>So Denzel and this woman have a thing and hook up. Her character is one I really don't enjoy. She serves her purpose in the story and shows how the alcohol pushes people away, but she is in the movie and then she leaves, and never comes back. She comes, she goes, and she is forgotten. I had a problem with that. It was a flaw in the movie. She was introduced as a major character with major importance, and then she leaves. I don't have a problem with leaving, but a problem, with not coming back. That is really my only problem, other than the ending of the movie is so predictable. There is really only one outcome and everybody knows it, even the characters in the movie.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington is absolutely fantastic in this role. He plays a great drunk. All of his scenes are real and it is amazing how well he got into the character. I knew he had talent, but this was raising the bar to the next level. Although he did not win the Oscar, he definitely deserved the recognition and the nomination. You can see the struggles he faces through his acting throughput the entire movie. He wants to stop drinking and a few times he tries but he gets sucked in again and again. John Goodman is hilarious for the short times he is in the movie. He was good, as always.<br/><br/>Overall, Flight was an amazing movie with some of the best acting in recent memory. Goodman is funny, Washington is powerful, and the supporting cast worked really well too. Most actors had good chemistry and we could see that on screen. The movie had a few holes and slowed down in the middle but it had a strong finish and an overall great story. Flight deserves the Oscar nomination for best picture. Denzel Washington deserves the nod for Best Actor in a leading role, and Flight gets the WillyT Seal of Approval."
"DICK STEEL","8","1","5","23 February 2013"," A Nutshell Review: Flight
","Wait, does this mean that the trailer's wrestling of airplane controls that resulted in the money shot of flying it upside down, was nothing than a peripheral plot device? Unfortunately, that is an affirmative, with Denzel Washington's Whip Whitaker, a veteran pilot executing everything in the books to correct his jet's sudden nose down scenario, culminating in the upside down glide of the plane to an open field that minimize ground casualties. With 6 perishing under the circumstances out of more than a hundred passengers, Whip's steady hands, which we'd have experienced given his punching his plane out of a stormy weather, once again demonstrated that experienced pilots, compared to the younger officers (Brian Geraghty), are miles better with vast experience and cool head to deal with any unexpected situation.<br/><br/>But Whip's character comes under scrutiny, when the film opens with an eyebrow raising booze and drug abuse, hours before his ill fated flight. I don't know anyone who would not mind travelling on a plane with the pilot on likely DUI charges if found out. One could get away with it most of the time, but when found out, the circumstances surrounding one's state of mind, whether or not one's alert, would mean scapegoats are quickly identified, and blame pinned on something that's easily grasped, versus to scour through hundreds of materials, eyewitnesses and various reports. It's as if it's an open and shut case, and if it is, the film wouldn't be too much, would it?<br/><br/>Which means Don Cheadle's lawyer character Hugh Lang, appointed to defend Whip, didn't get much to do, since this is not a legal thriller, and most of the charges got easily defended, deflected, and covered up through technicalities. It probably also reflected some hard truths in life, that perception is everything, and who's who in your network is just as important when it boils down to knuckle fights and you need some biasness to swing results in your favour. So exit Cheadle once he's done his supporting role. And Flight is temporal in its treatment of supporting roles, with John Goodman being Whip's principal supplier of his vice, popping up when needed to help sober him up, and Bruce Greenwood as Whip's pilot pal in the union, offers little advice, if any at all, there to represent the interests of most parties that would expectedly be in any lawsuits thrown at either direction.<br/><br/>Then perhaps Kelly Reilly's role was the most peculiar here, one that could have been done without as well. Her introductory scenes were edited in at the beginning quite haphazardly interspersed with what's going on thousands of feet in the air, and having little bearing with that panic in the sky. It's fairly irritating to be engaged in a mid-flight crisis, then cut toward Reilly's Nicold role as a junkie who got propositioned for a pornographic film in order to feed her drug addiction, then cut back toward the flight in the sky, then back at her woes of being unable to pay the rent, and passing out on a junkie high. We don't really care about Nicole at that point in the narrative, and having been put off, we continue not to care about her hook up with Whip, being rather peripheral in the character's motivation and intent, as being the fodder for Whip in a what-if scenario that he'd man up to his addiction, and take active steps to correct it, like Nicole did. We know that's the intent, and to add a little bit of loving between the two characters in the same boat, but editing 101 says it could have been done better.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington owns the role of Whip, but perhaps a little too much in successfully bringing out the helplessness of the character who repeatedly refuses to help himself, that after a while it stopped eliciting sympathy from the audience, and alienating Whip further away through his lies and cheating ways. It's consistent with those battling addictions, in that he never really admitted, and is in constant state of denial. Denzel's character is repulsive, and can lie to anyone straight in the eye. We'd like to root for the pilot who had saved lives from the jaws of death, but after knowing his character inside out, that fame and idolatry dissipates, and it became quite laborious to observe that one man's desperation for assistance when he had visits key witnesses to try and influence decisions and statements. Denzel nails his role and that nomination in this year's Oscars, but I suppose the statue will elude him no thanks to the overall negativity that role brought to the party.<br/><br/>Robert Zemeckis had teased Flight to be something more, but it boiled down to be an intense character study on alcoholism, drug abuse, and just about the most repulsive of human traits one can bring to the big screen. It's a departure away from his usual feel good movies, quick to remind us on the failings of the human being, that quickness to judge and condemn, though the pacing of the film sagged in the middle as it muddled around these issues far too much. The first act, without the unnecessary introduction of Nicole, and the final act, are what made the film excitably engaging, but I suppose having been out of the game for some time, it takes a little bit of getting used to, so let's hope Zemeckis next film will return him to the heights he was once known for."

'Flight' features a top notch cast across the board, which featured an outstanding and memorable performance by non other than John Goodman (of 'Rosanne' fame).

I really expected some action and a thriller but all I got was a collection of pointless scenes and dialogs. More than half this movie was absolutely pointless and not related to the story in any way. I really don't understand why a movie which half of it are filler scenes gets that high ratings.

"rmax304823","7","1","6","27 April 2013"," What Goes Up Must Come Down, And Vice Versa.
","It's a pretty good movie, although it's a downer, and despite the fact that it was directed by Robert Zemeckis, most of whose output has so far been commercially oriented, abject junk.<br/><br/>The script by John Gatins is thoughtful and not hurried. There are no car chases, no fist fights, no blood-spattered walls, nobody's head is wrenched off by a maniac. It's a character study rather than an action movie, and the character is Denzel Washington's commercial airline pilot.<br/><br/>He wakes up in the morning with a flight a few hours ahead of him, shrugs off the beautiful nude girl, takes a swig of one of last night's many beers, does a line of cocaine, and -- WHAM! -- he's ready to fly.<br/><br/>He boards the airplane still stoned enough so that the two stewardesses, as well as his co-pilot, notice something is wrong. The first officer observes him queerly as Washington straps himself in and takes a hit off the oxygen mask. ""Are you feeling alright, sir?"", he asks.<br/><br/>The first officer, a youthful looking guy who looks as if he should be a flight attendant, must have second sight because Washington does not seem stoned to me. The fact is, Washington is not a good drunk. He proved that in ""Courage Under Fire."" If you want to see a good drunk, watch Paul Newman in ""Verdict,"" and Newman never drank anything stronger than beer.<br/><br/>The airplane takes off with Washington in the left seat and hits some severe turbulence. The camera has evidently never flown through turbulent air in a large airplane because it is jarred from side to side as if it were being drawn on a cart over a rocky road. An aircraft wouldn't jiggle. It would feel more like an elevator that couldn't make up its mind whether to go up or down, but in any case would change its mind in a hurry and travel at high speed.<br/><br/>Then things get twisted. Finally out of the storm, Washington activates the autopilot and takes a half-hour snooze behind the while. Bang, and something in the airplane's controls go awry. So does the callow co-pilot, shouting panicky imprecations.<br/><br/>In the end, the National Transportation Safety Board determines that some threads were worn off in the bolts that held the elevators in position, and this put the airplane into a nosedive, from which Washington was able to recover by using his wits and his skills as a pilot. So far so good. But then the script ratchets up the sequential emergencies way beyond the red line. An engine cuts out, for instance. But what does that have to do with the failure of the elevator bolts in the plane's tail assembly? Nothing. Then the OTHER engine cuts out. Ditto. Then an engine catches fire. Ditto. And all this time the camera is being banged around like a ping pong ball. None of this is ever explained.<br/><br/>Well, as I said, it's a character study. Washington does okay with his role. Sometimes he pulls off the drunk role believably by minimizing it; an occasional bump against an item of furniture. He gets able support from Don Cheadle as a timid lawyer, Bruce Greenwood (I think) as good friend Charlie, and Kelly Reilly (there's a Polish name for you) as the recovering addict who falls in with him for a time. The rotund John Goodman as Washington's cheerful dope supplier provides some semi-comic entertainment. The guy who is the head of Washington's airline could be Bill Murray's double except for his speech, which sounds filtered through a corn cob.<br/><br/>Washington's character is sympathetic in that we all feel sorry for a guy in the grip of an addiction, but he's not really very likable. He lies all the time, about his drinking and everything else, until the cornball climax when he floods out and the unnecessary denouement in which he has a friendly chat with his estranged son under the blue summer skies.<br/><br/>I've picked on some of the film's weaknesses -- there are others -- but I don't mean to be too harsh. It's a thoughtful and engaging movie. Only it could have been much better if the formula had not been so strictly adhered to -- the guilty man finally and willingly confessing his sins. It's all laid out. Compare it to the ending of Dreiser's ""An American Tragedy"" or its cinematic offspring, ""A Place In the Sun."""

If you can watch the penultimate scene, as Whip says to himself ""God help me"" as he prepares himself to confess what he did, without tears coming to your eyes, maybe this movie is not for you.

I found myself saying of the lead character Whip: "" I don't like this guy"". I am not sure if I will watch the rest of this. 
Another reviewer noted the same thing... the writers gave us no reason to like Whip. 
We wanted a reason to like him, but he was a drunk and not very nice. <br/><br/>So what was the reason behind creating this movie of an unlikeable man who flew a plane drunk? A plane which was faulty, and he happened to save most of the people on board, then endure an investigation into his fitness to fly it in the first place.<br/><br/>Was it to point out that as people we are more likely to exonerate those we like and more likely to condemn those we don't like?<br/><br/>After watching the film I found myself thinking: ""So what if he saved a lot of people, he still flew the plane drunk and high on drugs - that's despicable."" And then I asked myself - what if they had drawn his character differently and made me actually like him as a person in spite of the fact he had an alcohol problem. Did my perspective change? Did I think: ""Well the plane was clearly broken, he saved most of those on board flying even having been under the influence - they should be lenient.' <br/><br/>Yeah it kinda did.

","FLIGHT is an actor's showcase for the excellent Denzel Washington - one of my favourite stars working today - and a nice change of pace for Robert Zemeckis, a director usually mired in making kid-friendly movies. This one's definitely an adult film, telling the story of Washington's addicted pilot and his efforts to save the lives of his passengers during a disaster. This early sequence is inevitably the greatest in the film and a triumph of special effects and direction. The lengthy story that follows becomes a drawn-out character piece with courtroom scenes, legal battles, and most of all personal battles with the demons of drink and drugs. Washington is superb, which is no surprise, but it is a surprise to see British actress Kelly Reilly - previously best known for fare like EDEN LAKE - equally convincing as a fellow addict. The film is made with stylish and professionalism, and draws to an end in a very satisfying way."

"fluturoj","5","0","2","8 August 2016"," Melancholic
","This movie was a bit slow for me but I must say it does show very well the life, emotions of an addict. <br/><br/>The real-life lessons-people won't help you unless you are willing to help yourself and change your behaviour. People around us if we are luck they will try and help us but not if they sense that you won't change in anyway. Nicole tried to help Whip by telling him she was worried and that he should get help but what Whip did was verbally abuse her while trying to protect himself from reality, then he acted as his drinking was not a problem taking as a joke and making false promises(which could be called by the lack of him taking the whole situation seriously) that will go to a clinic as soon as they had gone far away. Nicole at this moment walked away. She realised he had no intention to change since he had still not accepted the reality and reflected to learn that his actions where keeping people away. As expected she came back when he learned from his mistakes, and realised he was the one in the wrong. You can't help someone that won't accept help. You just can't. No matter how much you want to help them. You can only help them once they realised they need help. Until they do that, you have to walk away. <br/><br/>Plausibility: well its is a very plausible story. It was new to me the suggestion that an addict won't consider his circumstances and that the addition will win even in situations when you might go to jail for life because of that. I can't comment on the plausibility of that but it is quite convincing. <br/><br/>Charakter analysis:Whip- not a bad men, an addict that was not ready to receive help until he convinced himself that he needed help. A good man because he could not say that a person who possibility died because she helped a kid, drunk while on duty and had an alcohol problem. Nicole- smart. I thought at the beginning that she gave up on Whip pretty quickly after he helped her time of need but now I think that she was smart for realising that someone can't be helped if they don't think they need help.<br/><br/>Acting: all I can say is that Denzel Washington is as amazing as always. There is no need to say more. <br/><br/>Plot/ Stortline/Storytelling: slow. I got bored pretty quick after the crash, things just didn't seem to get moving. But in the end it did pick up peace so It made slightly up for that. <br/><br/>Overall, a great movie that actually shows (not tells) the life of an addict and how addiction impacts his/her happiness and relationships."

"droesslerjen","Null","0","1","6 October 2015"," Flight Movie Review
","Immediately, a plane carrying over one hundred passengers begins rolling over, catches a wing on a church steeple, and glides into a field. The thrilling yet dramatic movie, ""Flight"", starts abruptly with a crash. Directed by Robert Zemeckis, also director of big named pictures such as ""The Polar Express"", ""Forest Gump"", and ""Cast Away"", takes on a new story. Under phenomenal direction, it has a meaningful, but slow plot, and exceptional characters who are easily relatable. Unfortunately, the story takes an extremely long time to tell. Don't get too cozy!<br/><br/>""Flight"" is a tale of Pilot Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington) who came in clutch during an ordinary commercial flight. While being 3,000 feet in the air, Flight 227 to Atlanta hit turbulence, began to break down, and lost altitude at a rapid pace. Whitaker's instincts led the plane to roll onto its topside and crash into a field only losing six lives. He is immediately claimed to be an ""American hero"" as no other pilot could save that plane in the same situation as attempted on a simulator. Whitaker's title as an ""American hero"" was short lived as blood tests came back with disturbing evidence. Whitaker found himself sitting next to a defense lawyer, Hugh Lang (Don Cheadle), who informed him that his addiction needed to end as it has previously destroyed his marriage and relationship with his only son. His next step is to testify in front of a critical crowd about the fateful flight.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington's role as Whip Whitaker is very captivating as he maintains the role of an alcoholic, yet proceeds to state the fact that he ""is the only one who could have landed the flight"". His solid acting is never overpowering, and he easily becomes connected with the audience through his likable and smooth personality. Don Cheadle plays an excellent Hugh Lang as an intelligent and significant lawyer. Because the plot is devious, it proves how exceptional both men are as actors. They even create several emotional scenes together, and individually throughout the film. For example, the touching scenes together during the trial when determining what Whitaker's fate would be. Hugh Lang, Cheadle, also portrays a positive image for the audience as he promotes Whitaker, Washington, to become sober. Together they make the film deeply affect the audience.<br/><br/>The movie was a change of pace for Zemeckis as it is classified as his first ""action thriller"" movie in about 12 years, but ""Flight"" was not very action-packed. The two-hour plot could have been simplified and more compact instead of drifting along at a snail pace. It is hard for most people to sit through time-consuming movies and be entertained the entire duration.<br/><br/>Washington has had several positive performances throughout his career including his performance in ""Flight"", but that was not enough to give the movie two thumbs up. All of the elements in the movie were spot on, but the length of the movie diminishes its excellence. I would recommend everyone to watch it once, and only once."
"cinemattcom","5","0","1","20 March 2015"," a candid review of everything wrong with the movie ""flight""
","Boredom is a disease worse than cancer, drugs and alcohol cure it with little or no ill side effects if used as directed. – Dough Stanhope<br/><br/>The film ""Flight"" directed by Robert Zemeckis (Cast Away, Death Becomes Her, Contact, Forrest Gump, The Frightners) and starring Denzel Washington (Training Day, Man on Fire, Philadelphia, The Bone Collector, Book of Eli) was supposed to be, a hero drama wrapped inside a subjective social commentary about the pitfalls and self- destructive nature of addiction, Denzel portrays Whip Whitaker, an airline pilot who miraculously crash lands his plane after it suffers an in-flight mechanical failure, saving nearly everyone on board. Immediately following the crash, he's hailed as a hero, but an investigation soon leads to questions that paints the captain in a different light.<br/><br/>During the investigation the lead NTSB investigator states that no other pilot was able to successfully land the flight simulation of the crash without killing everyone on board. Just to clarify every other SOBER person would have not been able to save even one life had they been at the helm of the titular ""Flight"" and in spite of having cocaine which probably kept him alert enough to fight the controls of the aircraft upside down and vodka in his system (which most likely calmed his nerves just enough to land the plane he was able to save lives. So my question argument with this movie is one that ironically even in the face of the obvious and glaring evidence, no one seems willing to ask is simply this<br/><br/>Based on all the evidence provided, it is logical to assume that if he had not been doing drugs and alcohol that morning/afternoon, it is most likely that he would not of had been able to do what he did. Basically, drugs and alcohol probably saved the day. (and lives) and regardless, the fact that he was on drugs and alcohol, while not glorifying them, also cannot similarly demonize them, in a right or wrong sense.<br/><br/>Which brings me to my second major complaint, the ending. I distinctly remember hearing a woman gasp out loud when after thirty seconds, he finally does grab the alcohol and begins to binge drink before the investigaation Through out the investigation time and again, not only is there no evidence of his drug and alcohol use during that day, every negative aspect of the crash is – through no fault or admission on his part, the investigators come to alternative conclusion on their own – but he is time and again vindicated of any wrong doing, cleared of any fault and could have walked out of the investigation unscathed, but no, he has to admit to his drug use and end up in jail through his apparent truthful tourrette syndrome out of some misplaced sense of survivors guilt. Honesty is not the best policy is the only thing the ending proves, nothing else. Which would be OK but my argument is WHY ADMIT IT AT THAT MOMENT? WHY NOT WAIT TEN MINUTES until the hearing is over and then go and admit you addiction at some AA meeting. All the admission during the investigation does it guarantee you are going to jail, even at the end when he is telling his story to the other prisoners, they all look at him as if to say ""good work dumbass, all that honesty got you was allowed you to become was my prison bitch.""<br/><br/>Look I am not advocating or demonizing drugs, alcohol or honesty all I am saying is that there is a time and a place for everything and in the context of this film they were all unequivocally wrong time wrong place, 'nuff said."

","This movie can only truly be appreciated by alcoholics. Not because their life experiences will better inform them of the movie's nuances, but because you have to be drunk to enjoy it. Also, this movie doesn't have any nuances. <br/><br/>The only highlight of the movie is Denzel Washington's fascinating performance. His glassy-eyed stare, slurred speech, and baffled facial expressions are so plausible that I'm convinced he was actually drunk while filming. I'm sure he read the ham-handed script (or at least part of it) and decided that he wouldn't be able to get through the shoot sober. <br/><br/>There's a subplot involving a sexy heroin addict with a heart of gold, but nobody cares about that. The soundtrack uses pop songs about heroin (Under the Bridge, Gimme Shelter) during her scenes, which is helpful because I found myself forgetting that she was even in the movie and I needed to be reminded every so often what her drama was. Presumably the actress was also actually using heroin during filming and either died of an overdose or stopped showing up, because she vanishes shortly after the halfway point. Not that I'm complaining.<br/><br/>All of this stuff goes on and on in predictable ways, ends in a corny moral lesson, and Denzel takes home a paycheck large enough to install a whole new government in Uganda.<br/><br/>To be totally honest, I think the whole movie was just an excuse for Robert Zemeckis to meet Nadine Velazquez."

","The first half hour of the film was mediocre - there was a sex scene and a plane crash. After that, everything was about the captain's struggle against alcoholism. Even though it was an emotional struggle, it's one we don't have to see on the big screen.<br/><br/>I also know a few captains that fly commercial airlines worldwide. Although most of them are not alcoholics, there are a few I know that are highly irresponsible and pay attention to other things other than flying the plane - such as those being bored with flying and trying to get into another career; so they study while they fly. <br/><br/>This film just drives it in for me that there are no stringent measures taken to ensure that pilots are screened on a regular basis to be at their peak when flying planes carrying hundreds of passengers. <br/><br/>Overall, I found the film to be very boring, and more of a wake-up call to passengers that captains are human as well and subject to the many issues any of us may face. As a result, I didn't enjoy this addiction story as it felt like it kept dragging on and on for hours with no ending."

Though some scenes are clichéd, the rest of the movie has its interesting moments to enjoy. I would recommend this movie to those who are just want to sit back and the go though this emotional ride of the main protagonist of the movie.

I did not, therefore, find parts of the movie, or the movie itself, 'too long'. And, since I am writing a book about the corruption of our lawyers, who will do anything to 'protect their client' while the truth ultimately suffers, Washington portrays an individual who seemed to understand better, in the end, what the word 'justice' really means.

","'Flight forces you to view the safe crash from another perspective' that's what I summarised the movie with. In the first few scenes of the movie you see a drunk pilot saving a lot of lives, but still losing a few. My reaction immediately was: ""What a great pilot, saving so many souls"". The movie however, suddenly turns dark and forces you to view the crash from another point of view; from the dead passengers. Even though, technically, the plane was not in 'tip-top' state and not ready to be flown, the pilot wasn't in good state either. You, as a viewer, slowly start to realise the technical problem wasn't even the biggest problem: the pilot was. As the pictures start rolling by you realise that ""the pilot wasn't great, he wasn't good."" He pulled some nice tricks to keep most passengers alive, but still, putting so many lives at risk is even a bigger problem. The slow realisation, as you can call it, is one of the strong points of this movie. Even though I don't think Denzel Washington is one of the best actors there is, he did a great job with this film.

"anthonyehler","10","0","2","25 February 2014"," What makes a hero?
","Flight 9/10<br/><br/>The power of this movie is how it uses its fascinating anti-hero, played by Denzel Washington as Whip Whittaker, to ask some tough and intriguing questions. Just like the stunning crash sequence destabilises the life of Whip, an alcoholic pilot, the aftermath changes the way we as an audience look at him. Can a true hero, who saves lives, be an unlikeable alcoholic? That was the unsettling and made me change the way I thought about this question. And then the writer brings in a theme of religion: the plane crashes into a church's field, the co-pilot is an extreme Christian, even Whip's ally – a senior flight attendant – has a strong faith. Yet here is an arrogant man without faith in anyone except his own deep denial – and is unable to surrender his burden of addiction. The idea of surrender to a higher power is central to recovery – yet it's not hard to see how Whip could see himself as a higher power, saving lives in a trouble sky. I know some critics found some of the plot points implausible – such as how his addiction went unnoticed in regulatory tests. Others found the 11th hour turnaround in his character a cop-out. These are valid points, but I thought the movie made us see alcoholism in a strikingly original way and that has to be praised."

","Flight is one of my best dramatic movies ever. This movie remind me about the nature of all human beings. Which being weak and always seeking for pleasure. Whip Whitaker, played by Denzel Washington an addicted pilot who find a problem in his plane which led the plane to fall. With the good judgment of Captain Whip he could crashes the plane in an empty field and saves many lives. However, six people died cause the crash. The investigation indicated that captain Whip was drunk during the flight. And he may have a life sentence. And then begin the story. The story of struggling between being in the real world or being in the unreal world. As expected from Denzel Washington the acting was magnificent. On the other hand, I think the plot was a little bit predictable. Otherwise, I enjoyed with the special effects. Especially in the plane scene. And I can't forget about the amazing ending.

As the movie played out I realized I was watching an amazing piece of film history. I firmly believe that Denzel Washington is one of the best actors of our time. In this movie, as most that he is in, I do not see him as Denezel W., but as the actual character he is portraying. He makes me believe him, which is key. This story is about a Pilot that has a drinking and substance abuse problem. Because of an in flight accident (A very edge of your seat piece of film) he was blood tested and caught. The way the story plays out, and the performances that carried it through are both amazing works of art. The whole movie felt like a true story that I was seeing happen before my own eyes. The topic of substance abuse in a career that holds public trust is also a very of-the-times type of piece, and I love every minute of it. Overall a terrific drama, a near perfect film, I give a high 9/10 rating (only reason no 10/10 is because of a personal lack or re-watch-ability) but will not be buying on BluRay/DVD."

","Flight is a drama film released in 2012. It prominently stars Denzel Washington, other stars include Nadine Velazquez and Don Cheadle. This film takes place in 2011 all over the United States as Denzel Washington plays Whip Whitaker who is a airline pilot.<br/><br/>Flight starts off with Whip Whitaker waking up after a long night of drinking and sex. He then takes cocaine to wake himself up. We then find out he is on his way to the airport to fly an airline jet with 102 passengers. On the plane he proceeds to have three more nips of vodka and then takes off. The plane suddenly goes into a nosedive after a half hour of flight. Whip miraculously gains control and lands the plane in a field which leads to saving 96 of the 102 people. The situation was recreated by a flight simulator and every pilot who attempted to land the plane could not do so. Whip was seen as a hero, however the investigation led to the findings that his blood alcohol level was very high and that there was cocaine in his system. Whip, who is an alcoholic struggles to stay sober and carry out the trial.<br/><br/>The director did a great job with the shots in the film. Being a drama there were many emotional scenes. Whip being an alcoholic his family and friends were constantly giving up on his and leaving him. The close up shots of Whips expressions really gave an emotional feel to the film. It gave the audience a better look into what Whip was feeling making me more attached to him during the movie.<br/><br/>Gender representation in this film was very different. Nadine Velazquez played a very sexual flight attendant. She has sexual relations with Whip as did the other main female in the movie, Kelly Reilly. Kelly played Nicole who was a heroin addict. I found it interesting the two different women portrayed in this film were very opposite, and in the end the imperfect addict was the one who made the most difference in Whips life, trying to lead him away from his problem as she is fighting hers.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this film. I thought it brought a strong message to the viewers about alcoholism. I usually do not enjoy dramas, however this one really made me interested in Whip and what his life would become. I enjoyed the ending as well it gave the movie a good twist. I would recommend this movie."
"Bandrews815","9","0","2","30 November 2013"," Rings true
","As a fan of quality filmmaking Zemeckis does a great job of creating a flawed but sympathetic character in Whip (a very convincing Denzel). Like previous reviewers stated, the alcoholic/drug abusing role can be easily over done. Denzel plays it great. He has the right mix of cockiness and assuredness while he spirals out of control(pun intended). The ending completely makes sense from a Hollywood perspective, but I like it as well. Sure there are people who may say it's too calculated, even self-righteous, but nothing could have been gained by watching Whip continue to fall. The supporting cast is convincing enough. People with addiction do seem to surround themselves with well wishing, albeit it meek yes-men and women. Goodman's long-time, drug-dealing buddy is a humorous touch, although I could have done without the cocaine scene towards the end. I understand Zemeckis's choice to add humor to a tense scene but it kind of undoes all the hard work the film made in getting to that point. Even the shot of Denzel leaving the hotel (complete with funky song and druggie stroll, reminiscent of a Scorsese movie) while cool, does little to hammer home the theme that late in the movie. Without getting too personal, this movie is great for someone going through an addiction, especially someone who is functioning with the disease like myself. It seems like many addicts don't know how to be any other way after using for so long, and can't cope with emotions. The relapses Whip experiences all happen when his emotions are too great. Very powerful film. Overall I give it 9 out 10."

","I HATE alcohol. Never been able to touch the stuff. Give me a glass of cranberry juice anyday. But some people.... live for it. depend on it. It's like their liquid nurse. They don't care if it makes them swing from chandeliers and say outrageous things about the bosses wife... if their life is rubbish and nothing is going right, it's a lifesaver.<br/><br/>'Whip', the lead character in Flight, is a hero. He saves over a hundred lives in a crash that most would suggest was a complete write-off, only losing six. But he is also an alcoholic. The very first scene, we see him gulping wine and snorting on coke, after a night of passion with an air hostess. The plane he later pilots is a death trap which was always destined to fall apart, but thanks to his expertise, the minimum amount of casualties were sustained. As I said, the guy is a hero. But thanks to a hospital toxicology report, the results show him high on drugs and booze. This had nothing to do with the jet being patently unsuitable for flying, but thanks to the circumstances, the investigators are able to pin some on the blame on him... to cover up the airline's own shortcomings.<br/><br/>So, what begins as an edge-of-your-seat nailbiter as the plane descends into a vertical dive, quickly transforms into a sombre drama... as Washington's character reflects on his addictions and comes to terms with his failures as a father, son and general all-round person, while the media and law enforcement officers sniff about. He befriends a fellow patient in the ward where he's being treated for his injuries and, but she is unable to stop him from sinking into further depression... and consequently leaves. His only real friend seems to be his overweight dealer, who seems to be there on cue every time he needs a hit of 'the good stuff'. His life is basically a mess. He HAS to keep it together though, for a hearing which will determine his future, whether he's a free man or a jailbird.<br/><br/>And this is where 'the big moment' occurs. Where he realises he has 'to do the right thing'. You have to applaud his morality, but on the other hand... the man is a fool. He does NOT deserve the eventual fate that befalls him, regardless of him going on about 'redemption'. Who does he owe anyway, with the possible exception of his ex-wife and son? Why should a man who rescued scores of people from a fiery death, take any responsibility for it? What he was on at the time was irrelevant... It didn't impair his ability to do his job... In fact, it may even have improved it. But to throw him under the bus like that... disgraceful. He might think he has a lot to learn going by his final monologue, but if you ask me... it's the authorities that need to have a good hard to at themselves.<br/><br/>Sorry, in my tirade I forgot to comment on the quality of the work being discussed. Acting good, story okay, film maybe runs for a bit longer than necessary and the nude girlie has a nice uh, 'physique' (Judging by all the lingering, the cameraman agrees too). But it all boils down to the fundamental point the director is trying to make, which I disagree with in the strongest possible terms. In fact, the main message I got is that American justice SUCKS. 6/10"
"mwalgen22","7","0","1","13 November 2013"," I liked the actors but not the story or the script.
","I saw ""Flight"" last night.<br/><br/>It's a little disconnected.<br/><br/>First, the opening shots of Nadine Velasquez were sexy, cheap, and revealing about where this drama was going to go.<br/><br/>Second, the movie had a hell of a cast--Denzel Washington, Bruce Greenwood, John Goodman, Don Cheadle, Kelly Reilly, all fine actors, and there was a huge cast. But where was the story? Where did that go? Though you had lots of action and drama to open, the plot hardly developed any significant and meaningful twists. And on that point, the movie crashed early on. Whip Whitaker knew he'd be railroaded by the NTSB. But that never materialized until the end, where it was revealed up front that the plane had the bolt of one of its wings destroyed. Really? That's the twist we'd all been waiting for to exonerate Whip from negligent homicide? And it took nearly the entire movie to one, present this information, and two, to present no real challenge to Whip's character as a lying, drinking, hustling pilot? The plot never really developed. Reilly's character, Nicole, was as pathetic as Whip. What, was it a case of misery loves company? I mean how many clichés can one endure? Her character goes nowhere. We see her get picked up by a sponsor from AA, but where does she go? We don't know. We're not supposed to know. It's only enough to know that she left and that somehow demonstrates an independent and full recovery from a series of train wrecks. Ah, hardly. I mean there were these subplots that were really belabored and kept the movie, ""Flight,"" on the ground. It never got off the ground.<br/><br/>So what's the story about then? Is it a creative production of how a talented man comes to terms with his addiction? Is it a case of how a man learns about himself by the movie's end because his son asks, ""Who are you?"" From that ending to the scene before it to the larger realization where he needs cocaine to bring himself up again in front of Cheadle, Greenwood, Goodman, and Michael Beasley, we've kind of gotten the point by then that he is who he is--he's a talent pilot but a wreck of a man. But is that the story? I mean is that all to the story? No.<br/><br/>There's more. The story is about a skilled professional who has a private demon while serving the public. There is the line that he ""violated the public's trust."" According to whom? Who's trust? I mean does the public have any say so whatsoever in vetting any pilot any where? And if they did, would they know what to look for? Would they know what questions to ask? It's not public trust that Whip has violated, it's the Federal Aviation Commission who sets standards, creates licensing, and whatnot, but they love to say that it is the public's trust that he has violated. No. It's a case of government blaming the victim. Whip, too, was injured in the crash--he was a victim of it. But in order for the NTSB to shift blame and hold someone else accountable to their shoddy regulations, the lawyers and the NTSB heads have to tell us that it was the pilot who violated the public's trust as though the government has been in the act of serving the public. That's one kind of service I can do without. Whip is beholden to industry standards set by the government, and according to his remarkable skills at flying at inverted positions we learn that he has surpassed any other pilot in the same position. But that doesn't matter. All that matters is that he's a boozer. Clearly the booze did not affect his flying. That's made clear. Yet since the NTSB gets its funding from the tax-payer, it does not want to take the blame for shoddy standards but instead show the public that they have its best interest. They do not. For an added moral berating to his character, the plot includes people and visits to the AA. Always the individual's fault. Never the fault of the agency that sets the standards and regulations that serve special interest, crony-connected capitalists who are real capitalists.<br/><br/>I Denzel Washington. I like Goodman, particularly in Barton Fink. And I like Don Cheadle in Boogie Nights. But since then, Cheadle has had every politically correct role that one can find.<br/><br/>And then there are the requisite cheap shots at Christianity. Hollywood is Darwinian.<br/><br/>I rated this movie a 7 because I liked the actors. The script read like it was written by 10th graders."

","Flight is a very, very well made film. I love the brutal honesty and emotional toil that is very palpable throughout the movie. Denzel Washington is an American icon of acting. His total dedication to his craft is as impressive as any actor I've watched in the last 20 years. <br/><br/>The premise of a hard drinking, coke snorting woman chasing alpha male airline pilot smacks of what James Bond may have been if he flunked out at spy school. The plot is very straight forward and absolutely believable - on all levels. Denzel's character is so flawed, and so honest that at times, this movie resembles a documentary. <br/><br/>The supporting cast is very good. I love John Goodman's character. It places a modicum of well needed humor in an otherwise very dark and disturbing narrative. Don Cheadle seemed a bit wooden, but overall, very done. <br/><br/>I love the honesty.

","All the bad reviews that I read are essentially written in ego maniacal fashion. All the good reviews are by people who detect the societal moral dilemma within in the film. If you are a commercial pilot, and the crash is 20 minutes long, do not base your entire review on the plausibility of the crash, because believe or not, the movies is absolutely not about that. Neither is solely about his drug addiction. It seems to suggest how criminal lawsuits can be rigid to a man's story, only looking at facts, not giving weight to desperation versus mal-intent. Its an audience splitter. Have to write on more line to fill the requirement."

","After a brief start in which we see Whip (Denzel Washington) and a female partner drink and indulge in drugs for breakfast, Whip takes off into the skies towards Atlanta. While the plane is flying Whip enjoys a nice relaxing screwdriver but then something goes wrong. The plane malfunctions and starts to fail. A few people die because of the dire circumstances while Whip tries to steady the plane, even resorting to turning and flying it upside down. The crazy thing is about that move, and the movie Flight itself, is that idea works. Whip saves everyone and the scene is outstanding and breathtaking to watch. These first twenty five minutes are terrific but the movie falls flat after that.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington as the lead gives a very good performance as Captain Whip Whitaker, well he does the best he can. Flight was doomed from the start because the script is horrible. There is nothing new presented about addicts or alcoholics that one would not have seen in a film like Ray (a better but similar film) or Leaving Las Vegas (which is incredible). All the best scenes in Flight are within the first hour and the movie only becomes a more stale addiction drama after that. Kelly Reilly again does an above average job with a character where there is nothing for the audience to hold onto. James Badge Dale on the other hand steals one scene, with Nicole (Reily) and Whip, playing a cancer patient who is destined to day any day. Dale bursts off the screen in this short scene that has almost nothing to it, but that is what the movie needed more of. The other supporting parts bring nothing positive to the film, including a over praised John Goodman playing a cursing drug dealer, so while watching the film all I could hold onto was the crash scene and the work Dale brought to the film.<br/><br/>After Whip goes on with his daily life surviving a plane crash we never get a sense of danger or death from his addiction, the opposite is actually true. He is at his best when his high and nothing says that more than the plane crash scene. Why would we want this man who saved over one hundred lives to break his addiction and become someone else. His co-pilot did not know what he was doing and would have killed them all, but whether drunk or high Whip rules the air and through the film is viewed as generally nicer, funnier and better off when he is high. In a pivotal scene later in the film, director Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump, Back to the Future) holds the camera so long on an object the whole audience knows Whip wants it. If you catch the film on cable watch it until the plane crashes, or maybe even until James Badge Dale shows up if you can last that long, but if you stay all the way till the end it only gets more worse and more stale."

The namesake sequence of the film is probably its best, filled with amazing tension and some stellar effects.Flight could have been a better film if it had capitalized on the success of the tension it so well displayed early during the plane crash. Whip's story, his battles with his numerous demons- and ultimately, his freedom from them- are moving and wonderful to watch. If Zemeckis hadn't tried to shoehorn in this ridiculous investigation plot that never really merits any attention, it would have been that much better. Washington gives a five-star performance, but the rest of Flight lands at a dismal Three and a half out of Five Stars."

This is how the film ends, a hero made pitiful and faceless by the very people who he saves.

"donuthaters12","5","0","3","10 July 2013"," There Is Too Many Problems For Me To Appreciate This Film
","I have not seen all of Robert Zemeckis' films but with the ones I have seen, either it was good or just so-so, I think ""wow"". The Back of the Future, even the third one, is spectacular, Romancing the Stone was light and fun with colorful characters and great chemistry between the two leads, and The Polar Express is a beautiful Christmas film using motion capture and a film I can watch time and time again without getting bored. Not all of these films I just mentioned are perfect but they are great films and are effective on what they are trying to do. Flight is Zemeckis' return to live action and it takes a more serious tone compared to the ones I am familiar with. The film has flaws and it has it's strong points.<br/><br/>A screenplay written by John Gatins and honestly, this is the first time I have heard of him and Flight is the first film I have watched from him. I came into this, due to trailers and posters, thinking that it's going to be heavily focused on a plane crash but instead the film's real focus is the effects of alcoholism. There are moments of the film, where this focus works but at times feels pointless. The moments that work are the focus on his addiction's damage to his relationships and career. What also worked in the film, are the story points where they discuss about his case in the plane crash and whether or not his addiction could have caused it. Even with these great moments, they are bridged between pointless and boring moments like the protagonist's romantic relationship with the drug addict, or the scenes with his family. They felt a bit forced and added only a little bit, the divorced family aspect, to the plot. At the start of the film, Kelly Reilly's character was introduced a little too heavily. It makes the audience think that she is that of an important character and I felt that the film took a bit of a wrong turn. The film's plot was decent but could have been improved in certain areas.<br/><br/>Robert Zemeckis clearly wanted to make a film about the dark side of alcohol addiction. Yet the film doesn't feel dark in it's tone but rather a little positive. The plane crash sequence felt suspenseful but not in a way that would make me think twice on stepping on a plane again or whether the flight crew is to be trusted. I get it, the focus is on Whip Whitaker but if there was a sense of weight on the damage that may have been caused due to his condition, then the film would feel more effective. The film didn't really show much of his love for flying, which he desperately wants to keep, and it seems we have to just accept the fact that it's his love and passion.<br/><br/>With the films I have watched that has Don Burgess as the director of photography, it always feels light. It seems almost positive at times regardless if the subject of the film is dark or serious. This is just a judgement based on the films I have seen from him; I have not seen his other works like Priest, Source Code, or Contact that I assume may have a dark tone. Because the film here has a dark matter to it, it should be handled by a cinematographer who is capable of capturing the damage of alcoholism, but there must first be an intention from the director in order to really create that atmosphere.<br/><br/>The soundtrack of this film is top notch. The songs comes from amazing artists like Red Hot Chili Peppers, Lou Reed, The Rolling Stones, and Marvin Gaye. When they come on, it doesn't feel out of place and sounds appropriate to the scene especially the song 'Under the Bridge'. Alan Silvestri is the composer for the film and I felt that his score was a little underused. I did not really notice his impact until the climax, it sounded great and dramatic.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is what saved this film. Denzel as always brings his best and plays this tortured man without going to the point of melodrama. I had no idea the supporting cast of this film was going to have big names. Don Cheadle was great, he was really subtle but excellent. Bruce Greenwood, whom I am only familiar with from Star Trek, was really good in this. Brian Geraghty was pretty good from The Hurt Locker and I felt he gave a better performance here, even if his role is minor. But when John Goodman comes into the scene, he steals it and everyone plays off him great, in particular the hotel scene. Goodman plays a little eccentric but not to the point where you are distracted from the point of his appearance. The chemistry between Reilly and Washington was the my only issue as it felt like they were just saying what they were told to say and do what they were supposed to do, and also their point to the story was useless in my opinion.<br/><br/>The film is decent and does have enough good points about it to give it a watch. This didn't hit me as it did for some people but it is deserving of it's appreciation in Denzel Washington's performance. I ever feel like watching something from Zemeckis, this wouldn't be at the top of my list."

","Great viewing of two drug addicted people on different sides of the 'track'. The truth prevailed and every one was happy . . . a little disappointing perhaps but appealed in a 'I'm glad everything turned out all right in the end' theme. Terrific flight scene. Some tender moments as the dysfunctional persons struggling to come to grips with their reality. They look at each other and see the same sad reflection. After using each other as a crutch they seem to swap roles as one rises, the other falls. If you are a Denzel Washington, Junior fan there are no disappointments. The opening scene was unnecessary but would appeal to those inclined toward sex scenes. Being 'off the planet' on or off drugs is a bad place to be.

","HEED MY WORDS Hollywood, CAST DENZEL IN MORE ROLES!!! Let me put it this way, Denzel Washington has impressed me before, and he has also completely bored me for entire movies. And this movie, is by far one of his best performances (and get American Gangster out of your head, it was way overrated). Where to start? Lets see, well the writing of this film is totally spot on, it has such a pace and depth to the story that it just compels you to pay closer, and closer attention. Usually these disaster movies, hook you for the beginning, you loose attention in the middle as the pace slows, and then fails to entertain towards the end. NOT THIS. This movie will get you hook line and sinker. Acting? OH WOW. I didn't see John Goodman being cast in the role of his coke dealer, it was a total curve ball. AND I LOVED IT... When Denzel Washington, and Goodman, share the screen they captivate together, they play off each other, and make extremely memorable scenes. This movie was also shot very well, and with a lot of precision, the framing, and the cutting are spot on and keep the pace going. It never gets slow. BUT. Above the acting, and the way it was shot, and the writing, is the music. The music is a character in the film, and I like it because there are huge uses of the Rolling Stones, every time Goodmans Character is on screen. If you want a movie that you wont soon forget. Go watch this one, Id even recommend buying it."

","I never thought this film was this good. The film packs a powerhouse of emotions from the word go. As usual Denzel Washington carries the film on his able shoulders. he is at absolute ease presenting the role of an alcoholic and never ever goes overboard. He is highly successful in his portrayal of a drunkard with a lot of emotional turmoil. The film opens with a breathtakingly shot plane crash and than takes a sharp turn in to the life of the chief pilot. The supporting cast really does the job and provides the necessary support for the proceedings. It surely is one of the finest performances of Denzel of late and is a real come back in to his true senses. If you watch the film with not too much of expectations, there is a strong chance that you will be pleasantly surprised."

","Denzel Washington equals good to great films, we all know that. This film is somewhat different, it has a very hard hitting point about alcoholism and it's side effects on one and all. The deceptive way alcoholics can not only hide their problem but survive and indeed reach superior levels of ability whilst under the influence is portrayed very accurately. I am sure that a lot of people will understand this film, you don't need to be a pilot to appreciate it. 90% of the film, very accurate and realistic, sadly Hollywood being what it is we (or more pertinantly THEY) needed a happy ending, where everyone has come out better for the experience.....sadly reality isn't like that. A more realistic ending would have made this film a groundbreaking spectacle, however Hollywood's need to suit the masses brings with it the flawed, unrealistic ending.

The story is much deeper in the relating of the addiction traumas than the plane crash heroism and sadness. Expect flashbacks to the excellent flying maneuvers and passenger and crew reactions.

However, God has a presence in this movie that is more complex. The Lord brings us the steeple scene and of course the glorious mini-bar - His good work. Is God for or against the Captain? Religion runs throughout this movie, obviously, but it never REALLY clarifies where ""the Lord"" falls on this tragedy or on Captain Whitaker. What is clear is the prominent role of friends and enemies in Whip's journey. Some people are both, but whether they are hurting or helping our hero they are almost all defining themselves on that meter. Who am I to Whip Whitaker? Perhaps even God wants to be part of that.

","Anyone who's struggled with an addiction will find a lot to like about this film, and Washington's performance in it. <br/><br/>There are two other things that stand out. The first is the soundtrack. I've always thought an exceptional soundtrack can lift a very good film into something that resonates much more deeply. Flight has one of those soundtracks. Second, there is some gratuitous nudity. I'm not sure what the point is. The only explanation I could come up with is that it illustrates Whip's hedonistic lifestyle. The problem is I'm so distracted by the nudity that I'm not connecting it to Whip at all - I totally forget Washington is even in the scene.<br/><br/>Roger Ebert suggested this movie could have had a better finishing line: ""I'm an alcoholic"". I disagree. I think the reason for Whip's thoughtful smile was that while he now understood he was an alcoholic, he also knew it alone didn't define him. He still had time to explore the other aspects of his personality that had long been buried by his addiction. Anyone who's been addicted to something in their life will know exactly what Whip's smile means and why it's so special."

"januaryman-1","8","0","3","28 February 2013"," Great character study
","Flight caught a lot of flak as people realized that it wasn't an action movie about a plane crash. The false impression that it was such a movie undoubtedly came from the movie's trailers. If Flight had been an action movie, it would have undoubtedly been a special effects movie with some character development filling in the gaps between the effects. Flight is really a movie about a pilot's crash that is separate and distinct from the plane's crash.<br/><br/>Flight's anti-hero pilot, Whip Whitaker, is played by Denzel Washington. The opening scene of Flight immediately dashes any heroic conception of Whitaker and should scare the daylights out of anyone who flies as a commercial passenger. That scene has Whitaker and flight attendant Katerina Marquez, played by My Name is Earl's Nadine Velazquez, waking up from a night of presumed debauchery and returning themselves to some level of functionality through the use of beer, cocaine, and marijuana.<br/><br/>Cut to the airport, where the airliner, piloted by the self-medicated Whitaker leaps from the earth into a severe thunderstorm. Whitaker pushes the aircraft to edge of it performance envelope as he maneuvers the plane through a rough couple of minutes before popping into blue skies. Whittaker turns the controls over to his somewhat priggish co-pilot, Ken Evans, played very well by Brian Geraghty, and treats himself to three bottles of vodka from the drink cart. This scene becomes important later in the movie.<br/><br/>The flight progresses and the time for descent begins. Co-pilot Evans pushes the control yoke forward and all hell breaks loose as the plane becomes uncontrollable. Uncontrollable for anyone but Whip Whitaker who takes over the controls and barks a series of orders to Evans and drafts flight attendant, Margaret Thomason, played by Tamara Tunie, into service manipulating the throttles. Whitaker later claims that his actions and instructions came from instinct rather than contemplation. Most movies require that the viewer suspend disbelief to some degree; the instinctual nature of Whitaker's actions and its more or less successful execution requires that suspension. The plane crashes, albeit in a fairly controlled fashion and only six people are lost. Whitaker is hailed by the press and the public as a herountil the routine toxicology test performed on crew members indicates that Whitaker had an impressive blood alcohol content and cocaine in his system. This is where Flight really takes off.<br/><br/>The dead demand an answer. So states lawyer Hugh Lang, played by the ever capable Don Cheadle. The movie describes a system where aircraft owners try to blame the aircraft manufacturer or, failing that, pilot error. The manufacturer tries to shift blame to the aircraft owner or crew. Whitaker, as pilot, points the finger at anyone but himself. He says in no uncertain terms that the plane was ""broken."" Enter Nicole, played by British actor Kelly Reilly. Nicole is a down on her luck photographer who became addicted to heroin and prostitutes herself for drug money. Even as the airliner flown by Whittaker flies inverted overhead, Nicole is being wheeled from her apartment after overdosing. The two meet in the hospital later that day. The two become lovers, and Nicole begins a transformation into Whitaker's conscience. Whitaker doesn't enjoy having a conscience, having gone so long without one, and the relationship with Nicole suffers from the strain.<br/><br/>John Goodman plays Harling Mays, Whitaker's affable and eccentric dealer and general enabler. Mays arrives at key times in the movie to save the day or postpone Whitaker's day of reckoning. The audience should hate what Mays is, but that is hard to do. Director Robert Zemeckis, even has The Rolling Stones' Sympathy for the Devil place each time Mays makes an entrance.<br/><br/>The efforts of union representative and Whitaker's old friend, Charlie Anderson, played by Bruce Greenwood, and lawyer Lang give Whitaker the opportunity for denial, something he has done for many years. Will Whitaker run for his life or face the music? Flight is an intense character study that will hold you rapt. Flight is a long movie at 138 minutes, but you won't even notice that."

I seriously understood only a fraction of what some of the characters were saying, especially that cancer patient, I just couldn't understand him at all. I wish there were more slow scenes in this film. It was just too dialog-heavy. Maybe it had something to do with my own state of mind when I went into the theater, like I needed to see something more relaxing that night, don't know. By the way, is this based on any real events? Has anyone ever landed an airplane after flying it upside down? Has any pilot been found to be an alcoholic and a cocaine addict? Personally, I would have been more interested in some more technical stuff about how it is that an airplane can fly upside down when it can't fly right side up, and less in the pilot's alcohol problems. I guess I would have been more interested to see a feature film that was based on a real airplane crash investigation, rather than something that someone made up."

","I understand the need for TV spots and theatrical trailers to promote films. They need to show something to get people to the movie and get a return on the investment. But the trailers for Flight are typical in the way they reveal far too much about the movie. Reviews reveal too much. Interviews with crew and actors reveal too much. All of this lessens the impact of the story's narrative. most movies are like this and Flight is no exception. The medium of film relies on images that refute each other and stand in contrast to each other, which creates tension, shock, drama. For instance, having seen the trailers and read up on the movie, it came as no surprise that seconds after Whip snorts lines of coke he's exiting his hotel room dressed in his pilot uniform. That is a great cut! Ruined! What's more: the Academy Awards (sorry, ""Oscars"") chose to use the film's climactic scene, the NTSP hearing, to showcase Denzel Washington's performance. The brief clip they used GAVE AWAY THE ENDING OF THE FILM. Prior to this scene, you have this rather shocking scene in which Whip's union rep, his lawyer, and his coke dealer get him ""ready"" for the hearing after a night of binge drinking by paying for the dealer's drugs and services. The only reason this scene exists is to cast doubt on Whip's testimony. Will he do the right thing? Well if you watched the Oscars, you already know. It's criminal. And frustrating. Another note on the best actor race, which Denzel lost to Daniel Day-Lewis. I think Denzel's performance here is so much more powerful in how he shrinks himself and takes risks and sheds all of his Denzel-ness. It's hard to measure a performance to say who should ""win."" But I don't believe Day-Lewis' performance carries Lincoln. It's a combination of elements: the history, Tommy Lee Jones, Sally Field. But with Flight, Denzel carries it. His role and performance carries it."
"The_creator2010","8","0","4","26 February 2013"," Flight sees Denzel Washington convey a performance we haven't seen since Training Day
","It was a quiet night at the Oscars regarding the service behind Flight. What were the chances for Denzel anyway? Mixed with nominees such as Daniel Day-Lewis and Joaquin Phoenix (my winner). Denzel's performance in Flight does not need to be celebrated with an Oscar, rather a celebration between movie lovers global, because in my opinion, his performance is as good as anyone this year.<br/><br/>Flight begins with immediate impact, introducing a storyline that collaborates and connects smoothly with the consequences of decisions from Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington); an airline pilot with problems broader than family disconnection. The morning of a flight departing from Orlando to Atlanta would distinguish all possibilities in life, affecting characters of the movie both physically and mentally.<br/><br/>Waking up in a coma is always a bad sign. For Whip, it's about to get worse. Despite his majestic manoeuvre that saves the majority of lives on the plane, Whip is welcomed with the possibility of jail time following a blood test revealing traces of alcohol and drugs within his system.<br/><br/>However Whip is offered an ultimatum from Charlie (Bruce Greenwood); head of the pilots union who along with Hugh (Don Cheadle), offer to destroy the evidence behind the blood test in order to save the airline. Post crash, Whip struggles to overcome his alcohol addiction. In a bid to save Whip's dying reputation, Charlie consistently reminds him of his priority which is to avoid drinking, and avoid the media.<br/><br/>Flight evaluates the struggle of one man's character who, despite finding a likable persona in Nicole (Kelly Reilly), they both find themselves fighting a losing battle as Nicole seeks to throw a heroin habit, while Whip's rouge personality is destined to drag them both down, unless Charlie and the union can keep him sober, which is a task more daunting than the union could have imagined.<br/><br/>Robert Zemeckis's latest directorial creation is aimed to elaborate on two tragic angles of events; the crash and more so, the battle of human alcoholism. Robert brings out an unsympathetic character in Denzel that reveals an ecstatic performance and quite an original portrayal regarding the constant resemblance of movies we have seen from Denzel over the years. What is possibly Denzel Washington's best movie/performance since Training Day, his alcoholic persona is played out to perfection, while on the other hand Zemeckis introduces a level of romantic optimism with the chemistry of Whip and Nicole opening up a chapter in Whips life; one he has not embraced since his wife disowned him.<br/><br/>Flight is extremely centred on one mans battle, despite the inclusion of some crafty actors such as John Goodman who plays the humorous character of Harling; Whip's not-so trusty friend, more so his dependent drug supplier. John Goodman was clearly included to add a touch of comedy to a movie rounded up of depressing, dramatic sequences (quite appropriately).<br/><br/>Denzel has not featured in a story with this much craft and originality since Training Day and American Gangster. Movies such as Unstoppable, Deja Vu and Out of Time have advertised a stinking spell in his career. However I have always been a major fan of Denzel, and Flight really does showcase and once again rekindle the acting tools of a man who sometimes lacks the consistency of Hollywood choices.<br/><br/>Overall: Entirely focused on the presence of Denzel's character, Flight is an emotional thrill-ride, opening up a completely new side to Denzel's acting. Robert Zemeckis has created a dramatic story consisting of the battles of addiction, human ambition and that hope of potential romance, revealing a movie that can only be described as thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish.<br/><br/>8/10 Did you enjoy this review?

","Flight is the study of a man who in a moment of crisis, saves over ninety lives. But as a result winds up having to save himself. What sets it apart from other films dealing with substance abuse is that it sets up an interesting point of view. At one point Don Cheadle's character points out to Denzel Washingtons character Whit Whitaker, that several pilots had tried to duplicate his actions in averting the total loss of every passenger and crew member in the simulator, and all failed. This leads to an inference that if Whit hadn't been stoned out, he might not have been able to pull the maneuver off. This is reinforced at the hearing where Whitaker says his actions were instinctual in reply to a question questionfrom the hearing officer. This of course leads to ask does this excuse his behavior? Of course not. Whitaker's own statements at the end point out the futility of that line of thought. This is the the truly remarkable beauty of this story. We are allowed to come to the same conclusion that Whitaker comes to. But we come to it of our own volition. The same as our protagonist. We come to it without preaching or being led by the nose. It is an excellent study of a man who must in the end, save his self respect in addition to a plane full of people."
"richwgriffin-227-176635","6","0","1","12 February 2013"," Portrait of addiction
","I particularly loved two of the performances: Kelly Reilly (Nicole) and Tamara Tunie (Margaret). My favorite scene in the movie was when Whip (Denzel Washington) is asking Margaret to lie for him at the hearing. Her intelligence and her heartbreak at his request is truly great acting.<br/><br/>I had mixed feelings about Denzel Washington's performance. There were several scenes that just didn't work for me, but other scenes soared. Why was he paired with two much younger women in this movie? Tamara Tunie is closer to his age and is such a great actress, why not pair him with someone of her stature and age? I found myself really disliking all of the drug-taking scenes. However, Nicole's recovery was well developed.<br/><br/>The two scenes of turbulence on the plane were really tense and well-directed scenes. My biggest complaint about this movie is it's length: 2 hours and 18 minutes. I think 20 minutes could have been cut (all of John Goodman's role would be fine by me, and a few of the scenes at the farm went on too long).<br/><br/>I loved the ending. Telling the truth is so rare in movies today. Showing that cover-ups sometimes don't happen and justice can be served - it made me think about today's politics of justifications and cover-ups for heinous crimes against humanity. I was so glad he confessed and he had some consequences for his actions. I would not want to be flying on a plane with someone who was drunk and/or high on drugs! That's the real reason he goes to prison, not the plane crash, at least in my mind. He's finally free. Sweet ending. His son asks him ""who are you?"" and he says ""that's a great question"". It's the question we all have to ask ourselves."
"rooee","7","0","2","11 February 2013"," Sometimes soaring
","Robert Zemeckis's first foray into live-action since 2000 is further proof that he is one of the most intelligent mainstream filmmakers working today. He does precisely what popular artists should: render complex themes accessible and entertaining. Like Forrest Gump, Contact and Cast Away, Flight focuses on a single character as an archetype for broader human truths.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington plays Whip Whitaker, an airline pilot who gets wasted on booze and coke, goes to work, and then saves a hundred souls from certain death. It's a simple story that unleashes myriad moral and ethical minions into the mind.<br/><br/>The plane crash itself is handled with the kind of technical aplomb we've come to expect after Cast Away's memorable opening plunge. Zemeckis enhances the tension and horror by shooting the scene almost entirely from within the plane. ""Oh my God!"" cried a member of my audience as the sequence came to an end. It was more apt a reaction than she may have known. As the plane comes down it strikes the spire of a church, and thereon the references to God, faith and redemption are numerous. The mechanical failure that causes the crash is defined as an ""Act of God"". To take this literally would be to say that God willed that the passengers should die. Whip effectively defies the will of God. Therefore, in the eyes of believers, Whip is a sinner not because he was drunk but because he saved those on board. It's a clever dissection of religious moral logic. <br/><br/>Washington captures his character exquisitely, paradoxically by not appearing drunk. This is not the acting-out alcoholism of When a Man Loves a Woman, but the type more likely to exist in the real world, of inward-facing lies and outward-facing confidence. There's a telling scene, about two hours in, when Whip makes a booze-fuelled visit to his estranged family. They call him a failure. Dramatically expelled from the house, he finds himself face-to-face with reporters on the doorstep. They call him a hero.<br/><br/>For me, the main problem with the film is the distracting sub-plot involving a heroin addict, Nicole (Kelly Reilly). She's something of a cipher, seemingly serving to symbolise the universality of addiction – a laudable idea, but one that also serves to swell the running time. The relationship between Whip and Nicole never fully convinces.<br/><br/>Also, the soundtrack is agonisingly literal. The film opens with Barenaked Ladies' ""Alcohol"". We get ""Under the Bridge"" by the Chilli Peppers. We get two versions of ""Feelin' Alright"". I mean, you could sketch the narrative just by reading the soundtrack listing. <br/><br/>In the end the film slithers into sentimental mulch, as if to compensate for the genuine edginess of some of the earlier scenes (usually involving John Goodman's amusingly amoral Harling Mays). But this final drop-off shouldn't detract too much from what came before: skilfully played, technically outstanding, and morally ambiguous."
"jdneukom","5","0","1","10 February 2013"," ""Flight"" Soars for 30 min; Denzel Gets High and Becomes John Q. Addict for the Remainder
","As far as the 7.4 rating, I think that's fair though a bit inflated.<br/><br/>While the script did attempt to explore some details about Whip's character, other than his addiction, that attempt wasn't very effective. This attempt can be summed up in Whip and Nicole's chat where they say stuff like ""so what about your dad?"" --of course after having already bonded over a cig in the hospital (believable if you smoke/know how smokers bond) and likely made the beast with 2 backs. The problem is, while their initial ""getting-to-know-you"" is OK, their relationship devolves into a lame second-date feel to it. And then suddenly the heroin addict is going to AA meetings (with no real motivation for attaining sobriety) while Denzel becomes a bad influence on her. It doesn't really deepen Whip's character either since all we really learn of him is from a random home video of him as a kid and the fact that he is estranged from his ex and son. But, there really isn't much depth to his personality or to his struggle with addiction at all.<br/><br/>In fact, the movie kind of glorifies addiction. Sure, Whip's estranged from his family ostensibly because he's a drunk, but he never really seems to miss his ex-wife or son, save for one scene where he randomly drops in so we can have a near ""I learned it by watching YOU dad!"" scene from those old anti-drug commercials. Yes, Whip FREQUENTLY drinks and drives his whip around (while never seeming out of control of his vehicle--plane included), and enjoys snorting coke with a hippie/stoner John Goodman, which is sure to make kids just say no. Have a raging hangover? No problem, just do a few lines of coke and go for the ""banana boat."" In fact, at one point, Denzel was chugging what looked like a GALLON of vodka while driving, and showing no ill effects at all...MAJOR suspension of disbelief required. And yeah, not necessary, since we already get the fact he could be an effective pilot while stoned. The drug culture in this movie is a bit gratuitous.<br/><br/>While the lack of character depth and the unbelievably portrayed drug culture (heroin addict spontaneously going cold turkey, minimal impairment from consuming HUGE quantities of alcohol) certainly detracts from this movie, the film was actually not terrible.<br/><br/>In fact, my solution to what would've made this adequate movie really good is as follows:<br/><br/>1. Cut out the ~5 min nude scene from the beginning entirely. Only a convoluted explanation could tie that into the ending, when Whip all-of-a-sudden owns up.<br/><br/>2. Keep the initial plane crash scene similar, but instead of loosely basing it on a real crash (but with an unbelievable outcome), it would have been good to make the predicament and solution more physically possible. For example, I've seen pilots mention that this plane ""elevator"" stuck in this fashion wouldn't have allowed the plane to glide at the end--it would've been a nose dive.<br/><br/>3. Instead of introducing Nicole for really no purpose, maybe some more emotional depth could've been created around Whip's ex-wife and him ala Dennis Haysbert's character in the movie HEAT. Perhaps, the ex-wife could've still been in love with him, but wouldn't be with him without his sobriety. So, maybe a motivation for Denzel's character to get sober would actually be to get his family back.<br/><br/>4. Perhaps there could've been a plot device such as a flashback or two to show why/how Whip wanted to become a pilot and/or how he got so good at it. I feel we were just supposed to accept his piloting deftness and his co-pilot's whining for no reason.<br/><br/>5. A trial/hearing portion of the movie could have dealt with perhaps a villain, as there really wasn't someone against Denzel's character, save for himself, which is true of all addicts, but still...an external villain is often more compelling. Maybe the co-pilot is out to get him because his legs are crushed? Maybe he has a scorned former lover come forward and rat him out? Some character we can rally against, so Whip could've been more of a hero than an anti-hero. I mean, just because he was drunk flying the plane doesn't make him bad morally. It makes him an addict and breaking the law. But saving all those people, and defeating his addiction could've granted him hero status in this film had there been a villain to overcome. As it was, Whip leaves the audience with no really strong feelings for/against him.<br/><br/>6. While addiction is necessary to tell this story, something more streamlined like in RAY, such as checking into a clinic, and overcoming the addiction in 15 minutes (on screen) would have left more time to flesh out characters and plot details. Heck, he could've fallen off the wagon and gone back to rehab, and it would STILL be less than half the screen time FLIGHT spent on the alcoholism thing.<br/><br/>7. Get rid of the whole SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION feel at the end. Whip flying off to Jamaica after having reconciled with his ex-wife or becoming a big-time aviation trainer would've been more effective than the whole, though-I'm-in-jail-now-I've-never-been-so-free line. Andy Dufresne's character from SHAWSHANK kinda owns prison paradox humor when he said it took going to prison to make him into a crook. While it works great in SHAWSHANK, that movie has rendered such prison humor/paradoxes to be trite.<br/><br/>TL;DR: Had they developed Whip's character more, maybe Denzel would've had an answer when his estranged son asked him ""who are you?"" at the end. That was for the plot to answer, though it failed to do so in a satisfying fashion. Unless there will be a FLIGHT 2? Can't be, right?"
"brendan-268","7","0","1","10 February 2013"," A great film with only one or two flaws
","I wanted to give this film a ten, but unfortunately I think there were a couple of things that weren't done right, and which were important enough to have a bearing on the final ranking.<br/><br/>Before I get to those things though, let me start by saying that I think this is a brilliantly acted film that challenges the audience in some important ways.<br/><br/>I think that the casting of Denzel Washington was probably one of the best decisions that could have been made for this role - the fact that Denzel is one of those rare widely beloved actors means that it was easy for the audience to fall for his character without a lot of character development needed. I think that most other actors in that role would have alienated the audience, not because of their performance, but purely because of who they weren't - a popular celebrity.<br/><br/>By using Denzel the audience is quickly forced into the same internal conflict that people would experience in real life were the events in this film to unfold as portrayed - initially we would love the captain and consider him a hero, but then doubt would set in as the story began to unfold, and finally there would be the question of what to actually think about this man and his character in light of ALL his actions.<br/><br/>The audience is quickly pulled into this same journey, with little in the way of back-story required to endear Denzel's character to us, purely because we all know and love Denzel as an actor. Very clever casting.<br/><br/>I also like the story concept for this film - a plane crash that quickly turns into a character study of alcoholism and ethics, and the way in which it challenges the audience to actually consider the question: 'does the end justify the means?' I'm sure many an audience member was tempted, like I was at different points in the movie, to try and rationalize away the captain's unethical behavior purely because we could see a good outcome in doing so. Ironically, this sort of rationalizing is precisely the type of thing that addicts do when they don't want to confront the truth that they are addicted.<br/><br/>Here's what I think they got wrong though...<br/><br/>1. The final moments of the scene with the co-pilot and his wife in the hospital came across as being completely contrived - especially the weird 'praise Jesus' affirmations that his wife kept calling out. I'm really not sure who wrote that scene, but it doesn't truly reflect the mannerisms and speech of any Christian person I've ever met. I see what they were trying to do, but I think that the dialog was sloppy, and contrived and completely out of character with the rest of the acting in this scene, not to mention the rest of the film. Basically it pulls you right out of the movie for those couple of moments - there were far better ways those final few minutes could have been written to achieve what they wanted it to. In fact, I suspect that even the actors didn't get what was going on because suddenly the co-pilot and his wife slip into a mode of simply repeating dialog rather than actually emotionally investing themselves into what they are saying (just think about the difference in that co-pilot character at the start of the film, in the cockpit, and then again at the start of the hospital room scene, to what transpires in the last minute or so when they start talking about religion.)<br/><br/>2. John Goodman's character was wrong for this film.<br/><br/>Most of his scenes completely change, and are at total odds with the tone of the rest of the film. It literally goes from being a serious drama about an alcoholic to a Coen Brothers style black comedy whenever John Goodman's character makes an appearance.<br/><br/>3. The scene in the hotel with John Goodman and the cocaine rescue was completely wrong for this film.<br/><br/>We literally go from a serious scene exploring the temptations of addiction and the serious ramifications of giving in to that addiction, to a scene where a character right out of the Big Lebowski wanders in (catchphrase and all - ""I'm on the list""), and then three guys proceed to play out a scene with a comedic tone. The only thing that could have made that scene worse was if they had included canned laughter when the union rep and the lawyer are quibbling over who was going to pay the drug dealer's bill.<br/><br/>And then within minutes of this comedic interchange we are literally into the serious dramatic crescendo of the film - the aviation investigation hearing.<br/><br/>I guess they were trying to portray the irresponsible and enabling nature of certain people that addicts surround themselves with (i.e. their dealers), however this didn't really get conveyed at all in the film - i.e. there was no moment of epiphany where Denzel's character suddenly realizes that this lovable drug dealer is actually a loser who is actively destroying and dragging his life down the toilet, and then confronts Goodman's character. No, instead we have a drug dealer who has his own theme song and catchphrase, and whose vile behavior is turned into schtick comedy scenes.<br/><br/>Ironically these scenes almost completely undo the film by trivializing drug use, drug dealing and substance addiction.<br/><br/>So, all in all, a great film with one or two flaws that were bad enough to cost it a ten."

","Finally, Robert Zemeckis has returned, after twelve years, to directing real people (at least he didn't generally disappear from the directing game like James Cameron did for twelve freaking years). Zemeckis' last live-action film was 2000′s Cast Away, and since 2004, he has been experimenting with his unique knack of animated features. In 2004, he brought us the decent enough The Polar Express; in 2007, he brought us the Action/Animation feature Beowulf; and in 2009, he brought us the pretty over-the-top-and-not-in-a-good-way, Disney's A Christmas Carol. Now, he's back with a big old ka-boom to direct this beauty.<br/><br/>Whip Whitaker is ready to fly a plane after a night of partying. Once he takes that puppy in the air, it soon gets attacked by turbulence, and soon enough, the hydraulics take a turn for the worse. He lands it safely on the ground, and saves a lot of lives because of this. For a short time, he is seen as an unarguable hero, but once an investigation gets put in order, it reveals that Whitaker is a struggling alcoholic. Whitaker makes friendships along the way, and must simultaneously face both ridicule, and must fight off his inner demon of alcoholism and come to terms with the beast that lives inside of him.<br/><br/>Flight doesn't feel as long as it actually is. By the time the film is over, you may not have any idea that two hours and twenty minutes have gone by. And when you do realize it, you won't mind. Flight is totally compelling and often gripping. There is not one bad scene in this feature. The world of addiction is well and profoundly investigated with Whitaker, especially because he cannot admit to himself, or others, that he has a pretty serious problem. He also feels that if he wasn't drunk during the time of flying, everyone on the plane may have survived. That opening 20-minute sequence of the plane rushing through a sea of turbulence, and flying upside down, is both exciting and just a wicked does of an adrenaline rush. Imagine any other plane crash sequence in other films, and imagine it hyped up on cocaine and codeine (but without overdosing). Do you have that picture in your head? Yeah, it's pretty crazy, exciting and tense all at the same time. Even after seeing it a second time, you'll still feel as tense as you did the first time around. The suspense for that scene is beautifully created, and you can just feel it on each character's faces.<br/><br/>Flight sometimes can feel like an AA meeting, but only in a few scenes, especially when they are at an AA meeting of sorts. Though, those scenes aren't even bad. The fact that Whitaker wants to push everyone away who just wants to help him, can get a little frustrating for the viewer. Still, we all can feel the turmoil that Whitaker is facing in this state in his life, and over a vast majority of his life. Denzel Washington yet again brings a great character to life with ease, and portrays him beautifully, and makes us want to root for him wholeheartedly.<br/><br/>There is a sort of dramatic, emotional, darkly hilarious at times, and philosophical blended atmosphere that one can really get absorbed in. We, the viewers, may not know the true hardships of addiction and may not understand Whitaker's drinking, but we must comprehend that it seems like a very difficult disease to defeat. One person who tries to help Whitaker overcome his addiction is Nicole, a heroin addict who is trying to get sober. The relationship between the two grows is nice but can get a little strained because they both are addicts, but she has come to terms with her addiction and wants to overcome it, while Whitaker is having a tougher time. Some other relationships formed in the film are nice too, but almost all don't feel great (like with his union rep, Charlie Anderson or his lawyer, Hugh Lang) because Whitaker really feels like a person who doesn't play well with others, even though he's a very sympathetic man. One person he does play well with is Harling Mays (John Goodman), his cousin and sometimes drug dealer. Harling is not present in the film for an extremely long time, but when he is, he really steals the show with his comic relief, and no one else could play this role as well as John Goodman accomplishes. He is just the best, and only, man for the job.<br/><br/>The sound is great and the performances are great. Everything about this drama is just solid, because it is so profound and is very enjoyable. There is a load of emotional content here, and one heck of a suspenseful scene at the beginning of the feature. For those who find the concept of addiction fascinating, will enjoy this even more. Everyone does a superb job on this project, and if Denzel Washington doesn't get nominated for the Oscar for Best Leading Actor, I'll get drunk, fly a plane, and crash it."

","From the trailer, you might think this is a special-effects laden blockbuster with a bit of court intrigue and a heroic outcome. Which is great because the masses need fooling into watching what is, in actual fact, an intense and ultimately beautiful portrayal of one man's addiction his journey to a conclusion. Washington truly does give the performance of his life. Washed-up, slightly tubby, convinced of his own lies and self-centred, his character is a hero and arch villain in one. Zemeckis has directed some of the biggest movies of the past 30 years and yet this film is most closely related to one of his least commercially successful - Contact - in that it takes a huge, spectacular theme and surrounds it with carefully crafted stories of personal failure and spiritual success. Beautiful, moving and really really unexpected."

","After dabbling in the world of creepy pseudo-realistic motion capture with Beowulf, The Polar Express and A Christmas Carol, Robert Zemeckis returns to the land of the living with the tonally muddled, Oscar-ripe drab-drama Flight.<br/><br/>Academy Award winner Denzel Washington stars as Whip Whitman. After a night of debauchery, he wakes up in his birthday suit, swigs on leftover beer, tokes a joint, does a line of coke, and fools around with the brazenly naked lady at his bedside. All that before breakfast, he heads out to work, donning aviator's uniform and a beaming smile. ""This guy's a pilot? For whom? Ryanair, surely?"" We should be appalled by his unethical and offensively illegal behaviour but, hey, it's Denzel. Who can argue with that lovable rogue?<br/><br/>This is ostensibly Flight's irrevocable issue. Playing a neglectful father, a repressed manic depressive and an irresponsible substance abuser, this may be his most psychologically enriched character since his eponymous turn in Spike Lee's Malcolm X , but Denzel is just too darn charming for the drama to resonating or have the impact it is so desperately hunting for. It's a good performance, but one stifled by Zemeckis' lack of ballsy direction.<br/><br/>This isn't for lack of trying, however. In what must be the most extraordinary, and vicariously terrifying flight scene in cinema history, Zemeckis hangs the narrative on one paradoxical dilemma: is Whip the one-in-a-million hero who defied logic and saved 96 passengers in an emergency landing; or is he the inebriated killer of the unfortunate six who failed to escape the crash? It's a burden that the audience struggles with, whilst the character on screen continues with his alcoholism and emotional inertia.<br/><br/>Placing the monumental action set piece in the first quarter of the film was always going to be a brave narrative ploy, but in effect it's an unsatisfactory one, as the rest of Flight wallows in psychological, even biblical turmoil. During a cheeky hospital stairwell fag break, Whip meets recovering heroin addict Nicole (played by fiery English actress Kelly Reilly). In no time at all, they are romantically linked, both out of sexual attraction and mutual desperation as sparring buddies to help kick their addictions. All the while, pilot union official Charlie (Bruce Greenwood) and acerbically tongued attorney Hugh Lang (Don Cheadle) try to convince airplane manufacturing officials of Whip's honour and innocence. It's a court battle that will be easily won, but one that Whip can win only if he stays sober.<br/><br/>Written by Real Steel's John Gatins, the Oscar nominated original screenplay is riddled with redemption story clichés and pious undertones. There's also an odd mix of tone, shifting between the melancholic (an emotionally draining father and son confrontation), to the downright frivolous, (with John Goodman stepping in, in true Argo fashion as Whip's wise cracking coke dealer). Such ping-ponging leaves you confused in the middle. It's as if Zemeckis wants to tell daring adult stories through feeble sentimentality, a la Forrest Gump.<br/><br/>A dogged fan of 2000′s Cast Away, I was thrilled to see Zemeckis' return to live action filmmaking. Thirteen years later, with three disappointing motion-capture animations in the can, it's as if Zemeckis has forgotten how to engage with real human emotion altogether. A fantastic opening thirty minutes, but the less aggrandised, more cerebral moments that follow fail to strike a chord.<br/><br/>Give this project to Darren Aronofsky or Sam Mendes and you could have had a mini masterpiece. With Zemeckis, it's as insipid and synthetic as an in-flight dinner.<br/><br/>Reviews, short stories, and more at www.theframeloop.com"

","Sure, pilots have big egos - and when it comes to portraying a bad-boy with over-blown self confidence, Denzel Washington always seems to fit the bill. The drawback is, that when it comes to realism this film can't hold a candle to Lost Weekend - a very believable tale of an alcoholic who decides to turn over a new leaf when he meets a woman worth quitting for, only to prove to himself a hopelessly addicted alcoholic who CAN'T quit. ""Flight"" shows the can't-quit stuggle, but never shows an ounce of the self-loathing that alcoholics feel when they fail at serious areas of performance. The ending is a farce and totally unconvincing, although it's dramatic. I would have preferred Chris Cooper or Ed Harris in this leading role and made the character FAR more emotionally unstable in order to make the ""redemptive"" ending work. I did not find the ending believable in any way. So. GOOD movie? Yes... brilliant or classic? Not so much."

","Robert Zemeckis has made us wait long for his first live action feature film since Cast Away (2000) and this wait has well been worth it. <br/><br/>Captain William ""Whip"" Whitaker (Denzel Washington) awakens in an Orlando hotel room after a booze & sex filled night with very little sleep with flight attendant Katerina Marquez (Nadine Velasquez), arguing on the phone to his now divorced wife who is demanding more maintenance for his estranged son's higher education. He uses cocaine to be jolted awake, as he is due to fly SouthJet Flight 227 to Atalanta. The weather is overcast but Whip, being a skilled pilot takes off the plane through turbulence and then turns it over to his co pilot Ken Evans (Brian Geraghty). He then discreetly drinks vodka mixed with orange juice and falls asleep. He is awakened by Evans just before the flight's descent and as he takes the controls, the plane goes into a steep dive due to a malfunction, rapidly falling apart piece by piece. With no other choice, he flips the plane upside down to stop the dive, maneuvers the plane right side up, and then glides it away far from residential areas, crashlanding it in a field.<br/><br/>Whip awakes in an Atalanta hospital with minor injuries, to be greeted by his old friend from the Air Force Charlie Anderson (Bruce Greenwood), now representing the airline's pilot union. He tells Whip that his heroic skill saved 96 out of the 102 lives on board. An NTSB (National Transportation Safety Board) official then briefs him that Katerina was among the ones killed and that Evans is severely injured and put in a coma. Whip meets Nicole (Kelly Reilly), a recovering drug addict in the hospital and promises to visit her when he is discharged. He is sneaked out of the hospital ward the following morning by his drug dealer friend Harling Mays (John Goodman), who tells him that he has become a media celebrity. Whip drives away to his late father's farm to avoid the media, decides to quit drinking, destroying his stash of alcohol. Unfortunately, he relapses soon. He is called by Charlie and Attorney Hugh Lang (Don Cheadle), the latter informing him that his blood test was performed while he was unconscious revealing a high alcohol content, which could get him a life in prison for both drug and manslaughter.He storms off angily and visits Nicole, finding her getting evicted and asks her to move in with him, beginning a relationship with her. His alcoholism gets worse while Nicole on the other hand is getting rehabilitated. She leaves him seeing no improvement in him. Whip also visits Evans, finding that he has a very little chance of walking again ,who chides him for being drunk that day but accepting that the plane was at fault.Whip is soon discovered by the media in his farmhouse making him flee from there in an intoxicated state to his estranged family, from where he is evicted as well. Hugh informs Whip that he has trashed his toxicology report proving the incompetence of the testing equipment, and now he just has to stay sober till the hearing, led by NTSB investigator Ellen Block (Melissa Leo), which if all goes well will allow Whip to walk away a hero.<br/><br/>Whip is put in a guarded hotel room with no access to alcohol a day before the hearing, but he somehow finds a way to the adjoining room, discovering alcohol in its refrigerator. Hugh and Charlie find Whip passed out the following morning, barely an hour before the hearing is to begin. Harling is called to revive him and he uses cocaine to revive him. A rejuvenated Whip goes for facing the hearing which is to decide his fate.<br/><br/>Will he lie in his usual manner to walk away free to continue his decadent ways or will his conscience finally make him choose the painful but right path? These answers will be best found on screen.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington is one of the best actors to grace the screen and can emote more in one glance than the likes of Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt can with pages of dialogues. His portrayal of a successful person who is suicidally and stupidly dissolving his career, life and happiness in alcohol and drugs is painfully realistic. As a person who shamelessly lies, runs from the truth to the one who finally realizes that he has been going wrong since a long time or as a pilot who remains calm even in the face of an impending deadly crash, his performance is a class act. This is certainly his best role in a decade since Training Day and certainly marks his comeback after a string of forgettable films.<br/><br/>John Goodman gives the best cameo that you can remember and totally steals the show for the hardly ten minutes that he is on screen. Don Cheadle and Bruce Greenwood are left to play second fiddle to Denzel Washington, but they are nevertheless very effective in the thankless roles the script has for them. Kelly Reilly is effective in her supporting part as well.<br/><br/>Robert Zemeckis does a brilliant job here, and this film is no less than his earlier classics like Forrest Gump and Cast Away. He keeps the story line taut and pacy, avoiding being preachy about drug or alcohol abuse or portraying the protagonist Whip Whitaker in any sympathetic light. The dialogues are crisp and so is the storyline. The technical aspects are well researched and nothing is overdone. The most important question asked by the film is whether a ""hero"" is pardonable for his other bad deeds ? Should he be allowed to get away for an act of his which would have also endangered the lives of the very people he saved in the first place, just because all ended well? Come aboard ,folks. This one is a memorable ride."
"aequus314","9","0","2","18 January 2013"," Stylish film that pulsates with visual and postmodern wit.
","One of the pleasures of Robert Zemeckis's latest film is the way he introduces Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington), a suave airline pilot who shuffles domestic flights for a living. When Whip isn't jet setting around America in a JR-88; he is crack sniffing, hard drinking, and getting busy with beautiful flight attendants. In theory, he is the archetypal macho high flyer, a smooth operator with wind beneath his wings (I apologize for dramatizing... can't bring myself to pass up on corny metaphors.) But in reality; Whip is a product of vice addiction, in denial of his weaknesses, an antihero with a broken spirit.<br/><br/>****************************<br/><br/>Note: Possible spoilers for the first act of this film ahead. <br/><br/>The first action occurs during a brief flight bound for Atlanta. Safety is compromised by gathering storm and strong draft; resulting in violent turbulence, which Whip successfully negotiates with his repertoire of strategic moves. But the close call forewarns an even bigger crisis in minutes to come. At this point, I am tempted to rave in detail about the nerve-wracking sequence preceding Flight's second mishap. Zemecki lives up to his name as Hollywood's poster boy for visual effects (The Polar Express, Beowulf, Forrest Gump)--but I'd rather not. Because the next sequence is even more spectacular.<br/><br/>Flight 227 eventually succumbs to technical malfunction, enters a steep dive plunging all the way down for motherearth when Whip is forced to perform one of the riskiest tour de stunt (sic) known in aviation and Hollywood physics--rolling the airplane.<br/><br/>Bottom line is; they will inevitably crash. But not before Whip mitigates foreseeable damage by stressing the jet into inverted position midair. And the elegant touch is this: it is logical insofar as preventing uncontrolled descent is concerned--when the airplane flips, it regains balance and altitude. <br/><br/>Of course, the speed and precision in timing required of this maneuver is easier said than done. Which is why Whip emerges from the harrowing escape a public hero; whose talent as a pilot reduced impact upon crashing, thereby saving many lives on board. Yet things get complicated because this film is more than mind blowing action; this unique aspect justifies Denzel Washington's Best Actor, and John Gatin's Best Original Screenplay nominations in this year's academy awards.<br/><br/>An investigative agency responsible for assigning accountability launches inquiry into parties involved: the airline, aircraft manufacturers, crew members. With commercial and financial interests vested in their verdict, all the hero worship is not enough to pardon Whip's liability as sole authority in the cockpit. And to further implicate him; toxicology screens taken while he was unconscious reveal damning proof of alcohol and cocaine. From the angle of negligence, being incarcerated for manslaughter is a concrete possibility.<br/><br/>Herein lies the thick of Flight--under that veneer of cool amidst the chaos hides a tired, passive aggressive man. He sabotages legal aid granted by the pilot union; sinks low into the deep end of shame and self-destruction. As the plot gradually unfolds in the second act of this riveting film, the observer (audience) is being persuaded into private dimensions--there are moral impasses that underpin Whip's rational imperative.<br/><br/>Many stories have explored virtue and redemption with utilitarian narratives, but few managed to do so without being cliché. Flight stands out with sleek cinematic language in an authentic way. The result is a stylish synthesis of figurative dilemmas, pulsating with visual and postmodern wit.<br/><br/>cinemainterruptus.wordpress.com"

","Lots of spoilers - do not read if you have not seen the movie.<br/><br/>Of course, who does not love Denzel??? If you don't love him you should be banned from viewing anything on IMDb! He gives his usual stirring performance - this time as a addict (alcohol & drugs). I thought that this would be one of those ""the man rips off the little guy"" types of stories that are so popular - can you say Occupy Hollywood?<br/><br/>Surprisingly, they portrayed this alcoholic for what he was - even though extremely skilled at his craft - and saving many people - he was a risk and an out of control person who was betraying the public's trust.<br/><br/>The saving grace for the movie was when he makes the conscious decision to turn things around at the end. I am involved in a Bible study on temptation - and we discussed how sinners (& that includes all of us) have many opportunities to flee from temptation & sin & how, in most cases, we make the conscious decision to keep sinning. At the very end of the movie Denzel makes a fateful decision - and enables us to leave on a hopeful note. Who knows? maybe we can turn it around also.<br/><br/>Not many of Hollywood's ""finest"" would have taken a role where his character is so totally despicable, but Denzel is unafraid (did you see Training Day?)

","Outstanding, A must see. Being a pilot myself I'm a little bias, but the movie rocks da house!!! The flying scenes are some of the best I've ever seen and the story is based on truth. The special effects are the best I've seen since the airplane crash in Castaway. Denzel Washington does an outstanding job playing a maverick type airline captain and John Goodman delivers an hysterical performance as well. The subject matter addresses a number of pilot issues and safety issues which need to be brought out in the open. Hopefully this movie will make government agencies push for stricter guidelines. The crash cause is based on reality from a crash off the California coast near Point Mugu."
"pc95","6","0","2","15 December 2012"," A Bit Disappointing/ Mixed
","I had seen the trailer for ""Flight"", directed by Robert Zemeckis, once and saw a good average review, and the movie featured Denzel Washington, so figured it looked like at least a satisfactory time to be had. (major spoiler) And for me the movie is exciting especially for it's first 45 min or so thanks in no small part to amazing flying and crashing sequences. Technically this was the best I've ever seen in a movie, at least a full factor better than the next best plane crash sequence I can remember in ""Fearless"". However, the movie is not really about the Flight, but rather about the main character Whip Whitaker( Denzel Washington) and his simple but continual alcohol and drug dependence. By the end of the movie I felt like I'd been watching an AA collaboration hijack an earlier great movie I was watching. Substance abuse and it's melodrama is not really what I enjoy watching in movies, especially as the focal theme. So I Felt disappointed, misled, and tired of that continual theme almost non-stop for last 90 min of the movie. I didn't want to watch ""Clean and Sober"" with a plane crash thrown in. Will give it 6/10 for it's fist 45 min though."

","Who is Captain Whip? Why do we care? Who was grandpa with the flying machine? He seemed interesting. How did he become a drunk? If they had included more drug snorting scenes it could have been worse. Or they could have had more completely absurd acrobatics by airliners (aerodynamically impossible). By the way, penetrating turbulent air too fast in any type of plane is a recipe for structural failure. So, movie NTSB failed to site that from flight data and radio transmission. So, firewalling the jet in ""severe"" turbulence by the drunk/high hero pilot is the probable cause. Also the portrayal of the first officer as some sort of whiny gutless Christian is silly and culminates into that novice home movie like scene in his hospital room. Really?! <br/><br/>The cancer patient in the stairwell of the hospital is the best thing in the movie. It was as if it was copy/pasted from another movie. Too bad we weren't watching that movie. <br/><br/>As for this ill attempt at moral juxtaposition, wow. ""Alcoholic pilot does heroic act"". Even a blind squirrel finds a nut. That doesn't mean he gets elected to head the nut finding committee. It damn sure doesn't mean that he gets responsibility for hundreds of people's lives. Truth isn't relative, sorry. It isn't convenient either. <br/><br/>The end was also kind of copy/pasted from some other movie. It would have been touching. Hell, maybe it was but by that point I just couldn't wait for the thing to end. Yes we understand that being an addict can destroy your life. Can we have some substance please? Also maybe a consultant to help with the flying stuff. This ain't Roger Rabbitt and this wasn't written for 13 year old boys. (except for the opening scene). <br/><br/>Just to be clear, I am in no way taking away from the undaunted hell that alcoholism is. I am taking away any confusion that might lead someone to believe that they are going to see a compelling story of heroism and redemption or beating the odds. (as is indicated by the real Robert Piche' event -sighted on this page)<br/><br/>Airline public relations fun: <br/><br/>The airlines have an unmatched safety record and despite some petty security hassle and the fact that the weather might cause occasional delay (how dare the weather) it's a pretty effective way to get around. (It's safer than getting in your car). I think this movie does them a disservice.<br/><br/>Sorry I wasted my time on this movie. Im sorry that i suggested to my wife that we should see it. The info above states that it is closely based on the Transant flight 336 from 2001. Uh, really?! I am a pilot. The Transant flight is a compelling story. This movie on the other hand is insulting to our intelligence. Below is a link to a documentary about the real event of the Transant flight 336:<br/><br/>http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WA4ZFRcU88Q<br/><br/>Those responsible for the creation of this movie should take a look in the responsibility mirror before pulling the trigger on some flung together shots that should still be on the editing floor. Even a blind squirrel finds a nut occasionally. On this occasion it's certainly nosing around under the wrong tree."
"Turfseer","5","0","3","25 November 2012"," Tale of a Captain Sully with a drinking problem nosedives after sensational crash scene opening
","'Flight', Robert Zemeckis' first live-action film in twelve years, starts off with one of the most spine-tingling, harrowing plane crash disaster scenes in cinematic history. Denzel Washington as the plane's alcoholic pilot, Captain William ""Whip"" Whittaker, crash lands his jet into a field after a broken jack screw causes a catastrophic loss of control. Loosely based on a fatal Air Alaska crash in 2000, Whip successfully saves 96 out of 102 lives, by inverting the aircraft, right before it goes down.<br/><br/>Whip winds up in the hospital and soon recovers from minor injuries. Despite being hailed as a hero (a la the real-life Captain ""Sully"" Sullenberger), Whip was drunk during the flight and the National Transportation Safety Board now has a toxicology test taken when he first arrives at the hospital, that proves it. Fortunately for him, his tough as nails attorney, Hugh Lang (played by Don Cheadle), is able to quash the report due to irregularities in the blood test.<br/><br/>While the aforementioned plane crash is riveting, the bulk of 'Flight' is unfortunately just another tale of a sad sack alcoholic wrestling with his demons. Some may be impressed by the ambiguity of a man who can be both a hero and an angry, aggressive, self-destructive alcoholic at the same time--but most of 'Flight' is a story we've seen before.<br/><br/>While in the hospital, Whip meets Nicole who is recovering from a heroin overdose. Earlier, we see Nicole before she meets Whip and it's quite clear that her addiction is extensive. It seems rather odd that Whip would take Nicole under his wings at this juncture especially with the possibility of extensive media scrutiny, but he decides anyway to bring her back to his (now) deceased father's farm (why it takes the media a few days before they actually go out and confront Whip at the farm, doesn't ring true at all).<br/><br/>Nicole is there to contrast her quick transcendence over her addiction as opposed to Whip's continuing denial (it seems awfully convenient that such a severe addict as Nicole, is able to see the light, so quickly!). Still, Denzel Washington does a fine job in conveying just how hard it is to deal with someone who is an alcoholic (some of the best later scenes are Whip's confrontations with Nicole).<br/><br/>The rest of 'Flight' chronicles Whips' continuing downward spiral. There is Whip's visit to his ex-wife and son which ends quite badly and Charlie Anderson (the union rep) along with his attorney's attempt to sober him up before the big NTSB hearing. That whole scene is perhaps the least convincing in the film. You'll recall that Whip is placed in a hotel room where he has no access to alcohol. Even though they hire a bodyguard to watch the room, they don't bother to check to see if the adjoining room is stocked with alcohol. Furthermore, why would the door to the adjoining room be unlocked?--unless you've paid for the other room, a hotel would not leave such a door open.<br/><br/>In the end, Zemeckis must opt for the 'Hollywood' ending. At the crucial moment, Whip suddenly has a change of heart, and admits 'everything' at the NTSB hearing. In this case, he won't let the flight attendant he was sleeping with before the ill-fated flight, be blamed for 'drinking while on duty' (Whip won't impugn her reputation since she was responsible for saving a child during the crash). Is this enough for a man so in denial as Whip is, to suddenly 'come clean'? Unlikely. It would have been a lot more troubling if Zemeckis showed Whip staying in denial and is cleared at the hearing--but Zemeckis needs a feel good ending. Whip does go to prison afterward but is on his way to reconciliation with his son (who visits him in prison) and presumably with the ex-wife. There's also a rather obvious moral tale here--Whip articulates it when he states at the film's conclusion that he finally feels 'free' in prison, as he is no longer hitting the bottle.<br/><br/>Despite a pretty positive critical reception, there were a number of critics who refused to jump on the bandwagon--recognizing that the story surrounding Denzel's performance, in the words of LA Times critic Kenneth Turan, ""is not as subtle or involving as his performance."" Turan feels that 'Flight"" ""plays at times like a feature-length infomercial for the powers of AA."" David Fear agrees: ""Take out the opening jaw-dropper, and you've essentially got The Lost Weekend Redux. Despite Washington going the full nine yards ugly-drunk-wise, there's little to distinguish this from every other entry in the cinema du addiction genre: You'll get the requisite denial, hitting rock bottom and then rockier bottom, relapse and, finally, a moment of clarity.""<br/><br/>Stan Hall in the Portland Oregonian feels that Zemeckis' ""best-known work has a tendency to go for grand gestures, old-fashioned moralizing and outcomes that can often be spotted from miles away."" And he finds that, ""there's not much real value to this oddly slick stab at popcorn entertainment about a person's debilitating alcoholism."" Andrew O'Hehir in Salon concurs that Zemeckis is a ""technical wizard"" but ""drama just isn't his instrument"": ""Slowly but surely, ""Flight"" degenerates from a tale of moral paradox and wounded romance into a mid-1990s after-school special about addiction and recovery. You get the feeling the filmmakers are aiming for a star-driven combo of the Sully saga and ""Crime and Punishment.""<br/><br/>I quote these critics to point out that I'm not the only one who has reservations about this film. I think most of us will agree that the plane crash scene and Denzel's excellent performance are the highlights of the film. I'm not sure how many will agree with me and these other discerning critics, that Flight's narrative is nothing special, with its pedestrian emphasis on one man's quest to purge his alcoholic demons and the obvious exhortation to embrace sobriety."
"Bcud02","7","0","1","24 November 2012"," Flight Lands, but doesn't soar.
","This movie will not win an Oscar. It will be nominated for one, and that will be for Denzel Washington in the best actor category, (he'll lose to Daniel Day Lewis), but not by any fault of his own. It's just Lincoln's year. The most entertaining parts of the movie come in the first twenty minutes, and the last ten. Not to say this movie isn't well made, because it happens to be directed by one of my favorite directors, Robert Zemeckis. Flight is not high on his list of works, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. There are few movies that Zemeckis has helmed that aren't very good.<br/><br/>I mean there aren't many directors that can go from Death Becomes her to Forrest Gump, or from Howard the Duck to anything What I'm saying is that even though Flight is not one of Robert Zemeckis' best movies, it's still probably better than most movies out there. Flight proves two things. One, Denzel Washington is still one of the premiere actors of our time. His skill and delivery alone can carry a movie and that is exactly what happens in Flight. His portrayal of Pilot Whip Whitaker is somewhat of a different role for Washington. For the most part he's known for playing the good guy. The morally upright guy. Often times a cop, once even an angel. Then there are the times when we get to see the flawed characters, such as his Oscar winning turn as Alonzo in Training Day. These are the roles where we as an audience are treated to Denzel Washington's acting chops. That's exactly what we get to see in Flight. Denzel's fall from grace into a dark place of alcohol and substance dependency. His refusal to admit to himself and others that he has a problem, however glaringly obvious it is to all those around him. The second thing that Flight proves is that Robert Zemeckis has mastered the art of shooting a plane crash. The crash in Flight is beautiful. We are there every painstaking second of the crash. We feel the tension and they don't allow you to get away. You are there until that plane hits the ground. Zemeckis is possibly even more impressive in this crash than the also stellar plane crash scene in Castaway. This scene alone makes the movie worth seeing. I had two very big problems with the movie. One, John Goodman. He always delivers in every role and he still did in this movie, however he was horribly underused. His talents should not be wasted on scripts that only require him for one or two scenes. Similar to his two minutes of screen time in Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close. Let the man Act! Did you not see The Big Lebowski? My second problem with Flight was that it became too much of an after school special for me. The predictable problems that come along with drug and alcohol addiction are used in this script to repeatedly beat you over the head. In my opinion, the script could have used more subtle approaches to get the message across, and I was hoping that it did because I feared it was going into a preachy direction. With such a promising and entertaining beginning I really didn't want it to, but it did. That was the difference between having a great movie, and a good movie. This is a good movie.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Denzel is awesome. Flight is worth the price of admission. Zemeckis is still one of my favorite directors. Despite Howard the Duck. . . briancudemo.blogspot.com"
"EUyeshima","6","0","2","23 November 2012"," Washington Soars But This Flight Has More Than One Bumpy Landing
","That Denzel Washington is a movie star of the first rank is proved once again in Robert Zemeckis' 2012 crisis-driven character study, a film that starts out very strong but then turns into something of a morality play about addiction and personal accountability. Despite the slowdown in the narrative momentum, the actor lends a chilling honesty and his considerable charisma to his textured portrayal of Whip Whitaker, an ace commercial pilot for a regional Southern airline whose debilitating alcoholism forces him to live in a world of denial and distrust. He's middle-age, divorced, and estranged from his son, but he can still party hard with a sexy flight attendant and fly a jet airliner the morning after with the help of a line of cocaine. Their 9AM flight to Atlanta faces severe turbulence upon take-off, but it's nothing Whip can't handle with his skillful bravado intact. Having achieved momentary calm, he falls asleep at the controls after downing a couple of airline-size bottles of vodka mixed with orange juice. Suddenly the jet loses its hydraulics and descends uncontrollably with its engines on fire.<br/><br/>To the shock of his by-the-book co-pilot, Whip decides to invert the plane and fly it upside down to achieve some stability in order to maneuver a last-ditch attempt at an emergency landing in an open field populated with a congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses. Miraculously, only six of 102 passengers and crew perish upon impact, and Whip is hailed as a hero much like Sully Sullenberger after he heroically saved a jet on the Hudson River. This exacting sequence is as thrilling as they come in the movies, and Zemeckis (""Cast Away"") brings a propulsive realism to what must have seemed like a fantastical idea in John Gatins' screenplay. What follows this life-changing incident is far less unique as it becomes clear that Whip's blood alcohol count was well over the legal limit during the flight, and the ensuing investigation could easily destroy his career and send him to prison on manslaughter charges. He gets help from former colleague Charlie Anderson, the pilots' union representative for the airline, as well as Hugh Lang, a severely humorless lawyer who is pushing hard to discredit the toxicology reports which prove Whip's unfit condition for flying. The ongoing public pressure of the case sends Whip into isolation at his late father's farm where he begins another downward spiral into alcohol.<br/><br/>He gets involved with recovering heroin addict Nicole whose own story of desperation is juxtaposed with his until they meet at the hospital and enter into a relationship. All this leads to a climactic hearing with the National Transportation Safety Board where his fate will be determined. Washington is on screen for nearly the film's entire 139- minute running time, and his impassioned performance is fiercely without vanity. He is unafraid to show Whip's pathetic denial of accountability and brings a palpable face to his character's substance abuse. The supporting cast is solid with Don Cheadle lending a calm Machiavellian spirit to Lang and Bruce Greenwood a stalwart presence as unconditionally supportive Charlie. British actress Kelly Reilly (""Mrs. Henderson Presents"") sports a convincing Southern accent, but I found her a bit too languid as Nicole. In pure scene-stealing mode, John Goodman plays Whip's unapologetic drug dealer Harling Mays like he was redoing Walter Sobchak in ""The Big Lebowski"". It's a comically anomalous turn but something of a relief especially during the sturm-und-drang of the film's second half. Speaking of which, Zemeckis and Gatins' unsubtle storytelling approach resuscitates all-too-familiar scenes of alcohol abuse that make the story feel more predictable than it had to be as the inevitable events play themselves out. Regardless, Washington makes the film eminently watchable."

","Why, why, why does Hollywood have to paint an alcoholic the same way. Angry, hurtful and out of control. This was an opportunity for a great actor to embrace a real danger in our society, the functioning drunk. Here was a guy who obviously was getting away with it as we learn his coworkers were aware of his problem yet didn't say anything to him or anyone else. This doesn't jive with how Denzil's character was portrayed which was a man totally out of control and not functional. As it turned out, all his coworkers should be fired.<br/><br/>The movie was entertaining and worth seeing. I just would have preferred if Denzil was allowed to play a more shrewd character, better hiding his addiction. It would have been more effective showing the danger of enabling such behavior by ignoring it."

","The plot of the story of this pilot is a good story. However, it was too long. There were several dead spots in the movie. Two and half hours was grueling. The story could have been told in two hours or less. The pilot is an alcoholic and when the crash first happens the character played by Denzel Washington would have been well to not drink anymore as he had initially had intended. But, he was not able to withstand his temptations at anytime during the movie. Stupidity is at every side. This story has rings true with most people who are have real addictions to drugs or alcohol. It is almost too sad because the story is so real. The reunions at the end were nice The movie was extremely believable."
