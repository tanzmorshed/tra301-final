"wilma1913","Null","340","373","27 June 2003"," This film brought back memories.
","We lived through the depression and related to some of the conditions portrayed. We have watched it perhaps a dozen times. Each time we see it we pick up on something we had missed because we were still laughing at, or discussing, an earlier scene or line. The entire film was a collection of photographically great faces. We are still asking ourselves whether the entire cast were professionals or whether some were individuals found on location. The film was rich with subtle tie-ins like the children tied together with twine, as the prisoners were connected by chains. We still think the cow may have been hit unintentionally. Fords of that era had mechanical brakes. The driver of the car may not have been accustomed the longer stopping distances required. The many allusions to Ulysses Odyssey inspired us to do an inter-net search. We found a modern text version and discovered more sly references. We appreciate blue grass and country music as originally American and found it thoroughly enjoyable, along with the authentic ""Go To Sleep Little Baby"" and ""Down from the Mountain."" We were emotionally touched by this film because of our age, and find it totally entertaining every time we view it. We are still amazed that someone not of our generation could have captured the essence of that period of United States history."

","The Coen Brothers have truly outdone themselves in this wonderful saga of three escaped convicts. Though it is based on ""The Odyssey,"" the ancient work of Homer, you do not have to have read ""The Odyssey"" to be able to follow the story. The brothers Coen have woven a tapestry of celluloid and aural delights! The soundtrack is intrinsic to the film, indeed it is as though the soundtrack is the product and the film is wrapping paper. Each character is wonderfully exploited and harkens back to the days of old when films were rich with character actors whose very appearance in the film adds richness, texture and authenticity. George Clooney is magnificent as the grease haired Everett Ulysses McGill, a honest con on the run whose pompous linguistics and vocabulary are comical and endearing. O Brother, Where Art Thou is easily the best Coen film to date as well as Clooney's best effort. Clooney is good enough to warrant a best actor nomination as is Tim Blake Nelson's portrayal of the dimwitted friend Delmar, while the film itself is deserving of a Best film nod."

","Thank goodness for the Coen Brothers. Their success has brought them bigger budgets,but hasn't rid them of their creativity. I had planned on seeing another movie, but it was sold out so I went to this one instead. By the time it began, I had forgotten what movie I was there to see. I was surprised in more ways than one. This movie is hilarious, but they don't make any cheap jokes just to get the laughs. The writing is brilliant, and delivered with great skill by George Clooney (after this, nobody can say he's just a pretty face) and the rest of the cast. It can be appreciated on many levels, whether you remember the Odyssey or not. I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that was this clever. I've seen others I would describe as beautiful, intriguing, funny and charming, all of which also describe ""Oh Brother,"" but this movie reminded me of older seinfeld episodes where all the subplots came together in the end. You can feel that their journey is building up to something, but you can't tell what. And the Coen brothers do not fail us, the end is certainly not disappointing. It's surprising, and ties up all the loose ends neatly, without wearing the story out."
"KarlMaldensNose","10","114","139","9 October 2001"," Pretty darn good
","Having seen most of the Coen Brothers previous films I expected something different and slighty off centre. OBWAT is certainly those things, but it also has a heart as big as..well..as big as Mississippi. It is one of the most plainly enjoyable movies to have come out in recent times, intelligent, well-crafted, clever and superbly acted.<br/><br/>Characters are delivered in their myriad shades by a group of marvellous actors. George Clooney winning me over completely with his Clark Gable-ish looks and character. Having only ever seen him in Three Kings and his Thin Red Line cameo, I am now a fan. More comedy please George.<br/><br/>John Tuturro and Tim Blake Nelson ably assist, especially Nelson. If ever ""The Simpsons"" is made into a movie then he must be a natural to play Cletus the slack-jawed yokel. I don't think there is a performance that falls short of excellent from the entire cast. My special favorite is Stephen Root as the blind Radio Station Man.<br/><br/>Great old-timey music, a jiggy type dance by Clooney that I am trying to learn, and a feel of depression era southern US enhanced by sepia-like photography make this the best movie I've see  so far this century. The only drawback to the film is that it has almost sent me broke buying the soundtrack, the DVD and a DVD player to play it on....it's THAT good!"

","This was the best film I saw in the year 2000. The Cohen brothers have never let me down before, and they certainly didn't this time either.<br/><br/>It's one of those rare movies these days - it's witty, intelligent and vastly entertaining. I left the cinema with a warmth in my heart. Of course, there's lot of Cohen stuff in there - odd characters and peculiar gadgets, well-developed plot and magic camerawork. But no Cohen film is resembling any other Cohen film, if you overlook the general quality of them, of course.<br/><br/>The big surprise for me was that Clooney is so good. But the true master performance in this movie comes from Tim Blake-Nelson. But the rest of the cast is superb too.<br/><br/>A film that is lightweight comedy with a musical touch that evolve it's story round rednecks and old time country music - dripping with wit and intelligence. Thats a very unlikely combination. But it's exactly what this picture is."

","Not being a fan of the Coen Brothers or George Clooney, anyone can see the skepticism I took into the theater. Once again, someone in Hollywood dares to create something different. This time it was those zanie (for a temporary lack of a better word) Coens doing ""their thing"" to one of the great works in literary history. Who would've ever thought Homer had this in mind? I don't know where this film is going to fit in the history books of Hollywood, but it will be in both mine and many others DVD or VHS library. It is one of those films that you can watch over and over. The story is brilliantly written. Clean and entertaining, with a couple of Gumpesque brushes with fame, great performances by Clooney, Turturro, Nelson, and a brief but hilarious Holly Hunter. Being born in Mississippi and raised in other parts of the south, I wish more people would poke a little fun at us like this. They even invoke a soundtrack fitting for the rural south. You are NOT doing anything better this weekend, go see this movie!"
"baumer","10","141","187","25 January 2001"," It will grow on you
","I have walked out of a Coen movie before and not quite known how to feel. The two best examples of that are The Big Lebowski and Fargo. Lebowski was so ridiculously original and so filled with strange humour that I had to like it. On the other hand, there were some unnecessary reveries with flying people and killer bowling balls that just didn't seem to fit the mold of the film. Still, I liked the film and now own a copy of it. Fargo made me howl with hysterics, sometimes I wasn't sure why I was laughing so hard that it made me cry, but nonetheless I was. There were many seemingly strange characters in Fargo, but upon further investigation, they were really just real people talking about real situations. That is why the man with the shovel ( or was it a broom ) was so side-splittingly funny when he was telling the police officer about some funny looking man down at the bar the other night. And that is also why the theater erupted in laughter when he then says that there are some funny looking clouds coming in. (I own a copy of this film too) The Coen's have a way of masking their film and their characters as being somewhat eccentric and perhaps a little off the wall. But if you look closer at some of those same characters that seem zany, you will always find that in some strange way, they all ring true. That is what is quite exceptional about O Brother Where Art Thou? This is a film that is out there. I mean it is not even in the same ballpark as a traditional film. I reviewed the film Shaft this past summer and in it I said that Shaft was an okay film that I have seen a thousand times before. But you can not say that about a Coen Brother's film and you most certainly can not say that about this one.<br/><br/>This film has everything in it from a jail break, crooked southern politicians, muses, references to what I can only assume are historical figures, riverside baptisms, bank robberies, violence towards animals, singing flocks of religious fanatics, KKK, lynch mobs and so on. There are obviously many references to Homer's Odyssey in here as well, but I wouldn't know that because I have never read Homer's Odyssey or even knew one thing about it. Every other newspaper reviewer seems to know all about it and they think that this cynicism and almost spoof-like quality towards it makes the film that much better. Well coming from a guy who doesn't know anything about it, I can tell you that it is still an entertaining film. There were times when again, as is usual for a Coen film, I wasn't sure why I was entertained or laughing, but I was.<br/><br/>This is a road picture where three men travel along the way to find a hidden treasure that Clooney says he has hidden to his two other cell mates. He has to take them along because they were also chained to him when they had their chance to escape.<br/><br/>I like all the principal actors in the film and many of them are Coen cronies. It was nice to see Goodman again. It was nice to see Hunter and especially Turturro who seems to have a place in every Coen film. It's too bad they didn't find a place for Steve Buscemi but that is a different story all together. But back to Clooney. The man just has charisma. He is a one hell of an actor as well and here he is not quite as zany as the others but even he has his own idiosyncrasies. His work here is quite awesome and I really hope this shows that he is capable of playing any range of character.<br/><br/>Now after heaping all this praise on the film, let me just say this as well. I didn't really enjoy the film at first. I found it to be quite tedious and a little boring. There were too many ideas in here and not enough care went into harnessing them for all what they were worth. But then the film began to grow on me. It took a while but it did grow on me. I don't think this is their best film, but it is still a good one and I am giving it a 8.5. But the reason that I do recommend this film is for one reason only.<br/><br/>Every day you can go look into the paper and look at the films that are playing and say to yourself, seen it, seen it, oh, seen it last year, that is the same as this film and that is the same as that film. Most films have been recycled in some form or another. Not the Coen's films. They have not been recycled and if they have I don't know about it. That is reason enough to see something that they put out. Originality counts for a lot in my books. The Coens are original and they are good. And that is not common in todays cinema. Enjoy them while they are allowed to make films. Because you don't get vision like this in many films, so when you do, enjoy it!"

","The Coen Brothers have done it again. Three depression era convicts(George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson)escape a Mississippi chain gang and head off in search of buried treasure that will fund their new lives. Along the way, they sing on the radio and become much sought after stars as well as escapees. Great laughs and a soundtrack that is a lesson/introduction to bluegrass music.<br/><br/>Clooney is outstanding as the fast talking, quick witted Ulysses Everett McGill. Holly Hunter plays his estranged wife. Turturro and Nelson are flawless stumblebums. Also in the cast are John Goodman and Charles Durning.<br/><br/>Dan Tyminksi provides the singing voice for George Clooney on ""I Am A Man of Constant Sorrow"", the Soggy Bottom Boys song that serves as a template for the bluegrass laden soundtrack that also features Alison Krauss, Ralph Stanley, The Whites, John Hartford, The Cox Family and Gillian Welch. Toe tapping, knee slapping fun for the whole family. You'll be surprised with how relaxed and funny this movie is."
"culp@execpc.com","Null","11","12","23 December 2003"," You get it or you don't
","One of the finest pieces of story telling ever to hit celluloid.  The performances are so perfect and dead-on, and the nuances so subtle, that this movie defies description.  It is no wonder that the reviews you read run the gamut from ""piece of junk"", to ""superb"" to just plain confused. This is a must-see movie, and from there you're on your own, you have to decide for yourself.  Note, however, that this film follows its own course -- *loosely* based on Ulysses, and with its own symbolism, characters, and themes.  To spot them all you will need to watch carefully, think constantly, and, in all likelihood, see the film many times more than once. Not to worry, it improves with each viewing."

","I was into the movie right away.  I've seen the other Coen movies, with the exception of Raising Arizona, and I've noticed that each of their movies has a color.  Fargo is gray/white, Lebowski is bright orange, and this movie is a pleasant yellow.<br/><br/>The bright pleasant qualities of this movie start right away.  Soon the look is accompanied by the great, great music.  It's the old folk sound, the kind of music that was written during a time when music was enjoyed as a part of day to day life.  Enjoyed by everyone, chain-gangs, church choirs, and even prison escapees.<br/><br/>Now, about the prison escapees.  I don't know what crime their characters could have possibly committed, as they are a very very friendly group of guys.  Clooney is fantastic, completely nailing his role.<br/><br/>Go see this as soon as possible.  I believe that it can be enjoyed by anyone at some level.  For some reason, the theater I was in was full of old ladies and old men, and they loved it.<br/><br/>You'll love it too, I promise.  I was compelled to get my hands on the soundtrack right away."

"filmfan92","9","5","5","8 April 2007"," ""O Brother"" is righteous
","The Coen Brothers may just be cinema's greatest crackpot auteurs-they deliver sly, ironic stories that generally consist of several weird and wild subplots that all collide in an ending that always leaves a few loose ends for the audience to ponder. Bless them. In the midst of the blockbusters franchises and hipster road movies, seeing a Coen Brothers movie is like inhaling a breath of fresh air. This one is no exception. 'O Brother Where Art Thou' is an adaptation of Homer's sprawling Greek tragedy 'The Odyssey', retold in a new setting-Dustbowl-era Mississippi. George Clooney stars as Ulysses Everett McGill, a slick, suave greaseball of a man who was arrested for practicing law without a license. When he hears that his wife(Holly Hunter)is getting re-married to another man (the hysterical Ray McKinnon), Ulysses busts loose from a chain gang to set things right. However, he must drag along the two men who are chained to him; violent, confused Peter (John Turturro) and ditsy, dim Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson is witty without being one-dimensional). Along the way, the Coen Brothers find time to pack in a run-in with real-life criminal Babyface Nelson, a group of bewitching she-devils, a huge flood, and a KKK rally attended by a hopeful politician and a malicious one-eyed Bible salesman (John Goodman plays him with what could only be described as beastly allure). Through it all, the film (photographed ravishingly by Roger Deakins) is set to a glorious soundtrack of roots music. John Hart, Chris Thomas King and Allison Krauss all deliver excellent tracks, but the real highlight is when Clooney and his co-horts burst into a toe-tapping version of ""Man of Constant Sorrow"", not for the sake of the plot, but for pure enchantment. And that's what 'Brother' is all about-not story (although it has a great one), but serving up a great slice of unadulterated folksy bliss."

You gotta see this movie!!!"
"truemythmedia","10","4","4","11 September 2019"," My Favorite Coen Brothers Film
","As I write I find myself wondering why this one gets me laughing so hard and I think it's for a lot of reasons. The first is that there is something hilarious to me about adapting a story like ""The Iliad,"" a Classic (in the Greek foundational principles sense of the word) High Myth Hero's Journey, and setting it in the deep south during the great depression. There couldn't be anything less grand than that.<br/><br/>The other thing I find so funny are the characters. Between the three of them, Everett (George Clooney, ""Burn After Reading"") Pete (John Turturro, ""Barton Fink"") and Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson, ""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs"") are each one of them hilarious on their own but the interplay between them is priceless.<br/><br/>Everett is the fast talking knowledgeable man of the world, always scheming and angling for what will give him an edge. He may be knowledgeable but he's not always right or even trying to be right. He's just trying to get his own way and facts, exaggerations, stories, and quickly spoken half truths are his way of doing it.<br/><br/>Pete is easily out matched by Everett because while he may have a better sense of what is just and looks out for what is fair and right, he is also dumb. As such, Everett almost always gets away with whatever he wants and Pete is left continually frustrated in his attempts to make sure he isn't getting the short straw.<br/><br/>Delmar is dumb as well but sweet. He wants everyone to just get along and is always looking to be helpful. Of course, as Everett, Pete and pretty much any other person they run into is always looking to pull one over on each other, this puts him in the awkward position of never really knowing whose side to be on, since he's on everyone's side.<br/><br/>This trio of silliness leads to some of the funniest back and forth conversations, shouting matches, and name calling I've ever seen on screen.<br/><br/>The last thing that makes this movie really funny to me, and I know this is controversial, is the southern drawl of every character in this film. My Grandmother was originally from Arkansas and while her accent has much diminished over the 35 years I've known her, it was very strong to me when I was younger. I always thought it was funny that she referred to Meijer (a local grocery chain) as 'Maars."" For me, a southern accent is both funny and fond when I hear it so I know some people may not get the same feeling from this film as I do but for me it is a perfect combination to go with the themes of the movie.<br/><br/>The themes in this film are certainly Coen Brother classics. The values of brotherhood, family, sacrifice, and hard work, with edges of fate, the supernatural, or karmic justice are ever present in their films but the way they blend it with that southern gospel and dry dust working man mentality cuts through strong in this film. It isn't lost on me that the three leads in this film form a close bond, the film is called ""O BROTHER, Where Art Thou,"" and it was directed by the Coen BROTHERS. As a brother myself I can attest to the spirit of camaraderie that can form between siblings and this film oozes with it. There is nothing like the bond that can form between people when they journey together and seem to meld into one person in three bodies almost.<br/><br/>The last thing I will extol in this film is the music. I leave it for last because it is the best. Old time twang and southern gospel in its many forms. Upbeat and praise filled, down low and mournful, and wistful longing for a home that is not yet ours. It is used for good and evil alike and the solace of those broken by life and their fellow human beings as well as the joy in the hearts of children still ignorant of life's troubles. There are many songs in this film that feels as if you might have been able to hear them on any summer evening as you drove by the porches of families all gathered outside to enjoy the cool breeze accompanying the setting sun.<br/><br/>Perhaps that is what I, actually, love the most about this film. The sense of coming home after hard times away. The belief that, while family is worth everything, close friends are often the crucible through which we are refined and make us better people for our families when we do get home and join them. The journey is not the destination, but it does change us and make us into the people who will arrive there."

","From the opening of the film, almost to the end, this movie has a great feel. The cinematography is beautiful, and following around these three escaped convicts is interesting to watch. But, unfortunately, these characters are only so interesting, and the situations are what the movie has to rely on. The situations become tiring, and then the characters have to run the show. It would've been good if both were great at all times, but they just weren't.<br/><br/>Everett (George Clooney), Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson) and Pete (John Turturro) have just escaped from prison. They go on several long adventures, sing a few songs, and more than anything, try to avoid the police. All 3 of the leading actors are very good, and have an odd (but great) chemistry with each other. Tim Blake Nelson, especially, stands out acting wise as the confused convict who wants to be erased of all his sins. The movie has no real plot or center, which is fine, but some of the sub-plots are dull, and bring this movie down a level from where it could be. Overall though, this is a beautiful looking, interesting character piece on three good hearted convicts.<br/><br/>My rating: *** out of ****. 100 mins. PG-13 for violence and language."
"MrVibrating","10","9","12","18 November 2006"," Wonderfully odd comedy!
","Coen movies are easy to spot. They have that feel, the feel of originality and oddity, the crazy story lines and characters. Oh Brother has all that. The toned down dustiness of the movie feels less like a gimmick and more like it's supposed to be there, adding to the already thick Southern filter the movie's viewed through.<br/><br/>The storyline is imaginative and totally impossible to predict. Giving credit to Homer is a bit silly, since the references to the Oddessy are made for fun and could easily have been discarded without changing the story.<br/><br/>Characters are the usual bunch of misfits and crazies you expect. George Clooney does the role of his life-time. Remember the usual, smug, to a varying degree annoying Clooney you see in every movie he's in? Forget him. This is another person. His two companions are good support and fodder for his clever remarks and half-baked plans.<br/><br/>Since this is set in the 30's South, there are tons of things to use as comedic elements. KKK, crooked politicians, religion, rednecks... amplify that with Coen's script-writing talent and you will laugh. A lot. There is even one of the trademark hallucination scenes, kind of.<br/><br/>What more can you say than: ""Thank you Coens!"" I wont tell you to enjoy this movie. It's very simple. Just watch it!"

And the best part about this movie is how much more your liking and respect for it grows the more you watch. Never before have I found myself so engrossed in a dialogue driven movie. Every viewing brings new laughs and exposes new subtleties that I was sure I caught. George Clooney firmly establishes himself capable of acting in a comedic role. Fans of Dennis Miller will certain appreciate the ""intelligent humor"" this movie provides and Coen Brother fans should have a new personal favorite. And a small suggestion from this end.

","First, for those of you who don't know who Owen Gleiberman is, he's one of Entertainment Weekly's movie critics. From what I remember reading in his review when ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" came out, he said it was just stupid stereotypes and gave it an F. Now that I've actually seen this movie (I got it for my birthday a few months ago), I realize how stupid I was to trust the opinions of a man who also had the nerve to give ""X- Men"" a C.<br/><br/>
""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" is an excellent film in all senses. I'm normally not a George Clooney fan (Until then, the only movie with him I liked was ""From Dusk Till Dawn""), but his performance in this film was perfect, and he truly deserved that Golden Globe he won for it. I also really liked the actor who played Delmar. His realistically amusing facial expressions and hilarious lines (""We thought...you was...a toad!"")kept me happy all throughout the film. The frightening Sheriff  made an effective villain, and the equally intense scene with the KKK rally was really exciting to behold. <br/><br/>The references to the Odyssey were charming and well- done, although I still don't get who George Nelson was supposed to resemble in the ancient Greek story. However, the Siren scene and its aftermath were quite funny, and John Goodman is creditable as the one- eyed Big Dan Teague. Easily one of the best scenes in the movie is when the Soggy Bottom Boys sing ""Man of Constant Sorrow"". That song quickly brought a smile to my face, and should have won that MTV Movie Award for Best Musical Performance.<br/><br/> So, you can forget about what the ""professional"" critics at Entertainment Weekly said about it, and just enjoy this hysterical, light- hearted and worthwhile film."

","The Coen Brothers have done very well and accomplished a movie that completely shocked me.<br/><br/>*************** (slight) Spoiler Alert! ****************<br/><br/><br/><br/>The movie is based on the Odyssey, and because it follows it so much I would highly recommend rereading it or at least look at the Cliff's Notes. The thing is, if you know the Odyssey, you will get a lot of the jokes that are thrown in there.  I saw one comment on here by another user who didn't like the movie and thought that the scene (SPOILER SPOILER) where the guy slaughters several cows was excessive and that the Coen Brothers were just trying to be shocking.  I was laughing a lot, because I understood the connection in the scene to the book.  (MAJOR MAJOR SPOILER:  connection is that in the Odyssey, they kill very sacred cows of Apollo, and those men are struck with lightning.  In the movie, the character who kills the cows is electrocuted in the chair. Absolutely brilliant).  There are tons of Odyssey jokes here; so much so that if you don't read it before watching at least read it afterwards.  You simply can't do the movie total justice without seeing how genius the Coens are.<br/><br/>Oh, and you WILL be singing to yourself the type of music you thought you hated before this movie.<br/><br/>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

Seriously, some stories are universal. We have never been to Greece, nor lived the classic period of Homer, but he speaks to us today. So does Shakespeare and Dante. And stories from far unknown places also reach us, when told with sensibility, intelligence, humor, just like ""O Brother"". Besides, we all (the rest of the world) have our own hillbillies too!

Despite the subtitles, despite being on the other side of the world.

","Based on homer's Odyssey, we follow Everett Ulysses McGill and his companions Delmar and Pete as they escape from a chain gang so that McGill can get home to his family.  Along the way they must deal with sirens, a bible selling Cyclops, Babyface Nelson, a campaigning Governor, a Klan lynching party and a blind prophet.<br/><br/>This is another of the Cohen brothers `different' projects - basically meaning that nothing will make a great deal of sense and won't always follow logical paths but will be full of imagination and energy.  The story won't always be gripping unless you know Ulysses' original adventure.  If you do then the story will be a joy, as you recognise the parallels between the two tales.  Even if you don't there is plenty to enjoy here, the story is so full of funny, imaginative and original characters that you can't help but be drawn in.  From Badalucco's Babyface Nelson (`Oh George, not the livestock'), to Durning's Pappy, everything is handled with such an edge of surrealism that it's captivating.<br/><br/>Clooney has never been better and is truly excellent here with his eccentric hick character with a taste for hair cream.  Turturro is also excellent, but Nelson's childlike Delmar is the best character and a great performance. Hunter is as good as she usually is in Coen stuff and the support cast of Durning, Goodman, Badalucco etc are all great.  The music is fantastic, even if you not a fan of this type of music it still fits so totally with the mood of the film that it all works well together.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful film - yet another from the Coens.  It has it's slow moments and the episodic nature of the story can sometimes give it an aimless feel, but overall this is significantly better than the sum of it's many great parts."

","Headline says it all really. I was a bit sceptical about going to see the film. Firstly the location was an 'Arty' cinema house and that sort of gave me the impression of an 'arty-farty' concept film, not made for the pleasure of the mass public, and a film to establish Clooney as more than a hearthrob. However, I read the review of the film, and according to the review the film would need to be watched more than once to be able to appreciate all the humour, as it came thick and fast. I think that comment was meant for the Dutch, originating from the UK I had no trouble with following the film.<br/><br/>To my delight I was delighted with the film. Clooney played his part excellently as did the rest of the cast. The humour was great, at times very stereotypical, at times very subtle.

The three escaped convicts search for hidden treasure while merciless lawmen (Daniel Von Bargen , Royce D. Applegate) pursues them . Along the way the trio meets curious characters as the historical Baby Face Nelson (Michael Badalucco) who was a homicidal gangster named Lester M. Gillis, he was known for his hot temper and itchy trigger finger ; and Governor Pappy O'Daniel (Charles Druning) who is based on W.

As the main starring getaways bound for home , where waits his wife Penny or Penélope (Holly Hunter) . Sometimes, you have to lose your way to get back home .<br/><br/>¨O Brother, Where Art Thou?¨ is an enjoyable film by Cohen Brothers that packs thrills , dry humor , action , wonderful songs and numerous references to Homer's ""Odyssey"" . ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" comes from the title of the movie-within-a-movie in Preston Sturges' Sullivan's travels (1941) . Starred by three rare characters suffering several Coanesque adventures ; what the trio encounter along the way are a number of surprising situations and weird roles that , when all is said and done , seem like just that individual incidents that never really add up to a whole plot . 3 Protagonists fit well enough to comprise a pretty agreeable yarn , though relies heavily on their peculiar and continuous relationship . The film includes characters or places with the stereotypes of the regions they take place in , as the Southern accents and dust-bowl landscape from Mississippi . The whole concept is loosely based on author Howard Waldrop's novella ""A Dozen Tough Jobs,"" which recounts the labors of Hercules in a similar Mississippi setting , albeit ten years earlier ; another possible link comes from the William Faulkner short novel, ""Old Man"" . Sympathetic acting by main stars accompanied by a magnificent plethora of secondaries as Charles Durning , Thomas King , Ray McKinnon , Lee Weaver , Ed Gale , Stephen Root , Musetta Vander , as well as Coen regulars as John Goodman and special mention for John Turturro . The picture had big success , being nominated for 2 Oscars and another 7 wins & 35 nominations and won five Grammys . Highly keen soundtrack by T Bone Burnett , in which mundane sounds are made to seem eerie or used for absurd effect . George Clooney practiced his singing for weeks, but in the end his singing voice was dubbed by country blues singer Dan Tyminski . The film's soundtrack became an unlikely blockbuster, even surpassing the success of the film . By early 2001, it had sold five million copies , spawned a documentary film, three follow-up albums . Colorful as well as evocative cinematography by Roger Deakins , Coen's usual , the whole film was graded digitally on computer , the negative was scanned and then colors were digitally fine-tuned .<br/><br/>The motion picture was well written and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen . They have shared these duties on all of their films, but Joel has always been listed as director and Ethan as producer .

Both of whom are part of the prestigious group of individuals to have won Oscars for writing , directing and producing in the same year, for the film No Country for Old Men (2007). Their career is splendid from first film : Blood simple (1984) to Arizona Baby (1987), Miller's crossing (1990) , Barton Fink (1991), the great Lebowski (1998), The Man Who Wasn't There (2001) , Intolerable Cruelty (2003) , Burn After Reading (2008) , A Serious Man (2009) , True grit (2010) ,among others ."

","""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" is a beautiful movie with vivid, endearing characters. The storyline is broken neatly into episodes, apparently much like its source material. I haven't read Homer, so other than a few obvious nods to the classic author (the cyclops, for instance) I missed many of the parallels I'm told are there. It's difficult to pinpoint what makes this such a magnificent movie--probably because there are so many details that add up. The first thing that sold me, like so many others, was the music. The album sales alone stand as a testament to the quality of the soundtrack (I realize album sales don't always equal good music, but here they do). It feels like the movie was made during the Great Depression. If you watch movies made during the time, they were all ""feel good"" flics. Several reviewers here have drawn the savy comparison between OBWAT and ""It Happened One Night"", and specifically between Clooney's and Gable's performances. There are so many things that make this movie worth seeing. My only complaint that sticks is that it could so easily have been made PG. As it stands, it is one of the most harmless PG-13 films in a long time, and I wish the filmmakers hadn't opted to put in the extra ""dammits"" to elevate the movie into the more profitable bracket. Even the famous siren scene seemed tasteful, and sweetly seductive rather than racy. My point? This movie has the potential to make you smile."

","Warning: this review contains spoilers about the ending of this movie.<br/><br/>I watched this film again last night on Blu-Ray. It still amazes me<br/><br/>I was first introduced to this excellent movie through the soundtrack album, which I loved, but than I watched the film. It is now one of my favorite Coen films. (Though, that isn't a fair comparison as I have only seen this, ""True Grit"" and ""Raising Arizona"") The performances are classic, especially George Clooney as the slick protagonist Everett, obsessed with Dapper Dan hair grease and his wife, Penny. (""Damn! Were in a tight spot!"" is my favorite quote.) Tim Blake Nelson also deserves praise for his portrayal as Delmar. Blake Nelson portrays an idiot very well and the Coen's script gives him the best lines of the movie. (This is my favorite, ""We'll I'll only be 82!"") The beautiful photography by Roger Deakins (who also helped ILM on the beautiful animation for ""Rango"") captures the feel of 1937 Mississippi perfectly with his digitally colored shots. They fit so well with the story that they are inseparable. It is a great hoot watching this eclectic assortment of The Odyssey, country music, southern folklore, and great humor.<br/><br/>The most perfect part of this film is the ending. The flooding of the valley with the harmonies of the Fairfield Four would be good enough. but the details makes into a great piece of art.A sea of Dapper Dan cans! The drowning hound and the ""happy little tire swing""! The cow on the cotton house! Clooney's monologue about the new south! Roll-top desk!

"bobsgrock","7","2","2","29 December 2009"," Looking for logic where there is none.
","There is a line in O Brother, Where Art Thou? that sums up not just the consensus view of this movie, but also that of nearly every Coen Brothers production. George Clooney says to his chained counterpart John Turturro, ""It's a fool that looks for logic in the chambers of the human heart."" Indeed, there may never have been a better and more meaningful statement uttered. For that sums up the total outlook Joel and Ethan have given to us ever since their stunning debut in 1984 with Blood Simple.<br/><br/>Although this is not a new concept for them, I think these themes work really well with the setting of this movie, one of the most original in remembrance. Here, we get the story of Homer's The Odyssey set in the 1930s of the American South as three bumbling ex-cons search for a treasure while encountering many obstacles along the way. However, like many a Coen Brothers movie, the plot is just a spot to hang up the arc of the story in order to give way for the really interesting aspects; here being the idiosyncrasies of the characters, the gorgeous wide-screen photography, and the overall crass view of human existence.<br/><br/>Through all this, there is a great amount of fun and joy in this story. Clooney is the fast-talking, slick leader of this weirdly likable trio and despite many believing he is too good looking and polished for the role, I believe that only adds to his repertoire, for this Everett needs to be a fast-talker in order to be taken serious because of his looks. Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson add comic support but also depth with their portrayals of Pete and Delmar, chained to Everett and loyal followers the whole way. Even with the clever writing and shifty characters, there is something of a heart behind this story as well as the typical cynicism of the Coens.<br/><br/>This is certainly the type of movie that grows on you and multiple viewings are needed not necessarily to understand the plot but to capture the tone and message of the movie; if there is one. Still, if nothing else, one can certainly appreciate the intelligent/stupid mixture of humor the Coens are capable of mixing together so well. Clooney, Turturro and Nelson are wonderful in their respectable roles and of course, Roger Deakins perfectly captures the feeling of the old South with his colorful and rich cinematography. Here is a great looking, fast talking, clever movie with not much of a message. With the Coens in charge, what is the problem?"

"Aidan McGuinness","Null","2","2","24 June 2002"," O Creativity Where Art Thou? Oh, I see, you're here.
","Ah Coen Brothers - you can expect a step up from the humdrum with these two and this movie is no exception. It's about three escaped convicts off to get some hidden treasure in the Deep South of the 40s, and based loosely around the Greek epic `The Odyssey' with George Clooney playing Ulysses Everett McGill. They have a series of adventures of course, including creating a hit musical single (that they're unaware of) and meeting a variety of colourful characters like John Goodman in the delightful role of Big Dan Teague.<br/><br/>Is this movie hilarious? Not to me, no. It's more in the Wes Anderson vein of being bizarrely `quirky'. Some of the jokes are quite dumb, and others come from the characters themselves - both in their actions and the reactions of others. Ulysses' constant chatter is a very amusing counterpoint to his companions' near inability to speak word. Indeed the characters here are, unlike many comedies, fairly well built and become quite likable, rising above the general shallowness of the genre. The actual plot starts off with them going through a series of seemingly unconnected adventures, but concludes, somewhat obviously, with them all coming to a head. Nevertheless you can't help but recognise the strangeness, and humour, in the coordinated dancing of a Ku Klux Klan crowd (it's just very, very, bizarre).<br/><br/>Acting is all solid here and Clooney once again proves he's not just a pretty face (although he's proved himself to me already by now). His side kicks - John Turturro and Tim Blake - are all fine too, playing congenital idiots, and they're all backed up by a fine supporting cast, including Goodman in one of his finest ever roles.<br/><br/>The cinematography is, as I would expect from the Coen brothers, excellent. There's a lovely feeling of the Deep South of the times, captured in long shots throughout the movie and an excellent attention to set and costume design. The music, the most famous component of the movie, suits the flavour of the movie though the genre, not being in anyway my favourite, grated on occasion (although the main song of the movie almost made up for it in a toe-tapping way). But once again the Coen brothers have pulled off a polished little package (I've never seen a bad movie by them), that's humorous (without being hilarious), quirky (without being down right weird), well acted (without being outstanding) and generally entertaining (without being a `Best Movie Ever' type). Well worth a look if you fancy a change. 7.2/10."

","O Brother is, simply put, a spectacular tour-de-farce that has all the elements required for a great movie in the style of old Depression era Hollywood. Before seeing this for the second time, we rented Sullivan's Travels by Preston Sturges. It was really cool to see the references the Coens did to Sullivan's Travels in O Brother!<br/><br/>Now, a few comments about O Brother: The visuals were stunning. From the antique cars to the grimy clothes to the brilliant yellow fields, this movie gets an A+ for visual depth and brilliance.  Likewise, the soundtrack is great. I'm personally a fan of hillbilly music, but even my husband and friends who aren't could get into the great music. Also, the dialogue was hilarious! There are some great, ludicrous gems in this movie. Also, the characters were truly brilliant, Faulknerian in their tragic comedy. After seeing this movie, I wish the Coens would do a film adaptation of As I Lay Dying, IMO one of the greatest epic comic/tragedies Faulkner ever wrote!<br/><br/>The characters brought this movie to life. Ulysses Everett McGill, the fast-talking, inventive ""Paterfamilias"", played by George Clooney was both likeable and ridiculous with his schemes.  John Tutturo's flashing eyes and fierce expression, coupled with his gravelly voice and molasses-thick dialect, stamped the role of Pete on my heart. And Tim Blake Nelson played the innocent, empty-headed, big hearted Delmar with charm reminiscent of Evell Snopes in Raising Arizona.  It was no wonder butterflies flocked to the childlike, charming Delmar- if an ex-con may be called charming.<br/><br/>The secondary characters were also terrific. McGill's estranged wife, Penny played by Holly Hunter, the seven little Wharvey gals, the acerbic Pappy O'Daniels played to the hilt  by Charles Durning, the malefic Big Dan Teague, Bible salesman-cum-mugger, hilariously played by John Goodman, George (""NOT Baby-Face"") Nelson, Tommy Johnson and the Devil, just to name a few.<br/><br/>By the way, does anybody else think that the prison warden was the Devil? Think about how Tommy Johnson described the Devil at the crossroads, then look at the warden...<br/><br/>All in all, to those to complain that this movie is ""pointless"" or just a ""bunch of stuff strung together"", I humbly suggest that that is what an odessey IS. It is a journey in which the journey itself is more important than the outcome. O Brother is an epic farce which brings together a rich stew of elements of Depression era history, politics and nostalgia, mixes it with some truly outlandish humor and mythic storytelling, and brings it all together to create one of the most heart warming, feelgood movies I have ever seen.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 10/10."

","How blessed we are with the current blizzard of fine films!<br/><br/>Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>Here the Coens embark on their most ambitious effort yet, playing with multiple dualities:<br/><br/>--the real world and a  magical reality of myth<br/><br/>--the world of performance and the world of politics<br/><br/>--the stories of song and those of image<br/><br/>--the lovely bright yellow land of the south and the unlovely people who partly covered it<br/><br/>In the center of each duality, they placed the pretense of our trio moving through what Goethe said of Ulysses was an apprentice voyage. Clooney will really be p***ed when he realizes how these guys goofed on him. Turturro is a long time Coenite who understands their light regard for the patina of entertainment the ordinary viewer expects. In fact, he has just come off of two rather ambitious projects concerned with just these four dualities and the complex role of the actor in weaving them into apparent entertainment: his remarkable `Illuminata,' which he funded, wrote and directed, and Tim Robbins' similar (but more political) project, `Cradle Will Rock.' Turturro is becoming a phenomenon, real intelligence.<br/><br/>Tim Blake Nelson participated in the highly adventurous `Hamlet' of last year, tilted toward just such an issue -- with Hamlet as a film student musing about these dualities. He then took Julia Stiles, the Ophelia, and directed the forthcoming `O,' a version of Othello that is held up I understand because it is `too intelligent.' He has written and directed other films which I haven't seen, but `Eye of God,' written and directed by him is supposed to also be about this same stuff. Natch, all the bright filmmakers are buzzing about these issues. Together, Turturro and Nelson play the game of switching realities, while both Clooney's character and Clooney are oblivious. The title is from a Sturges film-within-a-film. Same issues -- everything revolves around the chicken dance.<br/><br/>A small complaint: the symbol of blindness was too heavihanded, much as with Woody Allen in `Crimes.' And `soggy bottom?""

After listening to the wonderfully original music that permeates the score, the viewer is then treated to an audience singalong of ""You Are My Sunshine"", a song even more loathsome than ""Disco Duck"".<br/><br/>The subplot about dueling politicans made no sense and contributed nothing to the storyline, other than as a convenient way to wrap up the ending. Is there any politician in the world who would storm into a crowded music hall and proclaim ""I am a member of a secret society""?  It was a very weak and very lame way of disposing of the subplot villain.  Why would a man who was so careful and crafty with his campaign throw it all away by raising the ire of a roomfull of people?  So stupid, and made no sense.  This is very sloppy writing by the Coens.<br/><br/>John Goodman is not a very good actor.  Although he was brilliant as Dan Connor on ""Roseanne"", he just doesn't have the range to play different characters.  He delivers his lines as Dan Connor would; little wonder then that the character is named Big Dan.  Fred Flintstone, Babe Ruth, King Ralph:  he plays the same character time after time, just like Morgan Freeman does.  However, he has a good screen presence, so it's understandable that he's a Coen brothers staple.  Holly Hunter, normally a firecracker, is ice-cold, and it's difficult to understand what Everett sees in her.  John Turturro is, as always, on the edge of mania, ready to fall off the deep end at any moment.  His howl of lust when he sees the women at the river is one of the funniest things he's ever done.  ""Looks like Pete's got the itch,"" Delmar deadpans in his philosophical way.<br/><br/>My main problem with this movie is that there is no point to any of it. There is no goal and no storyline.  You can't identify with any of the characters, and it's difficult to accept Everett's longing to be back with his frigid wife.  Villians pop up right and left, but they are just temporary.  This film is like a series of half-finished thoughts, or half-remembered dreams, all leading up to a whole bunch of nothing.  The ending fizzles out like a dying candle, with Everett begging Penny to take him back.  Hmm, we're back where we started.<br/><br/>With better writing, this could have been a great film."

I'd like to help change that, and invite others to add their comments.<br/><br/>The movie takes place in MISSISSIPPI.<br/><br/>The character Charles Durning plays - Pappy O'Daniel - was the actual governor of Texas (1938-1942), was in fact a flour baron, and toured with a band (that's STILL playing together, albeit with new members as well as some of the original ones) called the Lightcrust Doughboys, who specialized in Texas Swing and other old-Tyme music.<br/><br/>One song that shows up twice - at critical junctures in the movie - is ""You are my Sunshine,"" the official state song of LOUISIANA, that was penned by a real LOUISIANA governor: Jimmie Davis, who lived to be 101 years old and lived in THREE different centuries ! As Durning's character walks into the radio station in the movie, one of his assistants mentions "" . . . every parish and precinct . . ."" involved in his election campaign for governor.<br/><br/>The ONLY state where there are ""parishes and precincts"" is LOUISIANA - all of the other 49 states have ""counties and precincts"" as their political subdivisions.<br/><br/>The flooding of the valley recalls the TVA in Tennessee.<br/><br/>There must be more references that others know about concerning their state or area.

","Earnest effort which achieves some success to adapt the classic Odyssey story to a '30's nostalgia period piece. The adventurers this time are escaped convicts, wandering about the Depression afflicted South bungling their way into trouble.<br/><br/>The greatest strength of the film is the wonderful music soundtrack, effectively evoking not only the era that this is set in, but the spiritual references that run rampant in the film. Besides its value to the tone of the movie, the music is just plain fun to listen to.<br/><br/>What cripples the film is that the characters really aren't that likable. In a comedy, you need that element in order to have fun along with them in their misadventures. Instead, we have a bunch of selfish, arrogant, soulless, mean spirited nobodies who really have no positive points at all. They're not imposing enough to make you hate them either, so it's hard to relate to them at all. They're offered up as clowns, but like people who put clown makeup on and march in parades, they just aren't funny.<br/><br/>Like the story that inspired it, the movie takes these guys on an ""odyssey,"" encountering a variety of symbolic (some even mystical) characters. Everybody is stamped with offensive stereotypes, the operative word being ""stupid."" People are mocked right and left, and consequently, no one is left being particularly interesting or appealing. The movie doesn't like its own characters, and it doesn't let you like them, either.<br/><br/>Riverside baptisms, beautiful sirens, stolen cars, fistfights, radio preachers, people being whipped with sticks; all are thrown at you in disjointed fashion. Some evoke a few laughs, others confuse or bore you. I did laugh when a nerdy guy beat the snot out of an especially obnoxious lead character. But there were a lot more pointlessly gratuitous scenes; an example: some '30's Dillinger-type guy strafes cows with a tommy-gun. Comedy? Symbolism? No; just mindless violence, which detracts from the intellectual nature of the original source material this story draws upon.<br/><br/>Other adaptations of the Odyssey are much better. Unless you're a George Clooney fan, rent something else. But buy the soundtrack CD; the music is great."

The film meanders along but never builds any momentum. It does get a big boost from Clooney's charismatic, Gableesque mugging, and also from the art direction and T-Bone Burnett's lively music.

"ElMaruecan82","6","3","4","9 September 2016"," O Coen Brothers, Where Were You?...
","Praising a Coen brothers' movie because it has style is like praising an ice cream because it's cold, there's got to be more. ""O Brother Where Art Thou"" has all the style a fan of the directing siblings can ask for, but a little more substance wouldn't have hurt the film.<br/><br/>Talent is a double-edged sword, the more you prove yourself capable to surprise the viewers, to mesmerize them, to please their eyes and challenge their intellect, the more they expect from your next creation. And after ""Fargo"", perhaps the most universally acclaimed Coen brothers' movie and ""The Big Lebowksy"", a bizarre take on the noir genre whose brilliance sprung lately in our minds, came ""O Brother Where Art Thou"". Watching it, I want to ask the two Coens ""O Brothers, Where Were You?"" A Coen brothers' comedy is an offer you can't refuse, but there are many ways to play comedy, goofy and borderline-parody like in ""Raising Arizona"", surrealistic and over-the-top like in ""The Big Lebowsky"", bleak and engrossing like in ""Barton Fink"" and ""A Serious Man"", or dark and atmospheric like in ""Fargo"", even in the so-called dramatic movies, there was also a few scenes to channel their wicked twisted of humor. But as far as comedy is concerned, the case of ""O'Brother Where Art Thou"" is puzzling, it obviously tries to play on the ""Raising Arizona"" level with the atmosphere of ""Sullivan's Travels"" in the background, but the humor never really manages to hit that special chord so that you can follow the story with the confidence that this is going to be one hell of a belly-laugh ride.<br/><br/>And it's even more puzzling because the film actually got the casting right, the first shot with the three fugitives from a chain gang running and ducking in the midst of a cornfield is like borrowed from a 30's cartoon, it successfully sets the tone, something in the line of ""Of Mice and Men"" and Tex Avery. George Clooney is a 'clowny' version of George crossed with a Clark Gable wannabe, his name is Everett, John Turturro is Pete, a sort of Lenny without the good heart, and Tim Blake Nelson is Delmar, a pint-sized Lenny without the strength, and none of Turturro or Nelson even tries to steal Clooney's thunder, which leaves him enough space to display his comical abilities. But there's not much given to him. For instance, there's one part where Pete asks Everett why he's the boss, Everett proposes a vote. Pete proposes himself so it all comes to Delmar, there's no time for him to come with a funny line, their first encounter: a black blind man driving a handcar on a railway.<br/><br/>And this is only one of the many colorful tropes of the Great Depression era, a time, full of pastoral melancholy immortalized by so great classics, interestingly many road movies: ""The Grapes of Wrath"", ""Bonnie and Clyde"", ""Bound for Glory"", a time made popular through bluegrass music, the sounds of banjo, sepia tones and so many visually appealing details that it's no wonder the Coen brothers decided to venture into this chapter of America and where else than Mississippi could they complete the picture with pies, long railroads, hobos in freighters, a governor who look like the KFC old man and Klan rallies? A Depression film is no depressing premise, not when it is tackled by the Coen brothers and cinematographer Roger Deakings. So what went wrong exactly? <br/><br/>Well, the film is said to be adapted from Homer's Odyssey. While it gives the film a certain edge, it doesn't really add much to the story as the Coen brothers reckoned they didn't read the book, so why handicapping a great premise with a needless framework. Are the Coens so uninspired they couldn't make a story of their own? In fact they did, because nothing really evokes the Odyssey apart from the Sirens' encounter, Penny, the wife, played by Holly Hunter is obviously Penelope, with her knitting habit, but what do they add up besides simply 'reminding' of the Odyssey. Take the sirens part, what does that part offer except from the recognition that they are the Sirens? I believe the film would have been more interesting had they stuck to an original screenplay, with so many great characters, they could. But the film was just so busy loosely imitating a never-read book that it created a series of events, enjoyable in their own terms but so inconsistent that even the resolutions feels a bit artificial and unconvincing.<br/><br/>At the end, we enjoy it for the stars, the atmosphere (some religious moments are haunting), the performances of John Goodman as Bible salesman and governor Charles Durning as Papy O'Daniel and naturally, the defining song of the film ""A Man of Constant Sorrow"". I would lie if I said the film wasn't enjoyable, every single department is well done but something is lacking in the whole. %aybe if it was made by other directors, we would have been less critical, the fact is the film was made after ""The Big Lebowksy"" and it just didn't compare. Still, as a minor offering, ""Brother' is never as good as when it takes departure from the whole Odyssey's outline and its homage to ""Sullivan's Travels"", a film I didn't even like in the first place. Maybe that's why I'm so critical?<br/><br/>Nah it's precisely because I have been so admiring of most of the Coen brothers' works that I allow myself to say this one made me a viewer of constant sorrow."

The movie is based on Homer's The Odyssey. I'd personally would rather watch this adaptation of the book than read the book itself. The movie stars as George Clooney stars as Ulysses Everett McGill, John Tuturro stars as Pete and Tim Blake Nelson as dim witted Delmar O'Donnell. All of them play escaped convicts looking for the treasure that Everett had buried before going to jail. So when they bust out out of jail it is a whole new adventure waiting for them. When they record a song to get some cash they end up recording a hit song. Everyone is looking for these new found musicians but they are trying to hide from the law. This whole movie is filled with hilarious one liners from Clooney. The move also stars Holly Hunter, Charles Durning and John Goodman as a greedy bible salesman. This movie is a success in in every aspect and it is the Coen brothers greatest film."

I have watched it several times and pick up some new detail every time I see it. Also, I think the Tim Blake Nelson version of ""In The Jailhouse Now"" is the best I've ever heard; better than the original or any other recordings of the tune that have hit the charts such as the Webb Pirce version.

","Any semi-intelligent person should be reasonably amused with any production by the Coen Brothers since incredible care is placed into mocking the specific characteristics of common ordinary people. O' Brother Where Art Thou is another success which, like other Coen Brothers films, has a number of messages for the viewer in the course of a film that has several, oddly connected and hilarious scenes.<br/><br/>The dialogue is witty and in this film, a good amount of bluegrass music is interspersed with the theatre-like dialogue. Initially it takes a little getting used to in sliding into the concocted dialogue. But what really takes the cake in this film are the incredible performances by all the actors who each have their moment to shine.<br/><br/>Clooney is remarkably good as Ulysses, the leader of the pack of convicts who escape a chain gang and wander into the wild, crazy, and mad world of the early 20th century. They come face to face with a number of characters that are included not only for the comedy, but much for the messages that the characters seem to give to the audience through their dialogue. What is wonderful is that the audience, if semi-intelligent, gets to put together the pieces of the moral vignette rather than having it spoon-fed in typical Hollywood style.<br/><br/>The running hair joke in this film is hilarious. Even more remarkable is the great performance by comedic Tim Blake Nelson, a relative unknown. Turturro, Goodman, Hunter and Durning are all special as well but we've come to expect excellence from that group. Some may not care for the Coen brothers style but that is most unfortunate since you would be missing out on a collection of the world's greatest non-commercial films ever made in the face of pretentious Hollywood. This one is a winner and very entertaining."

I am a Cohen Brother's film fan and almost all of their films had the same effect on me. Ya can't immediately fall in love with their films, they take time to enjoy and find out how loving they can be.<br/><br/>(Spoilers?) This film is loosely based on Homer's: The Odyssey. (And not Homer Simpson either folks!) Once you know that basic story you begin to find out just how endearing this film really is. Three ex-cons were 'conned' into breaking out of jail and go on quite an adventure. Believable? Hmmmm, maybe. Unbelievable? Hmmmm, maybe. The key line of this film is told right in the beginning by the old man riding the rail when he tells them that they are seeking a treasure, that they will get it but it will not be the one they seek. <br/><br/>But that is just what makes this fun. The music is to die for, and to be honest, you don't have to like ""bluegrass"". It has that PLUS other styles as well that adds to the richness of the adventure. George Clooney, whom I don't usually like, turns in a good performance here as well as his ""partners in crime"". The one liners in this film are fun and the actors carry them off well, such as the one I used to summarize the film. Quirky, silly, funny, strange can all be used to sum this film up.<br/><br/>One problem I had was that I felt the ending of the film wasn't that great. You could have actually ended the film 15 minutes earlier and it would have been just as fine. It's worth a look...or two, believe you me, you'll find that over a few viewings you'll see it for what it is, a very craftyly done adaptation of an age old story.

The music in here is super, led by the catchy ""Man Of Constant Sorrow,"" performed by Gary Tyminski. I also loved ""Soggy Mountain Boys"" humorously sang and presented by the three main characters: Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson. Those three guys were hilarious, particularly Nelson with his rubber-faced looks. Audibly, the entire soundtrack is outstanding, under the direction of T-Bone Burnett. I wound up buying the CD as millions of other people did. Fantastic music.<br/><br/>The way this was filmed makes it visually fascinating, with scenery enhanced by computer graphics and all-time great Roger Deakins in charge of the photography. All the people in this movie are wacky, as are the people who made it: the unfortunately clever-but-biased Coen brothers.

The Cohen brothers brilliantly weave actual happenings of the early 20th century into this story to make a believable setting and storyline. The combination of Clooney's leading role blends well with Turturro and Nelson's supporting acts. John Goodman's appearance in the movie is hilarious. The soundtrack is great as well.

","The Coen brothers are probably America's most creative minds in recent years as shown by the many projects they have brought for our benefit in order to entertain us. As with all creative persons, some films are extraordinary, some are excellent, and a few miss the mark. Having seen the film in its original release, we were fortunate to see again in DVD format recently. With ""O Brother, Where Art Thou"", the Coens are at their best. <br/><br/>Joel and Ethan Coen gathered one of the best group of performers to be in the film. George Clooney is seen as Ulysses, or Odysseus in the Greek epic, the man at the center of the action. Never has this actor been given this great opportunity and he has responded in ways that bowled us in watching him portray his character on the screen. To say this is his best work in the movies, is perhaps not saying anything at all! Mr. Clooney can thank the Coens for trusting in him and giving him the role of his career.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is perfection. Most of the players are part of the Coen's troupe of talented players at their disposal to give life to their characters in film. John Turturro, John Goodman and Holly Hunter have been in other films by the brothers and shine in this movie. Tim Blake Nelson, Charles Durning, Del Pentecost, and Daniel Von Bargen, among others do extraordinary work for the Coen team.<br/><br/>The musical score by T Bone Burnett is what makes this movie unique.

No doubt the aforementioned hacks will all scream `Philistine' if and when they bother to read this particular review, but I for one found this film dull and tedious in the extreme. I found myself waiting for something momentous to happen but nothing really did. The whole thing just plodded along at snail's pace  uninspiring plot lines leading toward an equally uninspiring ending. By far the worst movie that George Clooney has ever been involved in. His character was obviously intended to be the brains of the trio alongside those two other dimwits, but the whole sorry bunch were just annoying and tiresome, GC included (and that accent - oh dear me). I usually enjoy movies set in the depression era and I sat down in eager anticipation to watch this one. The 30s backdrop and the atmosphere conjured up by the bluegrass soundtrack were perhaps the film's only saving graces. But the plot (such as it was) and the characters were just awful.

","`Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?'  is ostensibly based on Homer's `The Odyssey,' but I have no reason to doubt the Coen Brothers when they say that they've never actually read it.  The film really has nothing to do with that epic poem other than the fact that the filmmakers throw plot elements from the original haphazardly into the mix every now and then.  Need a Cyclops? Dress John Goodman up in an eye patch to no point or purpose.  Sirens?  Have the main characters stumble across three beautiful women singing and washing clothes by a riverside, even though the scene seems totally contrived and arbitrary in the context of the story.  The Coen Brothers' lack of familiarity with the original is only too apparent.<br/><br/>Actually, this is one of their worst films, no doubt about it  slow, arch, disjointed and heavy-handed in both its plotting and its humor.  The original `Odyssey' was an epic tale filled with adventure, high drama and great themes involving issues of courage, pride, commitment and love.  `Oh Brother' is none of these.  It is, in fact, silly, cramped and trivial.  The role of Ulysses has been assigned to George Clooney, as the leader of a trio of convicts who escape from a chain gang in the Depression Era Midwest.  As they roam the countryside, they encounter a myriad of bizarre, eccentric characters, some derived loosely from `The Odyssey' and some not.  None of it really works, partly due to the arbitrariness of the plotting and partly due to the fact that the humor is not very well executed.  In fact, most of the wit consists of having the actors overplay their facial expressions and accents.  As a result of these two factors, the strain never ceases to show.<br/><br/>So are there any good things to be found in `Oh Brother'?  Well, the movie does look good, thanks to fine cinematography and art direction, which beautifully capture the look of the dusty rural countryside of the 1930's. And there is, of course, the occasional joke or idea that actually does work despite the fact that the film as a whole is a major disappointment. Perhaps, in the case of this particular Coen Brothers film, the title is inadvertently symbolic."

The Coen brothers have a very sophisticated understanding of American regionalism; which they blend with their unrefined, idiotic sense of humor to make some very awful movies. There comes a point in this movie when a viewer cuts his losses, as the scales tip from enthralling regionalism, to repellent juvenile low-humor; which probably wasn't even funny when it last appeared (vaudeville?). There isn't a gag in the Coen canon that rises above cornball. How they've managed to parlay this into a respectable career is confounding.

Unfortunately, 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' falls into the latter category and isn't even as good as 'The Big Lebowski' or 'The Hudsucker Proxy.'<br/><br/>'O Brother' is basically an episodic series of in-jokes without much point, and not all that much humor or cleverness either. As most reviewers have noted, the film's plot is very loosely  and, as far as I could tell, quite arbitrarily  based on The Odyssey. Its main character, Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney), is an 'adventurer' like his Homeric namesake and has as his 'real' goal the return home to prevent the marriage of his wife Penny to a suitor. Of course, we don't discover that this is what the Clooney/Ulysses character really wants until long after we've stopped caring. And what does Homer have to do with ""Cool Hand Luke"" chain gangs, Ku Klux Klan meetings a la ""Indiana Jones"" cult gatherings, a disbarred lawyer's vocabulary, a talent for blue-grass country music singing, an association with Baby Face Nelson, a Clark Gable lookalike hairdo, and other random and sundry character traits and encounters? I leave that for others to discern.<br/><br/>The allusion to Preston Sturges' 'Sullivan's Travels' in 'O Brother's' title is equally pointless. Yes, viewers familiar with the Sturges minor screwball comedy classic might find it mildly rewarding to recognize the title of the socially conscious Depression movie Sullivan abandons Hollywood and comedy hoping to make. And they might even be mildly amused by a couple of shot/scene riffs (e.g. hopping freight cars, and the chain gang shuffle into view a movie). But so what? The Coen brothers don't seem to have anything to add to the art-for-art's-sake versus moral high seriousness critical debate about the function of art. They obviously fall into the former school, but that doesn't seem to motivate the reference in the slightest. Is it an homage? If so, why make it? I like post-modern pop culture reference and textual play as much as the next person, but it's a lot nicer when it amounts to something at least tonally, if not thematically, consistent  and not just an arbitrary concoction.<br/><br/>This screenplay is simply a silly mess. The only consistent, and consistently pleasing, element is the folk/country music soundtrack. It doesn't have much to do with Homer or Preston Sturges, but, considering the rest of the film, that's probably a good thing. On the other hand, I'd recommend using the price of admission on the soundtrack CD."

","I know I may get a bit of flack because this is a Coen Brothers film and it is an interesting take on The Odyssy, but I couldn't help but find myself checking the clock from time to time.

","ok most people seemed to like this movie, but personally I hated it.  I know it is a parody of the Oddysey, but i didnt notice too many similarities.  Also, the whole idea that three guys break out of a chain gang seeking treasure and somehow manage to create a blue grass band that becomes very well liked just doesn't make much sense. The fact that the whole movie has blue grass music in it does not do much for me.  I have heard it has been recognized for its music, but if you aren't a big bluegrass fan, then this moive can be somewhat of a turn off as it was for me.  I don't really care for George Clooney in a not serious role.  I think he is a very fine actor in Oceans Eleven, but as a convict, he isn't too convincing.  This movie recieved two and a half stars from ebert and roper or whoever and frankly i would have to agree with the rating.  To me, O Brother Where Art Thou was simply a mediocre movie."
"MovieAddict2016","4","7","15","2 December 2003"," O Cohesion, Where Art Thou?
","I haven't seen many of the Coen Brothers' films, although one of the two I have seen is one of my favorites (""Fargo""), and the other I've seen is one I don't care for very much (""O Brother, Where Art Thou?""). One of the films has a lot of humor, the other doesn't. One of the films is extremely entertaining; the other is just sort of boring.<br/><br/>""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" is a retelling of Homer's ""Odyssey,"" or ""Homer's Odyssey,"" since you never see the title without the name preceding it anymore; Homer's name is practically part of the title, now. Am I digressing? <br/><br/>It starts with three runaway convicts, Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney), Pete (John Turturro), and Delmer (Tim Blake Nelson). Everett - as his chumps call him - has a strange fascination with his own hair, and Dapper Dan hair cream. ""I'm a Dapper Dan Man!"" he proclaims after being offered another brand of hair cream by a store clerk (who unfortunately doesn't carry Dapper Dan but looks as if he couldn't give a hoot either way). And, in another one of the film's few funny scenes, we see local police picking up a trail on the threesome after a bloodhound finds a tin can of Dapper Dan and a hairnet lying by a diminished fire.<br/><br/>The trio has escaped from jail in hopes of finding an ancient treasure not delved into by the film so very much. Along the way they meet an odd assortment of characters, including a black guitarist who sold his soul to Satan so that he could learn to play guitar; a baby-faced criminal trying to make a name for himself; and a bulky thief (John Goodman) who steels what little fortunes the men have achieved by singing on the radio under the combined name of The Soggy Bottom Boys.<br/><br/>Along the way they also encounter Everett's wife (Holly Hunter), who claims he was hit by a train, tells her seven children this, and refuses to acknowledge him as her husband. With the law in hot pursuit of them, the boys have only their brains to fall back on - and they don't have much of that available for use.<br/><br/>The plot's not the problem with the film (per se). It has fun with itself; the bluegrass music is perfect for the film and makes you feel like you're in Mississippi. The problem is the way the film has a million different ideas going on that it never seems able to make sense of. The film takes spiritual detours that pay off at the end, but nothing is ever truly resolved. In one scene towards the overdue finale, Everett gets down on his knees and prays to God to deliver them from their doom. Suddenly a gigantic tidal wave roars through and demolishes their surroundings, leaving them alive and bobbing on the water's surface.<br/><br/>I've read ""The Odyssey,"" but even with all its weirdness in mind I don't remember it being this weird. It's been a while, yes, but I don't remember a giant tidal wave and I certainly don't think it belongs in a feature film with enough wasted ideas. At least `The Odyssey' was weird for a reason  `O Brother, Where Art Thou?' could certainly do without the strangeness.<br/><br/>Every time George Clooney is on-screen you'll be having some minimal amount of fun at least, but when he's gone and the film takes its time rooting through some unimportant sub-plots, it gets to be a real bore. It's not even two hours long but it feels like it's three.<br/><br/>The plus side? Depression-era Mississippi comes alive, and in some scenes the dry filming makes you thirsty for a glass of cold water. Not only that, but just as in ""Fargo,"" the Coen Brothers are able to make us feel a sort of attachment to the characters - but even with Everett's funny infatuation with hair gel, he's not in the same league as Marge Gunderson, and he never will be.<br/><br/>The first time I saw this movie in 2000 (the year of its release), I absolutely hated it. Back then, perhaps I was expecting something too close to ""Fargo."" Maybe I just wanted something better. So with last night's repeat viewing, I made sure I wasn't expecting anything. I made sure I put away all pretensions. It still didn't impress me.<br/><br/>""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" does have some good parts, but for being a comedy it certainly doesn't have very many laughs, and for being a lightweight, uplifting drama it seems too caught up in darker ideas that don't need meddling with. And, apart from everything else, it's just plain weird. It's a whole lot different than ""Fargo,"" which might sound good since change is often welcomed from director(s). But whereas M. Night Shyamalan's ""Signs"" was different than ""The Sixth Sense"" in a delightfully splendid way, ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" is sort of like George Lucas' latest installments into the extended ""Star Wars"" series. They may be different, but they're definitely not any better.<br/><br/>2.5/5 stars.<br/><br/><ul><li>John Ulmer</li></ul>"

"RHKLWK","1","14","37","27 May 2002"," And You Thought ""Planet of the Apes"" Was Bad!
","This is an awful film.<br/><br/>But first, an historical note:  The Confederate battle flag is the centerpiece of an ugly scene in this film involving the Ku Klux Klan.  For the record, the Confederate battle flag was NEVER associated with the Ku Klux Klan during its heyday.  If you take the time to look at any of the news reels from the 1920's and 1930's, including film clips of the thousands of robed klansmen marching down Washington, D.C.'s Constitution Avenue, the only flag you will see is ""Old Glory.""  The Confederate battle flag was MISAPPROPRIATED in the late 1950's and in the 1960's by groups opposing the integration of the public schools and, later, by the handful of ""yahoos"" in this country who claim to be sepratists and Aryans, ad nauseum.  The point is that Hollywood's fixation on the Confederate battle flag as a symbol of evil is a continuing slander on the memory of millions of Americans who fought for independence.<br/><br/>But, back to the film.  I dislike the Coens because they are not just mannered, they are pretentious.  Come on, folks.  Be honest.  The Coens are indulging themselves.  And we, that small slice of the movie-going public with the brain cells to write a review, are letting them get away with it.<br/><br/>The story?  What story?  It's just a series of scenes.  Unless you know something about Southern American history, the movie makes absolutely no sense.  Even then, it's a reach.  The ""story"" takes place in Mississippi, but the real Governor Pappy (""Pass the biscuits, please"") O'Daniel was a Texan, and the film's theme song, ""You are my Sunshine,"" was written by Louisiana's Depression-era governor, Jimmy Davis.  Symptomatic with the way Hollywood views the South, I suppose the Coens are trying to cover it all in one film.<br/><br/>The characters?  George Clooney is laughable as Ulysses Everett McGill. This man obviously never spent one day on a chain gang, or one day in the South, pretend or otherwise.  Burt Reynolds would have been better, but then the art house crowd would never have gone for it.  Holly Hunter?  Her pained expressions were all too real, I am afraid.  She has no direction, no scenes, no lines, no personality, and no interest in the film.  And what a waste!  She's a real Southerner with a real Southern charm and attitude.<br/><br/>Tim Blake Nelson as Delmar O'Donnell is just too painful to watch.  He had me wishing the witches had turned HIM into a toad.  But, on the other hand, he represents the Coens' view of Southern people, so his performance is not atypical.  Charles Durning is completely wasted as Gov. O'Daniel.  The man has some range, but here he is just a one-note blowhard.  (Remember him in ""The Sting"" and in ""Tootsie""?)  John Goodman?  Oh, please.<br/><br/>
I did not care about any of the characters.  I thought the Coens were going to do something with Tommy Johnson (played by Chris Thomas), thinking perhaps that he would be the Coens' version of ""Leadbelly,"" but he makes no contribution.  We know nothing about him.  In the end, he's just a black guy with a guitar.  Michael Baldacci's turn as ""Baby Face"" Nelson is filler.<br/><br/>Not surprisingly, it is hard to like ANYBODY in this film, which is characteristic of a film by the Coens.<br/><br/>The film did win a couple of Oscars, including one for cinematography. But how?  Many of the daytime scenes are hazy and desperately in need of a filter, and those outdoor shots that are attractive, are no more attractive than the outdoor scenes you see in a typical episode of ""The Crocodile Hunter.""<br/><br/>I wonder what Tim Burton is up to these days?"
"jimbo-53-186511","1","10","25","23 September 2014"," A complete failure on all counts
","This is another example of a film that once again fails to live up to its relatively good premise; IMDb Plot Summary ""Three escaped convicts search for hidden treasure while a relentless lawmen pursues them"". That is all I was looking for - a nice little cat and mouse chase with laughter and fun thrown in throughout the film - sadly you get none of that here.<br/><br/>I'm aware that this film has been adapted from Homer's Odyssey, but I'm not going to claim I know much about this work. I am aware that some of the characters and scenarios depicted in this film are based on this Odyssey, but does that make it a good film? God no!!!! <br/><br/>The problem with this film is that many characters are introduced and then disappear seemingly without any point or purpose. Let's look at a few examples;<br/><br/>GEORGE NELSON - a mobster whose character is presumably meant to be some kind of parody of Baby Face Nelson whose real name is also George Nelson. His character arrives and the only memorable scene involving his character and our trio of fugitives was a rather disgusting scene which involved him shooting cattle and then their pursuers running a couple of cattle over. Is this meant to be funny? It was pretty sick if you ask me. His character is then randomly introduced at the end when he's arrested and sentenced to death - again possibly a parable of the life of the real life character. <br/><br/>TOMMY JOHNSON - a hitchhiker that our trio pick up who has sold his soul to the devil. He then quickly disappears and then reappears later in the film when he's captured by the KKK who wish to sacrifice him because he sold his soul to the devil??? I honestly couldn't believe how stupid it all was.<br/><br/>DAN TEAGUE - a religious fanatic whose character served no real purpose in the film other than to shock the audience. I like John Goodman, but his presence in this film wasn't enough to save this catastrophe of a film.<br/><br/>Added to a whole host of pointless characters the Coens also present you with a screenplay that's a complete mess - they'd go from one scene to the next without any sort of logical connection. As I've mentioned characters are introduced and then disappear without any real explanation and then are reintroduced in the most ridiculous and contrived of ways. Factor all of this with a stupid sub plot involving two government officials both fighting to win people's vote. What the hell did that have to do with anything? Also, I thought this was meant to be a film where the fugitives are being pursued. Did anyone really get the feeling that they were actually being chased? I think I only saw the law enforcement official about 3 times during the entire 105 minute running time.<br/><br/>I would have forgiven most of the above if the film had even been remotely funny, but it couldn't even fulfil that basic need. We have the running joke of RUNOFT. Is that supposed to be a joke about how people speak in the Deep South or is the joke that they are thick and are unable to spell? That was lost on me. Then there's the scene at the start where our trio of fugitives randomly enter an establishment and start singing into a pan. What the hell was that all about? I kept scratching my head and wondering if I just didn't 'get' it.<br/><br/>The main failings of this film are simply that there's too much going on; too many characters who serve no purpose, too many sub plots, it wasn't remotely funny, poor chemistry between the 3 leads. I think the Coens may possibly have been trying to weave stories together, but it doesn't work because there's just too much going on and too much for the average viewer to take in. <br/><br/>The only positive I took from this was the initial scene with the blind man on the rail road where he says 'There's a fortune out there, but there's a long road ahead of you to reach that fortune'. It's clever because it makes the audience believe one thing, but by the end it's interpreted as something else. That is the only positive that I got from this film."

","Ok - so I caught on to the loose parallels with the Odyssey. The sirens, John Goodman as the Cyclops, Holly Hunter as Penelope. Maybe I missed something, but the whole Odyssey thing seemed like forced cleverness.<br/><br/>The movie came across as a collection of hollow stereotypes that managed to expose the Coen brothers' obvious contempt for the culture of the rural South. Because they are so out of touch with the people about whom they wrote, the lines often came out lifeless and flat. Particularly with Turtorro who was totally miscast as a hillbilly. He sounded like he picked up his Southern accent from watching episodes of Foghorn Leghorn. Also - I though hillbilly music literally came from the hills - Appalachia - not the Mississippi Delta.<br/><br/>I would be interested to see the Coen brothers turn their vicious parody machine on a culture with which they have some familiarity - say Jewish culture. Could you imagine if a couple of Southern boys had made a film that brought to life all of the negative stereotypes associated with New York Jews -- perhaps set against the musical stylings of Gershwin's tin pan alley??<br/><br/>The movie came across as slightly too mean-spirited.<br/><br/>Not one of their better efforts, in my opinion."

","As fun as O Brother, Where Art Thou? can be, it has an overlong, dragged-out feel. There seems to be less material than a 105-minute feature can support. And, as is often the case in Coen Brothers movies, there is minimal character development. We learn a little bit about Ulysses, but almost nothing about anyone else. In large part, we're willing to stick with these three individuals because the actors playing them do a good job. Clooney radiates charisma as he slides into character. John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson are both effective foils, and the entire supporting cast falls into place. The Coens are master filmmakers but this is something of a misstep. Not by much(after all this is the Coens we are talking of) but it is."
"tieman64","Null","3","5","18 May 2008"," Sullivan's Travels
","""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" is the Coen Brothers' homage to Hollywood's screwball comedies of the 1930s, and a giddy wink to the various depression-era Southern motifs depicted in literature and film. <br/><br/>As such, the Coens give us a film awash with the flavours of 1930s Louisiana as mediated by 70 years of accumulated myth. Their vision is categorically not a depiction of the ""real"" South, but rather a demented, postmodern take on an imaginary South encountered only in print and film.<br/><br/>Chain gangs, baptisms, KKK rallies, unwashed yokels, farm houses, corrupt politicians, bank robbers, blues musicians (who sell their souls at the crossroads), Bonnie and Clyde car-chases, the march of ""progress"" as symbolised by the spread of electricity and radio etc. etc....the film is filled with little moments and anecdotes drawn from, not history, but art's impression of history. It's a copy of a copy, paper thin and with the weight of a laminated photograph.<br/><br/>If all Coen flicks are postmodern homages, then this one is an affectionate nod to the Preston Sturges comedy ""Sullivan's Travels"". In that film a director sets out to make an ""important"" picture (called ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"") instead of a comedy for once, but then ends up realising that he should stick to what he does best. ""There's a lot to be said for making people laugh,"" Sullivan says. ""Don't you know that's all some people have?""<br/><br/>So in utilising Sullivan's proposed film title for their own spoof, the Coen's are suggesting that it will contain some ""high-minded"" artistic content too. Adding in some obviously pretentious and inappropriate references to Homer provide the Coens with just the meta-parodic hook they're looking for. In this regard, the final film contains many amusing parallels with Homer's Odyssey. These include scenes with sirens, a cyclops, blind men and a mockingly self-important ""based on the Odyssey by Homer"" credit, all of which serve as a sort of formalist meta-joke. <br/><br/>7/10 - There are some good sequences here, like a KKK ceremony which is reenacted as a MGM musical parody, but the entire film is weighed down by its cartoonishness. Elsewhere the film's self-consciously ""clever"" window-dressing serves only to inflate what is essentially a jaunty lark about yokels (which is of course the point of most Coen flicks). Worth two viewings."
"zdrummer10","6","3","5","26 December 2007"," Relating this movie to ""The Odyssey""
","The Coen Brothers successfully transformed the epic poem, ""The Odyssey"" into a movie through their full screen spectacle, O Brother Where Art Thou? For example, both pieces begin with blind prophets who describe future occurrences through predictions. In O Brother Where Art Thou? the prophet is revealed to be the blind man on the train tracks, predicting the future of the three fugitives. In ""The Odyssey"", there are many prophets, such as Muse, Theoclymenes, Helen and Tiresias who often describe the impending doom of the suitors and Odysseus' return. In addition, in both pieces there are sirens who attempt to stir the main characters' supporting crew. In O Brother Where Art Thou? the sirens are located at a lake, persuading Pete to follow them leading to his eventual arrest. In ""The Odyssey"", the sirens are directly in the path of Odysseus on his way home. They attempt to persuade him to follow them, but his crew strictly restrains him and they eventually pass through unharmed. Thirdly, both pieces contain a strong antagonist (Cyclops) who approaches the main characters kindly and quickly turn hostile. In O Brother Where Art Thou? this antagonist is represented by the one-eyed Big Dan. He kindly tells them that he is willing to sell them atonement for their sins through the bible, and turns hostile by physically assaulting them and killing their frog. In ""The Odyssey"", the antagonist is represented by the Cyclops who begins his part in the story as a hospitable creature, but later turns hostile when eating two of Odysseus' crew mates.<br/><br/>In addition to the meeting of the two Cyclops's, both pieces of work show the physical pain caused by the protagonist on the antagonist. In O Brother Where Art Thou? during the Ku Klux Klan meeting, big Dan is killed by Evrett when the flaming cross falls on him. In ""The Odyssey"", Odysseus blinds the Cyclops with a flaming spear during his imprisonment in the Cyclops' cave. Another similarity between the two pieces is the protagonist's wife's plan to remarry. In O Brother Where Art Thou? Evrett's wife, Penny plans on remarrying a suitor. In ""The Odyssey"", Odysseus' wife, Penelope plans on remarrying one of the many suitors occupying her home. Lastly, in both pieces, the main character enlists the help of his friends before the final, eventful scene. In O Brother Where Art Thou? Evrett promises loyalty and fair treatment to Pete and Delmar before entering the church and trying to stop the wedding. In ""The Odyssey"", Odysseus promises to treat the cowherd and swineherd as children if they aid him in his final battle with the suitors. In conclusion, the similarities between the two pieces of work prove the successful translation from ""The Odyssey"" to O Brother Where Art Thou? I am a total buttface"

","This depression era period piece is simply a delight. The music is wonderful; the fanciful, on the road story of lovable escaped convict country bumpkins, who pratfall their way through numerous scrapes invites hilarity; and the beautifully dove-tailed script by the Coen brothers is marvelous.<br/><br/>That script was nominated for the Oscar for Best Screenplay based on material from another medium for 2001, but didn't win. (Stephen Gaghan won for Traffic.) But never mind. The writing is just so clever and that is part of what makes this movie so much fun to watch.<br/><br/>That won't surprise viewers who are familiar with the work of Ethan and Joel Coen. Those guys are strikingly original talents who can write comedy and noir with the best of them as in, e.g., Raising Arizona (1987), Blood Simple (1984)--their first, and in some ways, their best--and of course Fargo (1996). Their work is characterized by irony, satirical intent, and sly plotting in which later events are foreshadowed by previous events. O, Brother, Where Art Thou? is especially replete with clever foreshadowing. Characters appear, as they are wont to do in road movies or epic wanderings, and then they are left behind as our heroes move on. Here however, the first appearance of a character is probably not the last appearance. When John Goodman first appears as a morally and ethnically-challenged Bible salesman who welds a mean stick, we may think he is gone, but (I'll keep this vague) when he reappears we are not surprised; in fact his reappearance is just right.<br/><br/>One of the highlights is George Clooney as Ulysses Everett McGill whose sweet-smelling Dapper Dan hair pomade plays a bit of a role in the plot. He is perfect as a slick-talking, hairnet-wearing country wordsmith who could charm the birds out of the trees. With the slicked-back hair and the thin moustache, he reminded me a bit of Clark Gable, which is only right since Gable was a thirties film star whose style was much imitated.<br/><br/>Clooney is supported by John Turturro, who has played in at least two other Coen and Coen movies that I have seen. He is one of those non-glamorous actors who is at the top of the profession. It may seem a bit of a casting stretch to play him as a Mississippi bumpkin, but he pulls it off. This is the same guy who was just perfect as a New York Jewish writer gone to Hollywood in Coen and Coen's Barton Fink (1991).<br/><br/>This is the first time I've seen Tim Blake Nelson, but he was also very good as the third country musketeer. As usual the alluring Holly Hunter gives a solid performance as Everett's estranged wife about to marry another man, the mother of his six daughters. But make no mistake about it, Clooney clearly steals the show, and I am surprised he wasn't nominated for Best Actor. He was really that good. (He did win a Golden Globe award.) And the music: country, bluegrass, hillbilly, gospel, traditional--and I know not what else--is really at the heart of the flick. When the ""Soggy Bottom Boys"" come on with their ""I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow"" it really brings the house down. The Coens know this, and so later in the movie when the boys appear on stage, looking a little like ZZTop on a budget, they reprise it to the delight of the Mississippi folk at a political rally and really get the joint to jumping--and of course it all figures in the plot. And how appropriate is that lyric for a depression era song: ""I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow""! See this for both the Coen Brothers who know how to have fun with a movie, and for George Clooney, who puts on a mighty good show.<br/><br/>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

"zetes","7","3","5","19 January 2001"," By Far the Worst Movie the Coen Brothers Have Ever Done
","Like many people, I first became associated with the Coen brothers through Fargo. They might have been the first filmmakers whose entire body of work I searched out and watched. And I liked every one of them. And then I was the first person in line to see their next film (their previous film now) The Big Lebowski. And that one just added to their shining reputation.<br/><br/>
And now, some three and a half or so years later, comes their next film, O Brother, Where Art Thou? It has all the marks of a Coen brothers' movie, but, for some reason, it doesn't work at all. <br/><br/>And I know why, or at least I think I do. What makes a Coen brothers' film distinct from a film of another director? Some would say quirkiness. This is certainly part of it. But people can copy quirkiness, and have. Take Being John Malkovich. It is possibly the quirkiest film ever made outside of the Coen universe. But no one would mistake it for a Coen brothers' film. Why is this? Well, in my opinion, which, of course, is informed, it is the Coen brothers' sense of perfection and meticulousness both in the technical aspects, the performances, and the script. Technically, O Brother is a match for any of their other films. The cinematography, mise-en-scene, sound and editing are great. <br/><br/>The script is the biggest problem. It is bad. Not that there aren't good ideas in there. In fact, any one of the episodes could have turned out to be hilarious. Possibly, its just that there are too many episodes. Therefore, each episode runs for approximately two minutes before it is over. Each episode comprises about one sequence, and each sequence is composed of about two or three scenes. Take a look at Miller's Crossing, for example, to compare. The pace is slow. O Brother is not a short movie, yet it feels that way. <br/><br/>And because of the sloppy script, there are no performances to speak of, really. I like any one of the actors on screen, but their characters, even the character of George Clooney, are all one dimensional. It isn't necessary to flesh out every character of a comedy, but I think some of the more colorful supporting characters should have had more screentime, more development. John Goodman should have had a more substantial part, for instance (although his Southern accent is not very good), and Charles Durning's part should have been better. In fact, the whole gubernatorial race part of the plot should have been more in focus. I would have based the plot more around it, rather than having it taking place in the corners. The way the Coens get rid of Durning's opponent is just bad.<br/><br/>
The only thing the film did get right is the music. The main song that the escapees sing is just marvelous. And all the other songs written by T. Bone Burnett are excellent, also. In fact, it would be a travesty if at least that main song didn't get nominated for an Oscar. It completely deserves it. I would have given the film an all-time Coen brothers low score of 4/10, 7/10 being the former low (The Hudsucker Proxy), but I have to give it at least one point for the music, so final score = 5/10."
"Movie-12","2","7","17","18 February 2001"," One of the worst movies released in a long time; pointless, and absolutely moronic. * (out of four).
","The Coen brothers are very gifted filmmakers. Considering some of my all time favorite movies, including ""Fargo,"" ""Blood Simple,"" and ""Raising Arizona,"" were products of their excessive capability of making good productions only contributes to the enormous disappointment of their latest effort, ""Oh Brother, Where Art Thau?"" It is as if they took several bad actors to play bad characters thrown in a bad script with bad dialogue and bad situations. Everything about this movie is bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. The movie is a complete waste of 106 minutes of your life. It makes sitting on the couch watching ""Survivor"" look good. I am sorry to say this but I may hold this one against the Coen brothers for some time to come.<br/><br/>""Oh Brother, Where Art Thau?"" is your standard road/buddy comedy, but missing comedy, laughs, insight, and interest. The story feels tedious, yawn-inducing, slow-moving and ridiculously stupid. It takes place in 1937, in Mississippi where three convicts escape from a pretty chain gang. They are Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney), Delmar (Time Blake Nelson), and Pete (John Turturro), who quickly find themselves discussing their dreams with a crazy blind seer. This man explains the three escapees must travel a long and difficult path before they find a treasure at the bottom of a lake in four days. Being the absolute idiots they are, Pete, McGill, and Delmar find themselves following the advice of this clearly eccentric drifter.<br/><br/>The three idiots are pursued by various other characters, including a local sheriff (Daniel Von Bargen) who's bound and determined to bring the criminals to justice, a young musician (Chris Thomas King) who sold his soul to the devil in exchange for musical abilities, George ""Baby Face"" Nelson (Michael Badalucco), a manic depressive bank robber with machine guns up the wazoo, Big Dan Teague (John Goodman), a deceptive one-eyed bible salesman, and incumbent Governor Pappy O'Daniel (Charles Durning) in a close campaign with Homer Stokes (Wayne DuVall), whose manager (Ray McKinnon) is married to McGill's ex-wife, Penny (Holly Hunter).<br/><br/>""Oh Brother, Where Art Thau?"" is a moronic shadow of ""Of Mice and Men,"" minus the legitimate plot and defined character intentions. This film contains the most annoying of characters; they are bland, boring, dual, dumb, negative-adjective inspiring. What is that you say? The movie's intentions were to induce laughs through the stupidity of the characters? Well, if that were the case I think I would have laughs, or even smiled at that. I found myself moaning and groaning in disgust and agony. Not a single character is the least bit intriguing. That is one of the biggest problems the movie makes, finding a character in which audiences can relate. Maybe if the characters were introduced or developed, or had the slightest interesting personality, then there may have been some involvement.albeit not much.<br/><br/>The dialogue is typical redneck blahblah, wooden and straightforward. There is little creativity or sharpness in the writing. The screenplay, by Joel and Ethan Coen, based on a poem by Homer, puts you right to sleep, especially in the scenes where the outlaws sit around campfires exchanging depressing, meaningless gibber jabber. The soundtrack is equally as painful, consisting of irritating old-fashion country music, and even some numbers sang by the characters themselves. Those scenes, dragged on way too long, are irrelevant to the story. All of these horrible qualities precede an ending that is not satisfying and inconclusive.<br/><br/>""Oh Brother, Where Art Thau?"" is just a really dumb movie; there is no other way to explain the quality. It is just really dumb. Not in a funny way. Not in a slapstick way. Not even in a bad movie sort of way. It is inexplicably dumb. Dumb. Dumb. Dumb. Oh, yeah, did I mention that this movie is dumb. Still considering going to see this junk? Fine, but do not say I didn't warn you."

Well, many years later, the Coen brothers have made a movie with that title, but true to the spirit of ""Sullivan's Travels,"" it turns out to be a comedy, not a preachy social tract.

You had two stupid characters(Pete and Delmar) and one intelligent character(Everett). Usually this could work but Pete and Delmar were so stupid it simply was not funny, it was like they only knew about 20 words and half the time it was just Everett talking and them looking back gormless. The only thing positive about the film was it had some catchy songs. I would not go out of my way to watch this film nor would i recommend it to anyone, if it's on TV and it's a Sunday and you can not find the remote then by all means watch it but otherwise its a big No."

I could even manage George Clooney under the sure hand of the Coens.<br/><br/>But this movie is AWFUL. NOT funny, except in about five (very short) places. Dull, dull, dull. Way too many drawn-out scenes with blues or bluegrass music playing over ""depression"" scenes, with absolutely nothing happening. About an hour into the movie, I was experiencing the worst feeling possible during a movie---I just wanted it to be over.<br/><br/>The completely pointless interaction with George Nelson (don't call him ""Babyface"") was a waste of Michael Badalucco's talents.

"smashattack","3","6","14","25 February 2002"," I guess it's an acquired humor.
","Frankly, I don't see how this movie has been given such a high rating on IMDb.  Maybe the people who have voted need to really watch it again and pay really close attention.<br/><br/>Especially to the lack of a plot and storyline.<br/><br/>Sure, the movie has a ton of subplots, which could be a good thing.  I'll give it that much.  However, the subplots lead nowhere and don't add up to anything.  The main plot is just as shallow, as only parts of it are revealed, hidden within the different and, to put it nicely, ""unique"" characters.<br/><br/>The characters are shallow and flat.  You know nothing about them except that they have run away (or R-U-N-O-F-T) from their prison.<br/><br/>Conflict.  Every movie and book has one.  Every great story has a conflict that leads up to a climax and resolution.  However, O Brother, Where Art Thou? lacks this trait and tends to rely on subplots, such as the Sirens and the Ku Klux Klan rather than staying with its central plot.  This gets really annoying twenty minutes within the film, when the viewer is left behind just like the three escaped convicts were left behind the train.<br/><br/>The movie is classified as comedy.  I found nothing funny about dragging people through a tedious, dim-witted movie without even living up to its own genre."

This movie had incredible humor, fantastic acting, a great plot with excellent foreshadowing (you'll have to watch the movie twice to appreciate this) and is a fun wild ride. Anyone who has read Homer's The Odyssey will also find extra humor, like turning the Cyclops into a one eyed Bible salesman. Fantastic.

I have now seen this movie well over a hundred times, and I still laugh every time I watch it, partly from memories of those Guard guys with their hysterical accents, and partly because it's just such a great movie.<br/><br/>It is not often that a comedy can be so smart, beautiful, and funny at the same time.

","I saw this film years ago, and afterwards I named it as my favorite film on several occasions. Then I forgot why. Now I saw it again and remember.<br/><br/>The plot is simple enough: Everett (wonderfully portrayed by Clooney), a handsome, vain man whose lines undoubtedly contain over 70% of the film's vocabulary, gets the two prisoners chained to him, Pete and Delmar, to join him in seeking a treasure he buried after an armored car robbery before a river is dammed and the valley in which he buried it flooded with water. Meanwhile they are chased by a cold-blooded Sheriff Cooley (at one point in the film subtly likened to Satan) and have to overcome various obstacles ranging from Pete supposedly being turned into a toad to being seduced by three blatant references to the sirens of the Odyssey. This all becomes amusingly tangled into the electoral campaigns of the two men running for governor, 'Pappy' O'Daniel the hotheaded old man who is striving for re-election and Homer Stokes, who is secretly a Ku Klux Klan leader.<br/><br/>There are few films that stand out to me as being 'perfect', ones where there is nothing I can nitpick on, but this is one of them. It is neither too long nor too short, the humour is golden, the characters are endearing, every scene would detract from the film if it weren't there, and the ending is very satisfying but not sappy. Wonderful film."

","To me, this is what the Coen brothers means. Not Fargo, which is a bit more subtle, but this wonderful parody of one of the most highly regarded historic writings. to take a legendary story and put it in a John Turturro format is not seen nearly enough. Clooney does comedy well, especially when eating corn whilst Delmar is beating repeatedly. Script, Setting, Story, Parody, Blasphemy, Ku Klux Klan, this is Coen brothers. even better than ""Bar,ton Fink!, Bar,ton Fink!"" And then there is the song. Man of Constant Sorrow, made me get the entire soundtrack, now it's not even my favourite song! all those chanted songs are surprisingly awesome. Coen's picked well. And the first thing you say to someone after they have been arrested and you meet up in a cinema so must whisper should always be ""We thought you was a toad.""

"kpbutler","10","2","3","5 June 2005"," Bizarre, yet highly entertaining
","Whether you like the Coen brothers or not, there can be no debating that they make extremely interesting movies that aren't by the book. There's no question that ""O Brother"" doesn't deviate from that formula. The film has many scenes that don't make a whole lot of sense to me, but I suppose if you've read the Odyssey (I have) and actually remember it (I don't) then you might comprehend it completely. The cast is solid, especially Clooney and Turturro. However, don't listen to Clooney when he tries to tell you he did his own singing, because he didn't. And it's obvious, because if that was him singing, he'd have had a few albums released. The film's strongest asset is its soundtrack, and I challenge anyone who views it to just try and not have ""I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow"" stuck in your head for days afterwards. All in all, ""O Brother"" is a lot of fun. Enjoy."
"nutriafritz","9","2","3","12 February 2005"," Most memorable movie experience!
","Like the rhapsodes who stitched together tales to form the Odyssey, the Coen brothers have brought together Homer, blues and bluegrass, George Clooney, and digital photography to create a modern-day epic-comedy. The first 12 minutes feature the memorable opening scene (which I understand uses the soundtrack from a real chain gang), the highly amusing song ""Big Rock Candy Mountain"" and the train scene which makes me laugh out loud every time I see it. In fact, this is all I saw the first time in the theater, due to a power outage. My husband and I received a voucher and couldn't wait to see the entire movie the next day -- based on only the first twelve minutes! I saw the movie in Louisiana, and ""You are my sunshine"" was written by our former Governor Jimmy Davis. I got a lump in my throat when the entire audience began singing ""You are my Sunshine."" O Brother is based on Homer's Odyssey, and it's a fun parlor game to see how many episodes from the Odyssey you can recognize (John Goodman playing the Cyclops is the most obvious). The one thing missing: they need a voodoo priestess to play the role of Circe to try and change the frog back into Pete! One word of warning (not a spoiler): There are two instances of animal brutality that are hard to watch (but it's obvious what's going to happen).<br/><br/>The DVD is a must-have... it shows how they took the verdant Mississippi countryside and digitally enhanced it to make it look like the dustbowl of the 1930s.<br/><br/>Film buffs will recognize tributes to Cool Hand Luke and the Wizard of Oz, among others. The Coen Brothers are geniuses.<br/><br/>Now you'll excuse me... I've got to R-U-N-N-O-F-T."

","I liked ""O Brother, where art thou?"" although I've never been a fan of the Coen brothers. It is a funny idea to transpose ""the odyssey"" by Homère in America during the Great Depression in the thirties. This movie is a rather successful parody of Homère's story. Here, for instance, the three women by the stream replaced the mermaids and Penny (George Clooney's former wife) is a derivative of Penelope. Moreover, John Goodman took the role of the cyclops. The Coen brothers also obviously aimed at parodying several episodes of the Bible, notably in the last sequence with the flood.<br/><br/>I also thought that the personality of the three main actors was very similar to Candide, the famous character created by the French writer Voltaire in the eighteenth century: they go through all kinds of adventure, either funny either dramatic in which they don't learn their lessons.<br/><br/>If the humor isn't always well used in a relevant way or sometimes in a clumsy way, a few sequences are particularly successful: the Ku-Klux-Klan one. The music is also judiciously chosen and lends itself perfectly to the setting of the era. It's the same thing for the costumes.<br/><br/>An original movie in which the directors don't think twice before laughing at their trio of actors. They're laughing at their credulity."

""Fargo,"" on the other hand, is continually held out as ""one of the great classics of all time,"" but I found it absolutely pointless and unfunny.  Both movies seem to rely on quirky characters, yet the quirkiness works well in this one - you care what happens to these yutzes.  The various story lines gel at the end, and you realize you've seen an adventure with all the classic elements of great storytelling - a beginning, a middle, and an end that justifies it all.  The music is appropriately ""old-timey"" and darn good (did someone here complain that it had no ""mainstream appeal""??

","O Brother where art thou? is one of my favorite movies, it has a story like none other. From the very beginning of the movie it catches your attention and never lets go, the movie does not have any ""slow periods"" where nothing seems to happen. The movie twists and turns and introduces small stories within the story, you will never be able to guess what happens next, unless you already have seen the movie. The characters all have their own well defined personality, and seems very vivid in the hands of the talented actors, many of the characters has small lines you remember long after you have seen the movie, such as ""I'm a Dapper dan man"", ""care for some gopher?"", ""Damn, were in a tight spot"" and ""she R-U-N-O-F-T"".<br/><br/>The movie is not a musical but it is ""song rich"". Throughout the movie songs appear, many sung by the main actors, and done so very well. Personally I think it boosts the movie making it more fun to watch.

","Alright, folks... here's your riddle of the day: Whaddaya get if you cross the Three Stooges with the Greek poet Homer?<br/><br/>""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" that's what!<br/><br/>Here is another superb comedy finely crafted by screenwriters /producers/ directors Joel and Ethan Coen. Starring George Clooney, Tim Blake Nelson, and John Turturro, it features a brilliantly written script, superb acting by a wonderful ensemble cast, and a musical score that's simply second to none. <br/><br/>""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" is a simple story really... set in the Mississippi delta region during the Great Depression, it's the tale of three petty criminals who escape from the chain gang in quest of buried treasure and experience a series of misadventures along the way. Ulysses Everett McGill (Clooney) is the silver-tongued, self-appointed leader of this odd trio, a man who claims to have stolen and buried over a million dollars in cash. Delmar O'Donnell is the docile, sweet-tempered dimwit (played to perfection by Tim Blake Nelson). The third member of our little gang is an irritable, acerbic fella named Pete. Together they set off, chained to each other, in search of McGill's treasure, which is buried somewhere about to become a man-made lake. Our heroes have only four days to find the loot before it's lost forever at the bottom of the newly created reservoir.<br/><br/>As they begin their journey, the run across an old blind seer who prophesies that they will find a fortune, but not the one they seek. with a posse of law enforcement officers and vigilantes hot on their heels, Everett, Pete and Delmar ditch their chains and prison garb and continue on their quest.<br/><br/>
Our trio's journey is anything but quiet and uneventful. They continually run into strange people and situations... At one point, soon after stealing a car and picking up a guitar-playing hitch-hiker, they stop at a local radio station and, posing as an ""old-timey"" music group called the ""Soggy Bottom Boys,"" they cut a record that's soon all the rage throughout the region. Later they encounter a Baptist congregation at river's edge, singing a beautiful song, lulling our heroes into sweet forgetfulness for a few brief moments. They happen upon three washer-women, also at river's edge, whose siren-like song ensnares our three miscreants... George Nelson, a bank robber on the run, who nearly co-opts our heroes into a REAL life of crime... the one-eyed, fast-talking Bible salesman Dan Teague (played by John Goodman) who offers Everett, Pete, and Delmar a hard lesson on economics and life in general in the Depression-ravaged Deep South... and other characters as well: Governor Pappy ""Pass the Biscuits"" O'Daniel, running for re-election against a reform-minded candidate named Homer Stokes... Everett's ex-wife Penny, soon to me re-married to a real drone named Vernon Waldrip... and a whole gang of fellas dressed in white sheets and hoods who take exception to our heroes' intrusion into their ceremonies.<br/><br/>One of ""O Brother, Where Art Thou's?"" greatest strengths is its musical score. As the Coen brothers point out, nary a scene goes by without some kind of music in the background. The songs - 19 of them by my count - are all wonderful. It's a sublime mixture of old-time gospel and country music and African-American spirituals. From James Carter and the Prisoners' ""Po' Lazarus,"" through Alison Krause's sweetly simple and reverent ""Down to the River to Pray"" (with brilliant harmonies added by the First Baptist Choir of White House, Tennessee); the old-time country classics ""I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow"" and ""Hard Rock Candy Mountain,"" and ""You Are My Sunshine;"" to the old-time Gospel classics ""Keep On the Sunny Side;"" ""I'll Fly Away"" and ""I Am Weary (Let Me Rest),"" (and many other songs as well), the music adds an extra dimension to this already multi-faceted film. (By the way, all these songs can be found on the ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" soundtrack compact disc... but that's another review!)<br/><br/>I've now watched ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" about a dozen times. Each viewing has been a genuine pleasure for me. This film is clever in its conception, extraordinary in its execution, sublime in its storytelling, and masterful in its music. In short... wonderfully entertaining in every respect. A definite ""must-see"" for movie-lovers everywhere!"

","SPOILERS right from the beginning i knew i would love this movie.  i was right. it was not exactly artistic, but it sure did have some of its components.  the symbolism in the movie was so beautiful. first the filtered colours added a nice, old-fashioned southern effect. when i was watching the movie i really tried to find any deep greens, blues and reds, but i really couldn't find any...they were all drained of their colour.  adding all these images like butterflies around delmar, sirens, incorporating all these characters of Homer's Odyssey in such a creative yet more realistic manner made the movie quite charming. umm..acting was quite good. george clooney did sound like a boisterous know-it-all, and i think it comes naturally to him. all in all i love this movie! the music was classic! 8.5/10"

","I have yet to see a Coen brothers movie I didn't like, but I can see how some of their work can be a little too esoteric for some (e.g. the wonderfully strange 'Barton Fink'). 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' however, is their most accessible and downright entertaining movie to date, and should appeal to a wide range of viewers. A typically eccentric Coen premise - Homer retold as a Depression musical comedy - it manages to be consistently funny and warm without losing any of their trademark quirks and wit. George Clooney steals the show with one of his  best performances (equal to 'Three Kings' in my opinion), and is wonderfully backed up by Coen regular John Turturro ('Do The Right Thing') and relative new comer Tim Blake Nelson. The three make a classic comedy team ala The Three Stooges. The rest of the first rate supporting cast includes many familiar faces from previous Coen films (John Goodman, Holly Hunter, etc) as well as the underrated Daniel von Bargen ('Lord Of Illusions, 'Desert Blue') and 'Wild At Heart' weirdo Frank Collison. This movie is a joy from start to finish. I loved it and would recommend it to anybody who is looking for a genuinely funny and clever comedy."

I felt pretty much the same way once I saw the actual film. Clooney is fun to watch, and the bits about his hair cream made me chuckle a few times, but, I'm sorry, I need more than hair cream jokes.

","Edit, August 2016: I just watched it again after 15 years and it is still a comedic masterpiece. Those Coen brothers sure know how to entertain.<br/><br/>**SPOILERS**Loosely based on Homer's Odyssey, where Ulysses attempts to return home to his wife, Penelope, and his children after the Trojan war, encountering the Cyclops, the Sirens, and other obstacles, finding tormentors who believed him dead and wanting to marry his wife.<br/><br/>In ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"", George Clooney plays Ulysses, Holly Hunter plays Penelope (Penny), John Goodman plays the Cyclops (patch over his eye), and three beautiful women washing clothes in the creek play the singing sirens. All-in-all a very well-done film, definitely a comedy, and interesting the way the Coens used the ""Odyssey"" as inspiration, even crediting Homer as a co-writer.<br/><br/>The film opens in almost black and white, slowly, gradually showing color, first with a light blue sky. The DVD ""extra"" showing the filming technique I found highly interesting. To achieve the ""look"", all film was scanned and digitized so that images could be properly manipulated. Most of the greens of grass and trees, for example, where made to look almost golden. The colors were de-saturated to give a light pastel rendering, but with normal contrast. Then, all digital images were transferred to film and copies made for theatrical showings.<br/><br/>SPOILERS -- Instead of the Trojan war, Ulysses and his men, Pete and Delmer, have just escaped from a depression-era rock-breaking chain gang in Mississippi. Although he was imprisoned for practicing law without a license, he tells the other two men he stole and hid $1.2million, and when they retrieved it they would split it 3 ways. Later he tells them, ""if I had told you the truth, you wouldn't have come with me"", and they were all chained together.<br/><br/>They get a ride with Babyface (""my name is George"") Nelson, and are beneficiaries of a bank robbery. They ""sing into the can"" for money, as the ""Foggy Bottom Boys"", and later it comes in handy as they get a pardon from the governor. During a picnic, Goodman a giant with a patch over one eye (Cyclops), steals their money. They foil a KKK lynching.<br/><br/>Ulysses finally makes his way back to his ""ancestral home"", finds Sheriff Cooley (Von Bargen) and his men digging 3 graves, nooses over the branch, when suddenly a great flood sweeps over them all (hydroelectric power), they save themselves holding onto a floating coffin, drives out his wife's tormentors (politician), and the films again fades to black and white, as Penny and Ulysses talk about getting re-married. She had divorced him, telling the children he had been hit by a train, ""Some very important people have been hit by trains.""<br/><br/>The DVD is really a superb visual treat, probably being made directly from the digitized images. The surround sound is selectable in either DTS or DD 5.1. I watched it with DTS and the sound is great. As I mentioned above, the extras are a fine addition. Many people will not like this movie. My wife only gave it 30 minutes.<br/><br/>On a personal note, it is nice to see Daniel Von Bargen (Cooley) fit and trim, since he had gotten a bit heavy in recent years. Our history goes back to 1969, where he and I were on stage (with a bunch of others) at Purdue for the 28-performance run of the student production of ""Leave It To Jane."""

","Just seen this film at an NFT preview, and I was blown away by it. It is very funny, gorgeous to look at, has a stunning soundtrack and absolutely impeccable comedy performances. Sharing a similar meandering storyline with the Big Lebowski, it succeed where that film fails by still having a coherent storyline running through and a satisfying resolution. As I've come to expect from the Coens, the visuals are striking but they've never been this beautiful before, and at no time - unlike - in previous films, do they seem merely to be there as an exercise in cleverness. But what makes this film is the excellent comic performances from even the smaller roles (several of whom are Coen regulars) - Even though the characters, as in many coen films, are (slightly irregular) stereotypes the performances give even the shallow characters a depth and makes the scenes even more funny. Oh, and the soundtrack ain't too bad either."

"usc-87342","9","1","1","30 November 2018"," A long Journey Home
","""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" Movie Review
by Brooke Dupree
Directors:
Joel Coen, Ethan Coen (uncredited)
Writers:
Homer (epic poem ""The Odyssey""), Ethan Coen
Stars:
George Clooney, John Turturro, Tim Blake Nelson, John Goodman, Holly Hunter<br/><br/>Anyone who has read Homer's Odyssey knows that Odysseus's journey is wracked with obstacles. Odysseus's internal battle with his ego and his desire to go home to his family is the inspiration for the Coen Brothers successful portrayal of the journey of Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney), and his two fellow escaped convicts in ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" (2000).<br/><br/>Everett's obsession with his hair and his know-it-all tendencies lead he and his two dimwitted jail mates, Pete (John Torturro) and Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson) as they search for a secret treasure through the deep south during the Great Depression. Just like in The Odyssey, they come across their fair share of hurdles, the ultimate of which being the Lawman, hot on their trail, which leads the audience through their ridiculous pitfalls, narrowly escaping the law, accompanying bank robbers, and losing one of their friends to the Sirens.<br/><br/>There are two ways one could view this film and be either disappointed or delighted. If the audience is expecting to follow a more modern story that closely relates to The Odyssey, she will be disappointed since the film is very loosely based on Homer's classic poem. However, if the expectation is to just find a story about three escaped convicts searching for treasure, then she will see some of the connections to The Odyssey, but appreciate the turn of events as its own story, somewhat from The Odyssey's characters and plot line. The obvious liberty that the Coen brothers took with depicting Homer's Odyssey does not veer completely off base; instead they offer the basic nuts and bolts of some of its most epic characters and scenes. Cyclops makes an appearance as a smooth-talking Bible salesman, played by John Goodman, and the Siren scene, is sexy and mesmerizing, as it should be. Since the Coen brothers left some of the most ultimate parts of the Odyssey in the film, we are able to make the connection, but view each scene as its own separate contribution to the journey of Everett himself.<br/><br/>Some of the most important characters from Homer's poem are missing, however, one of them especially, the character of Telemachus. Although we don't necessarily need his character to tell the whole story, his absence is felt by the necessary plot moving specifically towards Odysseus's journey, which is, in part, to get home to his son and wife, and helps to portray the time lost in Odysseus's absence. Without his presence in the movie, the audience may lose this detrimental part to the story. We are also missing the overall stakes. Throughout the film, the connection between Everett and his ultimate goal is lost. This could be because the focus on the possibility of losing his wife and daughters to another man (the suitors) is not very well established as the most important motive for Everett's escape from prison. The way Southerners are portrayed is also a bit problematic, in my opinion. Some of the characters are seen as being redneck hicks, dumb, and foolish. Although this portrayal is mostly done as a backwards humor, I think it is a mis-portrayal, since, the Coen brothers have admitted (per other film critiques) that they have never even been to Mississippi. That being said, I find it a little jarring that the South is chosen as a background to represent the foolishness and stupidity of some of The Odyssey's most famous players. I am biased, however, as I have lived in the south my entire life.<br/><br/>I think ""O Brother where Art Thou?"" was an attempt by the Coen brothers to remain true to the story of Odysseus's journey, but not stick to it as a form of storytelling. I believe it is successful as its own story, not as it relates to The Odyssey, but as it stands alone by itself. In other words, the characters and the scenes can be considered something completely different than The Odyssey, as more of a journey to ""get the girl"" and find religion, since from the beginning, Everett argues with his cohorts about religious validity. And speaking of religion, the film seems to be using religion, or Everett's question of it, as a way to question the difference between right and wrong and the basic human struggle to stay on the right path, resist temptation. As Everett continues his quest to get home, he begins to ""suffer"" and asks God for mercy.<br/><br/>I would compare this movie to a ""road trip"" film such as ""Smokey and The Bandit,"" a rendition of which is complete with southern sass and culture, bluegrass and country singing, and travelers who are constantly evading the law, without a heavy influence on the ultimate objective of the journey itself. ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" may not be lacking in humor and good ole southern religion, but its attempt to stay true to the Original Odyssey is, in effect, not going to make it home."

","A wonderful cast and I admit that even I didn't ""get"" all of the characters, but I will try, so here goes: The renegade sheriff is the ""Devil"". John Goodman is the ""Cyclops"" Charles Dunning is ""Zeus"". The 3 ""amorous"" ladies by the water are the ""Sirens"" George Clooney is ""Ulysses"" and Holly Hunter is his wife. The blind man is the ""soothsayer"". I am not sure what character ""Baby-Face"" Nelson represents, but he is ""plum-crazy"". Surprisingly little (if any) ""cussing"" and muted violence even in the KKK cross-burning scene. Suprisingly complex dialog for George, The Governor, and John Goodman's characters. Based on the actual political career and campaign by a Southern governor seeking re-election during the Great Depression. The Coen Brothers Masterpiece? I believe so. Authentic and honest ""Hillbilly period"" music. Violent but rather tongue-in-cheek like the ""Butch Cassidy"" movie. It may be a bit slow for some impatient viewers.

"NateWatchesCoolMovies","10","1","1","21 November 2015"," A bona fide Classic and a sensory experience all its own
","The Coen Brother's O Brother Where Art Thou is just a rush of pure originality, musical genius and inspired storytelling, situated outside the box of used conventions, and rooted deeply in a whimsical realm of absurd, charming characters on an epic odyssey across the American south during arguably the most eccentric time period, the 1930s Great Depression. It's the Coen's second best for me (it's hard to top the Lebowski, dude), and a film that I watched so many time growing up that it's almost now a piece of my soul. It's loosely based on Homer's The Odyssey. Three bumbling convicts escape from a dusty chain gang in a delightful opening romp set to Harry McClintock's The Big Rock Candy Mountain. Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney) is their silver tongued, trouble making leader, on his way to reunite with his estranged wife (Holly Hunter, reliably stubborn and sassy) and little daughters. Along with him is short tempered Pete (Coen regular John Turturro in top form) and sweet, dimwitted Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson). Together they get in just about every kind of trouble that you can imagine three hapless convicts on the run in depression era south getting into. They briefly share paths with musician Tommy (Chris Thomas King), cross the radar of a boisterous bible salesman (John Goodman, stealing scenes as usual with his effortless, booming charm), become involved with duelling governor candidates Homer Stokes and Pappy O Daniels (Wayne Duvall and Charles Durning), and have run ins with sexy sirens led by Musetta Vander, the KKK, notorious mobster George Babyface Nelson (Michael Badalucco has to be seen to be believed as the lively, likely bi polar suffering wise guy) and more, all the while pursued by mysterious Sheriff Cooley (Daniel Von Bargen, RIP). It's quite al lot of goings on for one film, but the Coens are masters of telling zany, eclectic stories that deviate into all sorts of unexpected subplots without ever derailing and losing us. This one flows along wondrously, a wild, funny and haunting fable that almost feels like a dust bowl Dante's Inferno at times, albeit of much lighter subject matter. Roger Deakins spins poetry with his lens, capturing every chaff of wheat, every ray of southern sun and brown hued set design with painstaking expertise. What really holds it together though, is the absolute knockout soundtrack. There's so many moments of now iconic musical storytelling that we feel we're watching a strange bluegrass lullaby that just happens to take place in cinematic vision. The Coens have always known their music, but they transcend to another level of intuition here, gathering an incredibly evocative group of songs and artists together that stir the collective ancestral memory of historical Americana. Off the top of my head there's You Are My Sunshine, Keep On The Sunny Side, I'll Fly Away beautifully warbled by the Kossoy Sisters, Didn't Leave Nobody But The Babe sung by the slinky sirens, In The Highways by the adorable Peasall sisters, Jimmie Rodgers's In The Jailhouse Now, Lonesome Valley, Ralph Stanley's two eerie pieces O Death, and Angel Band, also by the Peasall Gals, and the classic Down To The River To Pray, which sneaks up on you and leaves you in rapture from its inescapable grip. My favourite by far though is I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow, an endlessly catchy hobo tune of jangling melancholy and highway humour, sung by John Hartford but cheekily lip synced by Clooney and team, an original piece made up on the fly by the three characters that goes on to make them ridiculously famous under the pseudonym the 'Soggy Bottom Boys'. It's all an intoxicating wonder to take in, the period authentic screenplay and production a feast for the senses. The Coens seem to be adept at whatever they try; sly satire, period piece, stinging violence, dark humour, and even touching drama when they put their minds to it. This is a career high for them, a totally unique piece of art that demands multiple viewings and a spot in any avid movie collectors pantheon."
"serafinogm","10","1","1","9 October 2015"," Brilliant adaptation of Homer's epic poem the Odyssey!
","Another thoroughly enjoyable Coen offering. The Coen's have become, as an Italian might put it ""master del loro mestiere"" (Master's of their craft). In the Coen adaptation of Homer's epic, Clooney's character, Ulysuss Evert McGee, faces the same obstacles as Homer's hero Odysseus encountered in an effort to return to his wife and children (Evert's goal as well)! The cyclops, the prophet, the sirens, captivity, suitors for his wife's affections, Charybdis (more or less all the parallels are there) and are all interwoven in this compelling, amusing, and must see film! Kudos to the Coen's and their cast! By the way the music ain't bad either! You won't regret spending roughly 110 minutes of your life I predict 'enjoying' this film! If you do regret the time spent then you and I are entirely different animals!"
"sharky_55","9","1","1","17 August 2015"," Hot damn! It's the Soggy Bottom Boys!
","O Brother Where Art Thou is a magical retelling of Homer's Odyssey weaved through rural Mississippi during the great depression. The Coens draw us into the setting with ease; times of economic desperation, growth of chain stores (and stay out of Woolsworths!), the rise and spread of music through radio, populist politicians appealing through sweeping campaigns and folksy country western music, racial tensions behind public image...There's also the reference's to the Greek myth that blend seamlessly with the period piece: a boisterous and large man as Polyphemus (John Goodman), three haunting and mesmerising girls bathing by the river as the Sirens, a prophetic blind old man as Tiresias...The film blends this narrative with its setting so well, at times almost dream like in its atmosphere - take the soul-stirring choral rendition of Down to the River to Pray by a mass of baptismees, as the camera gracefully unveils the progression heading to down the river and Everett and Delmar's conversation about gophers comes to a standstill in amazement. <br/><br/>Confronted with a lush green Mississippi upon principal photography, the Coens enlisted long time collaborator Roger Deakins to oversee a ground-breaking digital colour correction process that saw the fields of green turned into a dry and dusty rural canvas. The browns of the sepia tone seep into the frame and enhance the already dirty and ragged look of our trio of escapees (mistakenly identified as coloured after days of weary grimy travel by the KKK). Whenever you get the chance, make sure you watch the correct version with this post production process in it, otherwise be treated with garishly jarring green fields in the background. And of course the boys hauling the blocks of dripping ice across the fields becomes a less immersive image.<br/><br/>George Clooney plays the leading man Ulysses Everett McGill, full of charm and suaveness. Twice he wakes up from his slumber to worries of his perfect hair being ruined (I'm a Dapper Dan man!), and despite his overall easiness and wisdom he still exhibits some peculiar insecurities or emotional tangents, but his best lines come from his exasperation or cheerful sardonic quips (Well, ain't this place a geographical oddity. Two weeks from everywhere! and Baptism! You two are just dumber than a bag of hammers!). The second smartest of the three is Pete Hogwallop, despite his name possessing heart, with Turturro hitting a wide range of notes including the absurd (Do. Not. Seek. The. Treasure) and over-the-top humour (I'm gonna kill you, Judas Iscariot Hogwallop!). The funniest is Delmar, played with such heart and good intentions by Tim Blake Nelson, always curious but naive (We thought you was a toad!). There's a sort of gullible and lovable idiocy about Delmar that can only be displayed by Nelson and that big smile, whether it's the grand sweeping gesture as he indicates that the water is indeed fine, or the sympathy he shows for the livestock. Delmar is the glue that holds the group together (Okay, I'm with you fellas). If you haven't already figured out, OBWAT is endlessly quotable. <br/><br/>They're joined by a varied host of colourful and memorable characters, like the humble Tommy, a black guitarist who sold his soul to the devil for his wicked talent, the well rounded and grinning Nelson, feared through the state for his machine gun and babyface (but don't say that in front of him), the well endowed Pappy O'Daniel and his escort, irate but a politician through and through, and the reform candidate Homer Stokes, well mannered and good natured but possessing seedier ideals underneath. He's revealed as the Imperial Wizard of the KKK at a nightime rally, the mass choreography and the fiery chants managing to look ominous and over-the-top ridiculous at the same time. <br/><br/>But what would OBWAT be without it's immensely successful and award winning soundtrack, that perfectly sets the mood for the southern Depression-era tale? It features a impressive cast of country, bluegrass and folk musicians: Emmylou Harris, Alison Krauss, Norman Blake, Ralph Stanley and of course the jaunty and effortless voice of Dan Tyminski on the iconic Man of Constant Sorrow. That and many of the rustic two and three part harmonies blend so easily in the story world and with those warm accompaniments of guitar, mandolins and banjos. Who didn't cheer when Delmar and and Pete launching straight into the harmonious intro in that hall? Its musical romp is simply infectious. <br/><br/>As the radio station manager says, it's some mighty fine a-pickin' and a-singin."

Then add the off-the-charts performances of so many top-notch actors starting of course with George Clooney (who puts in a bravura performance that brings to mind the brilliance of a Cary Grant), John Turturro (who was never better and never more endearing, stealing many scenes in fact as the backwoods Pete Hogwallop), and Tim Blake Nelson as the lovable but terminally dumb Delmar O'Donnell...but then there are the exceptional performances of so many great character actors it's almost impossible to give everyone credit.

You have to see this film just to see the incredible job Goodman does here (one of his best roles ever)! Even vignette-player and fine character actor Stephen Root impresses as a blind radio station guy - what an imagination! He creates one of the most memorable comic characters you'll ever see in a movie. He leaves an indelible impression, one of the highest points of a film with many high points. He will have you in stitches. I'm not a fan of Holly Hunter usually, but here even she puts in a brilliant performance as Clooney's quirky and quixotic wife. Ray McKinnon as Vernon T. Waldrip and Frank Collison as Wash Hogwallop - both bit parts - shine brightly as well. The music's incredible too - I had to buy both the DVD of the movie and the CD of the score, the music was so endearing. This movie sizzles on every level and the cast and crew all were on the top energy level in synch and with a chemistry rarely seen in film. Can't top this. (And, by the way - if you like this film, by the way - try to see Preston Sturges' great classic, Sullivan's Travels, upon which this movie was in part based.)"

","I must say at the outset that I am a TOTAL Coen Brothers fan and have seen ALL of their projects. This ranks right up there as one of their crowning achievements.<br/><br/>This is a re-telling of the ""Odyssey"" by Homer and after viewing this, I finally got a handle on just what the ""Odyssey"" was about. In a nutshell, it follows the exploits of a man and the exotic characters he meets along his journey. The way the Coen Brothers personified such stalwart literary characters as the Cyclops (John Goodman) and the Furies is most creative.<br/><br/>Excellent performances all around from the likes of George Clooney (in one of his most endearing roles), the incomparable John Goodman, Holly Hunter, John Turturo, Charles Durning and a wonderfully strong supporting cast.<br/><br/>However, one cannot mention the merits of this movie without a mention of the soundtrack. It is most obvious that the Coen Brothers invested an enormous amount of research to make sure that the music adequately accompanied the mood and tone. A wonderfully indelible example is the use of an acapella song (that utilizes no words, only moans) still used in African-American churches that is beautifully realized.<br/><br/>The music in this project is positively spellbinding, regardless of your particular musical preferences - there is something here for everybody. The soundtrack deserved the kudos it received.<br/><br/>This one you will enjoy over and over and over again!!!! Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeexcellent!"

","OK. I completely love the Coen Brothers. They can do no wrong. They are the scoundrel analysts of the human soul. The world is not to be taken too seriously and they know it. And they can persuade actors to be as great as they can be. But they don't make funny ha-ha movies. You will cry as much as you laugh. From the deep empathy they show to every creation. And all of this this happens in Oh Brother. George Clooney who already has that glint in his eye that a leading man needs is now granted humility and desperation. Which his jail suit complements perfectly. Are there not at least ten 'characters' in this movie you will never forget? People you will see on the streets from now onwards. But you never knew they existed before these geniuses pointed them out to you. Hail Coen Brothers."

","I am a surviving member of a family who remembers these characters breezing through our little town back in '31. We hung those boys but I guess this is a good Hollyweird take on that situation. Love George Clooney. He reminded us of a Gable or a Flynn type. Both had relations with our girls. We disowned all! Here is my niece Ethel and her story.<br/><br/>We lived through the depression and related to some of the conditions portrayed. We have watched it perhaps a dozen times. Each time we see it we pick up on something we had missed because we were still laughing at, or discussing, an earlier scene or line. The entire film was a collection of photographically great faces. We are still asking ourselves whether the entire cast were professionals or whether some were individuals found on location. The film was rich with subtle tie-ins like the children tied together with twine, as the prisoners were connected by chains. We still think the cow may have been hit unintentionally. Fords of that era had mechanical brakes. The driver of the car may not have been accustomed the longer stopping distances required. The many allusions to Ulysses Odyssey inspired us to do an inter-net search. We found a modern text version and discovered more sly references. We appreciate blue grass and country music as originally American and found it thoroughly enjoyable, along with the authentic ""Go To Sleep Little Baby"" and ""Down from the Mountain."" We were emotionally touched by this film because of our age, and find it totally entertaining every time we view it. We are still amazed that someone not of our generation could have captured the essence of that period of United States history.<br/><br/>My niece is mentally unstable and you should not take her seriously. These characters really existed and some still live. They are still interested in larceny, etc. so you should beware! We remember the Baptismals in the river ceremonies. Get Baptized!!!

","Those Coen brothers' movies really do grown on you. I had just seen Fargo when I rented this. It is one of the most creative, off the wall films I have ever seen. As these characters bumble their ways after a prison break, they are embraced by a series of the most unconventional personages ever to hit filmdom. And one gets turned into a frog--sort of. their flirtations with fame, the Klan, a cyclops, and all the other episodes, make this a hilarious romp. George Clooney's Ulysses is an obsessive, full speed ahead, damn the torpedoes, coupled with the charming half-wittedness of his fellow travelers, works at every level. Like Greek poetry, he is butting heads with the gods, but despite setbacks, keeps moving. It is story telling with charm and a load of bull. Everyone is some kind of philosopher, but the words come out of gap toothed, shaved headed hillbillies. And, of course, Clooney has hell to pay. I could watch this over and over again. And then there's the really cool music. I didn't even mention that!"

","Being a true Southerner(NC)and having parents that grew up in that era, it is a treat to see how close the Coens come to getting it right. Granted there is some stereotyping and bias, but only a person that has a true feeling of the times can appreciate it. One thing that I loved that at times, color was the least of the problems that the boys faced. Times were tough and it made people hard, but still they could find joy in simple things. The music flows beautifully and is integrated into the story so well. George Clooney proved that he could act, and Tim Blake Nelson stole the show with his simplicity. John Turturro was funny and the rest of the cast proved up to the challenge of being Southern."
"Wulfstan10","9","1","1","8 March 2005"," Superbly Entertaining
","This is absolutely one of the most fun and entertaining films I have ever seen, easily ranking up there with the Adventures of Baron Munchausen.<br/><br/>Somewhat like Terry Gilliam and his cohorts, the Coen brothers have a knack for creating a wacky story with colorful, odd-ball characters and odd events in a surreal manner that is utterly compelling and convincing. They achieved all of that in this film, providing a surreal and very fun take on a stereotypical movie-land version of the South combined with many ideas and characters certainly based on the Odyssey and Aeneid. Although they supposedly claimed never to have ""read"" the Odyssey, and some have criticized this film as incorrectly claiming to be inspired by the Odyssey, it is quite clear that that inspiration is there. Numerous characters and events are clearly taken from the myths of Odysseus (and, in fact, Aeneas), but they are simply dressed up in a wacky Southern guise. The events may not happen ""exactly"" as they did in the Odyssey, etc., but that is irrelevant. The fact remains that the parallels are undeniably there and that everything in the film works beautifully. <br/><br/>The cinematography, visuals in general, soundtrack, and the acting are all excellent. The result is, in my book, certainly one of the Coen brothers' best achievements, although not quite the equal of The Hudsucker Proxy, which is simply incredible. It is possibly their most fun move ever."

","This movie really had it all - meaning, humor, great acting, wonderful writing. I was very impressed with the quality of the direction and the screenplay, both of which brought out a uniquely adapted ""Odyssey"". The film's cinematography captures the essence of the '30s, and, contrary to its slapstick front, makes some very important points about US history, social circles, and cultural heritage. O Brother, Where Art Thou is one of the 15 movies I own simply because of how effective I found it. Watching it reminds me of the first time I saw Gladiator and the way I questioned my world-view, seeing deeper meaning to the mundane things around me. In Gladiator, the mundane was represented by the feel of wheat shafts on one's palm vividly represented in Russell Crowe's dreams of his home; in this film, the simple landscape that forms each scene brings to mind how important it is to just stop and appreciate the little things."

","When this movie came out, I read an article that said that the plot was based on the ""Odyssey"" by Homer.  They were probably right, it is like the hick version of the timeless classic.  In a couple years, when material is short, they'll probably do the same for the ""Illiad"".  But seriously folks, just because it's hick doesn't mean it isn't great.  The characters are funny, the situations are funny, (especially when they knock the burning cross on the KKK members)The music is pretty good too.  When it came out, I really liked that ""I am a man of constant sorrow"" song.  It you want a funny, definitely a time piece and something from the south then this is perfect."

George Clooney(Ulysses Everett McGill) along with John Turturro(Pete) gave excellent drama and comedy with their great acting skills.  However, John Goodman(Big Dan Teague) with a one-eyed patch and a suppose to be ""Bible Salesman"" gave some good punches to Ulysses over a picnic lunch.   Charles Durning (Gov.

His perfect Hollywood face, dirty as it was, still seemed out-of-place among the 'real people' cast. He delivered a much better performance than I was expecting of him, though. He just stuck out from the rest of the actors. Maybe that was the point in casting him; I don't know.<br/><br/>Doesn't hurt that I also loved the music (no, that's NOT grammatically correct. I know).

","** SPOILER ALERT ** Do not read this review unless you have already seen the film, AND don't read this if you haven't seen any other Coen Brothers film.<br/><br/>
""O Brother Where Art There?"" proves what the Coen's can do. Resourceful to an extreme, this probable homage to Preston Sturges's ""Sullivans Travels"" is a pure delight. The film IS of ""Best Picture"" quality but I knew it hadn't a prayer. Instead of listing the film's strengths, which many others have done, let me mention a couple of pet peeves. Before I go further let me also say I'd rate ""O Brother"" a solid nine on a scale of ten. I am going to bash a Coen Brothers trend rather than<br/><br/>detail the brilliance of the film point by point. The two complaints:<br/><br/>1) WHEN is a mainstream film set in the American south not going to be stereotyped? When will characters in such films not be presented as buffoons and imbued with ignorance? Sadly, never. That's my opinion. Because the film was rated PG-13, the KKK needed to be humiliated, and I salute the gesture. It's a good scene which could have and should have been much better than it was. Why did the Coens force Wayne Duvall (candidate Homer Stokes) to give a hate speech at the Klan gathering? His presence there is enough, why must he speak of ""Darkies,"" (nice truckle to political correctness, Joel and Ethan) ""Jews,"" (ditto) ""Papists"" (many non-Catholics won't know what 'Papist' means, good scheme) ""and all those smart-assed folks who say we come descended from monkeys."" A lessening of rancor, may the saints be praised. Until, ""So tonight, we're going to hang us a Negro!"" Nice touch, change ""lynch"" to ""hang"" and the big N to ""Negro."" Everybody knows that the Klan always used the word ""Negro."" Disingenuous and lends credence to a few things I have heard but will not repeat here. Fellas, this is supposed to be a comedy! Stick to ""R"" rated films, you are better with them anyway. <br/><br/>2) This is in a strange way more bothersome than the above, or perhaps my ears are oversensitive. Most Coen brothers films have at least one character scream at the top of his or her (usually his) lungs, often for no apparent reason. Here are Coen films which contain screams, the likes of which may burst an eardrum: ""O Brother Where Art There,"" ""Barton Fink,"" ""Fargo"" (to a lesser degree), ""Raising Arizona,"" and the worst of all (although I love the film,) ""Millers Crossing."" (Remember the scene near the end, the brutal one? The character named Drop Johnson puts out a series of fire alarm level screams but with a simple facial gesture, omnipotent Gabriel Byrne shuts the guy up. This scene is unbearable and I hit the mute button until the screaming stops).<br/><br/>On the other hand, most great directors had not merely mean streaks but outright cruel ones. John Ford, Hitchcock, Billy Wilder, William Wyler, I could go on for a while, I think you get my drift. It seems as though Joel and Ethan want to continue the great tradition. Maybe that's just the way it is. A couple more ""O Brother's"" and the Oscars will start pouring in and the power of the very talented duo will grow--exponentially. The Coen Brother's are America's best movie making team and I hope that they keep it up!<br/><br/>For the most part, these are minor complaints. Back to ""O Brother.""

The visuals and soundtrack were entirely too much fun, and 100% unique to the era that this movie was released into.<br/><br/>What else could we expect from the Coen brothers, who have been creating completely original visions since the mid-1980's?  The story is a wonderful spin on Homer's ""The Odyssey,"" and cribs several characters and events from the ancient tale.  If there were any complaint about this film at all, it would be the (few) liberties it takes with the poet's tale, but it still makes for an epic film, the kind of loopiness that was missing from ""The Newton Boys"" (remember that one?), or certain modern day remakes of classic stories.<br/><br/>A 10/10 on this one-- sheer mindless, random fun, but still grounded in reality... exactly as Homer would have dictated it."

Maybe even the crown-jewel of my shrine.<br/><br/>Just taste the essential idea of it: A travesty of Homer's Ulysses located in the hot south of the United States, that takes place at the beginning of the 20th century - surely this must stimulate your curiosity, mustn't it? Three prisoners escape their captivity, together (they have to, as they happen to be linked together by their balls and chains) aiming to find the golden loot from a robbery .

One can't but surrender. After have watched the movie on early night show I seriously contemplated to stay and watch the late night show as well.

I just don't have the sophistication or film school training to appreciate the cinematography or makeup or score if the plot is bad.<br/><br/>But I was really dazzled by ""O Brother, Where Art Thou"", which comes with a big dose of arty, but it's not overwhelming. Rather, it's accessible, with a fast, intellectual plot, lots of comedy, and lots of wonderful bluegrass music.<br/><br/>What a wonderfully original film. And unlike many musicals, where the characters just say, ""Oh, I think I'll break into song now,"" there are real plot reasons for the singing to occur everywhere. If you are familiar with Homer's ""The Odyssey"", there are some in-jokes as well. There are a number of wonderfully clever plot gimmicks, too such as the ending.<br/><br/>My only concern would be that bluegrass music is sometimes so religious it's overkill... but that's just the culture and the music is great. I immediately went out to rent some other Coen brothers films, and with the exception of Miller's Crossing wasn't that impressed with the others.<br/><br/>Who should see this film:<br/><br/>-- Everyone<br/><br/>I'll give this film a 10 out of 10."

Three convicts escape a chain gang in the deep south and pursue a hallowed treasure with the intention of splitting it three ways. However, the treasure turns out to be bogus and the three men end up discovering hidden musical talents which win them a repreive. The three men go on a journey which allows the spectator to view the idiosyncracies of life through the eyes of three idiots, covering everything from politics through racism to love.<br/><br/>A dramatisation of Homers 'Odysey,' O'Brother renders a time and space with such poignancy that you feel as if you are viewing the film through the same sandy gauze as all that romantic frontier photography.

","Since I loved ""The Big Lebowski"" so much I felt the urge to buy this movie as well, and it might not be as great as ""Big Lebowski"", but it sure is great! The Coen brothers just make excellent movies!<br/><br/>George Clooney delivers a load of funny lines throughout the movie, and can't seem to stay serious for 5 seconds. John Torturro and Tim Blake Nelson aren't quite as funny tho, its basicly up to Clooney and the characters they meet to keep the comedy feel up. But the scene where Nelson discovers the toad is just a killer! <br/><br/>On their journey to stop a marriage they encounter many strange people, and lots of other stuff. Klu Klux Klan for example... Or George (Baby Face) Nelson. John Goodman also plays a role here, but he's not that funny, compared to his role in ""Big Lebowski"", but its always fun seeing Goodman around!<br/><br/>The soundtrack, as with all other Coen movies, is great!

","I don't follow the  same school of thought of some people when it comes to the Cohen brothers .....that everything they do is brilliant even when it's poor brilliance.  They are hit-and-miss just as everyone else in Hollywood. This is without a doubt a ""hit"". A simple story that is filmed beautifully and skillfully acted .George Clooney is excellent... and I  have disliked him in everything he has done until now. The role was tailor-made for him. I saw a lot of reviews knocking his southern accent  even though Clooney is the ONLY southern born Soggy Bottom Boy! Delmar and Pete's  accents are stereo-typed southern accents and not really on the money ..... Clooneys use of a pseudo-regal southern accent was on the mark and fit the character perfectly.

Seeing Blood Simple for the first time and knowing who the Coens are and what they had to go through to get into the movie industry was an education in how talent can overcome political connections in the movie industry. I didn't think they could top The Big Lebowski so I didn't see O Brother, Where art thou? until now. In fact I have to admit that O brother now is the best movie ever made. In fact they don't even make movies they make works of art.

","The Coen Brothers do it again!  This is their best movie since Raising Arizona!  This movie was based on the tale of Homer's The Oddessy, in a 1930's setting in the Deep South.  Three bumbling and inept convicts escape from a chain gang to find a treasure.  They get into a lot of mishaps, and they meet a variety of characters who bare resemblence to the characters from the original Oddessy.  (i.e. the singing whores were supposed to be The Sirens.)<br/><br/>  George Clooney gives an outstanding performance as Ulysess.  George Clooney is great in whatever movies he makes, which is probably why he has captivated so many fans (like me) since his role as Dr. Ross on ER.  O Brother Where Art Thou is a heart-touching, riveting, and uplifting movie. It's one of those movies you can watch over and over again.  I give it 4 stars!"
"Twillhead","10","1","1","2 February 2002"," The Coen Brothers Triumph Again!
","'O Brother, Where Art Thou' is a gleeful retelling of Homer's 'Odyssey', set in 1930s Mississippi and rampant with splendid quirkiness that is the trademark of the brothers Coen. Three hapless convicts make their escape to find treasure--and more than their share of adventure--in this delightful film. George Clooney is in fine, ingenuous form as the chatty, amiable leader of the trio; but the real acting kudos go to John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson as his goofy but lovable cohorts, dubbed the 'Soggy Bottom Boys' by Clooney's character after they receive baptism by full immersion in a river. The three cut a record under that homespun nom-de-plume for the cash, and unwittingly become overnight sensations with veritable 'rock star' status. The film is accompanied by enough music and songs to almost qualify it as a musical. And there are some incredible feats of film-making here: the scene at the KKK rally is a real doozy, and is so similar to the scene when Dorothy's friends rescue her from the witch's castle in 'The Wizard of Oz' that it almost amounts to cinematic plagiarism. And what an amazing work of plagiarism it is! Without giving away the ending, I must say the climax of the movie is one of the most breathtaking sequences put to film in recent memory (on a par with the spectacular finale of 'Magnolia', another one of my favorites). 'O Brother' is a must-see, a perfect 10!"

So much, from the mustache to the cadence and tone of his speech, had Gable all over it. Watch ""It Happened One Night"" and you will see what has to have been Clooney's inspiration.<br/><br/>Having seen Clooney in so many other roles, and never like this, means this had to be an intentional impersonation. It actually fits with the story -- many a fellow in 1937 would no doubt, from pomade to manner of speaking, have liked to emulate Gable, the consummate leading man of the day.<br/><br/>I have searched through many reviews and comments on this film and have been surprised not to see this mentioned."

Then I wanted to see it again, and now I'm up to double digits with this great movie, the Coen brothers' finest movie they've ever done, with Fargo and Hudsucker Proxy coming in a tight second and third for me.<br/><br/>George Clooney gives the performance of his career playing Ulysses Everett McGee, a fast-talking know-it-all escaped convict who really doesn't know that much at all. Tim Blake Nelson and John Turturro are the perfect sidekicks for Clooney, particularly Nelson and his portrayal of Delmar, a loyal albeit uneducated fellow escapee. John Goodman is my favorite bit character as Big Dan, perfect. It reminds me of his part in Raising Arizona, he's just a perfect actor for this role. Coen brothers' favorites Holly Hunter and Charles Durning also provide memorable performances. <br/><br/>
Joel and Ethan Coen are masters of their trade. It's not like they try to win Academy Awards every time they make a film, they just try and tell a story that they want to tell, and it's entertaining. It's a loose adaptation of the Odyssey, and I mean loose for all of you Homer fanatics. It's just great.<br/><br/>The most amazing part of this movie though is the coloring. I've watched how they got the dusty feel to the movie and I am still in awe just thinking about it. The coloring does become an important part of the movie. Great great movie."

","The Coen brothers deliver a spectacular soundtrack accompanied by a film which is truly beautiful to look at but nearly impossible to watch.  It's a series of very much unrelated episodes--some scenes which would stand on their own as short experimental films, but taken as a whole produce no more than a hodgepodge of self-conscious exercises in cinematic technique.  The soundtrack deserves its monumental success, but the film was fortunate to do lukewarm business at the box office."

Oh well, at least I had the good sense to catch up with it on my local pay-per-view cable channel about a month ago. I can honestly say that I've only been surprised by a movie a few times, and this is one of those times. I saw George Clooney in ""The Perfect Storm"", and thought he did a very good job in that film, but I wasn't prepared for what ""O Brother"" had in store! I've seen ""Raising Arizona"" and ""Fargo"", and am definitely a Coen fan, but OBWAT is in a league ALL BY ITSELF. It's spirit is simple and poetic, its actors are dead-on, its screenplay is virtually flawless, its cinematography gorgeous, and its soundtrack is one that with have you humming/singing/whistling for a long time after. ""Surreal"" is a word that comes to mind to describe many of the scenes. The escapees are 3 of the funniest characters you'll ever meet on film; Charles Durning as Gov. Pappy Lee O'Daniel makes me laugh just thinking about his portrayal, along with his ""advisors"" and his rotund son, Junior; and all of the other supporting characters make for a superb collection of contributors to this rare jewel. I replay my tape of it to the auditorium scene over and over, just to savor the exuberant return of ""The Soggy Bottom Boys"". If you haven't seen OBWAT, you're missing a treat. 10/10"
"mattymatt4ever","7","1","1","13 July 2001"," Entertaining
","I can't say I enjoyed this as much as ""The Big Lebowski"" or ""Raising Arizona,"" and felt a little slighted, but ""O Brother"" is an enjoyable film worthy of some good laughs and a taste of the Coens' brisk, twisted sense of creativity.  The DVD edition contains the featurette, and I was interested to find out that the Coens are pretty simple in their directorial techniques.  That surprised me!  Of course, this movie is not the best example (and I'm only saying this in comparison) and it wasn't worthy of any Oscars (many feel it was robbed), but maybe it depends on the appeal. <br/><br/>
Though I enjoyed the Coens' previous work, I've never been a fan of old westerns or ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" or any of that stuff they show daily on TNN.  I guess that's why I didn't feel as enthusiastic about checking out this movie, seeing that it revolves around Southern folk.  For all those from the South who are reading this, I don't mean to offend ANY of your people!  I'm sure you guys feel the same way when you watch movies about urban areas like ""A Bronx Tale.""  When you live in the city all your life, it's hard to get accustomed to films of this nature.  But all apologies aside, I found the characters fun and quirky.  I think John Turturro nailed the accent perfectly, and seeing the way he talks in real life I find that amazing.  Tim Blake Nelson was also good.  Of course, George Clooney--who I assume is not the best at feigning accents, judging by his decision to chuck the idea of working with a dialogue coach and developing a New England accent for ""The Perfect Storm""--naturally seems a little miscast and continually struggles with the accent.  His performance was good, though. You can also spot Coen regulars like Holly Hunter (in a short but sweet role) and John Goodman (also on screen for a short time, but steals every minute of it).<br/><br/>Though I don't normally dig country music, I liked the title song ""A Man of Constant Sorrow.""  The DVD also contains the music video for that song. <br/><br/>
Overall, I found the film entertaining and original, but it doesn't have that in-your-face quality that the Coens have shown to us in the past.  It's a slighter effort, but a good one.  I still suggest you check it out. <br/><br/>

"Spiner-2","9","1","1","3 July 2001"," Not your typical movie
","I wasn't sure what to expect from ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" Homer's Odyssey set in the deep South during the Great Depression? A premise like that screams ""arty film,"" and an ""arty film"" usually equates to ""bad film."" Look no further than ""The Avengers"" to see a what I mean. On the other hand, it was the product of the Coen brothers, and I was quite entertained by ""The Hudsucker Proxy,"" so I thought I might like it. And if anyone can pull off an ""arty film,"" it's the Coen brothers.<br/><br/>The story revolves around chiefly around three men who escape from a chain gang and rush to collect a hidden treasure before the place where it is hidden is flooded by a dam project. Along the way, they have a variety of interesting and amusing experiences.<br/><br/>George Clooney plays the head convict, Ulysses Everett McGill, a man obsessed with having perfectly slicked-back hair (with nothing less than ""Dapper Dan"" hair gel), to the point of wearing a hair net while sleeping. He is accompanied by the rather dull (mentally) Pete Hogwallop (John Turturro) and the even duller Delmar O'Donnell (Tim Blake Nelson). Their on-screen exploits are, to say the least, hilarious.<br/><br/>One of the funniest parts is how Ulysses, as described in one review, ""manages to pull ten dollar words from a five-cent brain."" My favorite scene was when the three cons, still chained together, attempt to hop a moving train. Ulysses hops on and faces a group of hobos. As the second convict climbs aboard, Ulysses says, ""Any of you boys smithies? Or, if not smithies per se, were you otherwise trained in the metallurgic arts before straitened circumstances forced you into a life of aimless wanderin'?"" During this, the last con trips and falls while trying to board the train, dragging the other two off with him.<br/><br/>The cinematography is, as usual, gorgeous, and the music compliments the story and location nicely. Particularly good was the number performed by the three convicts in the story to earn some extra money.<br/><br/>The storyline does wander somewhat, but, considering the topic, it's actually rather appropriate! If you like other movies produced by the Coen brothers, you'll definitely like this."

","Yet again, the Coen Brothers have made a uniquely entertaining film. In ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"", three escaped convicts (George Clooney, Tim Blake Nelson, John Turturro) leave the chain gang in search of treasure and of home, encountering an ""odyssey"" of strange adventures as they amble through the Depression-Era South. John Turturro Tim Blake Nelson do a wonderful job of playing affable dimwits, and Clooney puts in a top-notch performance as a flim-flam artist who's about as dumb as his two fellow escapees . . . he just knows more high-falutin' words that make him sound smart.  The other cast members are equally impressive -- Charles Durning, John Goodman, and Michael Badaluco all put in some stunning performances as well.<br/><br/>Like most Joel and Ethan Coen movies, the story is both bizarre and highly entertaining, with some memorable one-liners punctuating some equally memorable scenes.  (""We're in a tight spot!"") Where the movie falls short of some of their other efforts is the overall plot -- ""O Brother"" is more a mishmash of loosely related scenes than an actual story; as such, it sometimes drags or otherwise fails to grab your attention. Still, all in all, quite good -- and I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the Delta bluegrass soundtrack, which adds a healthy amount of texture and depth to the laid-back charming fun that is ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?""

"BadRon","7","1","1","20 March 2001"," Good, but maybe just a little too uneven
","We can all count on the Coen Brothers giving us an offbeat presentation, and this is no different. There were moments in this film where I felt like a smile was glued to my face. But every once in a while, a scene would come along and be completely disturbing (animals crushed under cars; KKK meetings). It came along too abruptly. Perhaps they were sticking to the formula in Homer's ""The Odyssey"" by juxtaposing the pleasant with the horror. But I always felt that Homer's book had more horror than pleasantness to it which made the transition more welcome. Still, it is an interesting film to sit through if only because you will not be able to predict what will follow from one scene to the next. And Clooney is very good here as well. His best work since ""Out Of Sight."" Now, if I want to smile all the way through, I'll listen to the outstanding soundtrack. GREAT MUSIC!!!"

White-trash never looked so good! These characters capture you. George Clooney further strips himself of his pretty-boy image as he fantasticaly becomes the smooth talking trickster and allows himself to be the very lucky fool.  Tim Blake Nelson (as Delmar) is a gentle and innocent addition allowing us to not only find this bunch interesting, but endearing as well. These men both deserve an Oscar nod.<br/><br/>Since the movie is based on ""The Oddessy"", the Cohen brothers allow the soundtrack and several actual singing groups to be the chours.

","While I have enjoyed all of the Coens' brothers previous works, I have to say that this movie is probably one of worst films I saw this year, if only because I had such respect for their previous works that I went in with high expectations. The problem as I see it is that the script was trying too hard. There are far too many scenes in the movie that do nothing to advance the story but simply exist to cause a recollection of Homer's work. Whole subplots could have been excised from the script, most notably the sirens subplot, which ended with the characters in exactly the same spot as they had been before but left the audience some 10-15 minutes older. Same goes with the Babyface subplot, or the Cyclops. At least one of these 3 should have been cut from the script and the minutes added to the other subplots. Instead, the Coens include all three and meander between these scenes like a bad sitcom. The Coens strong point, the creation of quirky characters, is also sadly lacking in this feature. What made Lebowski work is that you knew where the characters were coming from. Same goes for Fargo, Hudsucker, Raising Arizona, etc. The audience came to know and love the characters' quirks, and the Coens were able to let their quirks drive the movies. In Oh Brother, however, the audience is never really allowed to see what makes the characters work, and so the plot has to drive the movie. As I noted previously, this made the movie utterly unsuccessful because of the overloaded script. On the whole, I would give this movie only 3/10, only because of the music and because one of Babyface's lynchers yelled ""Cow Killer!"" as if this were his greatest crime."

The soundtrack is an utter headache... when it doesn't grate on your ears it puts you asleep.  The so-called ""comedy"" bits are way too subtle to get any entertainment out of it.  The plot makes no sense if you're not familiar with the Odyssey... and if you are, it just strikes you as a rediculous substitution.<br/><br/>In its defense, any moment on the screen is good to look at... but the movie has no movement to it.

","Oh brother where art thou is a very strange film. I wonder if I'm just not the right kind of person to watch and enjoy this, I know lots of viewers like this movie, but I absolutely hate it. I think George Clooney is a very talented actor and I usually like him both on the big screen and in real life, but he just really annoyed me here. His acting seems way too over the top funny and it's all just too obvious. What I mean by that is that I don't really like it when actors deliver comedic lines so obviously that it's not funny, I prefer more dry/witty type humor. But it's not just the way the actors say the lines, it's also the writing, it's too over the top and obvious. When comedic dialogue is written in that way, in my opinion, they lose their appeal and amusement factor. It drains the funny reaction out that the audience is supposed to experience. And the issue is that it's not like this movie drops lines like that, it's all the time, I could forgive a few moments like that, but not all throughout the whole thing.... So really since the comedy didn't work for me and actors that I normally like were held captive to this bad writing, the whole thing just doesn't work. Also I really hate bluegrass music so whenever that would occur it would just make it that much worse. 1/10."

","Despite me giving this film a 10, it is NOT my favorite Coen Brothers film (that honor would go to the even more bizarre and quirky HUDSUCKER PROXY). However, it still is an amazingly good film. The first time I saw it, I might have scored it an 8, but now after seeing it again, I find myself laughing even harder and enjoying it even more. Plus, while the film is a hilarious retelling of Homer's ""ODYSSEY"", I find myself spotting more and more story elements from this great book. The cleverness in doing this was truly a work of genius. On top of that, the music is so infectiously fun that you can't help but tap your feet and even sing along--it's THAT good.<br/><br/>The film begins with the escape of three idiots from a chain gang. The normally handsome George Clooney is rather greasy and stubbly looking but he always manages to look far more attractive than his incredibly ugly and occasionally dim-witted sidekicks. I liked John Turturro quite a bit, but especially fun was Tim Blake Nelson as the dumbest and ugliest of the lot! He was incredibly funny throughout--especially when he was convinced that Turturro had been turned into a frog (much like when Odysseus' men had been turned into pigs in THE ODYSSEY).<br/><br/>However, these three guys were not the whole show, as like most of the best Coen films, they are surrounded by the best supporting performances you can find in film. Charles Durning (who was great in THE HUDSUCKER PROXY) was delightful as the wily old governor and Holly Hunter was wonderfully awful, but so many wonderful actors and actresses adorned this lovely film. So many odd faces (much like a Fellini film) and quirky personalities made this film truly memorable.<br/><br/>The look and sound of the film was also terrific--with a real nice early 1930s look about it and great sepia-toned cinematography and the best toe-tappinest soundtrack I've heard in years. I usually hate old time country music, but the songs they chose were amazing! And the actors did a great job in pretending to be singing the songs.<br/><br/>See this film. In fact, after you see this film, see ANYTHING the Coens made--THE HUDSICKER PROXY, RAISING ARIZONA, THE MAN WHO NEVER WAS, INTELLERABLE CRUELTY, MILLERS CROSSING and pretty much most of their other wonderful films. Oddly, while it won so much fame, one of their worst and most disappointing films was FARGO--a one joke film. Plus, I gotta admit that BARTON FINK really fell apart towards the end."

","""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" features some of the best and worst tendencies of the Coen Brothers as they reexamine another movie genre. <br/><br/>The cinematography is lush -- where ""Fargo"" was visually about white, ""Miller's Crossing"" visually about dark and ""Barton Fink"" fascinated by the look of fire, ""O Brother"" lingers over golden and amber waves of grain. ""In Fargo,"" I thought the Coens had genuine love for their home turf underneath the satire and cruelty, but here we have a South of yokel myth, that makes Preston Sturges' magical ""Sullivan's Travels"" --which this is close to a remake of--seem like a documentary. The Daughters of the Confederacy who walked out of ""Gone With The Wind"" for showing that the South lost the War Between the States would surely walk out of this one.<br/><br/>Like a humorous counterpoint to ""Dancer in the Dark,"" this feels like a European musical's look at the South of the Great Depression, from corrupt politicians, to chain gangs, to river baptisms, to KKK rallies, road kill BBQs, and bank robberies. <br/><br/>But it comes alive through the overpowering music selected by T-Bone Burnett that becomes the central focus of the movie (complete with a pilgrimage to a radio station as in ""American Graffiti"" but with a commercial and political exploitation angle: ""Hey a man there will pay you for singing into a can!""). Few other than public radio listeners will feel disconcerted having the very distinctive voices of Allison Krauss, Emmy Lou Harris, Gillian Welch, the Fairfield 4, and Ralph Stanley come out of actors' mouths, like in ""Pennies from Heaven,"" because the music is the basis for mesmerizing, highly theatrical set-pieces. <br/><br/>It must have been at the directors' direction that John Torturro gives the worst performance of his otherwise exemplary career and Tim Blake Nelsonis worse, as their faces are frozen in Ma and Pa Kettle stereotypes. George Clooney tries a Southern accent for 30 seconds then gives up, which is ironic as he was born and raised in Kentucky. His container of Dapper Dan hair pomade becomes an ongoing leitmotif like the hat in ""Miller's Crossing"" with no significance other than the visual. <br/><br/>I did miss the opening minute or so due to strong hunger pains and a slow refreshment line, but I don't think seeing the opening quote from Homer would have changed my impression.

So I gave it another chance.<br/><br/>Oh well.<br/><br/>The second time around I found it worse than disappointing; I found it offensive. The movie should be rated R for the number of times it takes the Lord's name in vain.

It lacks a sympathetic character (Tim Blake Nelson comes the closest, and it's hard not to like Holly Hunter in anything) or even any memorable scenes.<br/><br/>Yes, there are the typical Coen Brothers' eccentric characters and references to classic stories (Homer) and movies (like Cool Hand Luke) but, instead of enhancing this film or honoring the past, they just don't work.

That is fine for a stylish film noir like Blood Simple, but cruel, almost sadistic in films like Raising Arizona or Fargo. They are akin to Kubrick (not necessarily a compliment) in that they have neither the desire nor the talent to explore human nature or emotions in anything but the most superficial manner.

With O Brother, Where Art Thou? however I don't feel so ready to rewatch right away. My enjoyment of my first viewing was lacking somewhat compared to Lebowski and NCFOM. Nonetheless I will ensure I give OBWAT a second chance at some point to see if my initial rating can be boosted.<br/><br/>I didn't particularly care much for the soundtrack, which is getting a lot of praise amongst other reviewers. I've read comments suggesting the film grows on you as it progresses, which I agree with but must note it takes over an hour of runtime before this takes effect. Before Clooney's revelation about the truth behind his ""buried treasure"" (which with some prior knowledge of Homer's Odyssey would not come as a shock or twist at all to the viewer) the film presents itself as one disjointed scene after another. I would actually recommend researching a brief summary of Odyssey before watching OBWAT, as I feel this could make certain scenes and characters seem less random and therefore more enjoyable. For instance John Goodman's cameo does not seem so bizarre upon reflection, having now garnered some awareness of Odysseus' foe the cyclops.<br/><br/>Credit where it's due, O Brother, Where Art Thou? does serve well as a comedy and I did find myself laughing throughout. And kudos to the Coen Brothers for managing to tie up every loose end of their rambling sketch show-like story. My overall enjoyment of the film is reflected in my rating however, and until I get round to rewatching O Brother, Where Art Thou? I must stick with 6/10."

If I dare reveal such tantalizing little nugget of personal information to your kind self.<br/><br/>And I do belief that you don't need to hear any more. But nevertheless, because I'm a throughout man, who believes in not leaving a job unfinished if I can at all help it, I shall go into more detail. Yes sir, I did say more detail and I meant it, so help me God.<br/><br/>Misters Clooney, Turturro and Nelson play here three gentleman of ill repute. Veritable scoundrels they are and fresh off the hook of the great state of Mississippi. So to speak. For you see, and I know you'll find this hard to believe, but this here picture show features escaped convicts as its main characters. Now, I know that there are those among your humble and pious ranks whose first reaction is to find this offensive. And to you I say, bless you, kind madams and sirs. Bless you. You are the salt of the Earth and yours is the kingdom of Heaven. And yet to you I also say, open your hearts. For these are the most likable dirty chainbreakers you're ever likely to witness on this good Earth.<br/><br/>I might go on to praise the acting of these gentlemen three. Especially that of Mister Clooney, slipping into the guise of Ulysses Everett McGill, a man of words if there ever was one. Why, this man could charm the feathers of a singing bird. He could talk to rain and make it dry. He would don you his hat, flash a smile and become your most trusted friend before dinner.<br/><br/>Alas, if we are to talk about this picture show, and talk about it we must, it behooves us to also talk about the mistakes that have slipped in. For you see, and I must ask those weak of heart in the audience to praise themselves, this here picture ain't perfect. I'd dare even say it's flawed.<br/><br/>Now, I hear you crying. Mister, what could possibly be wrong with this picture. It's directed by the Brothers Coen. It has Mister George Clooney in it. Its story is based on Homer's The Odyssey. It even has the honour of being the first feature film ever to be fully digitally colour corrected. What possible fault can be found in it?<br/><br/>And to you, good sir, I say that the fault lies in its attempt to be a Grecian epic. It's precisely its attempt to imitate art greater than itself which reveals its flaws. Certainly, there are scenes within it that are lifted from the pages of Homer. But they're pale imitations and unwieldy in the setting of Deep South during the decade of 1930. I dare say, they don't fit. They're out of place. They're misaligned, out of whack, purposeless. They are an ill fit.<br/><br/>Nevertheless and despite my misgivings about certain aspects of storytelling as they pertain to the general cohesiveness of the cinematic grandiose this picture represents, I did enjoy watching this film. It was a lark, a gay old time. Why, I even find myself recommending it to my friends. Can you imagine?"

At the start of their journey, they meet a blind man who prophecises that they will find a fortune, though it will not be the one they seek; indeed, life for the trio takes many strange and unexpected turns before fate smiles upon them, their adventure involving encounters with many unusual characters (including three sirens, a Bible-selling conman, a bluesman who has sold his soul to the devil, infamous bank robber Babyface Nelson, and the KKK).<br/><br/>Combining smart witticisms with superb slapstick and American folklore, the Coens have crafted a sparkling comedic delight, helped no end by excellent performances, not just from the three endearing leads, but everyone involved, the superb supporting cast including such wonderful talent as John Goodman, Holly Hunter, and Charles Durning. The film also benefits from stunning photography (much of it sepia-tinted to add to the depression-era ambience) and a superb soundtrack bristling with 'Old Time America' bluegrass and country music (if you're not already a fan of the genre, you might well be by the end of the film), making it a treat for both eyes and ears.

","I'm not entirely sure how to review this flick. Don't get me wrong, it was enjoyable but something was missing that prevented this from being great. Essentially three chain-mates, who crush rocks on a prison farm, escape in an attempt to find buried treasure. But, in typical Coen fashion, the group go from one crazy scenario to the other. Constantly. From recording a country song for some cash, to getting robbed by a one-eyed Bible Salesman. From being seduced by sexy sirens, to being disguised in KKK uniform. It's just crazy fun. But there is just something about the narrative that seems...off. Like I wasn't fully connected with this biblical journey that's filled with religious connotations. I mean heck, the main character is named Ulysses. I just...didn't get the purpose of the biblical context. As a road caper, it's extremely enjoyable with plenty of humorous moments. Boasted with energetic performances by Clooney, Nelson and Turturro. Great supporting cast as well with dependable performances from Goodman and Hunter. The scenarios that our characters are put under are also hilarious and instantly memorable. As simple as falling from a train is, it still produces a good laugh. Hence why I admire the simplicity that Joel Coen was going for. It's not over-the-top slapstick humour, it's all in the dialogue. The Coen brothers pump out scripts that are consistently witty for every film they produce. They are known for damn good dialogue and this film is no different. I just...couldn't get on board with the context and subtext that was conveyed. Just didn't work for me. But as a hilarious adventure road flick, it works on every level. Might need to re-watch it at a later date to truly appreciate this. Not the Coens most accessible film but still a good watch."

","O Brother, Where Art Thou? offers some very interesting mixes of comedy and drama that overall makes it a very successful adaptation of the Odyssey. I watched this film late at night, so I was awake for most of the first act, sort of like April and the Extraordinary World. The film managed to wake me up with its action, though, and I was wide awake for the rest of it, laughing pretty hard at some of the jokes and getting captivated by the sense of mystery in certain scenes. The cinematography is very well done, portraying the southern US (or what it seems like) very well despite some areas where the color schemes of the set seem monochrome. The Odyssey is technically the story (just replace the characters) and finds an ideal balance between following the Odyssey and adding its own concepts (like the Soggy Bottom Boys). The characters were excellently cast and portrayed their counterparts in the Odyssey with both a sense of sticking to the source material and being progressive. Most of the songs are catchy to listen to, even if they don't enhance the tone of the movie or have dull parts. It's one film that you would want to consider viewing."
"ironhorse_iv","8","0","0","29 May 2016"," O Brother, this movie is a masterpiece! I love it!
","Written and directed by the Coen Brothers, ""O Brother Where Art thou"", tells the story of three Depression-era Mississippi prison fugitives Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney), Pete Hogwallop (John Turturro) and Delmar O'Donnel (Tim Blake Nelson) on a journey to reach for the money buried in Everett's backyard, before that area slated to be flooded by a local dam project. Without spoiling the film, too much, I like the fact that entire plot contains various shout outs to the Ancient Greek poem, 'The Odyssey' by author, Homer. While the film doesn't follow, the poem to the letter, it does borrow some notable plot elements from it, such as the blind man, the Cyclops, the sirens, and one of the main characters trying to get home to his wife so she won't marry someone else. The connections to the poem can get pretty clever the more you look for them. A good example is how Everett is surrounded by Peter and Delmar, which in Greek, means 'the rock' and 'the sea', referencing to the Charybdis and Scylla in the original poem. Even the term ""odyssey"" in the original Greek can be roughly translated to ""Constant Sorrow"" which is aptly, the title of the song that identifies our heroes. Although the fictional story is mostly based off, 'The Odyssey', the canvas of the film come from the fictional book/McGuffin of the same name in Preston Sturges' 1941 film, 'Sullivan's Travels'. Since that socially-conscious novel has never been define with any sense of a story, besides some downtrodden themes taken from author John Steinbeck, 1932's film, 'I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang', William Faulkner's novel, 'As I Lay Dying' and the Holy Bible; it allows, the Coen Brothers to draw their own creative artistic license to make whatever was, 'O Brother Where Art Thou' supposed to mean. One of those prominent themes is the idea of change. In this film, spiritualism is seem as a backward belief, made for laughs, that it's not needed for the more modern and technologically advanced. However, given the ambivalence with which the movie treats the idea of reform, and perhaps Everett's change of heart, toward the end. It is ultimately left to the viewer to decide whether the vast reform of America brought about by technology is, itself, a step-backwards or a step forwards. I like that, about this film. Another thing, I like, is how this film is almost a musical. In many ways, the Coen Brothers really wanted to make a period piece version of the 1980s comedy film, 'Blue Brothers'. This comedy choice in direction allows the movie to have fun with the sophistical meaning of the themes, without going all grim and somber. While, this movie might not have the action that 'Blue Brothers' has, this movie has nearly the same style of music. Both films emphasize the power that gospel and bluegrass music has on its characters, both in positive and negative ways. There is no better example of that, then the 'Down in the River to pray' & 'Go to Sleep Little Baby' (Didn't Leave Nobody but the Baby) sequences. Both songs are able to shown, the struggles of being sinful while, also righteous. Great singing from bluegrass singers, Alison Krauss Emmylou Harris, & Gillian Welch. I also love the other songs on the soundtrack, including music artist, Harry McClintock's 'Big Rock Candy Mountain', Norman Blake's 'You are my sunshine' and 'In the Jailhouse now' by Tim Blake Nelson. Yet, the best song, in the film, has to be, Soggy Bottom Boys (Dan Tyminski, Harley Allen, and Pat Enright) 'I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow'. It really tells, how life was like, during one of the most downtrodden period of American history. The notable use of dirges and other macabre songs in this film is wonderful. Hearing dark songs like ""O Death"", ""Angel Band"", in contrast to bright, cheerful songs ""Keep On the Sunny Side"", ""In the Highways"" in other parts of the film, make this film, one of the best movie soundtrack ever. This film really shows, how extreme poverty can indeed foster, a rich musical tradition of classic hits. Another great thing about this film is how well-shot, it was. One of the notable features of the film is its use of digital color correction to give the film a sepia-tinted look. If they didn't do this, the Southern summer landscape would have been a bright green, which is too cheerful for the Dust Bowl-type feel they were going for. Director of photography, Roger Deakins really did a wonderful job, capturing that time period. Another thing that I love about this film, is the acting. Everybody in the film, ranging from supporting actors, to the main actors were great in their roles. Mad props goes to George Clooney for making this film, a lot of fun. I have always love, his fun comedy side, better than his dramatic roles. It just sucks, that he can't sing, worth jack. It's a little more tragic, because he's from a line of well-known singers, like famed cabaret singer and actress Rosemary Clooney. Anyways, due of his lack of skills in the music department, he had to be dubbed by Dan Tyminski, during any part, where singing was involved. The other faults of the film is that many characters are introduced and then disappear seemingly without any point or purpose. Did we really need George 'Baby-Face' Nelson (Michael Badalucco) to cameo in the film? Wasn't he dead in 1939? That's another problem with the film. It's not historical correct, at all. The real Governor Pappy O' Daniels was a Texan, and the film's theme song, ""You are my Sunshine,"" was written by Louisiana's Depression-era governor, Jimmy Davis. However, since it's a fiction fantasy movie. I'm willing to give this, some leeway. Despite some faults, this movie is a bodafine classic. A must watch for any Coen Brothers fan. Overall: Go see it. I do recommended."

It has a realistic depiction with a touch of fantasy to it, one that will really skew into some goofy scenes. It's a film that plays with your suspension of disbelief for a little, but stays focused nonetheless. The cast was well picked out, with George Clooney and John Turturro as the lead, as well as Tim Blake Nelson, all of which do an amazing job. The tone is one of the best parts of the movie. It should be a drama, given the source material and the setting, but it plays off as a light comedy, with several over the top scenes that set up for an excellent music score. The songs in this had me humming for days, T Bone Burnett really did a good job in capturing the tone and time period for the film, and it pays off.<br/><br/>The film at times feels a little clustered, with some big stars that don't get as much screen time. Holly Hunter is pretty top billed, but isn't around until three fourths of the movie. The film is adapting itself into The Odyssey, so there are some appropriately added scenes that are there to be symbolism, and even though it's well done, it kind of slows down the adventurous pace. With that, the fantasy element of this film is strong, I feel like anything can happen in this movie, and that anything is possible, a free feeling I don't get in movies very often.<br/><br/>Not one of my favorite Coen's, but entertaining nonetheless, with some great characters, interesting storytelling, and a fun tone and excellent music."

","Three not-so-smart convicts escape a chain gang in Depression-era Mississippi and in three stooges fashion, go from one disaster to another. The semi-humorous plot is like a bad dream that goes on and on, each segment brief and with little or no continuity to the segment that went before. Along the way our stooges encounter interesting, oddball characters, most of whom represent some stereotyped persona from that era in American history. Probably the most interesting of these characters is ""Radio Station Man"", a blind one man outfit that records and plays corny songs to a local hick audience.<br/><br/>Given the surreal storyline, lack of scene continuity is not a problem. But some segments and some characters seem like unnecessary filler. Character exaggeration works well for some characters, but not others. Toward the end the plot gets a little silly and the climax seems tacked on.<br/><br/>Except for the wide ratio, letterbox screen format, color cinematography is terrific. The brownish yellow sepia toned images, which exist throughout, convey an appropriately dry and old look, consistent with the story's bygone era. Overall mise-en-scene design adds emotional support to that visual feel.<br/><br/>I could have wished for less screen time for George Clooney, whose character dominates the plot. Aside from that, casting and acting are acceptable. Possibly the best element is that harmonic music, a down home type that generally has gone out of style, though it remains popular among mostly rural Americans.<br/><br/>A splashy, big budget, in-your-face satire of some elements in American history, ""O Brother ..."" holds your attention as we journey dream-like through a world of three guys whose collective IQ may be limited but whose capacity to find trouble is not."

","The first thing that struck me about O Brother, Where Art Thou? was the locations. The Coen brothers did a stellar job of portraying the Mississippi of this time period as I have always imagined it would look. It makes me want to seek out these parts of my state myself, just to see what true rural Mississippi once looked like.<br/><br/>The second thing that caught my attention about this movie is how over-the-top it is. That will automatically make it unpleasant for some, but it became endearing for me after only a short time. Yes, George Clooney's accent doesn't work nearly as well as John Turturro's or Tim Blake Nelson's, but after a while it all seems to fit and just seems right.<br/><br/>The third element that stands out about O Brother is the songs. Awesome. Every scene is highlighted by some of the most kick-ass, old-timey tunes known to man. Anyone who doesn't want the soundtrack after seeing the movie is just being contrary. <br/><br/>The fact that this is loosely based on The Odyssey is only occasionally apparent, but the story that is here is more than enough to entertain. Every new character is captivating, no matter how long or brief their screen time. <br/><br/>The movies starts off brilliantly, sags a bit toward the middle, and then finishes fairly strong.

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","0","0","8 January 2016"," Smartly captures the mythology of the Deep South through music
","The Depression-era Deep South comes alive like mythological Ancient Greece in Joel and Ethan Coen's ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" <br/><br/>An adaptation of Homer's ""Odyssey,"" the Coen brothers came to the realization that the folklore of the Deep South is the heart of American myth and tales of long journeys and they marry Homer's epic to this aesthetic in a way that respects the original story and American folklore while imbuing them with a semi-silly tone.<br/><br/>The 1930s Mississippi setting also makes a difference; post-Civil War and pre-Civil Rights, the South is caught between past traditions and forces of change and the American Dream feels well out of reach yet not impossibly beyond grasping. The trio of escaped chain-gang convicts, Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney), Pete (John Turturro) and Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson) are in search of more than a million dollars that Everett has hidden back home, money that will change their lives. Their long journey takes varying episodic twists and turns as they encounter all manner of characters, good and evil.<br/><br/>The heart and soul of the film, however, is its music. Folks songs, hymns, spirituals and more have both a pivotal role in the film in terms of plot, in addition to providing the mythical tone. Songs are often tied to strange turns of events in the story, such as three mysterious women singing along the river and enchanting the runaways (obvious parallel to the ""Odyssey""). The gang even picks up Tommy Johnson (Chris Thomas King), who went down to the crossroads and sold his soul to the devil to play guitar, the very legend that started blues music.<br/><br/>The film's arrangement ""I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow,"" the song that the trio plus Johnson sing into a can for $10 under the pseudonym ""The Soggy Bottom Boys"" when they come across a blind radio producer (Stephen Root), proves strangely key to the story and is unbelievably catchy to boot. Music in the film, as it so often did in the South, brings people together and makes a difference. The Coens' film has as much to say about that notion as it does anything else.<br/><br/>The Coens' irreverent, silly but whip-smart humor also pervades ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" The dynamic of the loquacious and self- absorbed Everett along with hotheaded Pete and the clueless optimist Delmar has endless appeal, even when it's clear early on that it's not a healthy one. The oddball characters along the way, especially George ""Don't Call Him Babyface"" Nelson (Michael Badalucco), John Goodman's Big Dan Teague and rival politicians Pappy O'Daniel (Charles Durning) and Homer Stokes (Wayne Duvall) provide a similarly intriguging effect to the many creatures Odysseus and crew meet in their travels.<br/><br/>""O Brother"" stands testament to the power of American folklore, that even for a country barely 200 years old, there's a certain magic in it that the Coen brothers tap into with the appropriate use of magical realism and narrative technique that resembles Greek mythology. Its concept and music may be more exciting than its plot, but ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" is a special film to behold of a genre all its own.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

"Seraphion","7","0","0","17 October 2015"," Not quite the Odyssey I know but it's nice
","While stated at the very beginning that this movie is based on Homer's Odyssey, I feel that the Coen Brothers really take their freedom and gives a loose interpretation of the extant. The story feels like it's not a complete version of the Odyssey, rather a collection of snippets of the more significant incidents. The characters and backgrounds are also getting reinterpreted, wildly must I say. Yet those interpretations get to be very funny and entertaining. I really enjoy the interpretation about the Cyclops and the sirens. The mood gets to be formed very nicely with the coherent choices of lighting and coloration. The acting in overall looks also good. George Clooney takes most of the credit for it, but John Turturro did also quite good, especially on their face expressions."
"hall895","6","0","0","1 August 2015"," The Odyssey with music and laughs
","The Coen brothers present a reasonably entertaining comedy very loosely based on Homer's Odyssey. The hero of this film's journey is Everett, whose first name is actually Ulysses, and whose story parallels that of Homer's hero. But Everett's story is very much unique, the Coens take a rough outline from Homer and then make the story all their own. The story unfolds in rural Mississippi in 1937, a unique and, as we will come to see, rather strange place. Everett is an escaped convict who has two companions on his journey. Pete and Delmar were chained to Everett at the time of his escape, he convinced them to go along with him by filling their heads with a story of buried treasure. They lose the chains, will they find the treasure? The first person they stumble upon after their escape tells them they will find a fortune, but not the one they seek. Interesting. What will fate have in store for our trio at the end of their arduous journey? <br/><br/>This is a comedy film which has its funny moments but the film is rather uneven. The laughs don't come as consistently as you would like. It is music more than comedy which really sparks the film to life. Everett, Pete and Delmar end up unwitting radio stars, the Soggy Bottom Boys. Their hit song, Man of Constant Sorrow, is a treat. The film has a good, lively mix of folk and bluegrass music throughout. So, the music is fun. The story doesn't quite match the music though. There are times where things move a little too slowly, times where things get a little too weird. At one point Delmar is convinced Pete has been turned into a toad. Yes, weird indeed. Delmar is a bit of a dim bulb, Pete isn't much brighter. Everett is the brains of the operation but, while he's got a quick wit, he's surely no genius either. There are times when the dimness of the trio is endearing, but there are times where it wears thin too.<br/><br/>Everett, Pete and Delmar are certainly the focus of the story but they meet plenty of interesting characters on their Homer-inspired journey. And, keeping with the offbeat theme of the entire film, many of these characters are exceedingly odd. This really is a strange film but the Coens pull it all together reasonably well. George Clooney, playing Everett, is a good star to build around. Clooney brings real personality to the role. John Turturro, as Pete, and Tim Blake Nelson, as Delmar, complement Clooney well. There may be times the story drags, times where the comedy misses the mark. But it is not the fault of the performers, everyone suits their role very well. John Goodman and Holly Hunter are among those who pop into the film, portraying characters who take the story in some surprising directions. It seems a simple story, that of Everett and friends on an ordinary journey. But there is nothing ordinary about the world of this film. The Coens have populated this world with some supremely strange people. And that makes for a decent bit of fun. Maybe the film doesn't always work as well as it should but it perks up enough here and there to keep you interested and entertained. Things get a little bizarre at times but there is some fun in that too. And the music keeps things lively, you'll be clamoring for more of the Soggy Bottom Boys. This is certainly not the greatest comedy the Coens ever produced. But it's good enough to satisfy."

","A fine comedy / road movie by the Coens. I never read Homer's 'Oddyssey', but it seems one can do without when watching this. As per usual in a Coens comedy, there are lots of striking, over the top characters here, and I like them a whole lot better than the ones in 'The Hudsucker proxy'. The leading trio reminds me of Laurel and Hardy, especially Tim Blake Nelson looks and acts like the spitting image of Stan Laurel at times.<br/><br/>The story is more like a series of events, although towards the end, things are quite neatly tied together. As with some other Coen films, this time around it didn't speak to me as much as it once did, but it's still highly enjoyable, which also had much to do with the loads of fantastic (old country and blues) music, and the terrific (cinematographic) atmosphere of that ol' American South.<br/><br/>A good 8 out of 10."

","I'm rather young and haven't seen as much films as other film buffs out there, but I can't help but to think that this is one of the best films I've seen. I first watched this back in 2010 or 2011 and O Brother Where Art Thou still doesn't get old to me. For starters, they couldn't have chosen a better cast. It's hard to believe how amazing George Clooney's acting was. On top of that the storyline is phenomenal. How they were able to take an old story ""The Odyssey"", (one of my favorite Homer stories) and weave it into a Southern tale is seriously amazing. It's very believable.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is one of the best music scores I've heard. I'm very hard to impress with folk or country music, mainly because I'm not exactly into the genre, but I can say that I was very impressed with the soundtrack and thought it couldn't be any better or worse.<br/><br/>If you've never watched this film and are only reading reviews before thinking about watching it, stop reading now and watch the film already. You will not regret it. In fact, you'll thank most of us for writing about how great the film is."

","I just saw this very good movie for the first time. I was inspired to watch it because in the reviews of my favorite new movie, Blue Ruin, there were several comparisons to the Coen Brothers' movies. Everett's wife in O Brother tells his kids that he was hit by a train. In Blue Ruin, when Ben first sees Dwight, he tells him a guy (someone, I guess, they had both known) got hit by a train. It's the best comic line in the movie, in my opinion. I would love to know if it was actually an homage to the Coen Brothers. Jeremy Saulnier, the Blue Ruin creator, and Macon Blair, his friend and the star in Blue Ruin, strike me as being very subtle and intelligent, and I would be surprised if the train reference wasn't their way of honoring the Coens."

","I watched this movie again after a long time, and man, what a movie. I thought this was George Clooney's best movie he's ever acted in, with Michael Clayton a close second. The trio of guys fit perfectly and the rest of the cast was tailor-made for this type of movie. The score was fantastic as well by T. Boone Pickens. The digital color correction, which is also used in the recent TV series ""True Detectve"" is something I'm a big fan of. You really felt like you were in the deep south experiencing that era of life. I wish these kinds of movies came out more often. It's sad that these types of movies aren't typically guaranteed to make a lot of money. In today's age the world of cgi combined with action commercially is selling like wildfire, while our overall desire for well-scripted and acted movies is diminishing. Thank goodness people like Ron Howard, Scorsesse, Coens, Paul Thomas Anderson, and few others aren't necessarily scoring for commercial success."

","I definitely loved this film. It's just as perfect as a film can get. Some can say that this is not a 'Real' Coen film, but who cares when a film is good as this one? Everything is just flawless. The plot is way lighthearted for a Coen film, it's really the kind of film that follows the arc 'the protagonist suffer,suffer, and in the end he met happiness'. Similar arc with the Odissey of Homer, whose book was used here as the mainly inspiration for the film. Obviously, the name of the protagonist is indeed the same in both O Brother Where Are Thou and in the Odissey: Ulysses.<br/><br/>The acting in almost all the Coen's films are phenomenal and over the top, and this repeat itself here in this film. Great job by Turturro and Clooney, which held the lead of the film and did very well. The cinematography by Roger Adkins, and as well the art design, are essential to build the dread and sunset ambient of the south. Really deserved Oscar nomination for it.<br/><br/>And how to not talk about the fantastic music in the film? It really left speechless. Music in the film was originally conceived as a major component of the film, not merely as a background or a support. Noted producer and musician T- Bone Burnett worked with the Coens while the script was still in its working phases, and the soundtrack was recorded before filming commenced.<br/><br/>The ""Soggy Bottom Boys"" singing ""Man of Constant Sorrow"".<br/><br/>Much of the music used in the film is period-specific folk music, including that of Virginia bluegrass singer Ralph Stanley. The musical selection also includes religious music, including Primitive Baptist and traditional African-American gospel, most notably the Fairfield Four, an a cappella quartet with a career extending back to 1921 who appear in the soundtrack and as gravediggers towards the film's end. Selected songs in the film reflect the possible spectrum of musical styles typical of the old culture of the American South gospel, delta blues, country, swing and bluegrass. <br/><br/>There is a notable use of dirges and other macabre songs, a theme that often recurs in Appalachian music (""O Death,"" ""Lonesome Valley,"" ""Angel Band,"" ""I Am Weary"") in contrast to bright, cheerful songs (""Keep On the Sunnyside,"" ""In the Highways"") in other parts of the film.<br/><br/>The voices of the Soggy Bottom Boys were provided by Dan Tyminski (lead vocal on ""Man of Constant Sorrow""), Nashville songwriter Harley Allen, and the Nashville Bluegrass Band's Pat Enright. The three won a CMA Award for Single of the Year and a Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals, both for the song ""Man of Constant Sorrow."" Tim Blake Nelson sang the lead vocal on ""In the Jailhouse Now"".<br/><br/>""Man of Constant Sorrow"" has five variations: two are used in the film, one in the music video, and two in the soundtrack. Two of the variations feature the verses being sung back-to-back, and the other three variations feature additional music between each verse. Though the song received little significant radio airplay, it reached #35 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart in 2002. The version of ""I'll Fly Away"" heard in the film is performed not by Krauss and Welch (as it is on the CD and concert tour), but by the Kossoy Sisters with Erik Darling accompanying on long-neck 5-string banjo, recorded in 1956 for the album Bowling Green on Tradition Records.<br/><br/>Tommy, the lead guitarist of the Soggy Bottom Boys, is an intentional reference to the legend of Delta Blues artist Tommy Johnson, who claimed to have sold his soul to the devil in return for blues fame.<br/><br/>So, what you are expecting?

","It is likely that most often I will write reviews about the movies of Coen brothers. In a movie showing from well known to painfully well known themes, they succeeded to show their Coenism. As a perfect cinema culinary, the brothers powdered the main dish with the flavor of the collision of science and religion, the ignorance and faith, destiny and the personal choice. And in a what way! In moments grotesque, ironic and satiric, with the wonderful play of George Clooney, the main characters, like Odysseus and the Bremen musicians, led on the story line of Candid of Voltaire, are involved in adventure.<br/><br/>On the background of the individual lamentations for wealth and power, the heroic ensemble is being caught in the trap of the state laws and God's will. Who is authorized to judge? The providence attach to them colorful adherents which draw them into the stream of their personality acts. For final, the garnish is bittersweet and hard-baked.<br/><br/>Love. The woman of the main hero appear and she is capable of everything. It seem like it is written for them to be together, until she counts to three. The eternal motor is being found and the motive of the history is not reason. There is only one explanation.<br/><br/>It will be good if there were more of these movies. The sight which Coen brothers have is unique and can be put to a row of similar themes and plots.

","O Brother Where Art Thou was one film which had been intriguing me ever since I'd heard about it and its storyline immediately caught my fancy. A comedy- road movie about three escaped convicts who go in search of a missing treasure in the rural heartlands of 1937 Mississippi and how they end up becoming one of the state's most loved folk bands. I am told that it is inspired from Homer's epic ballad, ""The Odyssey"" and the film recognizes this inspiration in its opening credits. But since I've never read the Odyssey, I cannot comment as to whether the film stays true to it or not. But I can tell you that it is a beautiful comedy, a genre which the Coen brothers have dabbled in lately with movies such as ""The Ladykillers"" and ""Burn after Reading"". Unfortunately, their comedies are the only films I could relate to. I never really understood Barton Fink or The Big Lebowski, maybe they have many complex political and social undertones which are not perceptible to a first time viewer.<br/><br/>In O Brother.. George Clooney stars as Ulysses Everett McGill, a prisoner in a chain gang, who convinces his fellow inmates Pete Hogwallop (Turturro) and Delmar (Nelson) to come with him in search of a treasure buried somewhere in the heart of Mississippi. This starts off a long road journey where they meet a black guitarist, who claims he has sold his soul to the devil and they embark on a series of comic adventures, which include performing a single at a radio station calling themselves ""The Soggy Bottom Boys"", getting themselves swindled by an insurance salesman, disrupting a meeting of the Ku Klux Klan of which the Governor-Elect is a member, among other incidents. The film takes an extremely light hearted outlook on the depressing lives these people led and how they pulled on without any form of economic security whatsoever. <br/><br/>George Clooney's performance as the charming, all-knowing Everett, with a crazy obsession for neatly parted hair is wonderful, and to me invited comparisons to his character in ""Leatherheads"", which is also set around the same time. Everett is the kind of character Clooney could play in his sleep, and I sense that he enjoyed the role immensely. John Turturro as the ever-angry Pete Hogwallop is also a treat to watch, and Tim Blake Nelson as Delmar the Dunce is pleasing. <br/><br/>But I guess the real star of the film is its music. A wonderful soundtrack, consisting of several American folk songs of the time aptly complements the storytelling style of the film. Most notable among these are ""The Man of Constant Sorrow"" which is sung by the main characters in the film, and Harry McClintock's ""The Big Rock Candy Mountains"" which appears at the beginning of the film, and has now become one of my personal favourites. The tune and lyrics fit into the mood of the movie brilliantly and are part of the reason why its such an enjoyable watch. There is an almost constant background score throughout the film, and this gives you an impression of a magical land where everything was perfect and everyone was happy, far from what was actually happening at the time. But somehow the situations don't seem all that unrealistic and you end up loving the characters all the more. You just want to keep singing that song again and again. Until you watch the movie once more."

","O' Brother Where Art Thou (2000) is a movie about three guys on a chain gang that escape. Everett McGill played by George Clooney convinces the two guys he is chained with, Pete played by John Turturro and Del Mar played by Tim Blake Nelson, to escape with him. Everett deceived the pair by telling them that he had money buried from a heist that he would share with them.<br/><br/>The trio meets up with a blind man that tells them the treasure they seek may not be the treasure they find. There are many obstacles that the trio must face on their journey. Big Dan played by John Goodman beats them up and leaves them for dead, the trio narrowly escapes the KKK and even Pete's cousin Wash tries to turn them in for a reward while all the time they are being pursued by Sheriff Cooley. The theme of the movie is about being flexible along life's road; when on a path to a certain destination remain open to other roads that may lead to success. This is conveyed by the blind man the trio meets. As the story unfolds the trio becomes successful when they meet up with Tommy and decide to record a song with him; little do they know that this will be what makes them rich and gets them pardoned by the governor. This is exactly what the blind man's prediction was conveying! <br/><br/>The use of sound when the trio hops the train conveys the successful escape. The scene where the trio watches the blind man move down the track gives the audience a chance to contemplate the words he spoke to them. Another element that led to the movie's success was the soundtrack it was on the top selling list for years after the movie's release. The time period is conveyed by the colors in the movie. The other effective element is the way the characters talk with the Mississippi drawl. <br/><br/>Every time I see this movie I am reminded of Butch Cassidy and the Sun Dance Kid. The two very different groups are trying to escape criminal charges but neither group really appears to be criminals of their own choosing. I think each group is a victim of desperate times; they are trying to survive destitution. <br/><br/>It was a funny movie with many twists and turns that teach life lessons. The trio was always on the move experiencing many of life's surprises. The last disaster the trio faces is what keeps them safe. I think the storyline conveys the desperate times back in the years following the great depression. <br/><br/>According to IMDb there was an inaccuracy, the boy with the gun says he shot at a census taker but the census is only taken in tenth years; i.e. 1930 or 1940."

They have four days to reach the treasure before the valley is flooded to provide a lake as part of the new hydroelectric project. When they begin their journey they encounter a blind man on a manual railroad car that tells them what they will encounter through their journey. <br/><br/>Their first stop is at Pete's cousin's house that helps free them from their chains and provides them with clothing and Ulysses with his hair product Dapper Dan. Wash Hogwallop needs the money so he turns them in to the police, but his son saves them from Sheriff Cooley by driving into the burning barn and retrieving the three convicts to their freedom yet again. Later, while in the woods both Pete and Delmar are saved. Continuing on their journey they met Tommy Johnson (Chris King), a young man that has just sold his soul to the devil in order to play the guitar. Tommy is headed to a radio station that pays $10 dollars to record songs. Needing money the three convicts claim they are the Soggy Bottom Boys and record a song that becomes a hit around the state. While watching a film in the cinema, Everett and Delmar learn that Pete had not been turned into a toad by the sirens, but was turned in to the police for the bounty. Everett and Delmar rescue Pete from jail and Everett reveals that there is no treasure, he made it up to get to his wife (Holly Hunter) that is about to be married to another man(Ray McKinnon). Now convincing the three to help get his wife back they are disguised a musicians to get close to Penny (Holly Hunter) to show her he is a bona fide and he would not let her go.

They again meet up with the sheriff that is about to hang them when the flood comes to fill the valley. They get the ring but it is the wrong one and cannot get her wedding ring since it is at the bottom of the lake. <br/><br/>The movie O' Brother Where Art Thou is set in the 30's during the Great Depression, and has many similarities to Homer's Film the Odyssey such as the first lines of the odyssey and the text of O' Brother Where Art Thou. The names of the people and the biblical references show how the movies are both themed with the faith and skepticism. <br/><br/>Some of the techniques that are used are the lighting and angles. The Coen brothers wanted the movie to resemble the effects of and old- picture but to have the light intensify by the natural skin-tones and golden sunset's (old but new). With this effect they used digital mastering to dull the image of the entire film. When using different angles with the camera they have creating a sense of drama and at the same time hiding details.<br/><br/>O' Brother Where Art Thou theme is show throughout the entire film in which a number of biblical ideas are referenced and used to show the struggle between faith and skepticism."

","The film starts out with three men Everett, Pete and Delmar. Everett is played by George Cloony, Pete is played by John Tuturro, and Delmar is played by Tim Blake Nelson. The three men are in prison together and shackled at the foot and Everett comes up with this wonderful idea that he has a hidden treasure and the three of them should break out of prison and find it so that is what they did. The three of them overcome many obstacles while in search for the ""treasure"". Pete and Delmar then realize there was no treasure it is strictly Everett trying to prevent his ex-wife from becoming eloped again. The theme of the movie is very comical and it keeps you laughing the entire time. Everett, Pete, and Delmar learn a lot throughout the obstacle the first thing they encounter on their voyage was a blind man which tells them their future while receiving a ride from him the future that he comes up with for the men is that they are going to find a treasure but it isn't going to be the treasure that they are intending to find. The men end up sleeping in a barn and the authorities that are trying to find the men find out about it so they set the barn that they are sleeping in on fire. The men then go running through the woods and they cite a baptism without truly knowing much about it they get in line and receive the father, ghost, and the Holy Spirit. The men come across a radio station where they get on the radio as the Soggy Bottom Boys but they aren't about to sign their names so they just write X's they don't want the authorities to be able to hunt them down. The men also get involved in a bank robbery with Baby Face Nelson which has completed robberies several times. Everett and Delmar believe that Pete has been turned into a frog and they later find out that he was caught. Pete and Delmar find out that Everett was lying to them about the treasure he was just trying to get his ex-wife back before she got remarried but when they arrived to Penny she was interested in having Everett back and she told their kids that he was dead because she was ashamed about what Everett did. In the end Everett got his way and got Penny back. The movie was very well put together and it was a lot like the Odyssey. The movie made you feel like you were actually in the Great Depression due to the lighting and they well put together scenes."

","The plot of this film features George Clooney as Everett McGill pursuing and ambitious goal. Everett and two of his counterparts, Pete (John Tuturro) and Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson), escape from prison and embark on a false mission of finding a treasure. Their mission, in actuality, is Everett's selfish desire to keep his ex-wife from marrying someone else. Their adventure leads them into very troubling and dangerous scenarios. All the while, the three are pursued by a tenacious law dog (Sherriff Cooley) who catches up with the defying trio on a few occasions.<br/><br/>Much akin to the theme of ""The Breakfast Club"", the apparent theme of this film centers on numerous characters learning hard lessons of life and watching the changing of morality amongst the people they run into. One good example of this theme is when Big Dan Teeg (John Goodman) begins an exuberant sales pitch to Everett and convinces two of them to join him on a pick nick luncheon. While enjoying the pleasantries of the lunch setting, he attacks both of them and takes their money. Another clear example of this theme is when the trio runs into the ""Sirens"" washing their clothing in the river bed. The ignorance of the three of them leads them into a trap and causes one to be turned into the authorities. They awake stunned and perplexed as to what happened.<br/><br/>The lighting and color techniques of the movie really add to the realism of the dust bowl era that the film is set during. This adds to the challenge portrayed by the characters during their several scenarios of conflict. A prevalent motif, or symbolic repetition, that occurs throughout the course of the film is represented by the character obstacles of Big Dan, the Sheriff, and the Ku Klux Klan leader. At each point that the characters seem to make progress on their mission, or rather Everett's mission, these symbolic obstacles are placed in their paths which sets them onto the next scene with some knowledge obtained.<br/><br/>This film is a must see and keeps you involved in the mood and setting. There is plenty of portrayal of comic relief, wit, and other emotion to keep you interested. The trio definitely offers a bit of education on some hard lessons of life."

","Well, the Coen brothers made another interesting film to add to their directing repertoire. This is somewhat more mainstream then their previous films but that's not saying much. This film still has the delightful quirky feeling that their movies seem to feature. Despite some preachiness and a weird music score to this film, I really had to like a film like this.<br/><br/>This film is about three prisoners who escape and they go on an ""Odyssey"" like adventure to reclaim treasure before the wealth gets flooded away.<br/><br/>George Clooney is one heck of an actor. He chooses his roles very wisely(other than Batman and Robin of course) and that's why the Academy loves him so much. The rest of the cast led by Turturro and Blake Nelson were superb.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie feels like a cross between ""The Three Stooges"" and ""the Odyssey."" There are some adventures here that feature sirens and cyclops figuratively speaking and a trio of unintelligent delinquents. But, this a very fun Coens movie albeit a little more mainstream.

","Based on Homer's ""The Odyssey"" a chain gang led by Ulysses Everett McGill is led on a journey in search of false treasure. This treasure was made up by Ulysses in order to motivate his bound friends to escape. The film takes place in Mississippi during the 1930s. On their journey they encounter many unexpected people. Ulysses, played by George Clooney and his friends Pete and Delmar wind up in situations involving unique characters who reflect roles in ""The Odyssey."" An example of one of the more interesting character references was the sheriff played by Daniel von Bargen. He could have been meant to portray Hades the ruler of the underworld or Poseidon.<br/><br/>The theme is basically about a mans journey home. While on his journey the sheriff constantly chases him and he encounters many speed bumps on the way. Some of these bumps include Big Dan played by John Goodman meant to portray Polyphemus the Cyclops and the ladies in the river meant to portray the Sirens who try to seduce Ulysses and his friends. <br/><br/>This film is closely tied to another film directed by Preston Sturges. O Brother, Where Art Thou? and Sullivan's Travels have a lot of parallel thematic elements. The two films even share some very similar plot parallels. The whole idea of the journey home and the hero overcoming his pride were evident in both films. Some examples of the plot similarities were the train scene, the film viewing by the prisoners, someone using violence to quench their thirst for greed, and the rambunctious driving scenes of the two young boys. <br/><br/>The digital editing done in the film was a good way to make it seem as if it took place in the 1930s. The editing of the color into a sepia tone really created a southern old time feel. The computer-generated cattle were also another good technique used. This just helped the film look more authentic during the scenes where the cattle were included."

","This is actually one of my favorite Clooney films. Y'see there's these three soggy guys by the names of Everett (Clooney) Pete (Turturro) and Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson), who escape from a chain gang and embark on a journey acrost the state of Mississippi in the depression era 1930s. Loosely following Homer's Odyssey, they jump from one frying pan into the next fire, and over again. They get lost, get saved (a marvelous baptism scene) and manage to squeeze themselves into the strangest musical renditions and dance sequences imaginable. Clooney gives a classic performance as a character I can best describe as the humanized version of Foghorn Leghorn: a know-it-all who loves to hear himself speak. Then there's Pete played by John Turturro who's a grumpy guy along for the ride. At the bottom of this food chain gang is Delmar played by Tim Blake Nelson. Ole Delmar is a simple fellow with a good heart who's trying to keep a clean spirit in leu of the events these characters become involved in. Woven into this deep South motif are a black blues singer who sold his soul to the devil, two shady candidates for the guvna's office, and a one eyed Bible salesman played by John Goodman. There's so many things to notice in this film. There's a looney tunes quality, but also a very realistic quality, portraying the Depression era politics and poverty to a T. There's also a three stooges quality, and the at the same time a very Preston Sturgess humanist thing. It's the perfect balance for me but quite possibly the coolest thing about this film is the music, topping off that old timey look the film has. It's awesome bluegrass, delta blues, and gospel music and it's a character of it's own in the film. Long live the Coens."

Ulysses(Clooney) has been informed by a cell mate that he has buried over one million dollars and that it will be underwater due to a project creating a man made lake in four days time. The escaping convicts meet hobos on the railways and encounter a Christian revival and are baptized along the way.

","I get just the biggest kick out of this picture. So much so that I regularly listen to the film's soundtrack and have been inspired to memorize the words to 'The Big Rock Candy Mountain"". That song singularly captures the whimsical nature of the picture, and prefaces the adventurous escapades of our hero trio - 'In the Big Rock Candy Mountain, all the jails are made of tin, and you can walk right out again as soon as you are in.' <br/><br/>Not being a fan of George Clooney, I thought he did an exceptional job here as the nominal leader of the chain gang misfits that make a break for it on the road to fame and fortune. It's only later that we come to realize that Everett's quest is really to reunite with his wife and kids, and dispel the notion that he was hit by a train. Clooney's given all the best lines by virtue of his good looks and snappy delivery, and his 'dumber than a bag of hammers' line is one I'm apt to use from time to time myself.<br/><br/>So everyone knows by now that the story is based on Homer's 'Odyssey', but I haven't heard anyone yet make a connection to one of my favorite childhood films. Remember when Everett, Pete (John Turturro) and Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson) pop up over the hedge and join the procession at the Klan rally. Wasn't it oddly reminiscent of ""The Wizard of Oz""? The only thing missing was Delmar trying to tuck a tail underneath his robe. And say, didn't Pete look a lot like the scarecrow? <br/><br/>To sum it up - good story, cool characters, witty dialog and a great musical score make this a favorite of mine, and probably the first Coen Brothers film to get my attention enough to seek out their other pictures. This one though is the one I'll keep coming back to watch again and again, it's that entertaining."

","Maybe the perfect adventure film, this instant Coen classic is impossible to turn away from. Though it makes no mistake about its influences - an early title card immediately identifies the picture as an adaptation of Homer's Odyssey - the brilliance of O Brother is in its departures from the source material, which come so frequently that the carryovers (the Sirens, the Cyclops, the protagonist's escape from captivity) are celebrated as nods and winks, expected but also unexpected. George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson are perfectly cast as the charismatically brainless scoundrels at the story's epicenter, while guest spots from John Goodman, Holly Hunter and Charles Durning take the whole mess over the top. Amazingly rich, sharp-witted, engrossing stuff that's accompanied by an all-time favorite of a soundtrack."

The film is also more period oriented than any other Coen film. It is full of convincing sets and a good amount of extras. Roger Deakins' fantastic cinematography is a highlight, using color lenses for dramatic and comedic effect was one of the smartest decisions the Coens made with this one.

"matthewhylnd","10","0","0","16 March 2011"," Plot, Cinematic elements and relations to Homers ""The Odyssey""
","O Brother, Where art Thou? This movie is a comedy with a strange plot. The movie has household name actors playing very weird roles. The theme in this movie is one of an ill advised adventure which ends in disaster. The movie is set in the Deep South during the 1930's. The depression is in full swing and the scenes of the movie depict a desperate time in American history.<br/><br/>There are three stars in this movie George Clooney, Everett, John Turturro, Pete, and Tim Blake Nelson, Delmar. The movie centers around these three escape convicts who are the search for a hidden treasure. These hapless characters find adventure in many different ways such as a seductive episode at a river bed, a short lived radio broadcasting career, and an unbelievable ending to the wacky adventure. Although these adventures are side tracks to the real plot of finding the treasure that Everett so desperately wants to steal.<br/><br/>A few of the cinematic elements are music and editing. The music relates to the popular song the trio sang ""Man of Constant Sorrow"". They assumed the stage name of the Soggy Bottom Boys. In the movie this was a hit, but also in real life this song was played all over the radio. I wonder if it was more of a joke than actual talent but none the less it was entertaining. The second cinematic element that makes the movie a success is the editing. There are scenes in the movie where the scene cuts away and when it returns it leaves some question as to what actually happened. This is most evident in the Siren's scene by the river.<br/><br/>The movie is accidentally based off the story by Homer ""The Odyssey"". I have read many reports that the writers did not intend it to resemble The Odyssey. The similarities are vague and were changed enough to not be an exact copy of The Odyssey. However, one cannot deny that the subtle changes in the movie resembles Homers classic tale. I am sure that is Homer was alive he would have been thrilled that his story became a Hollywood spectacle.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I think that this is a top notch movie to watch. The adventure for the trio is surely ill advised but considering their alternative it seemed like a good idea. It has comedy that will make you laugh, action to make your heart race, and an ending that is unpredictable."
"wild308","10","0","0","12 February 2011"," Reformation and Progress in ""O Brother Where Art Thou""
","Like many aspects of the movie ""O Brother Where Art thou"", the title is an allusion of an allusion. The Coen Brothers themselves have been quoted as saying that the title references the fictional book of the same name in Preston Sturges' 1941 film Sullivan's Travels. In this earlier movie, John Sullivan, a movie producer, is on a search for a better movie based on the adaptation of the fictional book, ""O Brother Where Art Thou"". This title is itself an allusion to the novels of Steinbeck and ultimately even to the story of Cain and Abel in the book of genesis. In the Coens' movie, O Brother Where art thou, the characters are on a search for literal treasure. In neither of these movies do the characters find what they are looking for. The viewer too, may not find precisely what they are looking for. Indeed, if one expected to find a story as ""fine"" as Gulliver's Travels or one whose moral is as universal as the story of Caine and Abel, Sullivan's travels would fall short. As would any viewer be disappointed if they expected the movie ""O Brother, where art thou"" to be, as the character John Sullivan would, a serious movie that about the plight of the downtrodden. following the trail of these allusions places the viewer too on kind of treasure hunt, never ultimately finding what we are looking for.<br/><br/>The most overt allusion that the movie draws from, The Odyssey, seems conversely to give the viewer the most ""treasure"". Odysseus is there in the veil of Everett Ulysses McGill as are his shipmates and family. The angry gods make appearances, as do the sirens, the Cyclops and many more. However, the quality and scope of these characters seems to have degenerated throughout the ages. Instead of Odysseus (Ulysses in Latin) the great king overcoming great woes to guide his men home and return to his loving family, we are presented with Everett, a two-bit con man who fools his men into helping him return to his estranged family. The family too seems degenerate. Odysseus' wife is utterly faithful and goes to all length to fight off her suitors. His son is a brave prince who tries everything to find his father. Everett's wife Penny, on the other hand, is ashamed of her estranged husband. She lies to her daughters and tells them that Everett has been hit by a train, and plans to marry her ""suitor"". After seeing her, Everett even calls her a ""succubus"". The Coens seem to have gone out of their way to deprive the characters of ""O Brother Where Art Thou"" of any vestige of the heroism and greatness that their forebears once possessed. A one-eyed bible salesman has replaced the great Cyclops, the sirens are now just highway robbers and ancient Greece has become 1930's Mississippi. Even the comic narrative of ""O Brother Where Art Thou"" proves inferior in quality to that of the epic Odyssey. In framing their degenerate narrative in such sharp contrast to the heroic Odyssey, the Coens do more than invite comparison. They have re-formed the Odyssey and emerged with something poignantly less. In doing so, they seem to hint at the fact that reform is not synonymous with progress.<br/><br/>This idea is one that recurs again and again in the movie, but never as noticeably as in the side-story of Pappy"" O'Daniel. Pappy, is the governor of Mississippi. Pappy is shown to be a fat autocrat. However, his opponent, Homor Stokes, the ""reform candidate"", is shown to be much worse. He is, in fact the leader of the KKK. We even find out that the nature of Homer's political reform is to combat racial integration in Mississippi. Again, we see the idea of reform leading to a reversal of progress.<br/><br/>One notable exception to this idea comes in the form of radio. No doubt, the radio represents a ""reformation"" of technology, and yet it also is a positive image in this movie. Everett and his men are helped in a way that Odysseus could not be by the power of mass communication. ""The Suggy Bottom Boys"" are first made famous by their songs on the radio and then later use radio to vanquish Homor Stokes. No doubt, radio is a prime example of how re-formation can be positive. ""O Brother Where Art Thou"" does not seem to present the idea of reform as strictly positive or negative. Instead, we are offered a different image: that of manic depression. This notion is made manifest in the movie by the character of Baby Face Nelson.<br/><br/>In the last scene of the movie, we are presented with an image of a flood washing away a valley. Everett explains that the entire state will be put on hydroelectricity, which will bring in an ""age of reason"" and put an end to ""backward"" ways. Indeed, the viewer knows that Everett's prophecy has come true. Since the 1940's America has been re-formed by electricity. However, given the ambivalence with which the movie treats the idea of reform, perhaps Everett's optimism is premature. It is ultimately left to the viewer to decide whether the vast reform of America brought about by technology is, like radio, a cultural progression, or else like the narrative of the movie itself, a step-backwards."

If you know the Odyssey, the movie gets better. The movie is a bit of a musical, but they don't just randomly burst into music. When they sing anything it is always live.

From becoming a recording act called the Soggy Bottom Boys to a bank robber to sirens...it's almost like Forrest Gump in a way I guess. The ridiculous cast of characters they stumble upon are surprising and enjoyable. It's a feel good movie despite the fact that so many things go wrong but in a Coen brothers sort of way.

","The Coen brothers' refreshingly splendid adaptation of Homer's 'The Odyssey' is a treat to watch. Like many of their movies, it is one that you want to revisit again soon. Though essentially a comedy, it is layered with subtleties such as the poignancy of the themes, the metaphors and symbolism. An example is when the prisoners loosely tied together in chains sharply contrast with the daughters loosely tied together with twine.<br/><br/>The brothers wonderfully capture the essence of the 1930s Southern America. Their attention to detail through language, costumes, sets, music and the gestures of the actors and extras is commendable to say the least. The writing is eloquent and the layered humour, whether satirical, slapstick, situational or metaphorical always made one laugh out loud.<br/><br/>The sepia tinted colouring adds to the heated 30's atmosphere. The Coen brothers have an ear for music as they always manage to get the right music director who knows to pick the right songs. In addition, the songs themselves are very satisfying to the ears and mind and in this case, they are visualized fantastically.<br/><br/>Blake Nelson, Clooney and Torturro are superb as the '3 idiots' on the run. They play their roles very naturally each assuming the roles of the naive one, the impulsive one and the intellectual one. John Goodman was a surprising casting decision as he's like you have never seen before.

","Despite the ""based on Homer's The Odyssey"" credit at the beginning of the film, Ethan and Joel Coen claim to have never read the book. It's hard to believe otherwise, because aside from explicit plot references to the great Greek poet O Brother, Where Art Thou is a pure piece of Coen extravaganza: iconic characters, silly names, absurd situations and dialogue worth remembering.<br/><br/>The brothers' fourth ""comedy"" (after Raising Arizona, Barton Fink and The Hudsucker Proxy) tells the story of three convicts (George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson) who manage to break out of jail and set out to find a buried treasure (1.2 million dollars) somewhere in a Depression-stricken Mississippi. Everett Ulysses McGill (Clooney), a man who knows how to talk his way out of trouble, is also determined to win back the love of his wife Penny (Holly Hunter). During their colorful journey they run into a trumpet player who says he has sold his soul to the Devil and form a country music band to avoid regular people's suspicions, something that ought to come in handy when law enforcers, an evil salesman (John Goodman) and even the Ku Klux Klan are looking for them.<br/><br/>O Brother, Where Art Thou? is a light affair, but that doesn't make it less satisfying than other Coen brothers pictures: alongside their usual care for dialogue and performance (Clooney and Turturro are the standouts), plenty of plaudits should go to their reconstruction of the historical period the movie takes place in, particularly through Roger Deakins' Oscar-nominated cinematography. In addition, given the story, the soundtrack is another source of joy, especially when the Soggy Bottom Boys (that would the stage name used by the main characters) perform in front of an audience. It's a hilarious film filled with vitality and happiness, and a strangely optimistic piece of work coming from the Coens.<br/><br/>In short, this is another artistic triumph for cinema's most talented brothers, definitely worth watching, even if you haven't read the (alleged) source material."

","Charming is a word I'd never thought I'd use to describe a Coen Brothers film, who previously have treated us to such violent extremities as bodies being jammed into wood chippers, and pneumatic cattle guns pulverising foreheads. O Brother Where Art Thou? Is on the surface a simplistic comedy/adventure story, but in true Coen Brothers fashion, nothing is as it seems.<br/><br/>O Brother, Where Art Thou is set in Mississippi, 1937, as the Great Depression nears its end. George Clooney plays Ulysses McGill, a scheming, energetic criminal who flees the roadside as prisoners smash rocks. Unfortunately for him he's chained to two dim-witted co-escapees, and even after the chains are off they stick together to find the loot Ulysses buried before being prosecuted.<br/><br/>The film is partially based on Homer's epic Greek poem, Odyssey, and many of the famous episodes from it have had a typical Coen twist of character and quirk to fit with the different time, space and the sensibilities associated with the Depression-era South. Instead of the monstrous Cyclops, there's a boisterous, deceptive one-eyed bible seller. The allusions to Odyssey are expertly weaved, avoiding indulgence and not seeming forced. Each character and situation seem to naturally belong in the world the Coens create, like The Big Lebowski and Fargo, the bizarre universe of O Brother is full of human behavioural traits and actions we can recognise, but still laugh at the ridiculousness of.<br/><br/>There are references to other cultural tales, Tommy Johnson, a blues musician in the film claims to have perfect guitar skills after selling his soul to the devil, a reference to real life urban legend of blues musician Robert Johnson doing the same in return for a mastery of the guitar. Even the title is based upon the film-within-a-film from Preston Sturges's Sullivan's Travels, the director in the film wishes to make a Depression-era stark-realistic drama but gradually realises that a comedy would be much more beneficial. Conversely in O Brother the mood of the period is one that in theory wouldn't lend to the comedic material the Coens devise, one of the bleakest points in American social history is somehow reworked into a time of vibrancy and assorted excitement.<br/><br/>Mythology in all its forms is both an important influence on the narrative, and a plot point in itself. Ulysses, his jail buddies and the blues musician record a version of ""Man of Constant Sorrow"" for a radio station after hearing they can make some quick bucks from just ""singing into a can"". The song travels fast through the state of Mississippi and the mysterious ""Soggy Bottom Boys"" are a hit. The mythology surrounding them brings people together in speculation and idolisation, so when they show up on stage at a dinner party the crowd goes wild. Even the politicians get in on it, as the running candidate for governor jumps on stage and dances along to help his failing campaign. The Coens both celebrate and explore the power of myths, of legends and word-of-mouth for our culture.<br/><br/>I earlier referred to this film as charming, which is a clear understatement considering how hilarious, uplifting and exciting this film is. But charm is appropriate too, due to one of the best uses of music in recent years. The bluegrass/folk music is at the core of the films ever-changing mood, and vital to expressing each varying episodes' tone. From the opening scene of prisoners singing as they smash rocks, the unified beat provided by their labour, we know that music going to be important in the film. George Clooney excels himself as Ulysses McGill, providing excellent comedic timing while playing off his two sidekicks with quick wit and guile. Who knew George Clooney was such a funny performer? The physical comedy is done wonderfully too, as in the scene with Ulysses taking two punches in quick succession, Clooney widens his eyes and flits his head to the side twice to shrug off the punches as he circles his opponent. The rest of the cast are all impressive, providing another amusing array of Coen caricatures. Forming a delightful comedy trio with Clooney are Tim Blake Nelson and John Turturro, the group has masses of chemistry  The film could simply be the three arguing for the entire duration and it would be just as funny. Even with the quick-paced plot, the two supporting performers give the characters personality and depth.<br/><br/>It's noteworthy that this is the first film in Hollywood to be entirely colour-corrected digitally. The film has a distinct, sepia-toned hue, reminiscent of old photographs, framing the landscapes in the period of the great depression, immersing us in that old lost time. O Brother, Where Art Thou? is a unique film in the Coen's canon, never have they made such a purely joyous film  and they may never again. But for now, O Brother is deservedly up there with their best."

","Fans of blue grass music and slapstick comedy will be delighted by this depression-era adventure. However, those looking for a modern-day rendition of Homer's The Odyssey will be rather disappointed. Although parallels are evident, O Brother, Where Art Thou? has an entirely different storyline, and fails to make deeper connections to the epic poem.<br/><br/>The majority of the Coen Brothers' references to The Odyssey involve same (or similar) names. Examples of this would include the Sirens, Ulysses and Odysseus, and, Penelope and Penny. While their names may sound alike, their behaviors certainly aren't. Take Ulysses and Odysseus for example; Odysseus was portrayed as a man of great strength, wit, and god-like qualities. Ulysses Everett McGill, on the other hand, possessed no extraordinary talents, and focused more on how his hair looked than his future. Similarly, Homer's Penelope remained loyal to her husband for twenty years, while the Coen Brother's Penny got engaged to a ""suitor,"" even telling her children that their father had died. (Wasn't it a little odd that the children called their mother's fiancé a suitor?) Finally, Homer's Sirens were more than just seductive beauties doing the laundry. They signified Odysseus' ability to generally resist women, quite the contrary of Ulysses. Aside from the ""Big Dan"" reference to the Cyclops, which seemed rather arbitrary, and a few other obvious allusions, the Coen brothers failed to emphasize the essential themes of The Odyssey, such as loyalty. While the Coen Brothers were unable to successfully translate The Odyssey, I do believe it is possible to be triumphant in producing a modern-day rendition of it. A different setting would be necessary, along with a more clever way of disguising Homer's original story. <br/><br/>Funny, witty, and entertaining, O Brother, Where Art Thou? is everything but a modern-day translation to The Odyssey."
"Mahwongtonsoup","6","0","0","31 December 2007"," Comparison: O Brother, Where Art Thou? to The Odyssey
","In the Movie, O Brother, Where Art Thou?, it successfully translates the epic, The Odyssey, into a more modern perspective. To start, both of the stories begin in the middle. In the Odyssey, it starts with Odysseus trapped on Calypso's island, and then it explains the previous events. Also, the three men from O Brother, Where Art Thou?, are escaping a labor farm without explaining how they got there. Both main characters are embarked on a seemingly impossible journey. Odysseus must travel across oceans to return home to his family, and Everett escapes from the chain gang with the help of his loyal, yet ignorant friends, Pete and Delmar. Odysseus also had followers, or a crew, and at times there are parallels to the foolishness of Odysseus' crew and Everretts friends Pete and Delmar. Odysseus' crew for example were the ones who cut open the bag of winds, which blew their ship off course, and they also killed cows that belonged to Helios, the god of Sun. Consequently, Pete is the one who led the trio to the sirens, who seduced the three, taking Pete.<br/><br/>Another Parallel between the Odyssey and O Brother, Where Art Thou? is that the Antagonist in both works first appears to be hospitable, but turns out to hostile. Polyphemus for example welcomed Odysseus and his crew, but soon enough was swallowing his men whole. Also, Big Dan had a picnic with Everett and Delmar and making business with them. Suddenly he is clubbing them both with a large branch and taking their money. One of the most notable similarities is the Planning, or the idea of the main characters wife remarrying. Penelope, Odysseus' wife is plagued by the marriage-thirsty suitors. A coincidence is that Penny, Everett's wife is similar to the name Penelope, which is Odysseus' wife. Also, both Odysseus and Everett disguised themselves in order to get close to their wives and make sure they don't remarry. What seems to be another coincidence is that both Penny and Penelope doubt that the concealed man is actually their husband. Finally, it seems peculiar how both stories are portrayed in almost a foreign worlds, with the different lingo and phrases as well as customs and motives. With the numerous parallels in both plot and theme, The Coen Brothers Successfully translated the epic, The Odyssey, into a more modern film, O Brother, Where Art Thou?<br/><br/>-Dwizzle<br/><br/>P.S.

","In the movie O Brother Where Art Thou?, the Coen Brothers were unsuccessful in comparing it to the novel The Odyssey. There were some similarities such as the idea of returning home and certain obstacles such as the Sirens. It fails to relate to The Odyssey's underlying themes of hospitality and loyalty. Although they have story lines relating to journeys home, they are still entirely different. In The Odyssey, Odysseus is perceived as a godlike hero. However, in O Brother Where Art Thou?, Everett fails to think about his actions. Also, when the Sirens sing to Everett, Pete, and Delmar, all of them become lurred into there song. However, in The Odyssey, Odysseus is able to withstand there singing. This shows his strength and resistance toward making fast decisions. Also, when Odysseus is away, his wife Penelope remains loyal to him for twenty years. However, in O Brother Where Art Thou?, Everett returns to find his wife Penny engaged. All of these examples display how the movie O Brother Where Art Thou failed to relate to The Odyssey. The Coen Brothers failed to create a modern day movie based on The Odyessy. The novel The Odyssey strongly portrays hospitality and loyalty to others and to the gods. In the ancient Greek times, these themes were expressed during everyday life. For example, in The Odyssey, Menelaus invites Odysseus into his home and treats him like loyalty. However, in modern day times these characteristics are barely ever used. This is present today through the 2008 presidential election. Many people are hesitant to vote for Hilary Clinton because she is a woman and Barack Obama because he is an African American. The difference between the movie and The Odyssey is due to different values present during there era."

","In the movie, O Brother Where Art Thou?, the Coen brothers unparalleled Homer's epic The Odyssey. Although both stories showed a journey home full of hardships, they still have vast differences. The movie characters were wondering around on their journey home and made decisions without thinking of the consequences or the downfalls at the time. However, Odysseus though out and planned every decision, which is one of the reasons he was a strong leader and well respected. The Odyssey doesn't translate well into a modern day movie. THis epic contains many ancient Greek values, such as hospitality and loyalty. Also, it shows how the Greeks felt the gods has an impact of everything in their lives. Odysseus supposively didn't get killed in the Battle of Troy, like his fellow soldiers because he was ""blessed by the gods"". Odysseus was looked up to no matter what decision he made by the people of Ithaca. However, today he would be compared to the president, which isn't always backed up by the people of the United States, such as the war in Iraq. Therefore, the values of the ancient Greeks are different from our modern day values."

","""O Brother Where Art Thou"" is an offbeat movie that strays from the usual Hollywood mold. It is entertaining and refreshing, yet misleading. The movie claims to be based on Homer's The Odyssey, but this is barely true. As of thirty minutes into the movie the plot references were barely evident. During the opening credits the connection is stated, yet for a good portion of time that is the only inclination to any similarities. In addition, the biggest connection between the two stories is the movie's allusions to the book, not the similarities in the plot. There are some plot connections, but they are different enough to change the story. Also, most of the connections are through words. For example, the only reference to Charybdis and Scylla is George Clooney's repetition of the phrase ""We're in a tight spot"" and there is no plot reference to this. This is one of several examples of the use of language to convey the similarities. Overall, the movie was good even though it was not exactly what it had claimed to be. <br/><br/>It is difficult to determine whether The Odyssey translates well into a modern day movie based on ""O Brother Where Art Thou"". This is because the movie is not completely based on the epic. Based on the movie at hand, The Odyssey translated well due to the creativity required to translate it. The Coen Brothers needed a great deal of creativity to translate several monsters and situations into a modern-day scenario. This led to clever and different situations such as the one-eyed bible sales man, the seductive Sirens, the tidal wave and so on. These were referring to Odysseus' encounters with Polyphemus, the Sirens and Athena's help. The Coen Brothers were geniuses for having the ability to successfully translate one of the oldest stories into an entertaining modern-day film."

","I think that the Coen Brothers did not do a good job of translating The Odyssey into a movie. I feel that it was too loosely based for them to even say it had something to do with epic by Homer. In addition I believe the few parts that were based on The Odyssey were so random that it had no effect on the movie whatsoever.<br/><br/>I do think however that making the Odyssey into a block-buster movie is very attainable. This is because of the possible special affects and scenery available to production companies now. In addition, they could've found a much better actor for the role of an Odysseus type character than George Clooney. I mean, he doesn't exactly resemble the Odysseus type of person I pictured, and the same goes for Penny (Penelope in the Odyssey, Penny in the movie). She didn't really seem like the type of person to play Penelope. My final comment is that there was no Telemachus. He had his 2 buddies from jail, but his children in the movie were all around 10 and under. He was a major character in the poem and was non-existent in the movie."

George Clooney captures almost all of the qualities of Odysseus. Cocky, brave, and somewhat clever. However, he does not have the quality of being looked upon as something semi-divine or a role model to other men. Also his wife does not seem to want him the least bit back while in the novel Penelope greives over her husband's ""death"" while in the film Everett's wife makes up his death herself. And Everett's two friends Pete and Dolmer. Who are they suppose to be? In my eyes they are the most random characters in the movie, considering Odysseus had to eventually find his way back on his own with a little help from the goddess Athena. In conclusion, although such things as John Goodman's character portraying the Cyclops, and the women by the river representing the Sirens, everything else is not what the Odyssey exactly is."

","Like all the Coen movies it's well-made and beautiful to look at and to listen to. It also has the common Coen problems- it isn't really ABOUT anything, and is kind of shaggy, and seems, once you step back and look at it, to have been primarily a stylistic exercise. But there's beauty and wit here, just the same. The music is well worth remembering. Still, there are nagging feelings- while everything in the movie WORKS, I get the feeling I didn't experience as much beauty here as the brothers intended me to. I only recall feeling chills (for sheer beauty) one time, this in a film with many shots and songs included for beauty alone. This review sounds much more negative than it should, I rather liked the movie. I liked the Babyface Nelson stuff, the joke on local politics, the sirens, the toad, John Goodman beating people with a tree branch- there's plenty to like! But everything is at a distance, or else seems air-light and inconsequential,- for instance even allowing that it's a comedy and, being a Coen Bros film, is a play on style and stereotypes, does the viewer care if Clooney gets his wife and children back? I didn't. Nor do we mind much when it seems Pete has become a toad, nor when we find out he's been put back in a chain gang- nor, more importantly, does the movie seem to care. The only time one feels anything like concern for the characters is when they're about to be hung after having been pardoned- and even then my interest and my thoughts of ""How unfair!"" only lasted a second or two. Then I remembered what movie I was watching and thought, ""Oh, it's all so damn lackadaisical."" Anyway, seven points for style."
"DavidSim240183","10","0","0","21 March 2007"," Another Coen classic!
","The Coen Brothers are among the finest filmmakers in the world. Nearly every one of their films has been a delight in some way. They're just so unique. Bursting with ideas. And they're never less than engaging. And in the case of O Brother, Where Art Thou? they've made their first attempt at rewriting an already preexisting work of fiction, rather than adapted a story from scratch like their previous films. And what a film it is! O Brother may be a slightly disjointed tale, but its filled with so many fascinating characters, absorbing situations and catchy musical numbers that you're hooked.<br/><br/>Based (rather loosely) on Homer's Odyssey, the Coens' have taken a stab at reworking the story as a sort of unconventional road trip movie. And its a largely successful attempt. Set in 1937 during the height of the Great Depression in the Mississippi Delta, O Brother follows the adventures of three escaped convicts from a chain gang. The (self) elected leader of the group Ulysses Everett McGill (a surprisingly hilarious George Clooney). Pete (John Turturro). And Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson). One more dimmer than the last.<br/><br/>McGill is searching for buried loot he supposedly pillaged from an armoured truck robbery. Since he was chained to Pete and Delmar he had to bring them with him. Promising to cut them in on the stash, they begin an unforgettable adventure across the Deep South, encountering a diverse number of eccentrics, numerous run-ins with the law, finding fame as a singing trio, corrupt governors, the KKK and a race to reconcile McGill with his estranged wife Penny (Holly Hunter) before she remarries.<br/><br/>O Brother is a film that pulls us in quite a few different directions. Its a film of many sorts. One minute its a comedy, the next its a musical, some parts serious, and other parts tragic. It even touches upon mystical tones at times. In the hands of another director, O Brother could have emerged as a fragmented mess. But these are the Coen Bros. In all their films, their direction is masterful. And so it is here. They transform O Brother into a wonderfully rich, multilayered experience.<br/><br/>One thing that makes O Brother worth the price of admission is the sheer number of bluegrass music, gospel songs and blues numbers that populate the background. They're incredibly catchy, intensely hummable, and seriously memorable. They create an almost magical mysticism at times. Like the scene where McGill & Co encounter modern day Sirens. Three beautiful washerwomen who do nothing except sing. Its an eerie scene because even as they appraise these men, they still keep singing their hypnotic song.<br/><br/>Or the scene where they come across a communal Baptism. They're in the woods, when suddenly from out of nowhere people arrive in droves slowly walking to the lake to be baptised. They just keep walking and singing like in a trance. The music infuses these scenes with an almost tangible feeling of magic in the air.<br/><br/>But the one song that you have to hear is the one they sing as the Soggy Bottom Boys. They make a side-trip to a radio station just to earn some quick cash. But the song they come up with is an instant hit with people. And its a great song too! You'll be humming it for hours after the film's finished.<br/><br/>O Brother is filled with great actors from beginning to end. In fact I can't think of one single bad performance in the entire film. The acting is great all across the board. George Clooney is a revelation as the slick, fast-thinking McGill. He's never been as likable in any other film as he has here. Some of his slack-jawed facial expressions are hilarious. He's an entertaining leader. And Turturro and Nelson are comically endearing as his travelling companions.<br/><br/>John Goodman, a Coen regular appears halfway through as a surprisingly scary Bible salesman. I had no idea he could be so convincingly sinister. He at first emerges with his usual jovial personality, but when he crushes a toad with his bare hand, you'll see a side of him you never knew existed.<br/><br/>The Coens' trademark black humour crops up from time to time, even if it is a little restrained by their usual standards. In fact O Brother is surprisingly light for a Coen film. Except for one scene that's shocking in its audacity. An encounter with the KKK that turns into a choreographed dance number. Its a stunning scene that simultaneously highlights their evil, and their single minded mentality. It also shows you what the Coens' can get away with too.<br/><br/>As things draw to a close, quite a few of the films plot lines converge, involving a crooked election, the trio's last stand against the law, McGill's marriage and some divine intervention.<br/><br/>O Brother, Where Art Thou? is among the Coens' best work. The golden cinematography gloriously highlights the film. The different individual vignettes takes us on a marvellously entertaining trip through the Deep South, and the eclectic actors and their performances make the film into a real treat.<br/><br/>Unmissable!"

","Like most of the Coen brothers films, I think this one takes repeated viewings to really ""get it"". Yes, it's a comedy, but it's not some stupid Adam Sandler drivel. It's got depth. And while some here have said the characters lack depth, I must disagree! They are all quirky, but the lead, Ulyses Everet McGill - he had a depth of character that I think could even have carried him, as a character into other movies. Quirky - hell yeah - he's a candidate for the quirkiest character in any movie I've ever seen - but it works in this movie.<br/><br/>I'd say as well, that this is the highest review I will ever give for a pro-Christian movie. :) You may have to read back a few reviews to see what I mean, but I do mean it.<br/><br/>This is a movie about salvation. Plain and simple. While his cohorts gain salvation the easy way (southern baptism), Everet spends the whole movie EARNING his salvation, which he plainly gets at the end of the movie, as he asks for salvation in front of the devil (and his hound dog), and is granted said salvation in one of the strangest manners you are likely to see.<br/><br/>But religious or not, I liked the characters in this movie, almost without fault. And the historical nature of seeing the likes of Tommy Johnson (the first rock guitarist), and George ""Baby Face"" Nelson (Reputed bank robber), just added a nice touch of 1930s.<br/><br/>And I would be remiss if I didn't mention that this has to be, without a doubt, for me at least, the movie with the most memorable lines of all time. From ""I'll be a sonofabitch - Delmar's been saved"" to ""How's my hair"", or ""I don't want Fop - I'm a Dapper Dan man!"" - this movie has some memorable dialog.<br/><br/>My highest rating, and a must-own DVD!"

","This 2000 film from the Coen brothers, Ethan and Joel, features the adventures of three southern men criss-crossing the South and encountering different Southern legends and famous features. The adventurers consist of two rather slow, if likable men, Delmar and Pete, (Tim Blake Nelson and John Turturro, both fantastic in signifying slow reaction times) and a smooth-talking would-be renaissance man, Everett (George Clooney, playing a role which the smooth Clooney imbues his character with naïve short-sightedness typical of many would-be smooth-talkers) cross the south, encountering many archetypes and legends of the area as they go. <br/><br/>Joel and Ethan Coen have done a fantastic job of linking many tales of the South and connecting the characters to this voyage by taking as their framework, Homer's The Odyssey in which the characters had adventures all occurred within one day. The film opens with the main characters working on the chain gang and seeming northerner (and coincidentally the schemer?) Clooney concocting a scheme whereby he and some other men can escape and thereby return to his wife (the versatile Holly Hunter, playing Penny, Everett's tough but exasperated estranged wife) before she re-marries. They cross The mythical Crossroads, the site supposedly where guitarist Robert Johnson sold his soul to the devil in exchange for amazing guitar-playing abilities where they pick up a man obviously envisioned as a stand- in for Johnson, Tommy Johnson (Chris Thomas King), and with him they perform ""black music"" for a blind record producer to whom they tell they tell some sly and very funny lies. Pete and Delmar are baptized and re-born while would-be renaissance man Everett mocks their sudden reverence for what he regards as foolish superstition. They encounter a particularly psychotic religious huckster in Big Dan Teague (a fantastic John Goodman). The Klan is also lampooned hilariously and savagely. Some have critiqued this film for being less than the sum of its parts but I think that this criticism misses the mark. Although the settings might be distinct, the use of The Odyssey to tie these sites together seems to me to provide enough structure to give the film a narrative coherence. And to be honest, even were the narrative of The Odyssey not used, I believe that the examination of many Southern features also provides the film with a thematic constancy. And even were that not so, I believe that the notion that the film is too varied in tone is not really a legitimate criticism. I don't see that there is a lot of criticism of many big Hollywood films which are narratively incoherent, let alone consistent in tone and I believe that the variety of concerns which Coen address make for an interesting and rich film tapestry."

","When tackling Homer's 'Odyssey' within a modern medium, the question is not only how do you abbreviate it, but what modern underpinnings can you apply? For example, Steely Dan used the blues idiom infused with self-deprecating irony to produce a deceptively simple reinterpretation.<br/><br/>Here, the Coens have to rely on movie phrasing to permit audience digestion. Visibly, we have ""Ulisse"", ""I Am A Fugitive.../The Man Who Broke 1000 Chains"" (with Durning as the anchor), ""Sullivan's Travels"", ""Crossroads"", ""Dillinger"", etc.<br/><br/>But the key is, all of this is reconstructed on top of the Coens' own ""Raising Arizona"" reimagined as a musical. The combination of real place/surreal events/surreal characters plainly derives from that earlier work. Goodman even replicates his earlier fight scene.<br/><br/>And this is better than most musicals, because the musical narrative is not a 'separate reality' imposed on top of the 'movie reality', but seamlessly integrated to serve both the art and the story.<br/><br/>A fun little journey."

The Coens are not taking things too seriously this time around, as if incorporating the highbrow structure of re-doing Homer freed them to concentrate on entertainment and audience immersion instead of arty flourishes.<br/><br/>You really feel like you are back in 1937, with the attention to detail in look and sound. When Ulysses curses about his favorite hair pomade not being available in a general store, the proprietor admonishes him this is ""a public place"" and he won't stand for such talk. The ""old-timey"" musical score put the film on the map, and you get a rich gumbo of bluegrass and Jimmie Rodgers-era country music, with some blues and gospel thrown in. It's such a throwback, it comes across as exotic. Then again, you could say the same of the whole film.<br/><br/>Some of the bits work better than others. John Goodman, great in the otherwise erratic Coen Brothers film ""The Big Lebowski,"" is a weak link as the film's version of Homer's menacing Cyclops, and Holly Hunter is a bit one-note as Ulysses' adamantine wife.<br/><br/>But any weaknesses are easy to overlook when you get such wonderful bits as the campaign of Gov. O'Daniel (Charles Durning, never better), a bank-heist spree with George ""don't call him Babyface"" Nelson and Stephen Root's deliciously goofy turn as a bug-eyed music promoter who re-directs Ulysses' fortunes. The music is very cleverly integrated throughout the film; even the Ku Klux Klan gets to perform a pretty cool number.<br/><br/>Watching ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" you'll wonder where the time went, and want to see it again for all the clever bits of Coen business you missed the first time. And if that last image of the film isn't forever burned in some corner of your mind, there is something serious wrong with your soul."

","""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" is odd yet you have an itch to finish it if you were to be interrupted halfway through the movie. It is based off the Oddysey, and at first you find that funny but if you think about it, many things relate to the book, which I never read yet only know about through referrals in another book.<br/><br/>Some relations are the fact that George Clooney plays a man named Ulysses Everett McGill, and Ulysses is Roman for Oddyseus (however your spell that). Also, the sexy sirens ""bewitching"" Pete, which some supernatural woman did to most of the men in the Oddysey. The wife's name is Penny, which I think has some relationship to a woman named Penelope in the book. My friend mentioned some similarities (she has read the book) by being given some impossible tasks such as ""get the ring from a 9,000 ft. lake."" The sheriff with the hound is said to be like Poseidon, because he was chasing after ""Everett"" throughout the movie.<br/><br/>This was an enjoyable movie, not on my top 25 list but most-likely on my top 100. George Clooney and Tim Blake Nelson stole the show to me, though other characters such as Tommy Johnson and the one-eyed Bible Salesman (I don't know his name) were a hoot, too."

While some may be turned off by the ""strange"" themes and circumstances, anyone who had read, heard of, and/or liked the Odyssey will most likely enjoy this film. All the actors do their part well, especially Clooney who (while his role may seem a tad reminiscent of his other work) does a very nice job of portraying the main protagonist.<br/><br/>The biggest treat out of all is the movie's score. The score is absolutely wonderful, featuring all variety of original music by popular artists such as Alison Krauss and Gillian Welch.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a good movie for those who enjoy any one of the genres it falls under.

","Entertaining if somewhat ultimately silly picaresque tale set in the rural South of the 1930's. George Clooney is the brainy member of a trio of escaped convicts whose unlikely and sometimes scarcely believable adventures comprise the storyline. The photography is wonderful, the characterizations generally very good. Along the way they become unexpected recording stars when their spontaneous performance at a rural radio station strikes a chord with listeners. For those who might doubt John Turturro's credibility as a rural hick, check out his performance here. Holly Hunter has a minor role as Clooney's wife who has told their kids he was dead. Charles Durning is a hoot as the Governor of Mississippi. One scene that struck me as somewhat strange was the Ku Klux Klan scenario toward the end of the film. Certainly worth watching for escapist fare, and you might be entertained by the music, too, as so many were."

","I recently saw this for the first time and was very pleasantly surprised. This is a very thoughtful, well done film all around. John Turtorro is a terrific actor, capable of portraying an amazing range of characters (it's hard to imagine that this is the same person who very effectively played the nerdy Herb Stempel in ""Quiz Show""). But I also think George Clooney and Tim Blake Nelson did very fine work here as well. <br/><br/>The Coen Brothers clearly took a chance in adapting Homer's work to a Southern Depression-Era setting, but the gamble paid off handsomely, and we are given a very amusing story, beautiful to look at, with wonderful cinematography. The authentic recreation of the Depression Era was masterful, right down to the minutest detail. The music is great and very fitting. The scene with the three sirens on the river is one of the most unusual and haunting ever created  you will be as stunned as the three protagonists appear the first time you see it.<br/><br/>All in all, a wonderful film - one you'll want to look at several times."

","The best Coen films are usually the ones that have extreme quirks like the one and only ""Barton Fink"". Here, however, the muddled storyline is too ordinary or to put it another way, the Coens seem to want some kind of mainstream acceptance that has otherwise not been their goal before. The cast does well in their respective roles but there is something too familiar about the whole set up. Yes, there were a lot of rural dramas in the 30's and 40's but the Coens seem too much in love with these movies to satirize them. That means that it is more of an homage than reinterpretation and that's a shame because they had so good luck with their ode to screwball comedy ""The Hudsucker Proxy."" All the Coens' favorites are here including John Goodman, John Turturro and Holly Hunter but most of the time is wasted on crass southern stereotypes and to make fun of them is acceptable but it's annoying to see it for the umpteenth time. The best thing about this is the tinted photography which gives the film a worn out look that goes great with the rural setting. Otherwise, this can only be described as a failed effort but even low-grade Coen is better than almost every other movie so I have continued to see their movies because which other director/writer/producer team do the U.S. have that are more than just providers of pop corn entertainment."

","The Coen brothers continually astound me... and I'm not sure if that is a good thing. Every time I think I've figured them or their films out, they pull one over on me. The Hudsucker Proxy had some great humor, but was mostly a homage to old comedies. Fargo was somewhat weird and oddly repetitive, but had plenty of great humor. The Man Who Wasn't There is an excellent noir film. Intolerable Cruelty was very funny. All of them had great writing and dialog. Then, around comes this... what is it, anyway? A fresh interpretation of The Odyssey? The film revolves around Everett, a man on the run from the law with the other two thirds of his chain gang. He goes through many trials and tribulations throughout the just over 90 minutes the film lasts, until the conflict is finally resolved. The plot is fine, but there seems to be a nearly unlimited number of characters that just show up, serve their purpose and disappear. The pacing is daft. The characters are fairly well-written and credible. The dialog and script is well-written, as is expected from the Coen's. The acting is very good all-round. The humor works some of the time. The quirkiness of some characters makes for some good laughs, but that's about it. All in all, a fairly forgettable Coen brothers' film. I recommend this to fans of the Coen brothers and the actors involved. Fine for a single viewing. 7/10"

The Odysseian framework of the story enables an easy transition into a mythical spiritual journey to self awareness and the power of being and love. Far and away Clooney's best performance. The music contained in the movie is one of American legend. From the ""crossroads"" tales of Robert Johnson, the Bible belt gospel of Alison Krauss, and the other songs which still today defy categorization, such as ""Man of Constant Sorrow"" and ""Didn't Leave Nobody but the Baby"", by an array of artists who themselves easily fall outside the pigeonholes.

","Three cons in depression-era Mississippi escape from a work farm and embark on a strange series of misadventures in which they are chased by the police, record a hit record, hook up with a bank robber, are waylaid by three sirens, get ambushed by a bible salesman, rescue a man from the Klu Klux Klan, get pardoned by the State Governor, and are saved from certain death by a divine flood.<br/><br/>Joel and Ethan Coen's strange but wonderful variation on Homer's Odyssey is delightful, filled with typically crackling dialogue (""Friend, some of your folding money has come unstole !!"") and awash in great period music - blues, gospel, hillbilly yodelling, zydeco, what have you, supervised by T-Bone Burnett. Clooney, Turturro and particularly Nelson make for a fine latter-day version of the Three Stooges, with plenty of good-natured face-pulling and double-taking. The large cast all make the most of their tongue-twisting lines and good IL' boy wardrobes - I especially like Von Bargen as the Archetypal Coen Demon-Fiend, complete with hell-hound and sunglasses at night. The title of the movie comes from the film Joel McCrea wants to make (but never does) in Preston Sturges' brilliant Sullivan's Travels, and some of the characters are based on real people (King is legendary Delta bluesman Robert Johnson, for example). The links with Homer's epic poem are a bit tenuous to say the least - a guy estranged from his wife seeking to win her back, some sirens, a Cyclops (sort of) - and the script sometimes feels like it's a collection of funny episodes strung together rather than a coherent story, but it's so much fun that it doesn't really matter. Director of photography Roger Deakins captures a fabulous sepia-toned look to the rural scenes and there are plenty of wonderful visual touches - my favourite being the moment the flood comes and as everything is submerged a school of Clooney's Dapper Dan haircream tins perform an impromptu little aqua-ballet before our eyes. This is a wonderfully unique toe-tapping comedy."

","I'm pretty sure that when you tell people that this movie is a comedy that has been based on Homer's Odyssey, you'll get two reactions, but never a good one. Either they don't believe you, thinking that such a classic story can never become a good comedy, either they will not give the movie a try, because they are convinced that this will be much too difficult for them to understand or because they aren't familiar with the Greek writer and his work. No, tell everybody that this is a comedy from the Coen brothers and you'll be sure that you have an interested audience...<br/><br/>This movie tells the story behind the adventures of three escaped convicts. It's 1937 and the economic crisis weighs heavy on everyone. But the three man aren't exactly worrying about their financial status. They escaped from the jail chain-gang with the intention to pick up the the loot of a bank heist that Everett had stashed away near his home. But their way is long and difficult. They meet all kinds of strange characters (sirens, a bank robber, a campaigning Governor and his opponent, a KKK lynch mob, a blind prophet...), but don't have much time to really think about all that happens to them, because the house will soon be flooded by a newly built dam...<br/><br/>After watching this movie, I just needed a little break before I could go on with something else. The reason for that is quite simple: I had been laughing so hard that it almost started to hurt. This is an incredibly funny movie with some excellent humor in it. With this movie, the Coen Brothers really made an excellent adaptation of the ancient Odyssey, although ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" isn't exactly a title that reminded me of an old Greek writer. Before having all the correct information, I even believed that this movie had something to do with Shakespeare or someone from that time period.<br/><br/>It isn't a very strict 'translation' of the Odyssey of course, but it isn't too hard to find some similarities either (like for instance the sirens). But what would a movie be with a very good story when the acting isn't excellent? Indeed, nothing at all. But don't worry, George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson are absolutely brilliant. Their performances are amazing and I was especially surprised by Tim Blake Nelson. I can't remember that I've ever seen him play in another movie, but what he did here, only promises the best for the future.<br/><br/>All in all this is a wonderful comedy that will not only be loved by the people who are familiar with Homer's Odyssey. This movie has been based on it, but only loosely, leaving enough room for a new interpretation and some excellent humor. Add to this some very fine acting and you know that you have another hit from the Coen Brothers. I loved this movie and I can't remember that I've ever seen any comedy better than this one. That's also the reason why I believe that this movie doesn't deserve anything less than an 8.5/10."

Their odyssey leads them through some classical situations, but always with a humorous turn. Holly Hunter is Everett's beautiful but nagging wife, but his love for his daughters brings him back to the straight and narrow. Not only is the acting great, but the script is brilliant.

","Althoug many details are extremely far fetched, this story of rural Mississippi ca. 1935 has many realistic elements reminding of the ""dark side"" of life ""down South"" in the years prior to WWII. George Clooney is convincing as the street-wise and ""worldly"" self-appointed leader of a 3-man team escaping from a chain gang. The trio encounter a series of situations, including a recording-session at a make-shift studio owned by a blind radio station DJ, encounters with a bank robber, a shifty crook posing as Bible salesman, and several near-lynchings. Inbetween scenes we see a rivalry between the incumbent Governor and his radical challenger.<br/><br/>Several scenes are powerful testimony to the social injustices of the day. A secret nightly KKK rally is awe-inspiring. To see how an innocent man was to be ""offered up"" due to nothing other than his skin color is a shocking thing to view. Another vivid reminder of ""how things used to be"" is the sadistic prison official, who has a keen interest in ""law enforcement"" (namely lynchings).<br/><br/>Several critical moments turned out OK for our heroes, right down to the ""act of God"" towards the end, which gave a satisfying conclusion to the story.

There's plenty of Depression-era shenanigans and Southern fried humor throughout. Cinematographer Roger Deakins does here for color and the South what later he did for black and white and suburban California in his next collaboration with the Coen brothers, ""The Man Who Wasn't There."" He turns photographing shades, shadows, colors and textures into high art. This ain't no ""Fargo"", folks. It's not even as deep as say, oh, ""The Big Lebowski."" The Coen brothers really don't have much to say here, but I'll be damned if I didn't get caught up in the old timey spirit of it all.

I had absolutely no complaints with the film. I had no idea what the movie was about before renting it, but I was pleasantly surprised w/ the plot, characters, and soundtrack.   George Clooney does a great job in his portrayal of Everette Ulysses McGill, a modern-day Ulysses.  The chemistry between his character and those of the other jailmates (played by John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson) was memorable.  At times, I felt like I was watching an old episode of the Three Stooges. The soundtrack was another great aspect of the film.  I loved all the music, even though I am not usually a fan country or blue grass. Another asset to the movie was that it is good for ALL ages.

The south accent is very difficult to understand to a foreigner. So most of them had to rely on the subtitles, which can seldom do justice to movies. In this movie this problem is more severe, because this is not an action film. This film is heavily based on verbal dialogue, and you have to understand it in English to get it. Even when you know enough English to decipher the dialogue, whether you will find it funny or not is likely a function of your familiarity with the U.S. culture. If you need someone to blame after seeing the movie and not enjoying it, just blame whoever is importing these films into your country and marketing them as the next big thing... So, you are hereby warned..."

","While I enjoyed this movie very much and would definitely recommend it, I found George Clooney's character to be too smart.  The soundtrack was fabulous, especially the ""Soggy Bottom Boys.""  The movie alluded nicely to the story of Homer's Odyssey yet played around a little with some variations.  All-in-all a very good film."

","O Brother, Where Art Thou? has a very good and funny idea! Prisoner's escape and go to find a treasure. And for most of the film it works and is very funny! But there are many parts in this film where it is obvious that the Coen Brothers made this movie. The humor is very off at some points and the audiance that i saw this with i think aggreed with me! With scenes like: a bank robber shooting cows, A KKK meeting and midgets, ALL SET FOR LAUGHS, this movie turns from very funny to very creepy. I will give it about 2 out of 4 stars because some of the jokes are funny but the others are just disturbing."

","Watching the Coen brothers' latest is a strange experience; while certainly never boring, and always lovely to look at, the film somehow never manages to be fully involving. There are some amusing moments, three great performances from the leads, and a genuine feel for the Mississippi of the 30s.

","What a film this was! From its commencement with the words of Homer to its dynamic finish, this film was an extreme departure from the mediocrity of most mainstream film today. Its score, filled with lovely harmonies and dixieland style tunes, suited the film perfectly. I especially loved the song of the Sirens...<br/><br/>      Although the film was based upon the Odyssey by Homer, it bore little resemblance to the original, and was a delight in its own way. (Spoilers follow) John Goodman, with his one remaining eye was a dangerous Polyphemos, and of course, the Sirens by the riverbed and ""Penny"" rather than Penelope were all nods to Homer's epic. Yet what I loved about this movie was the way it built. Granted, it was a bit slow the first half hour, but once the audience realized the importance of Ulysses' journey and his need to reach his ""treasure,"" then the interest built and built. The most frightening moment by far occurred when the three convicts crashed the ""meeting"" of the secret society and beheld the unmasking of its leaders. In short, this movie was a definite departure from the mainstream and most definitely worth your $5. :)"

","""Oh Brother Where Art Thou"", unlike the Coen brothers' ""Fargo"" which was a mean-spirited parody on dumb talking Minnesotans, is rather a celebration of Southern culture, especially the twangy folk music.  Instead of picking on the people of Mississippi, the film glorifies a slower way of life, during the Depression, when the unhappiness and sorrow of poverty and inequality blended as naturally in song as the promise of a resurrection.  Taken loosely from Homer's ""Odyssey"",  the film follows three quirky convicts who escape from a chain-gang detail. Delmar (wonderfully played by Tim Blake Nelson) is the blank face, impressionable simpleton who could run to a uninvited baptism as easily as he could believe his friend had turned into a frog. Pete (equally well acted by John Turturro) is the moral compass, a man who sternly believes in right and wrong even if it means changing reality to fit his principles. Everett (George Clooney) is the articulate, agnostic universal man, a champion of expediency.  Together they immerse themselves into a real world they are ill-prepared to face.  The use of white is significant in three places, from the mesmerized people marching to the waters, to the muses by the river banks, to the KKK meeting and anticipated lynching.  Similarly the blind man is used initially as a prophet riding singularly on the rail, warning not the seek worldly treasures and then later on as a radio station owner who just happens to discover the 'soggy bottom boys'.  There are subplots too, involving the escapades of George 'Baby Face' Nelson, the governor's race between an inept incumbent and his sly challenger, and a fight by Everett to win back his wife and five girls. George Cooney's versatility really shines here.  The man who could take on the Iraqi army and a full Northeaster is just as comfortable comically acting out as one of the 'good ole boys'.  The Coen brothers finally got it right in fashioning good taste around satire.  In ""Oh Brother Where Art Thou"", life is really a series of serendipity events, in which being slow-witted becomes a virtue rather than a curse."

Then followed one memorable scene after another: hopping the train, the authorities, and one of the most erotic temptation scene in recent memory - though everybody keeps their clothes on. The movie is somewhat low-key and moderately paced, but combines the real with the surreal, the sad with the funny, and the sarcastic with the human touch and joy.

","Having gone through a horrid dry spell for good movies recently, which hit rock bottom when I found myself, out of desperation, watching Vertical Limit, the Coen Brothers have come through once again, and have they ever.<br/><br/>Let me start by stating that I'm biased - about 4 months ago I fell in with a few fellows playing old time music, so it's been on my mind lately. And what made this movie for me was definitely the music: The obvious hit is the Soggy Bottom Boys doing I Am A Man of Constant Sorrow, but the high points for me were the baptists singing Down to the River to Pray, The Siren Song, and Ralph Stanley providing the voice for O Death. The presence of Jerry Douglas on dobro in a few scenes ain't too shabby neither. For a fan of old time/mountain music, this movie is like a shot of heroin - you will be back again and again.<br/><br/>But even without the music, the movie features that Coen Bros touch, a little bit odd without descending into overt weirdness, and somehow true to life - there were some truly hilarious moments, and moments of such beauty that I was shaken.<br/><br/>I have only one complaint that I can make about this movie, and it's a petty one: during some of the musical numbers, you could clearly hear instruments being played that weren't being ""lipsynced"" onscreen, and sometimes the lipsyncing was a bit off.

The politics intertwine with a song the gang recorded to make a few bucks under the name of ""Soggy Bottom Boys,"" which unknown to the group is climbing high in popularity.<br/><br/>
The movie is very clean, no poor tasteless jokes, you could almost call it an adventure movie. 3 adventurers and their humorous experiences.

","I am and have been, a big admirer of the Coen Brothers. So I guess I approached this one with not a little expectation. I was a little disappointed when the lights came on at the cinema because I just felt that this was not up to Coen par. Maybe if I had never seen a Coen movie before this one, I would have felt that it was better than I think it now. (just as if I had seen To Kill a Mockingbird the film before I read the novel, I would not have such scorn for the film.) Interesting point to debate.<br/><br/>As much as I laughed with this film, it was somewhat mindless. Something shallow and hollow. I felt like thinking 'is this IT???!!' when it was finished because somehow, I was still waiting on the punchline, on the wicked offbeat humour the brothers have supplied in some of their previous films.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad movie, it's just not as great as reading these reviews, reading critics' reviews and seeing the standards on their other films would have you to believe. <br/><br/>Maybe if I go and see it again, I might get something out of it from the second viewing.

","What a movie, I saw it at the Film By The Sea festival and fell in love with it. It starts with a black screen while hearing a song (one might instantly recognise a chaingang song) and is we get a picture it is a chaingang, singing and hitting rocks. The picture looks authentic, a bit vague, the mood is set. And that is what this movie was to me, a good mood. I LOVED the soundtrack and I wish and I hope that it will be available.

","If nothing else, this film proves just how short-changed we've been by the music industry since about 1985 or so. When I was told the film relies on numerous American musical numbers from the 1930s, I was expecting to spend a lot of time squirming in my seat from sheer agony. Surprisingly, I almost felt compelled to sing along with whomever dubbed the vocals, a radical difference compared to the mood that the crappy synthetic drum-machine garbage of such films as The Corruptor and The Replacement Killers puts me in. If I could put the music of this film in the same boat as one that is set in modern times, it'd be Desperado. The reliance upon musical talent rather than trendiness to sell this component of the film works well in its overall favour.<br/><br/>That is not to say the film's only plus is the music. The cinematography is beautiful, and it will teach you why television screens are being made wider with the advent of digital television. If anyone tries to tell the distributor they want a panned and scanned version of this film, I'm going to kick their butts into the middle of the 22nd century. Even when there is nothing going on outside of the central focus of the shot, the wide, sweeping plains of 1930s America keep one's eyes focused upon the entire picture, not just whomever happens to be speaking. This is why 16x9 Enhanced DVD is the ONLY way to view films.<br/><br/>George Clooney is delightful in his role as Ulysses Everett McGill, while John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson provide wonderful comic fodder in their roles. Chris Thomas King is delightful as Tommy Johnson, the guitarist who sold his soul to the devil at the crossroads. Their recording session was delightful to sit through, and it is a hilarious reflection on the times that they could cut a record while on the run, and then travel across the state, blissfully unaware that they have a number one record on their hands. Contrast this with modern pop ""stars"" who can't get enough of themselves or their record company's attempts to make them out to be the greatest thing since sliced bread. There is a moral to this part of the story: truly good music only needs word of mouth to make people want to listen to it.<br/><br/>Oh, and the Sirens scene... now that was worth watching the entire film for, even if it was quite bizarre. In five minutes, we have a more pleasant image to look at than the entirety of Sirens, the meandering (not to mention ugly) film of Norman Lindsay's story that was filmed not far from where I live. I thoroughly recommend this film. It succeeded in entertaining me beyond my most generous expectations."

The story flows along well through all these situations with the help of countless great characters and Coen wit.  It is probably the best movie I have seen this year and should be an automatic Oscar nominee. The Coen brothers, as always, deliver the big three: Great writing, directing and acting.  Clooney is at his best and even pulls off singing, he is bonafied! Nelson and Coen vet Turturro are brilliant as the witless sidekicks, especially Nelson. In fact the movie is filled with great acting at even the tiniest characters but the best character in the movie might be the music.  The film is soaked with American folk music from the early 1900's.  The Coen brothers use it as Robert Altman used Jazz in Kansas City.

","Brilliant.<br/><br/>How can a one make a movie that is not an original story, yet make it entirely original?<br/><br/>I cannot believe people that negatively review creative filmmaking (Almost a non-existence in Hollywood) and tear this film to pieces. While the postives far outweigh the negatives, the Coen Brothers are an aquired taste that I have had since seeing Blood Simple years ago. Yes, I am a fan. I own all of their movies, and each is getting better and better.<br/><br/>While many will see similarities in George Clooney's performance to Nicolas Cage's H.I. McDonough from Raising Arizona. The two are still fresh characters that don't brandish action and suspenseful characters and gimmicky plot to carry them.  John Goodman's Cyclops role is reminiscent of his character in Barton Fink. Even the brilliance of capturing the era was very reminiscent of Miller's Crossing, but in the end is a movie that stands very much on it's own, not unlike Fargo.<br/><br/>What singles out this performace and is without doubt the film's best character is the music. Has there been a more astute soundtrack to depict a movie to it fullest in the last ten years? While not a fan of Satuday Night Fever, needless to say what the music did for that film. I think the closest comparison could be 2001 a Space Odyssey or maybe the Godfather.<br/><br/>I can only hope that this trend of filmmaking continues for many years to come, making the experience of cinema the art form it should be."

","I loved the first half-hour or so, the strange interruptions of the threesome's getaway: the arrivals of Orpheus as a black guitar player, mobsters, a blind prophet on the rails, baptizers, and sirens.  Their journey hits a sweet, strange spot that seems uniquely American at first. The film turned sour right about when Big Dan hit Delmar across the face: the totally random, flat-footed slapstick reduced Goodman to a caricature rather than any kind of character.  At least in Barton Fink, we got a chance to see Goodman's salesman evolve.  Here, he was all big and loud, just like Charles Durning and John Turturro, at times incomprehensible.<br/><br/>The plot festers very quickly here and turns into a series of small episodes and effects.  Gags range from strange and wonderful to repulsive. Hanging Negroes is not funny; r-u-n-n-o-f-t works but once; wearing blackface at a Klan rally is a low comic blow; being a ""friend of the midget"" gets old quick; torch-lit mobs leading men to their electrocution are not causes for hilarity either, though maybe under Dubya that'll change. The Coens pushed the envelope off the table this time.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Tim Blake Nelson and George Clooney both are surprisingly affable: their reactions to the sirens, and the morning after, are just precious.  Also, I loved seeing Clooney's interactions with his daughters and Holly Hunter: ""He's BONAFHYDE!  HE'S A SUITOR!  What are you?"" ""Well, AH ahm the Pater Familius!""  Anybody who can say that without breaking up deserves applause.<br/><br/>The cinematography, as everyone has indicated, is gorgeous, evoking a feel of some bygone ""golden"" age.  However, at the same time, this America seems more primitive, lewd: maybe I should head down to Natchez and Mississippi and see how much things have changed over the years.  Often I felt like O Brother was a lot like some of the old musicals: the screenplay and characters were weak moments and filler for great musical moments. The wet brunette sirens were seductive ""baaaaaaa-beh,"" the chain gang was powerful, ""I'll Fly Away"" a graceful moment, and even for a guy who would never listen to country, ""I Am A Man of Sorrow"" jammed.  Actually, this film seems less a remake of The Oddysey than a tribute to John Landis' Blues Brothers with an extra southern good ol' boy kick thrown in.  We could use more celebrity musician appearances or a good-old fashioned chase scene, and the film would lift off.<br/><br/>Just like last year's Sweet and Lowdown, this is a minor film by master filmmakers.  Some nights, I go in expecting a good time, and I got just that here: some lovely scenery, jokes, suspense, and fine, fine music.

","Forget about the Odyssey, think Preston Sturges.  The Coens like to take a genre and make a new movie in that vein (Miller's Crossing is a gangster movie, Blood Simple is film noir, Hudsucker Proxy is the wisecracking newshen comedy).<br/><br/>Yeah, OK, the main character (who looks a lot like Clark Gable) is trying to get home in a Homeric way, facing obstacles and fighting monsters, so he can return to his wife, but that's just the broadbrush outline of the plot. The reference to Homer might even be sort of a joke.  People know that a Coen movie is a tribute to some style of film, so maybe they deliberately put ""based on Homer's Odyssey"" in the opening credits.<br/><br/>You might be looking for Homer, but what you'll get is Sturges.  It's a 1930s or 40s kind of comedy.<br/><br/>Two things impressed me at the start of the movie.  There's that scene with the three convicts chained together, falling out of the freight train (you've seen it in the trailers or the TV ads).  Immediately after that, they meet a blind man who predicts their future.  It's a funny scene followed by a framing scene.  The wise old man (and a blind one at that) is an old story-telling technique -- like something from Joseph Campbell's explanations of the journey of the hero (or maybe something from the Odyssey).  Here and there, other myths or folklore pop in (a guitar player at the crossroads and a gubernatorial candidate whose theme song is ""You Are My Sunshine"").<br/><br/>The Coens are creating a myth and they're borrowing liberally from myths both ancient and modern.<br/><br/>Here's what I want from a movie: To transport me to a different world and to surprise me.  I could go through the movie and list the parts that transported me (the baptism scene was like watching mystical, musical ghosts).  And I love the scene where the three convicts, plus the guitarist, play their song.  In a period of about five or ten minutes, several plot lines were wrapped up -- bam bam bam bam.  But I won't spoil the plot for anyone who might be reading this.<br/><br/>Plus, there's lots of humor.  It's a very funny movie.<br/><br/>One thing bothered me: the Ku Klux Klan part.  Yeah, I know the KKK are the bad guys, but they're just so obviously bad.  It's like putting Nazis in a cartoonish movie like Indiana Jones.  The minor character who decided to be anti-KKK was basically a jerk.  However, maybe that's part of myth-making, you insert a character (like the devil) the audience will automatically hate.<br/><br/>Overall it's a huge thumbs up.  Not as good as Miller's Crossing or Fargo, but definitely worth seeing.<br/><br/>The Coen brothers have made another great movie.<br/><br/>ToddH"

The music, primarily old-time folk and gospel songs performed by contemporary artists, is completely delightful.   My wife purchased the soundtrack CD the next day.

He plays it absolutely straight with no hint of the absurdity of his proposition. George Clooney displayed admirable comic and possibly singing skills.

How rare is this!<br/><br/>The Depression-era pic, about three escapees from a chain gang (George Clooney, John Turturro, Tim Blake Nelson), is loosely based on Homer's 'Odyssey' -- although the Coens say they haven't read it! -- and chronicles the protagonists journey across Mississippi ostensibly towards Clooney's buried treasure of $1,200,000.<br/><br/>As offbeat and charming as you might expect, the movie is very episodic, with some set pieces working better than others but this is all very amusing stuff, with the performers all clearly enjoying the unique opportunities the Coens provide for actors in Hollywood today.<br/><br/>Roger Deakins' Panavision photography is literally breathtaking!

","Three prisoners from a chain gang make an escape.  It seems that one of them has four days to retrieve his stash from a bank robbery before a government damn project floods it over.  This movie is set in the middle of the Depression in the deep South, where it is apparently pretty easy to escape from a chain gang.  The three prisoners are wonderfully portrayed by George Clooney, John Torturro, and Tim Blake Nelson.  Each of them present us with likeable goofball characters who are recognizably American yet aren't cliches.   (Anyone who remembers Larry, his brother Darryl, and his other brother Darryl will nod with recognition at these three.)<br/><br/>On their travels to retrieve the treasure, they meet up with many colorful characters, and work their way out of several tight spots.  Some of the people they meet are ordinary people trying to get by during one of America's most hardest times.  Others they meet with are legendary, mythical, or even apocryphal.  (The makers of the movie acknowledge Homer's Odyssey as their main source of inspiration.)  They even meet up with a rascally scalawag or two.<br/><br/>As with any Coen brothers movie, the characters in this movie are unique and indelible.  The movie's plot twists and turns its way into and out of one seemingly insurmountable scrape after another.  It's a marvel to watch how these characters writhe their way out of each situation.<br/><br/>I saw this right after re-watching ""The Big Lebowski"", and it does suffer a little by comparison.  Some of the situations in ""O Brother"" are a little anachronistic, and the dialogue seems slightly less sharp.  On the other hand, the photography is beautiful, invoking nostalgic images of a simpler, more rural time.  This movie is a pleasure to watch, especially in this particular year of a seemingly endless string of bad movies, and I recommend it highly."

","This is an excellent film, for a variety of reasons.<br/><br/>(1)  The cinematography is breathtaking - it really captures the feel of the rural South.  The sense of the humidity and the squalor is almost palpable.<br/><br/>(2)  The soundtrack is absolutely perfect - it blends the very best of period and contemporary old-time Southern music, and the music integrates itself seamlessly with the film's atmosphere and action.  The music is one of the main characters in the film and supplements the authenticity of the vision as surely as the photography.<br/><br/>(3)  This is an American film through and through.  It does not surprise me that audiences in Spain or viewers in Ireland did not ""get it"" (I'm sure there are a lot of details and allusions in Almodovar films that I don't understand)  - it is a great portrait of an America which is now gone - an America now morphed into a land of Gap ads, fast food and Britney Spears videos.  That America is portrayed here, not condescendingly but raucously - in the best spirit of O. Henry.  The Klan scene is more intricate than most critics suggest - the political inclinations of the Grand Wizard are fascinating in our post-FDR polity.  There will always be Americans who are stupid enough to hate the South - this movie will be too rich and full for their small minds to accommodate.<br/><br/>(4)  The plot is described as meandering or disjointed by some critics, who complain that certain characters should have been given more prominence. The same critics scoff at the Coen Brothers' claim that the film is based on the Odyssey.  I assume that these same critics would feel quite at home with those who made similar complaints about Joyce's Ulysses in the 1920s.  The film uses the same picaresque and episodic narrative style that Homer employed in the Odyssey.  It uses the same juxtaposition of the mundane and the fantastic that Homer used and the Coens set their narrative in the same context in which Homer placed his: a musical one.  The original Odyssey is not a tightly-plotted, relentlessly paced thriller - it is a narrative that takes joy in the act of storytelling itself.  ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" is a film that takes joy in the act and art of filmmaking.  The plot is as it should be, even if it is not what Hollywood-trained Pavlovian viewers want it to be.<br/><br/>(5)  This movie is as Coen as it gets with regard to funny, intelligent dialogue and visual inventiveness.  The Coen brothers are still as uncompromising and dedicated to their own peculiar aesthetic as ever.  And, as always, the film is richly allusive, evoking all the classic movies of the American South from ""Birth of a Nation"" to ""Deliverance"".<br/><br/>This film is a triumph."

A thoroughly enjoyable movie that takes you back to depression era USA to follow three escaped inmates across the state looking to find a great treasure.<br/><br/>George Clooney does surprisingly well in his role of Ulysses Everett McGill, never once slipping out of character or out of accent for even a moment. John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson were perfect as Pete and Delmar respectively, and were a joy to watch. The often confused Delmar has many of the finest and funniest lines in the film and seems happy to go along with everything and anything. The small parts of John Goodman as Big Dan T and Michael Badalucco as George 'Babyface' Nelson do little more than reinforce the many references to Homer's Odyssey, but are still a welcome addition to the film.<br/><br/>The cinematography also deserves a mention with many wide shots of the open plains and fields of they early 1900s, along with radio shacks, town halls and general stores. Each drawing you more into the film.<br/><br/>And finally the soundtrack. Absolutely brilliant!! I can't say enough good about this. The fact that the soundtrack was more successful than the film, alone says it all. The pure sounds of blues, bluegrass and old timey are easy on the ears. I would, however, like to have the chance to hear Clooney singing In Constant Sorrow himself (it was dubbed even though he practiced for months), perhaps a feature on the DVD...<br/><br/>Overall a film that will have you tapping your foot and crying with laughter.

","There are two things you need before you see this film.  One is a basic understanding of Homer's Odyssey and two is to have seen a couple of Coen brother movies.  The Coens have a way of looking at things that are slightly off-center from off-center.  While parts may be slapstick silly, most are more thought provoking, likely to make you laugh after some time has passed. This one can be even more confusing if you don't know the parallels to the Odyssey that are drawn. I saw this in the theater on a slow night so I was able to watch the movie and the reactions of the other patrons.  About 10% 'got it' and the rest were just confused.  To the 10%, good for you! Someone will eventually give a similar treatment to other classic works of literature.  They will probably be accused of copy-catting the Coen idea.

I must confess, I've never seen the film but it's only a matter of time. Hollywood and film fans clearly love this movie and after Steve Martin mentioned it in Lawrence Kasdan's Grand Canyon (1992), it's one of those on the must see movie list.<br/><br/>Part musical, comedy and fantasy, it is set in Depression-era Deep South and follows clever dick Everett (Clooney) a man who is more concerned about his hair than anything else, Pete (Turturro) and none-too-bright Delmar (director Tim Blake Nelson) - a band of convicts who escape from a chain gang to find hidden treasure.<br/><br/>Naturally with the Coens' movies, things are never that easy. For the movie is inspired by Homer's 'Odyssey' and the lads bump into all sorts of nutcases on their journey, including a one-eyed bible salesman (Goodman) and a wannabe mayoral candidate (Charles Durning).<br/><br/>With some excellent bluegrass music, including a fine track by Clooney and The Soggy Bottom Boys, this is one of the year's most original movies that seems to have arrived fully formed into the world.<br/><br/>Most flicks are rather obviously the work of special effects crews and a team of writers desperately trying to glean some magic from the subject material but this has a strange simplicity. <br/><br/>The Coen's have a knack of making their films look effortless, but you know that behind the scenes, they must have been burning the midnight oil to get every element right.<br/><br/>A special nod should also go to Roger Deakins for his washed out photography.<br/><br/>It gives OBWAT that period feel while costume designers and set crew must have had a field day recreating an era seen all too rarely on the big screen."

","For me, being a great admirer of the Coen Brothers' movies, it is hard to rate this movie justly. Let me express it like this: It is better than most other films in this world but as a Coen baby it's only average. I'm afraid the two guys are getting older and losing the density of dialogue they once had in films like Barton Fink` or Miller's Crossing`. Their characters are getting shallower, their point is not in the characters any more, only in the plot and mainly in weird, atmospheric moments, which they still do better than any other American director. They always used fantastic technical effects to the full  photography, music, post-production. But in O Brother` they rely too much on those effects and leave the dialogue behind. In Barton Fink` & Co. you could at least belive that the film has a deep meaning (even if it hadn't). O Brother` is only a comedy  a most entertaining one, however.<br/><br/>They haven't made many films.

It is usually the scapegoat of America's sins in popular culture.  But, like any human thing, to see the South only as backwards, bigoted and uncouth is to miss the point that all places and peoples are at times and in places, bigoted, backwards and uncouth.  It shows us that not everyone in the South was or is racist or ignorant.  This film reminds us that in the midst of human lowliness, one can find beautiful things: the humor, the music, and the irony.  It also reminds us that, as one colleague of mine put it, that the two groups of people who have most in common are the poor whites and the poor blacks, and when they get together, beautiful things can happen.

I thought he did a creditable job with it.<br/><br/>
Charles Durning has made a very good living playing good ol' boys, and he does his usual stellar job here.

","The Coen brothers, for me, have always been hit or miss. The over-excesses of Miller's Crossing, which brought to mind the much superior The Glass Key, being balanced with the genius and beauty of a film like Fargo. But I've always admired their creativity and refusal to adhere to a specific genre. This film is certainly original, with beautiful cinematography, a great score, and fine performances (where has Tim Blake Nelson been all my life? His performance, right down to the goofy facial expressions, is phenomenal). What it lacks is dramatic tension and cohesiveness. The vignettes follow one after another with not enough thread to bind them together as a whole. The Baby Faced Nelson story is wholly superfluous.<br/><br/>I found myself mildly amused throughout, but certainly not exhilarated. George Clooney once again proved himself to be a solid, charismatic actor with genuine star appeal, but for laugh out loud zaniness, give me Jeff Bridges as the Dude any day of the week."

""The Odyssey"" and ""The Wizard of Oz"" both have main characters obsessed with getting home, and the Coens have built a richly layered entertainment that call upon a range of cultural allusions to make a point.<br/><br/>By the way, the movie within OBWAT is ""Myrt and Marge,"" an undistinguished Broadway-backstage movie that features the Three Stooges singing . . . much like the Soggy Bottom Boys."

","One of the one most interesting characteristics about enjoying films is that a person's taste is entirely subjective. One person may love a movie while another can completely hate it. This can be applied in many cases to art' films that may appease only the film connaisseur' and turn off the mainstream Hollywood filmgoer. If ever there was one film in recent memory that this may be applied to it will be the Coen Brothers' O Brother, Where Art Thou?' The Coen Brothers will both disappoint and appease many filmgoers with this comedic tale based on Homer's Odyssey. The one suggestion I may make is that  in order for one to fully enjoy this film, one must familiarize themselves with the story and then sit back and be treated to a great tale and a great treat. Furthermore, an appreciation of the Coen Brother's work is also an added incentive as this brother-brother filmmaking team have wet their beaks' in a host of subjects. This critic's personal favourite Coen film, The Big Lebowski'.     In relation to their latest film and the story in which it is based on, I will not pretend that I know my Greek myths, fact of the matter is I am planning to re-read the story and view the film a second time in order to view all the inside-jokes I probably missed the first time. But what the eye can see without reading the story is a lush, extravagant, beautifully filmed story replete with great cinematography by the gifted Roger Deakins. Simply view the film's opening and understand and experience just what kind of look he has given this film. And as always the Coen's pack in as many twists and memorable scenes as ever before including a well choreographed and comedic larger than life' Klu-Klux Klan scene where our heroes attempt to save their begotten friend. In order to bring this story to life, the Coens have given George Clooney the lead as he portrays the Ulysses character in 'The Odyssey' story as Ulysses Everett McGill. A well mannered, grounded individual who seeks the love of his family. What is also surprising is that Clooney actually plays the lead well, holding the audience to his every word and greased hair as he holds the film and leads this trio of trouble on their quest for treasure. Joining McGill as he escapes prison are  Pete Hagwallop (John Turturro) and Delmar O'Donnell (Tim Blake Nelson) as they search for a treasure only to discover what they are really after. Yes, the previous synopsis does sound flagrant, but in a nutshell, the moral is conveyed across the film in the form of witty writing and simply absolute beautiful cinematography that make this trio what they are really after.<br/><br/>     If one does appreciates a different  kind of filmmaking filled with musical moments, memorable  characters and a series of misadventures that are well played out while staying truthful to the The Odyssey' with a series of witty cross references - you will enjoy this film. If not, many might find this film distasteful and tedious, but I bet you will still be slapping your knees to the movie's many great musical moments.<br/><br/>Giancarlo's Rating: **1/2"
"jacob rosen","8","0","0","20 October 2001"," An Amiable Ramble
","A surprisingly entertaining comedy from the Coen brothers, who attempt to place Homer's `Odyssey' in the Depression-era Deep South. Maybe because they spend so much time focusing on getting the retelling right there's very little of the cold condescension towards the characters that mars most of their other films. (Not that there's a whole lot of warmth either; the Coen brothers don't seem capable of empathizing with people and many of the characters are present only to serve as comic relief.) There's also a rhythm that makes the film a very pleasant ramble, abetted by T-Bone Burnett's bluesy score and Roger Deakins' dusty, deep woods photography. The three convicts who escape from a chain gang and wander in search of home and family are played by Tim Blake Nelson and John Turturro (both very likable) and are anchored by George Clooney (passable but he does try). The large cast also includes Coen stalwarts John Goodman (as the Cyclops), Holly Hunter and Charles Durning. The title is a typical Coen film school in-joke, referencing Preston Sturges' `Sullivan's Travels'."

","Looking back on my freshman year of high school, I probably would have enjoyed Homer's `Odyssey' a sight more had it featured a character named `Wash Hogwallop.' The Coen Brothers, Joel and Ethan, have once again busted out the big guns. `Raising Arizona,' `Fargo,' `The Big Lebowski' (quite possibly the funniest film ever made) and now `O Brother, Where Art Thou?' Starring George Clooney, John Turturro, and Tim Blake Nelson, `O Brother' is a 1920's take on `The Odyssey' by Homer, albeit with wagonloads of artistic license.  Absconding from the chain gang to which they were sentenced for various trivial crimes, Ulysses Everett McGill (Clooney), Pete (Turturro) and Delmar (Nelson) are on the trail of hidden loot from a bank heist years previous.  In the tradition of Joel and Ethan Coen, they are beset on their way by sirens, a cyclops, the Ku Klux Klan, Baptists, and a young guitar player who has recently sold his soul to the devil.<br/><br/>As we've come to expect from the Coens, they've thrown out all vestiges of conventional plot in favor of glorious, off-center characters.  Clooney's McGill is the goofy, but philosophical father figure, seeming to possess an educated mind uncharacteristic of a habitual criminal.  His will to live is proportional to the amount of Dapper Dan Pomade remaining in his can.  John Turturro is probably best remembered for his role as Jesus Quintana in `The Big Lebowski,' (though, to be fair, I feel he was overlooked by the Academy for his work in Blockbuster Video's `Beginner's Guide to the Internet'). He adds yet another nut-bar character to his repertoire with Pete, who at one point may or may not have been turned into a toad.  Delmar, probably the film's least memorable character, was nonetheless given a healthy injection of hick charm by Nelson.  When it comes to supporting actors, you can't go wrong with John Goodman.  I'll give you the joy of meeting his character on your own- no need to give everything away. I've been waiting for weeks to use the word `stupendous.'  It just rolls off the tongue.  The soundtrack was stupendous. I think I'll go buy it now. Probably the most important thing to note about `O Brother' is the fact that in the hands of any other filmmakers, it would have been a complete disaster.  The Coens have mastered the art of leaving their audience unfulfilled, while ensuring at the same time that their audience is content and even gratified to be feeling that way. While `O Brother' is nothing groundbreaking, it's a pleasant diversion from the tried and true formula.  The Coens undoubtedly are able to go to sleep each night knowing that they've accomplished new things for film, which is more than I can say for most directors today.  `O Brother' may not be a popcorn blockbuster.  That's all right.  I'll even say that whether I enjoyed it or not, it may not be your cup of tea.  If you didn't like `Fargo,' you probably won't appreciate `O Brother, Where Art Thou?'<br/><br/>For fans of Joel and Ethan Coen, however, there is much to be appreciated here.  `O Brother, Where Art Thou?' gets a'B+.'  It's no Lebowski, but I'd sure watch it again.  And again.  If you're a newcomer to Coen fare, keep this in mind.  As the film opens, Ulysses, Pete and Delmar come upon an old prophet.  He tells them that `you will find a treasure, but it is not the treasure that you seek.'  How true."

O Brother, Where Art Thou?, in a nutshell, is a very smart movie about not-so-smart people (though that comment certainly can't incapsulate the depth of the film).  That is a common thread for many of the directing team's films, and it serves to show seemingly ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances.  The most humorous points in Fargo, for myself, came in points where there was no laugh-out-loud hilarity, just subtle close-ups on the strangely normal. Raising Arizona is certainly no different for me in that facet, and while I find these subtleties to be quite obvious, I doubt the type of people they parody would find it nearly as enjoyable.

","To steal a line from Roger Ebert's review of E.T., this latest offering from the Coen brothers simply made my heart glad. It has a bigness of heart and a generosity of spirit missing in many of their other equally accomplished, technically brilliant films, and while I cannot in good consience deem it better than either Fargo or The Big Lebowski, it is at least their equal.(It's also the most purely enjoyable Coen film ever.) Starting with Roger Deakins' photography, the film is exceptionally well-produced: it has a magical, sepia-toned atmosphere that does not so much re-create the Dustbowl of the 30's as channel it directly onto the screen. The soundtrack -- one of 2000's best selling cds -- is revelatory: bluegrass music simply rocks. The performances are all pitched towards greatness, with George Clooney at the forefront: based on this film, he's a marvellous, risk-taking comic actor who can downplay his own movie-star looks and appear foolish.  The script is brimming with dumb-witty dialogue and hilarious narrative contrivances, and the references to the Odyssey are fun and agreeably unpretentious.

","To steal a line from Roger Ebert's review of E.T., this latest offering from the Coen brothers simply made my heart glad. It has a bigness of heart and a generosity of spirit missing in many of their other equally accomplished, technically brilliant films, and while I cannot in good consience deem it better than either Fargo or The Big Lebowski, it is at least their equal.(It's also the most purely enjoyable Coen film ever.) Starting with Roger Deakins' photography, the film is exceptionally well-produced: it has a magical, sepia-toned atmosphere that does not so much re-create the Dustbowl of the 30's as channel it directly onto the screen. The soundtrack -- one of 2000's best selling cds -- is revelatory: bluegrass music simply rocks. The performances are all pitched towards greatness, with George Clooney at the forefront: based on this film, he's a marvellous, risk-taking comic actor who can downplay his own movie-star looks and appear foolish.  The script is brimming with dumb-witty dialogue and hilarious narrative contrivances, and the references to the Odyssey are fun and agreably unpretentious.

","The Coen Brothers continue to delight me with their unusual films.  It takes courage to go off the beaten track as they do and take risks.  They did so on all levels with this movie, offbeat casting, soundtrack, script and even choreography. The only irritant was it could not make up its mind what kind of a movie it wanted to be and kept shifting direction and bits of violence, particularly with the character played by Goodman, were needlessly offensive and detracted from the atmosphere. I found them jolting. Maybe that was the intent. Many great turns though....George Clooney as a hair obsessed fop has to be seen to be believed, bravo George, I am beginning to like you. The Coens have stated that this is based on Homer's Odyssey.  Fairly loosely, I would think. This is a semifantasy reminiscent of The Wizard of Oz, even to the three mismatched characters. George's Oz are his wife and 7 daughters.  One of the riveting scenes is of the KKK at a rally. Mesmerizing.  Another is of the 3 sirens at the lake which is haunting. I am a stickler for detail and editing and noticed only 6 daughters at the end of the movie.  Where did the 7th go ?? Nevertheless, I recommend this wonderful spellcaster. A 7 out of 10."

","At least the Coen brothers know how to use modern technology, if nobody else does.  That wonderful sun-drenched look is the result of an effects house digitally manipulating the original photographs to desaturate the greens - but at least there WERE original photographs.  Computer MANIPULATION of images need not be a great crime.  The manipulation here is at heart optical; they could, in principle, have used a film with an unusual colour response.  -It's computer-GENERATED images that are particularly evil, and the Coen brothers, bless them, have no truck with such things.  That wooden house we see at the end, for instance, is a model.  Maybe a few directors will notice how good that sequence looks; maybe it will even persuade them to stop reaching for the computer animators at the first sign of difficulty, like a hypochondriac reaching for the antibiotics.<br/><br/>""O Brother, Where Art Thou"" is the Coens' best work since ""Barton Fink"", a constantly entertaining, visually beguiling, musically delicious film that I had great difficulty understanding.  Others had to explain it to me, and I still don't get everything.  I don't get the title, for instance.  It comes from ""Sullivan's Travels"", and while I haven't seen that film, I know the story: film director Sullivan is tired of churning out shallow entertainment, and sets out to make a socially aware piece of moralism that will expose the plight of the poor; he plans to call it ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"".  -I get the reference, but I don't get the joke.  Would Sullivan's film really have looked anything like THIS?<br/><br/>Of course not.  The Coens have succeeded in doing what others have merely attempted - they've turned a twentieth-century era into a mythical, prehistoric golden age.  They make it seem effortless, too, as though all they had to do to make the enchantment lying over the landscape visible was place a filter over their lens and turn it ninety degrees."

Rather, ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" sees fine-tuned performances from George Clooney, Tim Blake Nelson, and John Turturro; playful, mood-rendering cinematography; easy-handed direction from Joel Coen; AND Ethan Coen's adept recreation of Homer work together as a well-oiled machine.

","The Coen brothers have created another enjoyable film.  While O Brother, Where Art Thou?' is definitely not their greatest work, it is certainly enjoyable, and is likely better than 70% of the movies being released today.<br/><br/>Loosely based on Homer's epic poem, The Odyssey', O Brother' is the story of three inmates who've escaped from a 1920's prison chain gang in Mississippi.  They're running from the law and soon meet up with several adventures as they try to regain a million stolen dollars hidden nearby.<br/><br/>Despite O, Brother's' origins in the classics, the movie is actually rather shallow.  There's not a lot of character development, and the plot, while entertaining, is somewhat thin.  O, Brother' did not set out to change the world or to tackle any important social issues.  But what seems to make this movie enjoyable is a fun script combined with good old-fashioned movie making--along with a variation of non-standard filmmaking techniques.  The Coens use music, and lots of it, to help move the movie along.  I was surprised to hear full versions of well-done folk and gospel songs.  The soundtrack for this movie is wonderful, and worth a separate purchase if you like folk or acoustic music.  Additionally, the movie's cinematography is effective.  Hues of yellow and brown fill many of the scenes, and it is fitting.  The colors and scenery effectively place us in a dusty 1920's Mississippi setting.  The Coens also cleverly vary the pace of the film. Slow deliberate moments are followed by well-paced action sequences.  It has the effect of luring you into a scene, and then cranking things up again with a new adventure.  Some may think that scenes are ill placed or do not fit well with the rest of the film.  But to me, this is the movie's strength. . . a quirkiness.  (This is not standard Hollywood fare.)<br/><br/>The acting was fine.  I wouldn't expect any awards here due to the fact that the characters were not written with any real depth.  But both Tim Blake Nelson and John Turturro are hilarious as sidekicks to George Clooney. Their characters and accents couldn't be goofier.<br/><br/>O Brother, Where Art Thou?' is not a great movie.  But it has enough fun, and enough innovation, to entertain and impress."

","This is a sweet, wacky movie with a feel not unlike ""The Big Lebowski"". I skipped it in theaters because of Clooney, but I regret that now. His performance is, I think, even better than his work in ""Out of Sight"", and completely free of the mannerisms that he used in ER (something I was beginning to find quite irritating). The plot is loosely based on the Coen brother's misconception of the Odyssey (a book they acknowledged they had not read before making the movie), but it is a harmless conceit. The look is somewhat artificial, due to the digital post-processing of the film, but I found that this enhanced the feel of the movie. And I liked the songs..."
"rcav","Null","0","0","15 August 2001"," Excellent film, but not what you think
","OBWAT is an excellent film, but to really understand it takes repeated viewings and close study. The important things to remember are that the Coens' claimed never to have read The Odyssey before making the film, although this may be a lie, and that the movie is both an exercise in postmodern pastiche and an essay on theories of media and mediation. This is a film that works well as a comedy, particularly for movie buffs, but also rewards close study with some interesting thoughts on the nature of media. To dismiss it as merely a remake of The Odyssey is a mistake, because there is a lot more to it than that. The Coens' put a number of characters and events in the film that seem to correspond to Homer's epic, but they also include some things that question that correspondence. In many ways, the film has much more in common with Robert Altman's Thieves Like Us and Arthur Penn's Bonnie and Clyde than with the Odyssey. But beyond these more theoretical aspects of the film, it is also a visually and aurally interesting film. the ""old-timey"" (more postmodernism)soundtrack is terrific, the camera work, while less flashy than blood simple or the big lebowski, is terrific, and the gamble on digitally altering the color of the film really pays off. As for the cows mentioned by another person who commented on this film, they do suffer some abuse, but the Coens' do give a Cow the final word on George ""Babyface"" Nelson"

Cheap shots, imho, and way overused. Great camera work, of course, and an awesome soundtrack. But just too many clichés packed into one flick.

So what is it with the Coen Brothers? OBWAT is a good movie at best. It is not a classic or a 5 out of 5 movie as other reviews have said (not necessarily on this site).<br/><br/>It is humourous but not that funny. The stylisation is excellent - the look, colour, and feel of the movie added to the sense of time, scale and also added to the myth/epic aspect of the story. However my biggest moan is not the movie - as I said, it was enjoyable - but with the hero worship of the Coens. It is not genius to take one idea and set it in another period of time (done MANY times before). It is not genius to throw famous or infamous characters of an era into a movie set at that time (also done MANY times before). I dont even think it was done that well in OBWAT. Apart from Big Dan having one eye and being larger than the rest (filmed very well to enhance this) what else was relevant to the cyclops from the Odyssey. It is my recollection that Penelope was fending off suiters to wait for Ulysses and was regretfully being forced to marry. Ulysses covered his ears and escaped the Syrens. And couldnt something else have been done with Robert Johnson?<br/><br/>I recommend this movie but please dont get caught by the Coen bandwagon.

","Going in to another Coen Brothers film, I was expecting a surreal masterpiece of novel characterisation and black humour.  I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>I knew a little about the film, but not a lot, and was surprised by the opening screen explaining that it was `based upon The Odyssey' by Homer'. `Based loosely upon' may have been more accurate.  Or even `Makes references to', for I will freely admit that my enjoyment of and involvement in the film blinded me to the numerous parallels between the film and the original Greek legend.  The way the Coen Brothers cleverly, even casually, weave the references in to the film is a testament to their talent and creativity. Whilst I wouldn't want to spoil someone's first time viewing the film, it's certainly an enjoyable intellectual exercise to see how many references you can find.<br/><br/>An essentially simple plot is imbued with life by fascinating characters and the diverting episodes they find themselves in.  The pace is unhurried without being slow, non-stop without being frantic.  Clooney's loquacious rogue is perfectly offset by the incessantly dim Delmar and the occasionally volatile Pete.  Although a truism to say that the writers obviously designed this trio, the three actors mesh brilliantly and create an impressive on-screen triumvirate that one can easily believe in.  Their appearance as Country and Western singers has left me irritating my colleagues with a poor rendition of `Constant Sorrow', and I may just have to buy the soundtrack to show them what it should sound like!<br/><br/>A muted colour palette that is reminiscent of nostalgic American photography, and glaring historical inaccuracies that I can't help find endearing serve to polish a complete and brilliant film.<br/><br/>If you have enjoyed any other Coen brothers, then you will feel absolutely at home watching this one.  If you haven't enjoyed any other Coen brothers, then this is a perfect place to start."

","I actually only watched OBWAT because the rental store gave my wife the wrong box (she wanted Pay it Forward), and was I ever happy about that. ""Oh Brother"" was funny, sweet, surprising and simply fun to watch.<br/><br/>The only rough spots were George Clooney's occational over-acting (yes, the character was supposed to be melodramatic, but it grated at times) and a few times where I thought the director was spoon-feeding the audience information.<br/><br/>These minor potholes did nothing to deter my amusement and surprise from the first scene to the last. The music was excellent (not only the theme song, but the entire score), the story was funny, the loose ties to the ""Odyssey"" were interesting, and I found myself rooting for the characters more than I have in a long time. A simple, effective movie that Hollywood should pay attention to. 9 out of 10."

","*** SLIGHT SPOILERS ***<br/><br/>From looking at the cover, reading the blurb, watching the trailer or even hearing the soundtrack before watching the film can be quite deceptive. One would imagine that from this material alone the film is not really something worth watching. Oh how this could not be more further from the truth.<br/><br/>The timeless story of the Odyssey has been re-done and set in the early era of the 20th century. Three escaped convicts are our guides as they take us on a ride of music, drama, mystery, evil, comedy and love in a truly human film.<br/><br/>If you don't know the story of the Odyssey then there are small sections of this film you will not be able to fully understand. It is best to just take in the music and wonderful cinematography in those moments. Besides the somewhat required prior knowledge this film is one of the more rewarding cinema expereinces.<br/><br/>The music is traditional ""old timey"" music of the Southern American persuasion. It is sometimes a little hard to get into if you have never really listend to it, however as time goes by and perhaps you here it more than once you begin to enjoy it more and more. Certainly I was not overly impressed with the headline song ""Man of Constant Sorrow"" when I first heard it but now I truly enjoy listening to it.<br/><br/>The drama is first class, combining tragedy, evil and love as well as the human spirit in a plot that is unique and inventive. Some people may not notice and I don't want to spoil it but listen carefully and you may find the devil makes an appearance on a number of occasions. The story is two lines of traffic meeting at the cross-roads. Firstly the escaped convicts being chased by the law and secondly the Pappy O'Daniel campaign for governer. The low level simplicity of this plot is quite deceptive, with the introduction of ""them Sirens"", the big one eyed ogre of John Goodman, Homer Stokes and his little man and their big lynch mob ritual the simple plot becomes very very amusing, unique and often heart warming. The major point to take away is nothing is as it appears on the surface, sometime if you listen and think hard enough you will notice things you would of never thought of.<br/><br/>The comedy is somewhat a different paradigm to the normal one liner ""duh duh"" Amercian style humour. You need to use your brain to understand alot of it and it is only when you really get into the story and the characters that you begin to laugh and laugh heartily. The comedy can fail to suck you in but I think that is a backlash from the fact that this movie is so different to most mainstream styles of comedy. If you begin watching with an open mind then you find it much more enjoyable than if you expect a certain brand of comedy.<br/><br/>The visual style is also something that is refreshing and different to other films. You get the distinct impression that every single shot no matter how small has been carefully crafted and executed to perfection. Combined with the wonderful music you can often lose yourself in the very Southern American Autumn colours. There are some shots that are so perfect you could print them off and frame them as legitmate first class photographic art.<br/><br/>The final peice of this amazing artistic puzzle is the humanity of the film. The slow conversations set to a guitar soundtrack about the simple things in life are truly heart warming and give these characters so much depth it makes other good films characters look like cardboard cut-outs. By the end of the film you truly feel for these characters. Their depth is only matched by their stupidity and one can wonder how they achieved so much in the film whilst still maintaining a real un-intelligent persona. Don't fear however, it is not anything like ""Dumb and Dumber"". This film stays well away from toilet humour and maintains its own self respect. If you have been dying for strong characters of enormous depth then this movie is for you!<br/><br/>On that note I suggest you ""R-U-N-N-O-F-T"" down to the video store and find out for yourself what your missing out on. Remember if you are not impressed with the tripe 'Hollywood' produces alomst 100% of the time, this may not be the perfect answer but it is a very good refreshing enlightening change. 5 stars!"

","Touted as a version of Homer's Odyssey, this could-have-been-great film is beautifully photographed, but makes no sense.  Forced inclusions of Homer's famous characters (The Sirens and Polyphemus being the most broadly recognizable) don't help prevent this oddment from ultimately failing to meet its own goal of being about... well, what?  It's the comic evolution of three men escaping from a Depression-era chain gang.  Clooney, playing the overeducated leader, has some witty lines, drawing their laughs from the misfit way he rambles polysyllabically (sp?) at simple folk who neither know, nor really care much, what he is talking about.  Finally, neither will you, as it turns out he has no real mission.  The character himself turns out to be confused, despite his vocabulary, even to the point of flatly ignoring the severe beating a friend receives while sitting next to him. The ""Odyssey"" metaphor ultimately fails, too, as he is not quite rewarded with his archetype's deserts, gaining nothing of any great consequence in the end.  See it after ""Being John Malkovich,"" if you liked that film (Carter Burwell, who scored the latter, added some music to this one, too)."

","If the stores were open at this hour I'd rush out and buy this movie. Then I'd come home and watch it again and again. I allow myself to own only five movies--Coen Bros.' Lebowski being one of them--which I can return to like the sun in the morning with the knowledge that I'll be entertained. It's the only way I substantiate paying $30 for a movie (twisted, I know, because I plop twenties for music without blinking). I'd name my other films, but I hate subjecting myself to that employee hot-pick type of pigeonhole--although I'd be kidding no one to say that, yes, my picks are rather stereotypical. I enjoy dizzying rides through undulating plots without a fastened seatbelt. I expect all tangibles to be perfect. Humor is a pro--no, it's more than that, it's a prerequisite. Hell, it may be the only way to truly understand things like Depression, self-absorption, illegitimacy and other s**t-luck stories about ignorant people with cruel hearts... In short, as I always try to be, I prefer quality movies. And O Brother is certainly that. Like any skillful work of art, its message is authentically ambiguous, allowing each viewer to take with him or her something entirely unique. For me, I took a tear, a laugh, a few notes even--and I'll take $30 to Blockbuster in the morning.

I think I laughed about two or three times during the whole film and was bored by the rest, but there were a few things I did like: Stephen Root's blind radio station owner, Clooney getting pulled out of the train, John Goodman, Charles Durning's loud-mouthed character, the three gorgeous sirens Clooney and his friends encounter and the photography of the scene itself, and the scene where Clooney gets beat up in the store was funny. Goodman is only in the film briefly, but steals the scene when he is, and John Turturro was quite good, though Clooney (whom I do like) gave what had to be his worst performance thus far. I also liked the great sense of atmosphere and the exceptional costuming, which really did an incredible job of recreating the time in which the film is set.<br/><br/>But that's about it. There's not much going for it, and is so slow that I found myself checking the DVD player to see how much time was left. If you're a Coen Bros. fan, you'll most-likely love it. If you're someone like me who likes their comedies to actually make them laugh and give you a good time, then stay away.

The odyssey is very loosely referred to throughout the film. John Goodman plays the ""cyclops"" (a one-eyed Bible salesman who mugs our hero and his friend,) the incredibly beautiful and erotic ""sirens"" are three luscious women washing clothes and singing by the stream, and there's even some divine intervention.

","So it's a steamy night, with rain and after day of driving, with a funeral . . . a night for which my wife chose the perfect movie, the Coen brothers' ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?""  Loosely but explicitly based on the Odyssey, it tracks three escaped prisoners across a Depression-era Mississippi, a land of strange magic, much singing, and no little amount of horror.<br/><br/>Among other things, a wonderful meditation on American modernity, and on how the future both displaces yet depends on the past.  Very Southern literary theme, of course, but difficult to film.  And I've not seen the importance of and ambiguous role played by music (much of it from the South, either directly or via Chicago, etc.) in defining mass modern culture, so that music is both broadcast yet expected to be authentic.. .<br/><br/>A similarly complex role is played by water.  As in the late 60's movie Deliverance (and in China today, where the Three Gorges Dam is planned to be the largest civil engineering project in human history) a decisive role is played by government project to dam a river.  Deliverance was written by the southern poet & novelist James Dickey, concerned with such traditional southern themes.  [Not exactly incidentally, I've spent time on the headwaters of the Chattooga, the Class IV/V Wild & Scenic River where Deliverance was filmed (somebody was killed during filming, if memory serves).]  The flooding that concerns Dickey, of course, is mostly TVA (though the Chattooga flows to the Savannah & Atlantic, andis therefore outside TVA authority).  In Brother, as Clooney makes clear, water sweeps away the old and ushers in the new, by providing hydroelectric power.  But as the same scene elegantly shows, this is hardly a rational process.<br/><br/>The weather.  As with most things Greek, one senses the power of the sun.  And as with most things Southern, one senses the shadows, the underbrush scraping on skin that seems to have been sweaty always . ..<br/><br/>This movie, as well as a few others I've liked recently, notably Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and American Beauty, seem to me to have learned the lessons of magical realism, and are now employing those lessons in a more frankly mystical/allegorical/thoughtful way.  But ""Brother"" does so in a way that recalls the musical -- everybody can sing -- if musicals were composed of spooky delta music, almost all a capella, sung by black and white Greek chorus/choirs of angels, which makes sense in Mississippi.<br/><br/>The movie is not perfect.  George Clooney, as the protagonist, delivers a performance that would be quite good in a lesser movie, but simply doesn't match the brilliance of this movie.  The romantic plot doesn't quite work.  I could go on, but won't bother.  It is a great movie.<br/><br/>So, if you haven't seen it, wait till a muggy afternoon, calling for rain.  Turn off the air conditioner.  Do something sweaty.

","This was a term for a hit, or success after a period of spotty effort from the period setting of this unique, ecstatic satire of the American South of the early 20th Century. 	Ethan and Joel Coen, brothers born in Minnesota and film educated at NYU is arguably the most original filmmaking team in US film history to date. Known best for FARGO fame, they first cracked Hollywood with BLOOD SIMPLE and except for FARGO, almost faded away with sputtering levels of fruition after their first outing. In this film, a borderline musical about three escaped chain-gang convicts, they come back with a vengeance. 	The cast, headed by a surprisingly new character rendering by George Clooney, story and direction, editing and production values are totally engaged here.  This is worth a rental for almost anyone who has a sense of humor and most decidedly a value if only for the hysterically bizarre Ku Klux Klan sequences.  Rent it and you might very well want to buy it after you see it.  It is certainly worth revisiting."

","Trustingly, I purchased both the DVD and soundtrack without ever having viewed the film. I should trust more often. It now ranks among my favourites. You truly get the feel of being in the South from frame one, complete with a chain gang, shotgun-toting supervisors, and a cold, villainous warden. Every detail in this movie is beautifully accurate (minus a few intentional and very forgivable anachronisms). Even down to the title's font, a Tuscan Ornate-esque style poster font that is true to its era. Not to mention the film's colour effects (like the sepia fades and golden overtones during the siren scene, for example) add a clarity and crispness to the experience that enhances it perfectly. Those are but a few reasons why I have such a deep respect and love for this film. I would (and do) recommend ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" to anyone I feel deserves the honor.

I found myself asking ""What happened to the fast-talking, quick witted guy?""  2)  The storyline took some leaps.  After the KKK scene (see below), Clooney, et al., end up at a political fundraiser (or something).  I didn't know why they were there or how they got there. 3)  Lip-synching.  Why do directors insist on closeups when actors are lip-synching?

","I have seen this movie several times now and as a white, Southern-born male fan of traditional music (and Coen brothers' movies), I find this movie wonderful on several levels.<br/><br/>I saw it first with a friend who is not familiar with the Coen brothers' eclectic style and she loved the movie for what it is on the surface: a Depression-era road movie, built around the plot of the Odyssey, with a blues/traditional/gospel soundtrack with over the top characters.  We enjoyed playing ""seek and find"" with the Homer references and the historical characters loosely woven into the story.<br/><br/>On my second viewing I started focusing on the more spiritual aspects of the film as characters are baptized and damned, all the while ""looking for answers.""  I listened less to the dialog and more to the music and how it compliments the action, becoming almost a Greek chorus of its own.<br/><br/>Only when I had broken down some of these elements could I let the movie just wash over me.  References to the ""Wizard of Oz"" which should have been obvious to me suddenly jumped out at me.  The movie has all of the oddball humor of ""Raising Arizona"" (I even went back to see if they got some of the same actors in each movie, especially the storekeepers, but they had not), but is not as over the top and has more layers.<br/><br/>Like others here have commented, the Coen brothers' movies are not for everyone.

","I have been a fan of the Coen Brothers work for quite some time.  Their style of comedy - what I call ""thinking man's comedy"" - is certainly well-represented by this movie.  Although I was not completely familiar with Homer's ""Odyssey"" I found myself exploring it just to find the similarities to the movie and in doing so realized the true brilliance of these two brothers.<br/><br/>Certainly one of the shining stars of the movie is the music.  Dan Tyminski gives a fabulous performance as the singing voice for George Clooney as well as appearing in the movie as one of the Soggy Bottom Boys.  Unfortunately many believe that Clooney did his own singing so Tyminski has not received his rightful credit.  The soundtrack and Tyminski's song ""Man of Constant Sorrow"" remained in the top position for several weeks on the country and bluegrass charts. For the record, Tyminski is a member of Alison Krauss and Union Station and has been since 1993.<br/><br/>The movie is funny and clever, one I think most will find well worth the time to view.  It takes the viewer on an outrageous journey with interesting and amusing twists and turns along the way.

","My favourite Coen Brothers film to date is the Big Lebowski.  I thought Fargo, their most acclaimed movie so far, was a waste of time.  And that's usually the way it is with their movies.  You either love 'em or hate 'em. But this time, with O Brother, I found that I don't love it or hate it; I just like it.  I give it a 7 out of 10 so far.  I say so far because I've only watched it once, and watching a Coen Brothers movie is like reading a Kafka short story---there's so much there that you can't pick up on all of it the first time.  Greater appreciation comes from repeated viewings. And some people will never really get it; it's not for the immediate-gratification crowd and never will be.  That said, having watched O Brother only once, my summary is this:  There's virtually no narrative to the story; it's just a bunch of stuff that happens.  Therefore it's not as engaging as could be had there been a stronger narrative pull, and some people will think it's boring; there are some slow parts.  But when it is funny, it's hilarious, especially George Clooney's character who cracked me up just about every time he opened his mouth.  At the moment I wouldn't put it up there with the Big Lebowski, but the laughs, when they come, are so strong that it easily worth the price of admission/rental."

Especially the KKK scene springs to mind, I thought that I should not laugh at that, but then memories of the Olympic Games opening came to mind and I nearly rolled on the floor...<br/><br/>The acting throughout is amazing and it was great to see Clooney in a different role, not tilting his head ;-) Torturro was amazing too, it was hard to recognize him at first, then I knew and then it was gone again as he was living the role. Maybe the third (unknown to me so far therefor I lack the name) was maybe the best, since I don't know him, I hope he was acting ;-)<br/><br/>Bottom line is that O Brother is an amazing film and the music fits in wonderfully.

","O Brother, Where Art Thou? is an interesting film to say the least. The writers and directors, Ethan and Joel Coen respectively, delved into a comedic rendition of Homer's Odyssey. The film sparkles with originality, which is frequently lorded over by wonderful bluegrass music. I am not much of a fan of typical modern American comedy. Of recent films, the only one, which comes to mind that I did enjoy was As Good as It Gets. I like Chaplin films. I like The Man in the White Suit, which was wonderful. I loved Ants and Shrek. But I am of the opinion that most American writers and directors have little command of the subtleties which need to be in place to make a film watchable for more than one time.<br/><br/>O Brother meanders though Mississippi of the 1920's with George Clooney as Ulysses Everett McGill, John Goodman as  Big Dan McTeague (Cyclops) and Holly Hunter as Penny Wharvey (Penelope), Ulysses dutiful wife.<br/><br/>The characters are brought into the 20th Century with amazing wit and humour.  The Odyssey is a serious epic about Ulysses or Odysseus, who set off on a voyage, leaving behind his wife, Penelope, who was continually urged to marry when everyone assumed her husband was dead and only got out of it (for years) by telling everyone she would marry as soon as she finished a tapestry, which she unravelled every night.  Well, Penny Wharvey became unravelled herself, but that was the extend.  There has been one other attempt at this story and that was James Joyce's much scandaled and long-banned novel.<br/><br/>The film will definitely bore many Americans.  It is multi-layered and does not have a  slam bang plotline to which so many here are accustomed. Regardless, this is a major cinematographic work and will serve as a classic film for generations to come.  The Coen brothers, like Woody Allen, have gotten to a point, where, regardless of any box office success, they produce quality entertainment offering up brilliance.  And I suppose the film studios believe that one or two of these sorts of films every now and again makes them appear as though they care."

","O Brother, Where Art Thou?(2000) is a strange comedy that mixes the zanniness of The Big Lebowski(1998) with the eccentric behavior of Fargo(1996).  George Clooney gives the best performance in his career as the main character, Ulysses.  Big Dan Teague played by John Goodman is someone out of a Flannary O'Connor novel.

","A peculiar version from the Coen brothers of Homer's Odyssey, set in the depression-era Deep South of the US. George Clooney plays Ulysses Everett McGill , who escapes from a Mississippi chain gang with two not over-smart buddies, and encounters a blind seer and sirens, not to mention various other oddities on the way to reclaiming his wife Penny (Holly Hunter) and family. As with most road movies this is a fairly episodic production studded with vignettes, some better than others. The blind radio producer played by Stephen Root was one of the better ones with a manner reminiscent of W C Fields, and there is an entertaining encounter with 'Baby Face' Nelson, a notorious bank robber of the period, who, surprise, surprise, does not like to be called Baby Face.<br/><br/>George Clooney, looking like Clark Gable, does a good job as Ulysses, a very handsome but not terribly bright man obsessed with the state of his hair. Tim Blake Nelson is great as Delmar, his even dumber sidekick.<br/><br/>Good use is made of the Southern setting  you can practically feel the heat and smell the cotton fields and it's a road movie with plenty of road, so to speak. The whole thing is agreeably light and frothy and served up with plenty of bluegrass music. It's an interesting example of giving some old clichés a new twist  chain gangs, evil southern cops, gangsters, bent southern populist politicians, the Klu Klux Klan etc. A pleasant entertainment with some of Fargo's quirkiness without the blood and gore."

With some of the rubbish being churned out by Hollywood (could go on for hours) it's nice to see something wrote, directed and acted with such flare. The story follows three 'on the run' prisoners (Clooney, best performance so far, Tuturro, never fails to be at his best, and Nelson, Best part he could have) in pursuit of a great fortune.  I know a lot of people who won't go to see Musical films because they automatically think of 40's style films.<br/><br/>But the music in O'Brother ties in beautifully with each scene without slowing the film down or seeming out of place.  No one just breaks into song in the middle of a sentence. Once again the Brothers and their casting director have picked out the perfect cast and their isn't a bad actor(ess) in attendance. The one aspect that really stands out though, is the filming.  Soaked in light, the backdrops and scenery look worn and fit in perfectly with the mood and setting of the film.

","Hilarious and glorious adventure set in Mississippi during the Great Depression about three convicts (Everett - George Clooney, Pete - John Turturro, and Delmar - Tim Blake Nelson) who escape from prison and try to stay a step ahead of their demented pursuers although they're attached to each other in chains and search for a bundle of money that the Clooney character claims to have hid from the authorites.<br/><br/>The Coen brothers (Ethan and Joel), who (are now the masters of dark comedy since director Stanley Kubrick passed away) have certainly created another gem in ""O Brother, Where Art Thou"" and the film's story is based on ""The Odyssey"" by Homer and ""Sullivan's Travels"".  There are plenty of bizarre and funny moments in the movie like watching KKK members dance and sing before a hanging (my favorite) and the convicts who run come upon three singing women (sirens) who are washing their clothes in the river.<br/><br/>Also, the film's photographer, Roger Deakins, has done a remarkable job here in capturing the scenery and the composer, T-Bone Burnett (Love the name), brings in a lovely mix of country and bluegrass songs.  One of the bands that's appears on the soundtrack - The Soggy Bottom Boys  actually consists of the convicts and a guitar player who sold his soul to the devil for the guitar.<br/><br/>The best performances that stand out in the film are given not by Clooney (who's mocking Clark Gable), but by Nelson, who has a few great one-liners and John Goodman, who appears as Big Dan Teague, a slithery and loud one-eyed Bible salesman.<br/><br/>""O Brother"" is a real hoot."

Because whence came those lines, the film, ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" Based on Homer's Odyssey, this delightful frolic takes our Depression-era adventurers, led by Ulysses Everett McGill, from the railroad to the recording studio, from the chain gang to river of redemption.<br/><br/>""My hair!""<br/><br/>Everett (played by George Clooney, doing a wicked Clark Gable imitation) leads his fellow prisoners, Pete (John Turturro) and Delmar (the incredible Tim Blake Nelson) through the fields and furrows of the Deep South. In the course of their travels, they meet a blind prophet; Pete's horse-eating turncoat cousin; a talented black guitarist (Chris Thomas King) standing at the crossroads (having sold his soul to the devil in order to learn to play the guitar; hmmm, wasn't there a movie called ""Crossroads"" that had to do with  oh, never mind); a blind radio station owner who starts the boys on their singing career; some incredibly hot babes (read: Sirens) who make off with Pete (""They loved him up and turned him into a horny-toad!""); and a one-eyed gluttonous con man (read: Cyclops) essayed by John Goodman.<br/><br/>""Cow killer!""<br/><br/>Oh, yes, did I mention George ""Babyface"" Nelson, who machine-guns cows, then makes off with a bundle in a bank robbery but gets depressed and leaves the loot with the boys? And Pappy O'Daniel, the fussin'-cussin' politician? Then there's the encounter with the excruciating little Wharvy Gals and their baby-factory mother (Holly Hunter) who longs for a ""bona fide"" suitor to take care of her and her girls. And a turn with the KKK, which constitutes a hysterical takeoff on the march of the Wicked Witch's guards in ""The Wizard of Oz.""<br/><br/>""I don't want 'Fop'  I'm a 'Dapper Dan' man!""<br/><br/>Through it all we have Everett's obsession with pomade and hairnets, Delmar's salvation and philosophical acceptance of the world around him (shades of ""Forest Gump"" here) and Pete's hapless encounter that leads to betrayal. And the mysterious lawman with the bloodhound (Daniel von Bargen) who shows up in the worst places at the worst times.<br/><br/>Most of the acting is first rate (except for the Wharvy gals) and the story, aside from a little rough language, is mesmerizing. (The lack of Academy Award nominations for ""O Brother"" was disappointing. Tim Blake Nelson's omission was particularly puzzling.) The one sour note is the cruelty to animals - though digitized and computerized, it still looks all too real.<br/><br/>However, the real star of ""O Brother"" is T-Bone Burnett, the genius producer (brilliant architect of Bruce Cockburn's career) who crafted the soundtrack. He has pulled together some of Nashville's finest - including my favorite killer gospel group, The Fairfield Four (appearing as singing gravediggers). The music weaves through the story to make a rich and colorful tapestry, so tightly woven that one can barely imagine one without the other. The main theme, ""Man of Constant Sorrow,"" turns up in two vocal and two instrumental versions, all of which rock (though the radio station version, with its awesome guitar, is my favorite). I couldn't wait to buy the soundtrack to this film. And I can't wait for the film to come out on video, so I can sit and watch it over and over again, reciting my favorite lines.<br/><br/>

","In the past I have been weary of the Coen Brothers films.  It cannot be denied that they are arguably the most talented film makers in Hollywood today, whilst also making some of the most annoying films of all time. Just look at the ending of the Big Lebowski.  The first time I watched O Brother I felt indifferent about it, but then I watched it again and loved it.  I have seen it several times since and the film keep growing on me.  George Cloony is great, and should have got nominated for an Oscar, as should have the film which was easily better in my opinion than Gladiator.  Not to mention the rest of the cast though would be a crime.  John Tueturro and Tim Blake Nelson are extremely good along side Cloony.  This to me is easily the best film the Coens have made so go see it."

For those of you who like movies like The Holy Grail and Transylvania 6-5000, you might like this one.  There are anachronisms, there are certainly plot holes.  So what? This was one of the most genuinely funny movies I've ever seen.  I didn't slap my knee very many times, but I smiled from the opening scene of the three running through the soy bean fields to the look on the governor's face as he said, ""Aren't you, boys?"". The look on Delmar's face carried me through the slower times.  Living as I do in the center of Bluegrass and Southern Gospel music (I was not raised here) I loved the music. I went out after the first time I saw it and bought the soundtrack. The second time I saw it (two days later and four days ago) I saw and heard things I missed in the first.  I will buy the video when it comes out and wear it out. Just like my other cult favorite, The Holy Grail.<br/><br/>Last bit of advice: if you have to ask why it's funny, go to another movie.

"LawnBoy-4","Null","0","0","4 May 2001"," A wonderful slice of Americana - the best film of 2000
","Upon reading the various reviews on this page, I can't help but notice that the overwhelming majority of negative reviews are from those reviewers who reside outside of the US. Considering the fact that this brilliant film is set in the depression-era south, it's quite understandable that most outside the US would find it difficult to appreciate or even relate to. In fact, I'd even go so far as to say that virtually ANY of the Coen Brothers films could reasonably be considered difficult to relate to by anyone who is not familiar with Arizona (Raising Arizona), the upper midwest (Fargo) or even classic American Industrialism (Hudsucker Proxy), for example. I liken this inherent difficulty to, say, the average US citizen attempting to relate to ""Trainspotting"", another brilliant film.<br/><br/>As for the film itself, I will echo the comments of many of my American brothers and sisters who have reviewed O Brother on this site by saying that this film is easily my favorite of 2000. <br/><br/>There are so many great scenes in this film that it's difficult to remember them all. One of the scenes which is indelibly etched into my memory is the one which depicts the Wizard of Oz-like attempt to rescue Mr. Johnson from the clutches of the evil KKK at a rally our heros stumble across in the middle of the woods. Folks, if this scene didn't make you smile, you need to check your pulse.<br/><br/>The performances were simply top-notch and George Clooney has given us all the evidence we need to cease dismissing him as just a ""television actor"". His performance, in my mind, was peerless among all American films in 2000. John Turturro is always amazing and is wonderfully selective in the roles he chooses. Like Johnny Depp and Brad Pitt, his very existence in a film lends instant credibility. It's no wonder he's accepted roles for four Coen Brothers' films - the Bros are simply the best in the American film business, bar none.<br/><br/>Finally, the direction and cinematography in O Brother were instrumental in giving this film an authentically early-1900s, southern US feel. Nothing was forced in this film for the sake of artificially creating atmosphere and mood - the Coens did such a wonderful job with the direction and script that the film was able to flow perfectly without obligatory (and contrived) references so often seen in quasi-period pieces.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this amazing film. Once again, the Coen Brothers have expertly captured true Americana like no one else."

It´s the odyssey of three guys (George Clooney, John Turturro, Tim Blake Nelson) who break out of jail in Mississippi and try to find the hidden treasure of a bank robbery. Although this is far away from the Coen´s usual style - not cynical as ""Fargo"" or ""The big Lebowski"" - there is one important element of their movies: The characters are no great heroes, they are ordinary guys like you and I, who try to stay alive in the struggles of life. That´s what makes them so sympathetic to me. This is a lovable, charming comedy. Lean back, have some fried green tomatoes and enjoy it!"

","I found this film to be a brilliant combination of musical, comedy, historical drama, and southern gothic style, but it's not for everyone. To really enjoy it, you kind of need to like all of those things; but more importantly, you need to be willing to let the story wash over you like molasses and accept the cartoony characters as part of the style. (To warm up, try watching something like ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil."") I wonder if the people who complained about the lack of realism got the point at all - the entire movie is so stylized it's hard to take anything literally. I thought the ""We're in a tight spot!"" scene was a dream sequence for at least half the scene! Maybe that dreamlike feel, more than any plot elements, is what the Cohens took from the ""Odyssey."" (Speaking of which, if I recall my English classes correctly, that classic piece of literature's plot consisted entirely of Odysseus going from place to place and encountering odd creatures. So why isn't anybody berating Homer?)<br/><br/>Bottom line, I have no idea what the Cohens were going for, but it sure worked for me. Just be forewarned that it might not work for you."

""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" is the most enjoyable film I have had the pleasure to have watched recently and, although it may be considered sacrilege by Coen die-hards, I thought it was better than ""Fargo"" and, let's face it, that takes some beating.  <br/><br/>The story is loosely based on Homer's Odyssey, the magnificent George Clooney plays Ulysses Everett McGill, the leader of an escaped chain gang which includes John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson.  En route to find some hidden treasure they encounter the Cyclops in the form of Coen stalwart John Goodman's Bible salesman and become embroiled in an election campaign between Klan leader Homer Stokes and governor Pappy O'Daniel.  It's surreal, entertaining and by far the best film of 2000 and it's such a shame that the academy and much of the public ignored it completely.  Clooney's performance is on a par with that in ""Out of Sight"".  Turturro is, as ever, excellent and the little known Nelson is surprisingly good as dim-witted Delmar.<br/><br/>A real treat, and the music's great too.  Miss this at your cost."

","It is always difficult to see what the Coen brothers will come up with next. Always shrouded in secrecy, the public have no choice but to be surprised by their next project. In this case, O Brother Where Art Thou does not fall short.<br/><br/>In their latest project, the Coen brothers have given the film the same kind of dreamy atmosphere that was hinted at in the wonderful The Big Lebowski. The washed out but warm colours give a very hazy feel to it all, providing a loving background to the humourous situations our 3 escaped convicts find themselves in.<br/><br/>The performances of our 3 main characters steal the show - so much so in fact that the film tends to suffer when they are not on screen, although thankfully these moments are both short and rare.<br/><br/>Praise must also be given for the fantastic soundtrack. I must admit I am not a big fan of country music, but the songs in the film did raise more than a smile from me.<br/><br/>If you liked the Coen brothers' previous work, or more specifically if you loved The Big Lebowski, then you will love this.

I love, LOVE movies where every character is crazy (does Apocalypse Now and Bringing Out the Dead ring any bells?)<br/><br/>First off the movie is a little weird.  Not bizarre weird, just awkward weird.  But all Coen brothers' movies are a little twisted.  I never liked Fargo.  Yea, you heard me.

","SPOILERS AHEAD!<br/><br/>Ethan and Joel Coen are endlessly imaginative minimalist filmmakers who suffer that paradoxically debilitating disease that attack most filmmakers who want to work on a larger scale: the bigger their budget is, the worse the films come out.  ""O Brother, Where Art Thou"" is not the nightmare that ""The Hudsucker Proxy"" was; this time they keep their energy in check and the film buzzes along pretty smoothly.  That's not the problem, but THE problem. They are, like Terry Gilliam and Oliver Stone, helplessly and inevitably at the mercy of their own compulsive inventiveness.  They simply cannot stop that stream of ideas that come out.  They have to put it up there on the screen.  It's their temperament.  But, unlike Gilliam, who is a babbler, and Stone, who is a screamer,  both Coens are drawlers.  They seem enthralled by the infinite possibilities of shaggy dog looseness.  Perhaps their most successful demonstration was ""The Big Lebowski"", where they had the talented Jeff Bridges, who is easygoing drifting negligence incarnate, as the motor that drove the movie towards a satisfying nowhere.  This time around they weren't so lucky.  ""O Brother, Who Art Thou"", based on Homer's ""The Odyssey"", is a chore to get through.  Their unrelentingly lazy pace is not helped by all those production values, as well by a grossly misconceived scene at the middle of the movie where a crazy fat psychopath realistically machine-guns down a cow and another gets run over with a car.  When that happens the movie stops cold, and no amount of the tons of talent of George Clooney, John Turturro, Tim Blake Nelson or of the other members of the cast, and no matter how funny or ingenious the filmmakers could ever get, literally nobody can resurrect this movie.  After that, their creativeness gets oppressive."

","Any new Coen Brothers film is a reason to get excited especially after wetting our appetites with the Director's Cut of Blood Simple. And any new film with John Turturro is a reason to still have faith in the power of acting. But, this time around I am not entirely convinced that the Coens hit the jackpot. Paying tribute to Homer and Sturges sounds pretentious and impressive but it doesn't quite work. The story evolves at a very slow pace, the trademark wackiness seems a tad contrived and getting George Cloony to star feels like a sell out. Also, the way the Coens dealt with Depression-era politics and social issues is lightweight and unsatisfying. Having said that, this film is light years more entertaining and amusing than any Hollywood drivel that gets spewed at us regularly. The fluency of their humour is something that your De Niro/Crystal/De Vito comedies will never achieve."

","What a terrific little film!  The performances of the three escaped convicts (Clooney, Tim Blake Nelson, John Turturro) are all deserving of recognition. I was particularly fond of Nelson's numbskull ""Delmar.""  The script was based on ""The Odyssey"" by Homer and there are multiple direct references to the epic.  Set in the Great Depression, however, the Coens creatively weave half-truth histories into the story.  (Partially) Real-life politicians, crooks, Klansmen, and musicians meet up with the trio as they make their way to a hidden fortune.<br/><br/>Another remarkable achievement of this film is the incorporation of some great period music.  The soundtrack is one of the best to come out in recent memory.  Under the direction of the legendary T-Bone Burnett, ""O Brother"" resurrects the Bluegrass sounds reminiscent of Bill Monroe, Lester Flats and Earl Scruggs.  Ingeniously, the Coens fashioned the script to present the music as a major star of the film, and not just background garnish.  It's not far off to refer to this picture as a musical...or at least a parody of a musical.<br/><br/>I'm generally a big fan of Coen films.  I remember thinking that Barton Fink was the most underrated film of its day.  I think that ""O Brother"" which was really snubbed by Oscar might be picking up the baton.  Run, don't walk, to the theater to see this film.  In my estimation, it's better than each of the 5 nominees for Best Picture this year.<br/><br/>9.5 out of 10 stars."

","Reactions to this movie can typically be cut into two groups. Those who love it, and those who just don't understand what's going on. While such a requirement may keep a film from being accessible, to appreciate this movie, you have to know where it's coming from. Forget Homer, what you really need is an understanding of American folk and bluegrass music. This movie is a screwball comedy set in the land where all those bizarre old ballads came from, what Greil Marcus calls ""That old, weird America."" (other movies that have been set there include ""Night of the Hunter"" and ""Housekeeping."") This movie uses folk more effectively than any movie since ""Bound for Glory,"" and maybe more improves on even that. If you saw the movie and didn't understand it, but would like to understand why so many people are calling it a masterpiece, you should start by reading ""Mystery Train"" and ""Invisible Republic"" by Greil Marcus, then listen to some of Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music, or at least some Stanley Brothers. Get a basic understanding of that, and you'll see why this movie is so brilliant."

I will admit that with the Coens, you either love them or you don't, and if you didn't enjoy their past projects then you will probably not be amused by this one.  I must say that this film was done a great unjustice by the Academy Awards this year  Nonetheless, I found it hysterical and this is one I will definately pounce on when it hits DVD.<br/><br/>Doctor Ross no more, George Clooney has found his niche.  He has an incredible nack for humor and comedic timing and he kept me laughing at every turn.  His very Clark Gable-ish character was impecable!  Perhaps the best performance in the movie was that of Tim Blake Nelson as Delmar.  He was a scream!!  His facial expressions alone were enough to put me in stitches and when he opened his mouth he only got funnier.  Clooney, Nelson, and John Turturro made and excellent on-screen team.<br/><br/>Other notable actors in supporting roles include John Goodman as the archetypical Cyclops character, ""Big Dan"" Teague, Charles Durning as Pappy O'Daniel, Holly Hunter, who is always superb)plays Penny Wharvey McGill (Clooney's wife), and Ray McKinnon as Vernon T.

I am not familiar with the Odyssey story at all, but I really enjoyed this nostalgic romp.<br/><br/>Clooney is great in this role as Ulysses Everett McGill, a wise cracking, brylcreme addicted personality, who goes on about the state of his affairs with a huge smile and a rambling southern accent.  It was a real treat to watch him in this role.  The cinematography is also quite good, and it had that great 30's nostalgic feel and captured the era perfectly.  I am a big sucker for nostalgia in movies and this film handled it perfectly.

The Coen brothers also did a great job of portraying the 1930's South correctly, but without being judgemental about the times or trying to make a statement.

Gorgeous scenes, gorgeous sets, just plain gorgeous. And the film was marvelously acted, Clooney was a stand-out, his best performance ever (even topping the Peacemaker, and he was brilliant in that!). And Coen regulars John Turturro and John Goodman were fabulous as always! Allusions were everywhere, not just to Homer, but to Robert Johnson and Babyface (the bank robber, not the producer;), among others. The script was masterful, a perfect combination of epic flavour and modern story. This film is a keeper!

","And there I was, thinking that I could get the first review in! I was at the same NFT preview, and I was damned impressed by this film. The Coen brothers have used many actors from their usual team (Johns Goodman/Tuturro etc.) and have mixed them up with a varied bag of others to produce a very fine character driven cast. The action rarely dwindles and there are some fine set pieces to remember, many of which are punctuated by the type of visual gags that are seldom witnessed outside of a Zucker/Abrahams film. The storyline is apparently based on Homer's odyssey, but as both brothers have admitted to never having read it the plot is not constrained to any level of accuracy, and their splendid imaginations are able to run rampant. This film is a visual and comic treat, more focused that the Big Liebowski, funnier than Fargo, and as those are the only other Coen brothers films I can remember now I will end my comparisons there. Go see it."

","By far the warmest and most appealing of the Coen Brothers films, O Brother Where Art Thou is a quintessentially American film. A series of lovely vignettes are full of comic moments, yet go deeper to capture the making of Modern America. The film is beautifully photographed and lit, the hard-edge ambience of the era permeates a landscape in which innocence and cynicism fight for primacy, resulting in a draw. The music is gorgeous, the references to the Odyssey arch and humorous (Penelope with a brood of daughters, pursued by an oily pol who would replace her own flawed Ulysses, is an indelible image). And George Clooney's brave, self-mocking performance is matched at every turn by an exemplary cast. This is John Turturro's best ""everyman"" performance since Quiz Show, and there is an air of unsentimental nostalgia about the whole enterprise that is peculiarly sweet and affecting."

","I had high expectations of this film going into it, and once again, the Coen brothers have not disappointed. ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" is the type of movie that may not click with most people on the first try, but definately deserves a second or even third chance to fully understand and accept the characters. One of the biggest complaints that I've read about this movie is that it doesn't really go anywhere.  That's exactly the reason why I liked it so much.  The film doesn't concern itself with spectacular special effects (with the exception of the cow scene), intriguing plot twists, or a grand finale.  Instead, what the Coen boys are best known for is their characters. George Clooney is excellent as a fast-talking wannabe know-it-all while Tim Blake-Nelson and John Turturro are equally as good as his dim-witted sidekicks.  Clooney is quickly moving up the list of my favorite actors. I really respected the way he was able to poke fun at himself and his leading man persona by creating a character who is so worried about his appearance that he wears hair nets while he sleeps.  I left the theater (both times) thoroughly satisfied perhaps because I realized before hand what I was getting myself into.  The lush scenery of the Depression-era South and a soundtrack better than any I've heard all year only add to the rich tapestry that make up this film. I guess then, that the most important thing to remember if you do go see ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" is that it's the journey that counts, not necessarily the destination."

"jhclues","10","0","0","12 February 2001"," The One ""Sullivan"" Wanted To Make
","Producers/writers/directors Joel and Ethan Coen evoke the essence of such classic films as `Sullivan's Travels' and `I Am A Fugitive From A Chain Gang,' with their Depression Era comedy, `O Brother Where Art Thou?' directed by Joel Coen and starring George Clooney.  Borrowing the title of the `meaningful' film that successful comedy filmmaker Sullivan wanted to make in the 1941 Preston Sturges film `Sullivan's Travels,' and finally-- in reality-- making it, is only the beginning of this clever, funny tale based on Homer's `The Odyssey.'  The hero here is one Ulysses Everett McGill (Clooney), who along with two others, Pete (John Turturro) and Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson), escapes from a chain gang, commencing an `odyssey' for the trio wherein they ultimately traverse many of the railroads, back roads and tank-water towns scattered throughout the good State of Mississippi.  It becomes an adventure of the first magnitude as the three cohorts encounter situations and characters that are humorous and sometimes poignant, and-- for the audience-- always fun.  It's a richly woven tapestry of Americana (including plenty of traditional music) that is bound to leave an indelible impression in the mind of the viewer. 	Leading man Clooney has one of his best character roles yet-- it's a Clooney we've never quite seen before-- and he is more than up to the task. Invested with the mustache and rugged good looks of Clark Gable, and with his natural charisma working overtime, he creates a likable, articulate character that stands out in marked contrast to just about every other character in the film.  And he's a joy to watch; his Ulysses is a real kick from start to finish, and it's a performance that is worthy of an Oscar. Turturro, as well, creates one of his most memorable screen characters, drawing heavily upon the naturally quirky side of his own personality and accentuating his own unique physical traits which lend themselves so well to the embodiment of Pete.  And Nelson does the same with his Delmar; like Turturro, he successfully captures the soul of the character, both physically and emotionally, and-- it must be mentioned-- both actors (with Coen's help, of course) manage to avoid the trap of making their characters mere stereotypes, and it's one of the reasons they are so engaging:  These guys are the genuine article. 	The extraordinary supporting cast, all of whom individually create truly original characters in their own right, includes Holly Hunter (Penny), John Goodman (Big Dan), Chris Thomas King (Tommy), Charles Durning (Pappy O'Daniel), Del Pentecost (Junior O'Daniel) and Michael Badalucco in a memorable turn as George `Babyface' Nelson.  Not content to sit on their laurels, the Coen Brothers constantly seek to expand the boundaries of their personal cinematic universe, and they succeed splendidly with `O Brother Where Art Thou?'  It's a rousingly warm and witty and-- most importantly-- highly entertaining and creative film that takes the viewer on an unforgettable journey.  The Coen's distinct imprint, like the cinematic equivalent of The Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval, is stamped on every frame of the film, and it's like an assurance of quality and a good time to be had by all.  There's magic in the movies the Coen Brothers make, and this one goes far toward proving what anyone who has followed their movies over the years knows already:  Nobody does it quite like Joel and Ethan.  This one is not to be missed.  I rate this one 10/10."

","I really, really enjoyed this movie. It had been a long time since I'd left a movie theater feeling really good as a result of what I'd just watched, but such was the case with ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" I know a lot of critics didn't appreciate this film, saying, among other things, that it was silly, had a thin plot, or didn't make sense. It also seems that a lot of critics feel a film must have deep social relevance or a ""powerful"" message to be worthwhile. I myself do not feel this way. Movies, after all, were created as entertainment - a diversion, to make people forget about their own humdrum, sometimes dreary lives. <br/><br/>Above all else, I think movies are meant to make people feel good. And what struck me most about ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" was the sense of joy - yes, joy - that permeated the entire film. The music was transcendent, and the performances floored me. With every role, George Clooney rises in my estimation; Everett was a glorious creature, and this was thanks largely to his portrayer. John Turturro, as far as I can recall, has never given a single bad performance; I count him among the most wonderful actors of his generation. And Tim Blake Nelson - always more active behind the camera than in front of it - was a pure delight, often stealing the show from the two cinematic giants he shared the spotlight with.<br/><br/>But I keep returning to the joy. Perhaps there wasn't all that much to this movie, but I was transfixed nonetheless. I was behind Everett, Pete, and Delmar the whole way, just because they were so much fun to root for. I applaud Joel and Ethan Coen for making movies simply for the love of movies (I think this film, as much as any of their others, shows that to be the case) - in other words, for the joy of it. This was unquestionably the best film I have seen in a long time, and its simplicity, lack of pretense, and happy-go-lucky tone all played large parts in that. These days especially, pure whimsy should be cherished in the movies - after all, there's so little of it left."

","The Coen brothers have made a mark on the movies since their 1980s debut, ""Blood Simple."" They reached a mass audience with ""Fargo."" Now they have given us another skewed vision with ""O Brother, Where Art Thou."" The question is, a skewed vision of what? Of Homer's Odyssey? Of America's fly-over country? Unless I have missed something in previous Coen movies, while these co-script-writing brothers are obviously literate, this is the first time they have based the plot of a movie on a classic story, but it is not the first time they have told a story set in that vast part of the US which many movie-makers ignore. On the other hand, some residents of fly-over country might prefer to be ignored. The Coens paint America's hinterland with broad and comical strokes. I laughed at the antic characters in this movie, but I winced, too. The Coens make sport of hicks, hayseeds, rubes and hillbillies--the only people it is still politically correct to make fun of. Perhaps this is allowed precisely because such folk are themselves famously politically incorrect, or more to the point, they too often look on political correctness as alien to common sense. (If one becomes genuinely sophisticated as opposed to being a poseur, one realizes that the rubes are often right.) A sense of fair play makes me think that rural folk ought not to be picked on so much. On the other hand, I want to say, ""Yeah, but this is really funny!"" That, of course, would be regarded as a poor defense of any comedy made at the expense of some politically correct sacred cow. That said, ""O Brother Where Art Thou"" is so full of fun that I can hardly wait to see it again. Homer's tale becomes a departure point whereby every cliche about 1930s rural America in general and Mississippi in particular is rendered larger than life. You have chain gangs, ""ole timey"" country music (the way it was before Nashville discovered electric guitars), folksy politicians, new Deal hydro-electric projects, dirt-poor farmers covered with real dirt, women with seven or more children, bank-robbers who drive fast cars while wielding tommy guns, and even the Ku Klux Klan. If you don't appreciate this movie, you should check out some of the fare on American Movie Classics. The Coens are making loving fun of the style of 1930s movies, complete with a performance from George Clooney that often parodies '30s mega-star Clark Gable."

They (the three convicts) meet various characters all of equal unimportance, who simply move the film along, while sticking to its root of the ancient text. It is filled with a tremendous amount of humor that, I thought was fantastic but I fear that a broad audience won't get. The film is immersed in Country Music, but fear not, it is not the Tim McGraw or Achy Breaky Heart Country, but some wonderful mix of sounds and voices that add a tremendous amount to the film, and humor.

There hasn't been such a mistake made by prominent critics since William Shakespeare was called an uneducated hack by London critics in the 1500's.<br/><br/>O Brother Where Art Thou is a film that stands so far above any competition in the comedy arena this year that I'm afraid a lot of critics can't see its brilliance.  It's a Coen Brothers movie so, of course, the writing's slick, the characters are interesting, the actors are given the chance to be as creative as they can, and the movie itself is just beautiful to watch. What makes this movie stand out is the way that it combines so many different elements of creative history to form one boiled down piece of art.  Here is a just a little taste of what is going on in this movie:  Sullivan's Travels, Homer's Odyssey, The Wizard of Oz, Bonnie and Clyde, Cool Hand Luke, Robert Penn Warren's All the King's Men, James Dickey's Deliverance, not to mention a real modern-day commentary on spirituality.  That's not all that's happening here, either.  I could write a book about it.  There WILL be books written about it.<br/><br/>There's a KKK scene in the film where the hooded imbeciles dance around in a semi-choreographed ritual before attempting to lynch a black man.  This scene bothers people because it makes fun of something we as a society deem so serious.  I agree, the KKK (especially at its height of popularity) was a serious problem.  However, in this film, the KKK can't sing on key, can't dance without stumbling over each other, have a one-eyed member with only one-eye poked out of his hood, have a dwarf in a KKK suit, and don't have ANY control over the situation at hand. Get it? Not only are the KKK in this movie clearly villains they are also extreme idiots.<br/><br/>Okay, I think that's enough, even though I could go on and on.<br/><br/>
There are some truly mesmerizing scenes in this film.  The writing here is as fancy as the visuals in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.  There aren't many flying swordfights or digitally enhanced scenes in O Brother, but the words dance and zoom over the rooftops of the American South."

It gets everything right - it's unassuming but by no means inconsequential, another masterpiece of comic mythmaking that builds on ""The Big Lebowski"" and goes further and higher.  It's certainly not plot-driven - Homer's Odyssey primarily provides a rationale for the hanging-together of episodes on motifs, as well as helping to create a fantastical atmosphere in which the everyday and the supernatural mingle. The Coens get away with scenes that would be disastrous in most films (how they manage it I don't know, but they can work the Klan into a comedy without trivialising the organisation); they contrive to be sentimental and disabused, romantic and down-to-earth at the same time.  <br/><br/>George Clooney anchors the film with a fairly relaxed, straight performance that builds on his ""Out of Sight"" persona, and this enables many of the supporting performances to go for baroque.  Turturro proves his versatility yet again.  In many ways, though, the musicians are the stars of the show; I'm utterly ignorant of bluegrass, but I think I'm going to have to buy the soundtrack album."

","All Coen Brothers' movies are fantastic in the literal sense of the word, yet they are done with great intelligence, technical skill, attention to detail; and always, strongly, with an overt and subtle sense of humor. A person can easily slip into the flow of the story. This is what happens with O Brother, Where Art Thou?<br/><br/>The story takes place in rural Mississippi during the depression years. The costumes, settings and props look so authentic, and the actors are so engaging and play their roles so well, and they are so well directed, that there were times that I forgot that this was a modern film. The Coen brothers' unusual (and often disturbing) sense of humor is in practically every scene of the film. But when the humor is disturbing, as it is in most of their films, there is a reason for it; it is a comment on human weakness and human triumph. Their films are the medieval Morality Plays of the late 20th - early 21st century, and O Brother, Where Art Thou? Is one of their best."

"The Masticator","Null","0","0","22 September 2000"," Not the best Coens film, but far from the worst
","While the Coens appear to have reached the status of ""They who shall never be derided, ever"" among critics, there are still those of us who point knowingly to the confusion and misjudged intricacy of ""Miller's Crossing"" and the often hellish excesses of ""Barton Fink"" and say: ""Boys, you're admittedly great, but you're not perfect. We're not going to wet our pants automatically as soon as you make a new movie. You've still got to convince us."" So I come to the new Coens movie with a more open mind than some.<br/><br/>After the masterpiece double-whammy of ""Fargo"" and ""The Big Lebowski"" - the latter often seen as somehow Coen Brothers Lite, mainly because it is so very funny, but repeated viewings attest that it is one of their best, most tightly-plotted and well-acted films with inspired dialogue throughout - ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" is an oddity as well as an odyssey. Apologies for that lame joke, there. But it certainly rambles far more than any other Coen, while the down-home dialogue lacks the sparkle we've come to expect from them.<br/><br/>The credits tell us that it's based on Homer: well, frankly, they could have got away with pretending that it was original, as the Homeric references are few and far between (John Goodman's eyepatch signals that he is the Cyclops; the singing Sirens; Everett's wife is called Penny). As a whole, though, the film does resemble ""The Odyssey"" in that the main character is wandering, seemingly aimlessly, for a long time without really doing anything - things just happen to him. This is not really a criticism; trying to stick closely to Homer would have no doubt been false and ridiculous.<br/><br/>The performances, of course, are exemplary; George Clooney gives an old-fashioned, rip-roaring turn as the dapper Everett while relative newcomer Tim Blake Nelson is funny and sweet. The Coen regulars (Turturro, Hunter, Goodman, Durning) need only to turn up to be great. The period look is fantastic, Roger Deakins' photography is beautiful and the film simply engages and entertains, without trying to grip or thrill. Neither does it fall prey to the clever-cleverness of so many movies made by intelligent, literate filmmakers. It also contains more than one classic moment of Coen comic absurdity.<br/><br/>My guess is that like ""Lebowski"", ""O Brother"" will improve immeasurably with repeated viewings, as the rich subtleties of plot and performance become clearer. Not a masterpiece, then - for now at any rate - but an undoubted success."

"Brogan","10","0","0","18 January 2001"," Joel & Ethan's Odyssey.
","There are two sides to film directors Joel & Ethan Coen.  There is the dark and suspenseful side which they showed in BLOOD SIMPLE and FARGO. Then there is the goofy and wacky side displayed in RAISING ARIZONA and HUDSUCKER PROXY.  With thier new film, O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU? the Coen Brothers use the wacky and silly road in telling a modern version of Homer's classic poem, 'The Odyssey.'  And the Coen's use their trademarks throughout this film, from the comical and amazing stunts to John Turturro. Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney) is a prisoner in the state of Mississippi during depression 1930's.  Ulysses is a man who takes good care of his hair with 'Dapper Dan' hair grease and wearing hair nets while sleeping, and has a rather unusual intellect for a prisoner in the 1930's. Ulysses decides to break free from work detail one day bringing along his two chainmates, Pete (John Turturro) and Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson).  Where Ulysses is smart, Pete is arrogant, and Delmar is not too bright.  Ulysses convinces his mates to escape from prison to seek the pile of gold that Ulysses hid before getting sent to jail. They first run into a blind prophet on a handcart who predicts that the three men will be going on a great journey on their way back home. While on their way back to Ulysses' homestead, they have the same encounters that the character of Ulysses encountered in 'The Odyssey.' Like 'Odyssey' Ulysses, Pete, and Delmar encounter Sirens, a criminal being George ""Babyface"" Nelson, a godess turning one of them into a frog, Zeus (as Governor Pappy O' Daniel), Cyclops (Big Dan Teague), suitors, and even Charybdis.  All of these enconters led for Ulysses to see his soon to be ex-wife Penny (Holly Hunter) before she marries a crooked suitor and taking their seven daughters with her. The very enjoyable thing about O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU? is comparing this film to The Odyssey.  Having been ""force read"" Odyssey in high school, I understood the ""inside jokes"" that Joel and Ethan Coen put into this film for the modern telling of the thousands of years old poem. If Hollywood filmmakers like Baz Lurhman can do modern version of William Shakespeare's ROMEO & JULLIET, then why can't the Coen's do Odyssey?<br/><br/>I also did enjoy the acting in this film.  George Clooney proves that he is not only a cool actor, but also funny and good!  He makes Ulysses a character what Pete calls, ""a big mouth smart aleck.""  Ulysses is a man who doesn't believe in faith, but believes in coindences and luck instead. While Pete and Delmar who Ulysses calls, ""dumber than a bag of hammers,"" do believe in faith and superstition, which makes Ulysses either egotistical or intelligent or perhaps both. And Tim Blake Nelson is also very enjoyable as the not too bright Delmar who is usually in the middle of the arguments between Ulysses and Pete, and who does believe in old fashion superstition.  And the other actors, from John Turturro, Charles Durning, John Goodman, Holly Hunter, and Michael Badalucco all deliver good performances as well. But two things stand out with O BROTHER, first is the bluegrass music, it's outstanding!  There are lots of classic songs that are depression era time that is played on the soundtrack of the film.  But the modern written ""Man of Constant Sorrow"" which is sung by Ulysses, Pete and Delmar as the ""Soggy Bottom Boys"" is the best song that will have you humming as you leave the theater.  And the directing by Joel Coen is also very well done, with great pacing, some very amusing scenes, and wacky characters makes O BROTHER a splendid comedy. In the Year in Review 2000 issue of Entertainment Weekly, film critic Owen Gilbertman said that O BROTHER was the ""Worst Movie of 2000.""  The worst?  More worse than other terrible movies with the likes of READY TO RUMBLE, BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE, SUPERNOVA, NEXT BEST THING, and the dreaded BATTLEFIELD EARTH?  I think Mr. Gilbertman either had obnoxious people sitting next to him, or had a bad hangover from a party the night before while watching O BROTHER at the Cannes Film Festival.  How could this very enjoyable and wacky film be bad?  Yet he give a movie like CHARLIE'S ANGELS a ""B"" for being trashy, yet fun?  At least film critic Roger Ebert gave O BROTHER another chance before giving a final review, to saying that some scenes were good, but not good enough to recommend.  I think Mr. Gilbertman should pick up a copy of 'The Odyssey' and realize the similarites between the film pieces of art. But there are still plenty of big and small named critics who praise O BROTHER, and it's even nominated for Best Picture (Comedy/Musical) for Golden Globes.  And after watching this movie I can see why.  It's the Coen's doing their Dr. Jekyl filmmaking, the lightweight fun and goofy side of a story.  But some critics and Coen fans prefer the Mr. Hyde vision of the Coens, with dark and moody.  But whether you enjoy wacky films or just the Coens in general (like me) then O BROTHER will please you a great deal, with you humming the songs from the soundtrack on the way home.  ***** (out of five)"

","I'm sorry to sound like a spoil-sport, but if this film been made any less than the Coen Brothers, I would have watched it, mildly enjoyed it, and held my peace. However, given the quality of the brothers' previous efforts, and given the overwhelmingly favorable reception this film has got so far, I feel duty bound to express my disappointment at the brothers' latest effort.<br/><br/>Is the film really so funny ? It is if you enjoy endless, laboured repetition of gags that were not so clever in the first place. For those who have not seen the movie yet, please skip to the next paragraph, although all I'm giving away is that I don't understand how repeating ""We're in a tight spot"" three or four times, or repeatedly saying ""I thought you were a toad"" qualifies as humour. The first time round these evoked a slight titter: the second, third and fourth time around, a definite yawn. There are undoubtedly better moments, such as that provided by John Candy as psychopathic con-man. However I found that the film generally fell short of the ironic, comic judgement that was there in the brothers' earlier films such as ""Barton Fink"" and ""Fargo"".<br/><br/>Was it visually interesting ? Certainly, many shots have a richness of color which rivals the most over-the-top southern-comfort advert, and there's a fair share of shots that pan, fade, and zoom with agonizing slowness. But this plush, cinematic indulgence is surely the preserve of  lesser talents who need it to spice up their indifferent films. Give me the cool arctic flatlands of Fargo any day, or the bleak earthiness of Blood Simple. I'm sorry, but the perpetual golden summery haze of ""O Brother"" totally failed to excite.<br/><br/>Good performances ? Underfortunately, the three leads had nothing to get to grips with. Take the  George  Clooney  character.  About five  minutes  into  the film, we  ascertain that he's self-important , pretentious and obsessed  with his hair,  and that's  about the sum  of it.  His  portrayal of the  character  stays at this level for the  duration of the film which,   to me,  seemed very long. From a performance point of view, the other two leads fare no better. Again, John Candy's  contribution lightens the gloom somewhat. But the  film is otherwise  burdened with a galaxy of mediocre character roles which are devoid of the originality that   we  have   come  to expect from the Coen Brothers.<br/><br/>I could go  on and on (especially when it comes to the moral confusion that consistently blights the film) , but  suffice it to say that this flabby film disappoints where other Coen  Brother films have delighted. I know I'm in  a minority on this one, but I  hope my review redresses the balance."

","This film is a spectacle of sorts.  Y'see there's these three soggy sonsubitches by the names of Everett (Clooney) Pete (Turturro) and Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson), who escape from a chain gang and embark on a journey acrost the state of Mississippi in the depression era 1930s.  Loosely following Homer's Odyssey, they jump from one frying pan into the next fire, and over again.  They get lost, get saved (a marvelous baptism scene) and manage to squeeze themselves into the strangest musical renditions and dance sequences imaginable.  Clooney gives a classic performance as a character I can best describe as the humanized version of Foghorn Leghorn: a know-it-all who loves to hear himself speak.  Then there's Pete played by John Turturro who's a grumpy guy along for the ride.  At the bottom of this food chain gang is Delmar played by Tim Blake Nelson.  Ole Delmar is a simple fellow with a good heart who's trying to keep a clean spirit in leu of the events these characters become involved in.  Woven into this deep South motif are a black blues singer who sold his soul to the devil, two shady candidates for the guvna's office, and a one eyed Bible salesman played by John Goodman. There's so many things to notice in this film.  There's a looney tunes quality, but also a very realistic quality, portraying the Depression era politics and poverty to a T.  There's also a three stooges quality, and the at the same time a very Preston Sturgess humanist thing.  It's the perfect balance for me but quite possibly the coolest thing about this film is the music, topping off that old timey look the film has.  It's awesome bluegrass, delta blues, and gospel music and it's a character of it's own in the film.  Long live the Coens and O Brother, I will be in line to see this again."

","Throughout their film career, the Coen Brothers have never disappointed, except at the box office. Whether this film will be a commercial success remains to be seen, I saw it the first weekend of release in the UK with only a small handful of other people.

The script is a masterpiece of dialogue realistically creating the 30s yet referencing modern day issues. The acting is sublime, George Clooney is on top form, John Turturro is always good but there's also an excellent performance from relative newcomer Tim Blake Nelson. John Goodman shows up in a brilliant cameo as a bible salesman/thief/KKK member. Also add into this an excellent supporting cast and Holly Hunter to boot. O Brother contains without doubt the funniest Ku Klux Klan scene I've ever watched which should be required viewing for Klan members and activists alike to make them all realise how daft they look! A word too for the soundtrack, a mishmash of 30s blues and country. I'll be queueing up for the CD! The Coen brothers really are master story tellers, true artists in an industry full of artisans. Who cares if it's a commercial success? Hollywood probably will so for the sake of there being many many more Coen Bros. movies go and see it! You will not regret it."

","I loved this movie. Basically I got to see 2 for the price of one. Not only is it a hilarious, zany, comedy but also a long overdue, heartwarming tribute to American roots music. The soundtrack is incredible and I hope it goes platinum. Congratulations and thanks to T-Bone Burnett. Being a great fan of the famous blues legend, Robert Johnson, I was tickled to see him get some screen time in this movie as ""Tommy Johnson"", sidekick to the Soggy Bottom Boys who, with the fake beards could quite easily pass for another fine blues band from the South - ZZ Top !!. If you love authentic American roots music of any kind you will appreciate this movie. As far as the acting goes, it is all round superb. George Clooney's performance has converted me from a sceptic to a believer.<br/><br/>Though the Odyssey is ostensibly the inspiration for the movie, I think the Coen Brothers are trying to put us off the scent of what must be the real inspiration - Jim Jarmusch's classic 1986 ""Down by Law"" featuring Tom Waits, Roberto Begnini (before his Life was Beautiful), and John Lurie. Down by Law is also about the rambling adventures of 3 misfit escaped convicts, only they are on the loose in the bayous of Louisiana, not Mississippi, and even has the same roasted gopher scene in it. Rent at your local video store if you can find it.<br/><br/>Quite simply the movie experience of the year for me."

","I have been shaking my head over the reviews this film is getting - even Roger Ebert and CNN, not to mention many writers here, apparently find it disjointed and plot less. How bizarre! I, and my housemates, walked out raving about the tightness of the plot. No character is superfluous, every thread begun is knotted in at the end - it's as neat as fine beadwork. I don't want to give away plot points, but trust me, it's just delectable how elegantly characters weave in and out of the plot, found and lost and saved just in time to do their part. Look, just for one example, at the scene where the Soggy Bottom Boys perform at the political rally, and at least five plot elements converge in about ten seconds of lovely reaction shots. Disjointed my boot! How can people be missing this?<br/><br/>And that's not even all the good stuff! This is a beautiful movie, handsomely shot in bleached-out tones that fill the screen with the heat and weariness of the Depression South. The much-praised soundtrack deserves it. The performances are rich with quirky humor and affection; I can hardly remember feeling so good after a movie. That the Coens have chosen to use just about the entire catalog of pop-culture period Southern references - open-air baptism, singing chain gangs, the Ku Klux Klan, Huey Long-style politicians, bluesmen selling their souls at the crossroads - only adds to the abstracted and gentle comedy of the film. Even the firelit Klan meeting combines menace with absurdity, looking as if choreographed by the team of Leni Riefenstahl and Busby Berkeley. (Honestly, I just don't see all the ridicule and mockery of country Southerners that others are seeing here. It's too good-natured for that.) The thread of Homer's Odyssey runs through it more smoothly than you'd expect, from the prophetic, blind handcar man as Teiresias the seer (and maybe as Charon the boatman of the Styx as well); to the alluring sirens at the river --with a nod to Circe, the sorceress who turned men into animals, when a frog is mistaken for a transformed man; to big John Goodman as a club-wielding, eyepatched Cyclops; and of course to Ulysses' need to get home before his wife Penny (Penelope) remarries. And there are scenes of wonderful beauty and magic realism, like the singing, white-clad Baptists drifting through the woods toward the river, and the dreamy vision of the Sirens at their washing.<br/><br/>This is a fine, fine movie, the Coens back at top form after the *utterly* disappointing and depressing ""Big Lebowski"", and the rest of 2001 is gonna have to do some work to come up with a better film."

When Everett just sat like an idiot while Big Dan clubbed his companion, I lost whatever sympathy I may have had for Everett. I also cannot imagine that the participants in a KKK rally would march around like a high school band from the land of Oz. Maybe that was supposed to be humorous, I don't know. Being from Mississippi, I also did not appreciate that the state was presented as some exaggerated, grotesque caricature of how some people probably perceive the state. The scenery was also not as attractive as what I've personally seen in the state. I'm sorry, I just thought all the characters were stupid, foolish, self-centered and with no common sense.

","I think that Coen Brothers are two of the greatest directors of all time, they are two of my favorite directors too. Art, entertainment and cinema feeling, most of their movies I have seen include all. People under-appreciated their last movie, No Country for Old Men and some people even hated it and say very overrated. To me the best Coen movies are Barton Fink and No Country for Old Men. However, O Brother where art Thou was not art, was not enjoyable and extremely insipid (lack of cinema feeling?) Besides, Coen Brothers make black comedies, there is black humor in their movies, except for Raising Arizona (it might be seen as black comedy too), but many people say that this movie is a definite comedy, it is very funny, full of laughs. There are a few possibilities. These people may be the people who have never watched any Peter Sellers film, Robin Williams film or Bill Murray film, these people may have a very different comedy conception or these people were cheerful at that time. Because, there was not even one moment I laughed or found funny in the movie. However, this is not important, it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen, because it was not entertaining, it was not stylish (not art) and cinematically tasteless. Is there anything makes person flabbergasted, astonished? The only thing interesting was Red Kit reference. It is an uninspiring adventure of three men. The series of uninteresting events.

I think the Odyssey has not been produced on film because of its complex structure and Hollywood's general ignorance of this classic epic. People who have not read the Odyssey will be mislead by the film's advertised similarities to Homer's timeless work. Unlike Homer's brilliance in content and presentation and organization of his long poem, this waste of viewer's time is a below-average attempt to be funny and entertaining.

Indeed, the cast plays an imperative role in this production,but they aren't the only aspect that requires praise.<br/><br/>The whole concept of the plot being centered around Greek mythology is genius, and works astonishingly well. The whole production is very original, honestly there are few films like this one.<br/><br/>But of course, the best aspect of the whole film is by far the musical contribution. Picking a favorite song is hard, every single one is naturally catchy. Truthfully, even if the casting was below par and the Greek mythological dimension was absent from the film, the music alone could probably carry it in my opinion.

","Over the years, i've watched this movie maybe 20 or 30 times and every time I find something new to laugh about. The Coen Brother have crafted a hilariously dysfunctional buddy movie in O Brother, Where art Thou? which never ceases to make me smile. Loosely based off Homer's epic ""The Odyssey"", the story follows 3 men who, after escaping from a chain gang in depression era Mississipi, set out on a search for buried treasure left behind by George Clooney's character Ulysses Everett McGill. Along the way they meet all sorts of quirky characters which include an unscrupulous Bible Salesman, a horse eating redneck, a bank robbing lunatic, an ornery flour tycoon(who also happens to be Governor), a young man who sells his soul to the devil and a very peculiar blind man who owns a recording studio. It's safe to say the Coen Bros. took their time fleshing out the minor roles in this film and every new character you encounter feels very original. Credit is also due to the actors for performing these roles, but the writing in this movie is simply fantastic.<br/><br/>Which brings me to my next point. The dialogue in this script is some of the funniest, most entertaining in films today. Everett McGill(played by Clooney) is the smooth talking, seemingly over-educated convict who self appoints himself leader of the escapees and is easily the bright spot of this film. Clooney's character is as hilarious as he is flamboyant and is definitely one of his best acting performances to date. Tuturro and Nelson are also quite funny as the bumbling idiot companions to McGill as they set out across Mississipi looking for the treasure. Some of the funniest moments in this movie involve simple conversations between the 3 and seeing the clearly uneducated companions try to make sense of McGill's over expanded vocabulary. Holly Hunter is also great in this movie as McGill's estranged wife and adds an extra dimension to the story that is quite interesting. <br/><br/>The Coen Brothers are known for writing fleshed out, quirky characters in their movies and this one is no exception. The writing is witty and the acting is exceptional by everyone. The theme is meant to be light hearted while also maintaining a sense of realism for the time period in which it is set. I give them a lot of credit for staying true to the accuracy of the period but also keeping the feel of the film lighthearted and fun(Tough to do as depression era Mississipi was not a lighthearted or fun period in time at all). I also have to add that the score of this movie fits perfectly, mixing old time county/bluegrass to perfect effect. Overall, this is not only one of the best Coen Bros. films but, in my opinion, one of the best 50 films of all time. The humor is(mostly) clean as well so it can be enjoyed by a wider age group than many modern comedies. A can't miss film by some of the best Writers/Directors of our time."

","The Film is called "" O Brother, Where are Thou ? "" is directed by Joel Coen and having been written by his brother Ethan Coen. The story is a Hy-bred cross between a Depression era saga and Homor's ancient epic 'The Odyssey.' Three convicts escape a Chain gang and set off on a journey of discovery during the 1930s'. Though a bit confusing, the Characters more than explain their philosophies and their thoughts on life, each concluding that their suffering and predicaments are part of the natural order of things. Indeed, the stars of the movie more than anything else, give life to the escaping prisoners. George Clooney plays Everett McGill, an educated con-man with family troubles. John Turturro is Pete Hogwallop and Tim Blake Nelson are his two inmate followers who share his trek across the countryside. John Goodman, Michael Badalucco (As Baby-face Nelson) and Charles Durning join the cast and are credited with the spark of Good Ole southern Boys found throughout the story. Escaping from their captivity, the boys search for a buried treasure and are warned by a blind man that what they'll find is not what they hope for. In the meanwhile during the country election they find that their musical talents promise more than they know. What is a complete surprise in this film is the singing talent of George Clooney. Sophisticate in many other movies, in this one he delights audiences with his true down-home demeanor. All in all a real home-spun movie which will delight audiences everywhere. Well Done. ****"

It has its moments but the narrative is too meandering to hold together. Clooney is fine, as is the rest of the cast, but the comedy is too broad to make this anything more than a curiosity piece. The songs are tuneful, particularly ""The Man of Constant Sorrow.""

","America is a young country, but it is not without a rich mythology. We may not think of it in this way, but the modern era has its folk tales, and they are defined in literature, theatre and of course cinema. In recent years some of the best American folk tales have been woven by that eminent fraternal writer-director team, the brothers Coen. O Brother Where Art Thou? was among their most profound yet playful.<br/><br/>In writing this picture the brothers weave together numerous cultural motifs, many of them from the movies. The title itself is that of the fictional movie in Sullivan's Travels. We see depression-era legends such as the good-natured bank robber and the blues guitarist selling his soul alongside cinematic references as disparate as The Wizard of Oz and Doctor Strangelove. All this is loosely structured around Homer's Odyssey, drawing together the strands of this modern mythology with that of the ancient world.<br/><br/>And as a directorial team, the Coens have a mark of simplicity and gentleness which allows the best elements of the movie to shine through. The pacing of each scene is considered and languid. This doesn't make things boring; it allows us to savour each glorious country scene or earthy expression. There is so much packed into each moment, showing us a rich world beyond the storyline. The Coens bring out period details, not through the wider shots but through seemingly inconsequential bits of background business, like the copy of Ward's catalogue that props up Hogwallop's boy on his seat.<br/><br/>The resultant movie is both witty and meaningful, but also beautiful and human. The brothers Coen show us a people whose peculiarities are just as beautiful or as harsh as the landscapes around them. Filled with deliberate anachronism (""You Are My Sunshine"" for example was not written until some years after it's set) and broad stretches of logic, O Brother Where Art Thou is not so much a historical movie as a mystical yet familiar dream of America's past."

To its credit, it's funny, and quite unlike any other film you'll have seen before. To its detriment, as with a lot of other Coen films, it's not especially emotionally engaging, and there's little in the way of coherent plot, just a ramble through the brothers' strange imagination. As for the claim in the opening credits that it's based on Homer's odyssey, there are some nods in this direction, but don't expect anything too literal; just remember that 'Fargo' was ""based on a true story"" in the same fashion."

","Java Man Reviews ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" (2000, PG-13). Directed by Joel Coen. Written by Ethan Coen and Joel Coen. Starring George Clooney, John Turturro, Tim Blake Nelson, John Goodman and Holly Hunter. Running Time: 103 minutes. Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com.<br/><br/>OVERVIEW: <br/><br/>During the 1930s, Ulysses Everett McGill (Clooney) and two of his prison pals, Pete and Delmar (Turturro and Nelson) escape from a Mississippi chain gang and embark upon a Depression era odyssey. While their primary goal is to locate an elusive buried treasure, Ulysses is also eager to return to his long-neglected wife, Penny (Hunter). Along the way, the trio's exploits parallel those of the hero of Homer's hexameters: They meet a blind prophet who guides their journey, a one-eyed brute (Cyclops) who thwarts it, and seductive sirens who pleasantly divert it. As the journey continues, ancient Greek mythology merges with modern American myth, with the landscape yielding up fabled characters from our own time, including outlaw George Nelson (""Don't call me Baby Face!"") and blues legend Robert Johnson (who sold his soul at the crossroads in exchange for guitar-playing genius.) Like the Odyssey, this movie moves magnificently toward an action-packed conclusion.<br/><br/>REVIEW: 4 STARS OUT OF 4<br/><br/>"" . . . and the Oscar goes to . . . HOMER!"" Though the Academy doesn't give out awards to 2,800-year-old epic poets, this film was nominated for best-adapted screenplay, with the ""material previously published"" being Homer's Odyssey. In earlier years, the Academy has given awards for original story, and once engraved a statuette for George Bernard Shaw for 1938's Pygmalion. (A bit of trivia: Shaw is the only person to have won both a Nobel Prize for Literature and an Oscar.) Whether it's Homer, Shakespeare, Shaw or the Coen Brothers, great stories make great movies.<br/><br/>But the Coens ransack more than just Homer. The title of this film comes from Preston Sturges' 1941 classic, Sullivan's Travels, in which the title character wants to make a serious film, and has titled it ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" And of course, Sullivan's Travels, pays homage to Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels, which in turn looks back to Homer's Odyssey. The performances also run back and forth through time. At the center of it is Clooney who plays Ulysses like the reincarnation of Clark Gable, even down to the well-trimmed mustache. One of today's big stars plays one of yesterday's big stars playing a character whose first name is the Latin version of Odysseus. Again, it all comes back to Homer and his seminal story.<br/><br/>Coen regulars also portray a parade of quirky characters. Goodman is intimidating as the one-eyed Bible thumper who parallels Homer's Cyclops. (Look for him too in a hilarious Ku Klux Klan scene where his sheet has only one eye hole.) As the poet's Penelope, Hunter embodies a more modern, less constant version of wifely virtue, with seven daughters and little patience for her absent husband. Turturro is completely submerged in the pensive character of Pete, while Nelson's deadpan Delmar is performed with perfect comic timing. Even cameos were played to perfection, such as Stephen Root's blind radio station owner.<br/><br/>Roger Deakins' Oscar-nominated cinematography provides generous views of the Mississippi countryside, adding to the film's epic quality. The music, which both the characters and the filmmakers take seriously, accounts for much of the movie's spirit. The twangy tunes were put together by a collaboration of some of today's finest folk musicians, including T-Bone Burnett and Gillian Welch.<br/><br/>Like epic poetry, film can carry us beyond the horizon, beyond hard times, to a place where the spirit of the Odyssey and the spirit of the American dream become one."
"Electrified_Voltage","8","1","2","5 September 2007"," A good comedy adventure set in 1930s Mississippi
","I first learned about this movie years ago, possibly around the time it was first released, and first heard ""I am a Man of Constant Sorrow"" from the soundtrack soon afterwards. However, it wasn't until just over a year ago that I finally actually saw ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" (I guess that was because I didn't watch many movies during the early 2000s). With my first viewing, I wasn't amazed, but it was still enough for me to give positive feedback, and I don't think that changed with my very recent second viewing.<br/><br/>The story is loosely based on the ancient poem, ""The Odyssey"", by Homer, but takes place in Mississippi, during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Ulysses Everett McGill, Pete, and Delmar are three convicts who escape from a chain gang. After doing so, they set out on a journey to reach the buried loot that Everett speaks of! Along their way, they encounter many people who influence their trip, and may cause them trouble, including sirens, a crazy bankrobber named George ""Babyface"" Nelson, a Bible salesman named Big Dan Teague, a Ku Klux Klan lynch mob, etc. Trying to avoid being caught is not the only challenge that these three convicts have to face! <br/><br/>I'm not sure about the first time I watched this, but while I watched it a second time, I had trouble staying into it early in the film, and trouble seeing the motion picture as much of a comedy. However, I eventually found myself more into it, and started laughing more, even though I may not have found any of the gags absolutely hilarious. Overall, ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" is a good comedy adventure (not great, but good), with the memorable ""I am a Man of Constant Sorrow"" song, as well as some crazy characters (which is mostly what makes it funny), for those who want that."
"skm15","10","1","2","16 August 2007"," My Favourite Movie
","I just recently signed up to IMDb, and this is my first review. I saw this movie a few years ago and loved it. Although it was only during the second watch I fully appreciated it. The plot is well thought out and includes all the events of Homer's Odyssey. The humour is hilarious and there are many great characters, even if they only appear in one scene. I am a fan of George Clooney and he plays Ulysses Everett McGill brilliantly. The music is also a very enjoyable part of the film with its soundtrack winning 'Album of the Year'. I've recommended it to a few friends and they thought it was great as well. I give it a definite 10/10 and as I said in the title, this is my favourite movie. I would highly recommend it for anyone."
"runnoft-1","10","1","2","20 May 2007"," Still my *FAVORITE* movie
","I saw this movie in the theater when it first came out, and loved it then. When it became available to own on VHS (and then later DVD) I bought it. I've seen it probably 25 times, and each and every time I see it, I glean a bit more from it.<br/><br/>I love everything the Coen Brothers do, this being their best, in my opinion. EVERY line, I mean EVERY line, is genius. The comedy is often subtle, or ""dark"", but some is outright. I'm not familiar with Homer's Odyssey, (which the movie is VERY loosely based on) but actually bought a copy of the book to further engross myself in this movie; to see the correlations, besides the Cyclops.<br/><br/>Terrific acting, terrific music, humor, action, romance, comedy, drama... does it lack anything? NO is the answer. The Coen Brothers combined brain is a theatrical genius. To me, no movie made prior or since, by them or anyone, comes NEAR the caliber of the brilliance of this movie. Do NOT miss it, OR the soundtrack!<br/><br/>Just a note: I don't pick movies apart, I look at the total package. This one is a 90 minute vacation of pure enjoyment."
"j-665","10","1","2","15 February 2007"," The Cohen's Best
","It's an absolute crime that this movie is not in the top in the top 250. Actually its a crime that it's not in the top 10. I reckon it should be about number 9. Shame on all the people who have voted on this movie. This movie is truly impossible to categorize into one genre. It succeeds as a drama, musical, action movie, love story and comedy all in equal doses. I might add that it succeeds brilliantly at all levels. This is the movie where I finally gained respect for George Clooney,s work and have been a huge fan ever since. Actually all the performances were top notch. The soundtrack is the best movie soundtrack ever and i,ve been a fan of Bluegrass music ever since. The most under-rated movie ever!!!!"
"muskrat-5","10","1","2","13 November 2006"," This is a classic.
","I've seen this film three times now and each time I find new reasons to love it. It - just - gets - better. The scenery is exactly right, the casting was A-1, the acting is great and everything fits together like a jigsaw puzzle.<br/><br/>I can't say enough good things about this film, but since we have a minimum requirement on IMDb I'll try to say more. Oh right, I really love the music in this film. I don't care that Clooney didn't do his own singing, the lip sync was very good and the pieces chosen for inclusion reminded me of my grandfather and my father who knew how to make that kind of music (but on the fiddle).<br/><br/>This should be a required view for all students in American schools. Sure, it ain't ""hist'ry"", but it's ""derned"" close! Ahem..."
"trampoline","10","1","2","29 January 2006"," American cinematic masterpiece
","This film hits every mark needed to qualify as a true classic. I'm not a slapstick comedy fan and i don't enjoy the juvenile situation comedies, so this film was indeed a curiosity to me when it was first released since it was based on ""The Odyssey"". But I had no earthly idea that its purely American themes of prison convicts on the lamb, stumbling/singing ones way to instant fame, seeking an imaginary fortune and political opportunism would meld into a story that is both charming and, thanks to Homer, intricate. The Coen Brothers were extremely fortunate to have cast George Clooney as the quick-talking philosopher Everet and Tim Blake Nelson as the simple-minded but revolutionary Delmer. John Turturro's Pete is Oscar worthy, enough said. The much glorified soundtrack is pure inspiration and deserves much credit for making this film so remarkable. The Three Stooges never had so many wonderful discussions nor displayed the innocence that the Soggy Bottom Boys put into their efforts. ""Being steeped in old timey"" is one of this film's best qualities for the cinematography is remarkably characteristic of the Depression laden South and the Coens use Dixie's traditions and its institutions to their full advantage. This is a don't miss film and one of the all-time best comedies."
"patrick_dunne","8","1","2","20 October 2005"," Damn, We're in a Tight Spot!
","""Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?"" is the Odyssey-based, music-filled, Coen brothers' title that stars three men (Everett, Delmar and Pete) who have escaped from their prison work. Everett, Delmar and Pete end up looking for a treasure which is buried by Everett's cabin. Along the way, the three encounter many obstacles such as: sirens, bible salesmen, horse-eating family members and a cow on a cotton roof. (Which really isn't an obstacle) <br/><br/>This movie is pretty unique and funny at the same time. The story and music may be a bit unoriginal, but the jokes certainly are. They aren't slapstick or complete randomness, but a bit clever, and silly at the same time.<br/><br/>Filled with jokes and tons of bluegrass music, there is some more appeal added into the movie. Though, some of the movie really depends on your sense of humor and taste in music, it is a great film, nonetheless. It also spawned one of the greatest quotes in movies: ""Damn, we're in a tight spot!""<br/><br/>Those Coen Brothers (also known for comedies such as ""Fargo"" and ""The Big Lebowski"") sure know comedies.<br/><br/>8/10"
"jboothmillard","7","1","2","14 September 2005"," O Brother, Where Art Thou?
","I don't exactly understand the meaning of the title, probably something to do with country folk or the time that the characters were living in, but it is a good film from the Coen brothers. This is quite an interesting story about some escape prisoners (with some accent) on the run and trying to get on with a new life. Golden Globe winning George Clooney as Ulysses Everett McGill is really good (and if it was really him), he is good at singing. On the way Clooney and his two companions Pete (John Turturro) and Delmar O'Donnell (Tim Blake Nelson) meet farm people, some police and a KKK group run by Big Dan Teague (John Goodman). Also starring Holly Hunter as Penny Although the ending is a tiny bit unlikely and confusing, the rest is still a film to watch. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published, it was nominated the BAFTAs for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Production Design and Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. George Clooney was number 72 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 7 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols. Very good!"
"ulyssestone","9","1","2","4 January 2005"," Funny and pleasing to both the eye and the mind
","when those first lines of Odysseys appeared, I thought, woo, these guys are really humorous. Then after a funny western ballad the rodomontade line came out that read Based on Homer's Odysseys. It really made some sense on that. The Sirens, they are, er, they are beautiful. And the Cyclops, er, he is really strong. It is funny that in Homer's epic Ulysses was cursed by Poseidon, but in this film those guys was finally saved by a flood. As well as Ulysses was smote hip and thigh while Homer's Odysseus killed all those suitors heroically. Yes, a highly enjoyable film with a couple of lovely ballad and brilliant images that pleasing to both the eye and the mind. But I am not sure what does that black man who sold his soul to the evil stands for."

","I can't think of a more enjoyable film I've seen in the last 10 years or so. It's a feel good movie that does just that. Others have said it's a film that can be watched over and over. That's very true. For those that just don't get it, or harp on about the Homers Odyssey tie in, I really think you've gone to see the film without an open mind. I never read a thing about the movie before I saw it except it was a Coen Bros film. That's all I needed to know. Millers Crossing, Raising Arizona, Barton Fink, Fargo..etc etc. Have any other filmmakers turned out so many classics in such a short space of time ? O Brother is another Coen classic. 10 out of 10."
"damian16","9","1","2","18 June 2004"," short one
","It's another terrific Coen movie. It might be classified as a drama, yet in my opinion it's both drama and comedy. The story is situated in EEUU in the 1920's, however, it is based on Homer's 'Odyssey'. Three escaped convicts looking for an inexistent huge sum of money, go through hilarious adventures and meet very strange real and non-real people as bankrobber George 'Babyface' Nelson, sirens, a fast talking one eye bible seller and a lot of the KKK members. It's got excellent characters and beautiful landscapes. Clooney and Turturro have very good performances. The soundtrack is one of the best i've ever know.<br/><br/>Worth seeing"
"alexduffy2000","Null","1","2","4 May 2004"," O Brother, How Silly
","""O Brother, Where Art Thou"" is just the Coen Brothers riding the success of ""Fargo"", and I think the ride has to stop.  Though this movie isn't as bad as the truly awful ""Hudsucker Proxy"", it has the same queasy elements, worst of all being the Coen brothers penchant for trying to recreate the cinematic style of the 1930s, as they did in Hudsucker Proxy.<br/><br/>I did enjoy the three characters played by Clooney, Turturro, and Nelson, and really enjoyed watching them perform as the ""Soggy Bottom Boys"" (I hope have that right, it's from memory).  The movie would have been much better if it had been about the group and a musical tour of the South they do, instead of the whole lame ""Odyssey"" thing.  The musical moments were definitely the best parts."

""Man of Constant Sorrow"" is one particular song that sticks in your head. Other than the great music, there are many funny scenes and all the characters are very likable. <br/><br/>O Brother is loosely based on Homer's Oddysey, but I thought they didn't need that to tie in with the story. 3 convicts on the run from the law is good enough. That would be my only complaint about it. Some people are always complaining how unrealistic George Clooney's perfectly straight and white teeth are. But really....who cares?<br/><br/>All in all, this is one damn entertaining movie.

Cool Hand Luke, and the title I can't remember with Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier. What it does have (that they don't) is a sense of humour. It has no equal, it is one of the best films I have seen in years. George Clooney shows a talent I have never seen before, as do his two co-stars.

If you are the type of person that gets stuck on the story without recognizing the subtle nuances presented visually, symbolically, and verbally then don't bother.  You will miss the point entirely.

There surely is some strange parts of the movie, which only makes it less boring to watch. There's also a lot of musical parts of this movie, and even if I don't usually listen that kind of music, it somehow made me feel like buying a sound track.

"roykommers","10","1","2","20 June 2002"," Feels like a walk through a fairytale-forest
","I'm a big fan of the Coen brothers and I think this is one of there best films. Well at least it is the one that is the most fun watching. If you compare the different Coen brother films you'll see that every film has its own style and use of colours and no two films are the same. Because of this every Coen brothers' movie is a surprise and this one certainly is.<br/><br/>The story is about three prisoners who escape and go on a quest to find the treasure one of them as hidden before he ended up in prison. From the moment they escape the most strange and amazing events start to happen. At least that is how the viewer and the three main characters experience everything. In reality nothing strange happens, but the Coen brothers succeeded in making every little thing that happens seem very mysterious. For example: three women who are washing their clothes in the river, sounds like nothing mysterious, but the Coen brother make you believe the three women are sirens. The movie is full with little things like this, which makes it some kind of eerie, thrilling, fairytale, in which everything seems and is possible.<br/><br/>The events occurring are not solely eerie end thrilling, as told previously, but are also good for a lot of smiles. Yes, smiles not laughs it is not a comedy, but it is a feel good movie and a good one. If the film ends you will have a big smile on your face, which will not disappear for quite some time. The movie feels like a walk through a fairytale-forest and that feeling will stay with you for some days.<br/><br/>Like in the Coen brothers' movie Fargo the most important colour was white, this movie also has one most used colour, this time it is brown and yellow. In every shot these colours are present and dominant. Also there is a lot of use of filters. Those two things together give the movie the dreamy, mysterious appearance. Because of this the movie is full of beautiful shots and even that alone makes it worthwhile to see the movie.<br/><br/>
To conclude: if you want to see a movie which is fun to watch, gives you a happy feeling, has a good and unpredictable story, gets you thinking, has great actors and sublime directing, than this is the movie you want to see."

The DVD commentary provides insight about color processes and other enhancements to create this visually ravishing film.

","Overall, I thought this was an excellent film.  It contains very artistic filmwork mixed with a unique plot and storyline.  This movie making technique usually makes for a successful outcome with the public. The only thing I thought could have been better in the movie was George Clooney's character.  You see, he was supposedly a traveler born and raised in Mississippi, but his acting was not very convincing.  Sure, he had the southern lingo very well, but what about the accent?  His two friends in the movie, Pete and Delmar, were a couple of countrified hicks, and their acting was very convincing.  Then there was George Clooney's character.  He made it seem like he was a yankee hanging out with a couple of rednecks.  And that is not what this movie was about. However, I thoroughly enjoyed the well-assembled cast, such as John Goodman, Holly Hunter, and Charles Durning (who was my favorite character, supplying most of the comic relief in the film)  It is obvious that a lot of planning was put into the production of ""O Brother, Where Art Thou"", and I give this movie a 9 out of 10!"
"oldbollweevil","10","1","2","3 July 2001"," I'm right here.
","First off, if you haven't seen the old movie Sullivan's Travels, try to<br/><br/>scare up a copy before watching this.  There's a real connection,<br/><br/>and being aware of it just makes your appreciation of this movie<br/><br/>that much deeper.<br/><br/>This should have gotten the Oscar for Best Picture last year.  And<br/><br/>after giving it to this film, they should have stopped giving it for<br/><br/>about ten years.  It's that good.<br/><br/>I love everything the Coen brothers have done, but this film<br/><br/>transcends.  It's the best film I've seen in years.  It just may be the<br/><br/>Great American Novel.  High school English teachers say Huck<br/><br/>Finn is, but it was too early:  America hadn't happened yet.  High<br/><br/>school English teachers say Huck Finn was based on the<br/><br/>Odyssey just like this film is.<br/><br/>It's very easy for me to wax mystical about this film.  It's a mystical<br/><br/>film.  By setting it in a mythical version of Mississippi--a land that<br/><br/>exists in its purest form in old country blues and protobluegrass<br/><br/>songs--the Coens have tapped into the motherlode, the jugular<br/><br/>vein of American myth.  This is the real America--the absurdity, the<br/><br/>cruelty, the violence, the beauty, the deceit, the Dapper Dan.  This<br/><br/>is the best America--the America that gave birth to Robert Johnson<br/><br/>and the Carter family.  <br/><br/>Critics used to say that the Coen brothers were technically brilliant<br/><br/>and emotionally cold filmmakers.  I never understood that and I get<br/><br/>it even less now:  this movie has more heart, more passion and<br/><br/>love and spirit, than just about anything else I can think of. <br/><br/>
Perfect performances (George Clooney gives us the ride of his<br/><br/>life), breathtakingly beautiful cinematography, and the best<br/><br/>soundtrack maybe ever.  <br/><br/>Mark Twain would be proud.  <br/><br/>10/10"

These are two incredible filmmakers, the best! However, this film was a dud! Very blah and cookie cutter, just not your standard Coen greatness. Maybe I am being too hard, but I don't think so. In most Coen films, the greatness comes from the assortment of crazy characters, that is what is sadly missing here. John Goodman and John Turturro are both wasted! George Clooney is good, but not enough to carry the film. A lot of old Coen favorites make cameos, but they look to be tacked on and not much else. I am sure that these legendary filmmakers will get it back, but this one was sadly lacking."

","This is the worst film that the Coen Bros have ever made. I was looking forward to this film for quite a while but was severely disappointed. I generally like the Coen's very much, but this has missed the mark. While it still contains some of their signature eccentricity I feel that this was created to please the masses. It seemed to cater to a different audience. The cinematography certainly had its moments (the Klan scene), and I laughed once or twice, but overall I could not wait for it to end. To be kind, the characters were drab; more often they were just obnoxious, unfunny and sometimes completely unbelievable. Most of the time I get annoyed when people say a movie ""had no plot;"" however, that is true of this film. It meandered through the old south (a good idea, I admit - it could have been great) and pretty much got nowhere. Quite uninteresting altogether... On a scale of 1-5 (1 being poor) I would probably give this a 2 and hope to not hear much about it again in the future."
"Coventry","8","1","2","27 January 2004"," The terrific odyssey of the Soggy Bottom Boys
","SPOILERS! The Coen brothers have done it again! In a time where cinematic art and inspiration never ceases to reach new lows, they manage to deliver extremely funny and original film adventures. With their amazing sense of subtle humor and their unique talent of storytelling, the bros present us yet another triumph in a complete series of highlights.  Not one film of the Coens fails to satisfy the audience and that makes them the greatest directors alive at the moment. O Brother Where Art Thou deserves most of its praising thanks to the sublime structure and the terrific atmosphere. The story takes plays in the depressing 30's and the rural way of living in this decade is transferred to the screen terrifically. A convicted prisoner escapes but he has to drag along two other (not so bright) prisoners because they're chained together. The makes them believe there is a buried treasure waiting for them if they stick together. They do find many adventures on their way indeedO Brother is filled with eccentric and hilarious personalities and each of them has a bunch of bizarre characteristics. Our three meet a lunatic bank robber who's merely looking for fame instead of fortune, a well mouthed Bible salesman who doesn't seem to be so religious after all, a threesome of wicked but lovely sirens, a guitar player who sold his soul to the devil and  top of the bill  they have to face an entire group of the Ku-Klux-Klan! The often melodramatic and depressing subjects are presented with an overload of humor and sarcasm, which makes the whole film very unique and typically Coen Brothers. The three heroes' even record their own hit and grow to be famous without even knowing it!! George Clooney gives away his best performance ever as Ulysess Everett McGillhis charismatic charm and sublime vocabulary fits this movie so well. John Turturro is a regular cast for the Coen brother and no doubt that he does his best work under them. Very good side roles for John Goodman and Holly Hunter (also frequently cast by the Coens) as well. In short, few movies come with such high recommendation as O Brother Where Art Thou. If you appreciate good cinema, you'll love this film. Just like all the Brother's movies by the way."
"celeborn-2","10","1","2","15 January 2001"," Sublime genius. An abstract masterpiece of adaptation.
","In ""O Brother,"" the Coens have really outdone themselves! This adaptation of Homer's Odessey to 1930's Mississippi is an out-right panic attack of sublime comedic genius. Students of literature would do well to consider this running commentary on the ancient epic as a poignant analysis of what makes Ulysses tick. Clooney is perfect as the self-obsessed Ulysses, who is destined for greatness in spite of himself. Goodman is a hilariously menacing twist on Polyphemus.

Comedy is very subjective. Here, I understood the slapstick and the screwballness of it all, but it wasn't my cup of brown, brown tea. I did not laugh once, but I admired the actor's balls for following the Coens wherever they wanted to lead. Including Clooney.<br/><br/>Though he only started the movie on a different track from his normal performances, unfortunately, about half-way through, if you can get past the dirt on his face, you'll see the Clooney you've always seen. In addition, neither John Turturro (or Goodman) or the Coens change either. It was business as usual for them. They even had to throw in some classic Coens: Animal Cruelty.<br/><br/>Three prisoners escape a real chain gang in the Depression Era – no not the late 2000's – and they're on a mission for gold. Along the way they meet goofball characters, do goofball things and sing aokay, good song.<br/><br/>Sure, there's search for them there Goldor an ulterior motive. That's not that much of a spoiler – anyone who knows what this is based on should see where this is headed.<br/><br/>And with that: They say this movie's based on Homer's Odyssey. I doubt the original text/poem, for which I have, in fact read, was meant to be this ridiculed. Heck, where was that Jim Carrey to step in and start singing? To watch this, you'll have to like the Blues. You'll have to like George Clooney. Wackiness. Barely a character to root for. And the color brown.<br/><br/>Sorry, I just can't get over that brownish, tanish tint over 98% of the movie. Nor could I get over this incredibly array of wacky characters, so out of left field, it's distracting.<br/><br/>Again, I get what they were trying to say and covey, but it just wasn't my bag. So, since I know it has a select audience, and you might be part of that – if you agree with what I wrote about what the film's about, I can't completely down-rate the movie to 1 star. At least I am able to acknowledge it does, in fact, have a following. More power to those who like it, I'm just not part of that group."

After many months of convincing from friends that it was a great movie, I picked it up. <br/><br/>
What a waste of time.  The preview completely captures the essence of the movie.  It is a boring script that is made worse by pitiful acting performances, especially by George Clooney in the lead role.  Remember Keanu Reeves in Dracula?  That's the level of quality we're talking about here. Clooney could stay in his pseudo southern accent for no more than 2 or 3 seconds before he relapsed back to Batman or that guy on ER or any of the other terrible performances he has given in the past.  It was just pitiful to watch.  <br/><br/>To me, the Coens have always made movies that make you laugh because of the intelligent humor in them.  In O Brother, they apparently went for slapstick and failed miserably.  If I wanted slapstick, I would watch Chris Farley and see it done much better.  I hope this film is not a sign of things to come."

"brentsoffcenter","8","1","3","20 August 2007"," Authentic southern culture of the depression era
","One of the many reasons that this film and story was so successful, is that it offers a true depiction and glimpse of part of depression era life in the deep south. It also offers a taste of that culture, social mannerism and behavior that is very interesting. As opposed to sliding by with approximating the southern personality, the director was able to pinpoint and authenticate the southern character and mannerism almost perfectly. It shows that everyone in the production either did their research, or came from that region of the country originally.<br/><br/>Homer's Oddessey was well adapted to the time and place depicted here. Just the right amount of pathos, irony, comedy, hard luck, and hard times give the principle characters something to really work with. And all of them have accomplished this in excellent fashion. John Turturro, particularly, has accomplished the quintessential down on his luck southern boy so well that he is almost the standard prototype of all time.<br/><br/>In addition to showing a historically accurate picture of southern rural life in the 30's, the film also deals briefly with the then condition of the Ku Klux Clan and its psychotic cultural behavior. We see, in this adaption, that the average African American was not hated and hunted down by all white men, but only by a small percentage of fanatical tribesman. It also suggests in a more masked way, that the Clan's behavior was highly influenced by a gangster mentality. Many of the participants in this behavior would not behave that way on their own, but only when masked, and in a large group. Sort of like sheep. For the most part, people of all colors were willing to get along at that time. But like today, race relations still had a ways to go.<br/><br/>Another treat was the depiction of the prison chain gang. Although not shown quite as hopeless and harsh as in Cool Hand Luke, Oh Brother does touch on the helplessness an inmate must feel, albeit done with a humorous slant. In this film, inmates are observed getting along well with each other, accepting their state of affairs, and working away without too much worry, frustration and fatigue. In real life, the chain gang was brutal, to the point where many of the inmates were on the verge of collapse almost everyday.<br/><br/>Finally, since this observation is mostly about the depression era south, it was very enjoyable to experience the progress of the music of the region and the period, when the bluegrass style was in its infancy. The ""Soggy Bottom Boys"" were great, as was the audience they played for. This was simply another feature of this film that was done precisely as it was when the story takes place.<br/><br/>For anyone who has not read the Oddyssey, or has not been in the deep south, or just wishes to enjoy a story well researched and well presented, then this is the story for him. It is an enjoyable film from start to finish, with flair and creativity to spare."

","The Coens use their two sources wisely, if not well.  Like 'Sullivan's Travels', the narrative is not a 'realistic' straightforward story, despite the attention to period detail, but a Frankenstein's monster made up from different bits of movies of the time, the musical, the gangster movie, the chain-gang movie, the socially conscious movie, like a Frankenstein's monster.  <br/><br/>Similarly, the allusions to Ulysses are overturned - Penelope is not faithful, Ulysses is beaten up by the Cyclops.  It depends on how you take all this - the Coens suggest not too seriously.  This is probably just as well, because the implications of the fascist basis of American popular culture and democracy are kind of alarming.

","Any film director who decides to try to use material of Homer, Ovid or another classic immediately deserves congratulations for the courage. Even if his effort wasn't positive he tried. I say that because I read Homer and I know how heavy this author can be. Its a kind of literature extremely difficult to adapt. The Coen Brother's went a step further: they took Homer to the cinema in a way that hardly resembles Homer. They put old Greek story into a new context, giving it a different shape. All done with the usual touch of sarcastic elegance that is the signature of these directors.<br/><br/>The plot's main idea is simple but takes time to show itself: Everett Ulysses McGill is a convict who decides to flee his labor camp and try to prevent his fiancé from marrying another man. He takes two other prisoners who were fortunately chained together with him. Some moments of the film are very funny and the irony is always there. Sometimes we wonder where are the logic but the film quickly explains most of the illogical moments (except, perhaps, the hundreds of pomade cans that appear throughout the film, which I honestly don't quite understand). In contrary to some critics, I don't think reading ""Odyssey"" is important to understand this movie, although it helps us to notice some nebulous scenes. The work of the actors is well done but no actor overlaps George Clooney, almost unrecognizable, with an intense southern accent. Well, maybe Tim Blake Nelson is as good as Clooney, thanks to the naive way he played Delmar. Finally, a word of appreciation for the costumes and scenarios, absolutely faithful to the period in which everything happens, as well as the enveloping and animated soundtrack, that gives life to the story."

Fortunately, ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" successfully updates the story and makes it accessible, enjoyable, and an absolute delight.<br/><br/>George Clooney is Odysseus (actually, that's Ulysses Everett McGill), trying to get back to his wife Penny (Holly Hunter), who's told their children he got run over by a train. Instead of war, he's been working on a chain gang, and instead of some kind of vengeful force, he now has to elude a sinister Sheriff (and a cyclops bible salesman, played to perfection by John Goodman). I can't begin to spill all the hilarity that happens within this one dreadfully short movie. There's some doozies, believe you me! All in all, this film would still be underrated if it were considered the greatest movie of all time. It's definitely on my Top 10.<br/><br/>""You shall see a cow on the roof of a cotton house!"""

Yep. You read that right. And to crown it all, Ulysses always needs some Dapper Dan pomade for his hair.

","""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" is a disjointed comedy film that takes place in the American South of the early 20th century. Brothers Joel and Ethan Coen wrote, produced and directed the movie, intending it as a modern version of Homer's ""Odyssey."" The film mixes serious social problems of time and place, with humor and somewhat with a nod to lesser crimes. In an interview, Joel said it was a Three Stooges film. <br/><br/>The acting is good, with George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Nelson in the lead roles as Everett, Pete and Delmar, respectively. John Goodman has a smooth-talking violent part as Big Dan Teague. Charles Durning gives one of the best performances as the governor of Mississippi, Pappy O'Daniel. The movie pokes fun at the type of politics of the time, and at the Ku Klux Klan and at good ole Southern religion. <br/><br/>The songs and singing are some of the best part of the humor. Some viewers may be put off by the considerable amount of profanity. I noted one thing curious about this movie. It was entered in the Cannes Film Festival in May of 2000, and then released in France on August 30 of that year. It was released all over Europe and elsewhere through 2000, but didn't make it to screens in the U.S. until February 2, 2001. <br/><br/>This isn't a movie to rush out and buy.

"Screen_Blitz","8","0","1","21 November 2016"," Depression-era comedy sees the Coen brothers in return in one of their most delightful forms
","Since their entrance into the cinematic realm in 1984 when they brought birth to the thriller 'Blood Simple', Joel and Ethan Coen have proved capable of handling just about every genre they have put in front of them. This feat is often accomplished by their ability to bend genres with their sardonic humor, aberrant characters, and narrative twists; all of which is greatly demonstrated in this comedy starring George Clooney, Tim Blake Nelson, and John Turturro as a trio of hillbillies on a cross-state adventure through the Depression-era Mississippi. Sporting up some unconventional characters, fancy period-appropriate dialogue, and a taste of one of the most lively musical numbers ever brought; this film is just another surprise orchestrated by the Coens, but its a pretty good one to say the least. Set in 1930s, this follows three hillbilly convicts: Everett (played by George Clooney), Pete (played by John Turturro), and Delmar (played by Tim Blake Nelson) who escape from captivity in prison and wander off through the old roads of Mississippi in search of a treasure Everett secretly buried. In the process, they encounter a slew of unexpected figures including Tommy Johnson (played by Chris Thomas King) who sold his soul to the devil to generate his talent as a blue musician, Big Dan (played by John Goodman), a ruthless leader of the Ku Klux Clan, and the law enforcement who sets out to hunt them down.<br/><br/>The Coen brothers flourish a handful of surprises for a movie with a title resembling a bible verse (though its confirmed that the title actually derives from a line in a 1941 film 'Sullivan's Travels'). The film is funny, eccentric, and surprisingly heart-filling. The minute our three main characters make their escape, we are introduced to some appropriately quirky characters with eccentric southern dialogue and pop culture references that suites the 1930s period quite well. From there on, the story progresses on these men on some of their most colorful moments including a lively musical number that offers nothing short of charm and fun to listen to. One particular involves a trio encountering three scantily clad women at a pond which leads to shockingly funny end results. Yes, the film does leave a little wiggle room for slightly darker moments which are greatly encountered towards the final act; but the Coen brothers do a genuine job of not escaping their ironically humorous roots. Furthermore, they offer just enough to surprises to make up for a few slogged scenes that don't work well as intended. Regardless, these fine directors know how to keep things moving.<br/><br/>When it comes to setting a movie in the Depression-era, it is highly appropriate (though not essential) to go to great lengths to give the film the vintage look and feel of the 1930s. That is where frequent collaborator of the Coens' filmography Roger Deakins and editor Tricia Cooke arrives into the picture. Deakins blesses this beauty with astounding cinematography that is nicely painted with a deep sepia-tone to the film a look of an adventure set in the old Mississippian times. With the use of low saturation and old folk music popular during the Great Depression years, the film effectively fosters an old timely feel of one of America's most unhappy decades. It works pretty conventional, but that's not all. The Coen brothers' have an extremely nifty talent in writing dialogue, and most of it shines through the strong, if a bit eccentric performances by leads George Clooney, John Turturro, and Tim Blake Nelson; all of whom adopt a thick southern accent that feels authentic, though slightly contrived every now and then. This trio of fine actors make the best of their idiosyncratic characters with their charm and darkly funny persona, and the best part is they do not their opportunities to be bring out some good laughs for granted.<br/><br/>O Brother Where Art Thou is a splendid comedic piece that sees Coen brothers in one of their freshest, if not classic forms. It is a delightful film filled with just about everything a moviegoer can expect from filmmakers like the Coens, and even it is doesn't go down as a classic, who can deny the immense memorability this film generates."

","O Brother Where Art Thou? Is a comedy satire based on the historical writing of Homer's Odyssey.

The three main characters are trying to break free from the Mississippi State Prison. The ring leader is Everett and he convinces the other two to break free in hopes to find a buried treasure that they must get to in four days before it is washed away. The movie provides plenty of different adventures for the trio all the while they are being chased by Sheriff Cooley and they must stay one step ahead of the law while still maintaining their moral. The characters hope the blind mans prophecy will come true!<br/><br/>This movie offers a new and exciting way to view and interpret. The film offer a wide variety of angle shots and uses panning often to show the events that played out earlier to show how and why the characters end up in the predicaments that they do. Music and transitions are used in comparison to guide the audience thorough rough and rowdy scenes, to naturally flowing scenes. This is done in such a way that the audience doesn't even know, giving more attention to be paid on the film itself. During the trios adventure they are constantly being followed by Sheriff Cooley. When such scenes are present in the film, the transition and editing is tenser and the music reflects. Also in happier times in the film, the trio performs as the Soggy Bottom Boys with much popularity.The music reflect this as well. The lighting and color are used in such a way in the film to represent the sepia tone feeling that was popular during that time period. <br/><br/>This movie is very fun and exciting to watch. It offers a modern day twist on the odyssey and the Coen Brothers keep you guessing at what will happen next. I recommend this movie to anyone! It offers a great storyline for young and old alike!"

","O Brother, Where Art Thou is a visually impressive film, with a great soundtrack, amusing characters, a few passing references to Homers epic Odyssey and a slightly above average plot.<br/><br/>In a lot of ways the Coen Brothers have taken all the elements which make a blockbuster, added in a few extra ingredients of their own, stirred it all together and come out with what is an enjoyable little story. Many people cite the films references to the Odyssey as an important part of the story, I don't however see this. That's not to say there aren't any, what I am trying to say is that the film is more reliant on it's own unique and interesting characteristics, as opposed to those of a 4000 year old text.<br/><br/>The colour in which the film is shot, is possibly one of the most important elements in generating the character of the picture. I think that shooting the picture, without the colour correction which was used in O Brother, would of detracted from the feel of the film. The dusty look, sums up the character of the Southern states. It also gives something of a dirty and lower class feel, which is perhaps important when we consider the backgrounds of the three lead characters.<br/><br/>The music of the film is another important element. Which is again one of the things the film would not be able to be as enjoyed nearly as much without. The music adds to the rustic feel that the colouring of the film does. It also helps push through the spirit of the era in which the film is set. A particularly strong example of this is the Baptism scene. Christianity is obviously an important part of life in Ameirca, and the Gospel bands that have appeared in that area have spread throughout the world. This scene is particularly entertaining, and the music enhances the effect. If they had chosen any other type of Christian Hymn the scene would weaken considerably.<br/><br/>However I am critical of the lead Actor, George Clooney. He dominates the film, in a larger then life manner. But, I don't think this is a good thing. From the opening moments, Clooney grabs the film by the throat and doesn't let it go. There is rarely a point where he is not centre of attention, and he always seems to position himself so that he is the dominate figure in a scene. Even in cases where he shouldn't be. The scene in the Barn is particularly irksome, with Clooney hogging the camera. I was amazed to learn that he earned a Golden Globe for this performance, because I really think that this is George Clooney at his screen hogging worst.<br/><br/>I won't however fault what is an otherwise entertaining film on the basis of one actor. It is overly an interesting and enjoyable film. It is not something which I would ever own, or even something I would go out of my way to watch. But nonetheless I think it has a unique appeal and is certainly something worth having seen at least once."
"johnnyboyz","5","0","1","15 November 2009"," O Coen Brothers, Where Art the real Thou?
","The Coen Brother's 2000 film 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' is too much of too many slightly to reasonably good ideas patched up and sprayed all over the screen at once. The film will cover so much ground in terms of the flicking between genres; grounded content; off-the-wall content and tacked on character development that it just all fuses together and comes away somewhat of a mess. With hindsight, we can all say that films like O Brother, Where Art Thou? represent one of two different sorts of films the Coen's have in them; some of their best pieces of work are restrained, looming, ominous and quite grim. However, they have this tendency to throw these sorts ingredients out the window from time to time, and just come up with 'stuff' (and I do mean 'stuff', in inverted commas) that's wacky; carefree; loud; trying too hard to be funny and just generally obnoxious.<br/><br/>O Brother, Where Art Thou? is one of those films; a film that'll shoot all over the place with absolutely no shame whatsoever, encompassing musical numbers; bank heists; a general sense of chase as they run from authorities as well as an electoral campaign running on a separate equilibrium. Between the film beginning and ending, some pretty far reaching material will have unfolded within a pretty small proximity of area. The unfortunate thing is that we're never given a chance to take any of it in and we're never given much of a chance to pause and reflect. The film is in so much of a hurry to shift onto the next 'funny' or 'quirky' encounter with the next misfit that none of film's character's encounter hold any sort of dramatic weight, and thus, do not add up to anything. A little of O Brother, Where Art Thou?'s approach goes a long way.<br/><br/>On paper, the film should've worked a lot better than it did: a Coen Brothers film about three escaped convicts in 1930s deep south America running from the law in the hope to un-earth some self proclaimed 'treasure' hidden out there somewhere, only one prisoner of whom knows its whereabouts. The additional catch is that they only have a few days to find it because where it's buried will be flooded shortly. Yes, Yes, Yes - hand me that premise in the hands of these two guys and I'd lap it up anytime, any-day. But somewhat annoyingly, what we get is a hodge-podge of a piece, a stumbling and fumbling picture attempting to create comedy out of a young man's simplistic mindset; a film that uncomfortably straddles the line between realism and escapism with its all-too coincidental chance encounters and general outrageous content blended in with its sharp attention to the three guys throughout as they need to change clothes, find food, garner money, discover places they can safely rest and be able to maintain a consistent speed of travel in whatever capacity.<br/><br/>The three men out and on the run are Tim Blake Nelson's Delmer; John Turturro's Pete and another individual named Everett (Clooney), whose authoritarian presence dwarfs the other two somewhat by being the one claiming to know where the loot from a raided armoured van is hidden. Their road-movie inspired journey is introduced somewhat obviously, and somewhat crudely, by a camera shot which begins on ground level by a railway track before shamelessly craning upwards to encompass a the rest of the single railway track going off into the distance, thus informing us of the singular line voyage these leads will go on. This occurs mere seconds after some kind of prophetic blind man lays out the long and spiritual journey the characters are to go on from here. It's all very self-aware, all-very post-modern and all very silly.<br/><br/>But what of the journey? For a film to adopt that singular line strand narrative arc, what happens certainly unfolds in the crudest and elementary of fashions. I don't think there's much sense that these characters have progressed an awful lot from the point their journey begins to the point the film rounds everything off. The Coen's play a couple of wild-cards to create the illusion that the characters do so, one of which occurs very early on when a local Christian congregation are baptising people in a river and two of the stow-away prisoners take up the chance to supposedly rid themselves of sin. But this is a stark and jarring occurrence that takes the character from one extreme item to another; the film's in a rush, and rather than allow these guys to bond and figure things out for themselves in terms of who they are and what they ought to be doing in life, one scene very early on prematurely thrusts certain leads from criminal/ex-prisoner to apparently reformed citizen.<br/><br/>A lot of the quest can unfold in any order it likes; there's no flow or consistency to any of these guy's mis-adventures. An encounter with some sirens; a coming across a one-eyed conman; interactions with a bank robber; some altercations with the police â€“ it's all loud, garbled nonsense and can unfold in any order you want it to while I found some of these wacky and outrageous encounters further pull me away from the focus of the leads and their supposed goal of finding the loot. Twinned with this is a somewhat disturbing overtone of gun-play, or gunfire made funny. Early on, a shotgun wielding kid will provoke a would-be humorous encounter with the criminals trying to get back on their feet; bank-robber Nelson's (Badalucco) eccentric attitude as he fires off Tommy Gun rounds I'm sure spawns a few laughs amongst others, while the exploding ammunition in the police truck probably does the same thing. But by the time a certain rug has been pulled from underneath us linked to the premise, and we've had a series of country and western warblings; I think we're just about ready for ""O Brother"" to end."

Much of the story involves music, in fact at one point they even make a record to earn a few buck then unknown to them it becomes a hit.<br/><br/>The story telling is superb as is the acting. While at times it feels more like a collection of incidents rather than a single story that is no bad thing as each incident that happens along the way is interesting and usually amusing.<br/><br/>If you want to watch something a little bit different which contains little to offend and much to amuse then this could be the film for you."

","O brother where art thou is a funny, exciting, at times emotional and all out comedy adventure of three escaped convicts in search of treasure, whilst being pursued by lawmen. It is tightly based on Homers The Odyssey and takes place in the deep south during the 1930's. George Clooney plays Everett, a man of big ideas but no real sense. John Turtorro plays Pete and Tim Black Nelson plays Delmar.<br/><br/>Why i say this is an instant classic is the adventure comedy aspect. Both pay of tremendously well all throughout the film. I cant think of any other bunch of talented actors who could up-hold the funniness like Clooney, Turtorro and Nelson could.<br/><br/>All in all a timeless and epic achievement that one could be happy enough to watch over and over."
"metjess1218","Null","0","1","1 January 2008"," Novel Vs. Movie
","What is it about our society today that we are so obsessed with the media? The media influences our lives so much that people say movies are part of the reason for teen violence. It seems that every time a good book is made we, as a society, have to turn it into a movie. This is no exception with the novel The Odyssey. In some of the best possible ways, the Coen Brothers included the most significant events of that novel, in their movie O Brother Where Art Thou? For example, the first major parallel that existed between the book and the movie was the singing village ladies. In the epic, the Sirens were a major obstacle to Odysseus and his crew. Their singing voices drove them crazy, made the men fall in love with the women, and drove them off course. Similarly, the singing women in the movie pull the three men off course. The men fell in love with the appearances, as well as the voices of these pretty ladies, and consequently let their guard down to the police. Once these singing women caused the men to be less aware of their surroundings, the police where able to capture Pete and hold him hostage. In addition, despite the fact that the Cyclopes is a mythical creature, the Coen Brothers still managed to put this significant event in the movie. It is amazing how they thought of putting a one eyed ""giant"" man in the movie who created obstacles for the boys, just like the Cyclopes monster caused major set backs for Odysseys and his crew. Their uncanny ideas should have captured the minds of any people watching this movie. Lastly, the major predicament of the suitors that Odysseus faced was captured and successfully translated into the movie as well. Just as Odysseus' wife was surrounded by men who wanted to marry her, Penelope was engaged to a new husband at the time when Everett returned home. The writers of the movie even managed to put the words ""he's a suitor"" into the movie which truly indicate that the same problem was evident in both story plots.<br/><br/>Although the Coen Brothers did one of the best possible jobs translating The Odyssey into a modern day film, that novel should never have been translated into one in the first place. The Odyssey is one of the most popular and widely known books in America and in other countries as well. The imagination and creativity that the reader once had is now gone because the magical creatures of The Odyssey were put into a more human and realistic form. The whole purpose of The Odyssey is to tell an imaginary tale of the great hero Odysseys. If Homer wanted his novel to be a real life scenario, he would have done so himself. Furthermore, the novel doesn't completely translate into a modern day movie. Some major events that ""made"" the novel were nonexistent in the movie. For example, the multiple events when the gods punished Odysseus throughout the epic were not present in the movie. In addition, the way his son and friends helped him restore his glory was also not a factor in the film. In fact, in the movie, the main character didn't even have a son; he had about 7 daughters instead. Third, the whole section of the novel about how Odysseys was a war hero and how he fought in Troy was not even made reference to in the movie. As far as the viewer knows, Everett is an ordinary guy and thus he is not an outstanding war hero like Odysseus was in his prime. Lastly, although the makers of the movie did their best to translate the novel into a modern day film, there were just too many things in the novel that could never be placed in the movie. The reality is, if you can't capture the true ideas of the novel that resulted in its fame today; don't turn it into a movie!"
"AlexM2415","6","0","1","1 January 2008"," Connection To The Odyssey
","The Coen Brothers were very successful in translating the epic poem The Odyssey into a modern day movie. While adding many changes, they were still able to keep many important plot points. For example, both had a man who wanted to get home to stop someone from marrying his wife. Also, both had a Cyclops, who somehow was able to hurt the protagonist. The Coen Brothers were able to use these details to portray Odysseus as a escaped convict of the 1930s. As well as using similar pieces of the plot, the Coen Brothers showed small details that were similarities to Homer's epic. For example, Odysseus' wife was named Penelope. Ulysses' wife was named Penny. Even the name Ulysses is similar to Odysseus. When adding these small details to the plot points, you realize that the movie O Brother Where Art Thou is a perfect interpretation of the Greek poem The Odyssey."

","I was extremely hesitant to watch this movie when I learned it centered around a trio of chain-mates, 1 of whom escapes to go in search of treasure - I guessed I'd be torn between hoping they'd succeed in their quest and that they'd get recaptured and sent back to the prison farm. As it turns out, this was my reaction, but the film was actually better than I expected. The sheriff who chased them annoyed me greatly - I hated it every time ""It's the authorities"" was bellowed through the megaphone they carried around. I found Delmar's quotes and misunderstanding with everything that happened to be not only amusing but memorable. I also appreciated Pete's being more moral than Everett, but Everett himself I despised. He jeers both his mates when they choose to become baptized, claiming Pete is being as dull as Delmar (though it's hard to believe he really is a gruff wanted convict when George Clooney's acting fails and his voice reveals an OK man at ease behind the beard). Why Pete - if he was so bad-tempered - didn't snap at him to shut up or else beat him is beyond me. I'm also curious as to how Everett managed to get the heat taken off himself with simplistic sentences the average person could've responded to in a flash. Having stolen from Pete's cousin, Everett reminds him that Wash betrayed them to which Pete (obviously) responds with a reminder that this was before any of them had known this - to which Everett replies ""Only a fool tries to find logic in the human heart."" I loathed him for getting away with that, the slime-ball. The one soft spot he has is for the family he hopes to reunite with. Again, I was torn at whether to applaud his wife for wanting to leave him since he's a greedy, selfish, lying atheist, or hope that he won her back. We later learn that this in fact the reason he broke free, not for a ""treasure"" he made up - to the disgust of Delmar and especially Pete, who wrestles him. Another character I hated was the exceedingly rude Pappy O'Daniel - yeah, his son's a fool, but he treats him like dirt, not to mention everybody else. I could see Stokes had better taste - so I was more than a little surprised to see he belonged to the world's worst racist group, not that I had a better view of O'Daniel, even if he acquitted the Soggy Bottom Boys! I had a lot of trouble with how some things in this movie didn't add up: Delmar is supposed to be a fool, an idiot, yet some of what he says sounds decent, but it sharply contrasts to his imagining Pete has transformed into a toad, and there'll be an available wizard to reverse it. We never learn why Pete and Delmar were imprisoned - with Delmar's lack of brains, what the devil would he do intentionally knowing it led to prison? - so my hoping for their escape ran deeper than for the protagonist who has no morals. When I watched this, I hadn't been told this was a modernized version of The Odesy - but it wasn't hard to believe after seeing sirens. Still, this was the only thing that they seemed to have in common without a stretch. I know John Goodman's character was supposed to represent a cyclopes, but it was considerably stupid how he was a Rochefort-like character who pretty obviously wasn't a Bible salesman...If Everett is so smart, why didn't he pick up on this - and why did he choose to join Teague who was ""selling Bibles"", or curse God's name if he was an atheist?! SPOILERS AHEAD: The climax is terrific, and my view of Everett did a 180 when I saw him praying to survive if only to return to his family, admitting openly his turning away from God. Now my hatred was merely focused on the nemesis sheriff who refused to acknowledge his pardon. However, after the excitement's over and his companions note how his prayer must've been linked to the following event, he is instantly back to his atheist attitude, showing he's fickle and shallow. I hated him once more. (SPOILERS END.) I think this movie was OK, but not great. The score and soundtrack were OK, and the message was good. Maybe if details made more sense and Clooney's acting had been better (if that's possible - I've only seen 1 other film of his, Batman & Robin, & his acting was better here), this would've gotten a higher vote from me. But it's amusing to watch and enjoyable enough."
"donny-31","10","0","1","31 May 2005"," Even with many small flaws, this is one of my favorite comedies.
","In order not to make anybody angry about the small complaints I have, let me say first: I love this film. I have a copy and I have watched it three times.<br/><br/>This movie was shot in several Mississippi towns, and I live in one of them. My wife, Jonnie Wilson Harthcock, was in the movie, but her scenes were cut and re-shot. My darling was the (first) waitress who says ""Yes, Sir"" to George Clooney in the hotel where they first encounter John Goodman's character Big Dan. Jonnie had Alzheimer's. I tried to impress this upon the Casting Director, but she liked Jonnie's looks for that small part. But my poor dear could not remember not to look down at her feet when she hit her ""spot"" by the table. So they had to re-shoot it with somebody else.<br/><br/>John Goodman lied to me, outside. How did he lie to me? He was a nice guy...knew I was Jonnie's husband...he said ""She did great. Really, she did great."" She did not do great, but John Goodman was very nice for no particular reason. Why was he even in this movie, I ask myself...so briefly and inconsequentially...probably has or had a contract with the Coens.<br/><br/>For Mississippians there's a lot of funny stuff that nobody else would get. For instance, all the towns the characters mention are real towns, but very jumbled up. Many scenes were shot in my town of Yazoo City, but they called it Itta Bena, which is an actual small town up in the Delta, but not as scenic as Yazoo. The ""Woolworth's"" that Clooney gets thrown out of is the old Saxon Hardware (now a trendy, artsy furniture re-do place). Did you notice...the guy who throws Clooney out calls it ""Woolsworth."" Of course, there never was a Woolworth's there, but the people who own the building left the signs up until they wore out.<br/><br/>I am a big fan of the Coen Bros. to begin with, so don't think I love this film just because they shot it in my town and my wife was supposed to be in it. It's extremely funny and well-done. The three principals do a great job of lip-syncing some terrific music, and Tim Blake Nelson is beyond hilarious.<br/><br/>Here are my small complaints:<br/><br/>First, Parchman Farm (which is way up in the Delta, nowhere near here) never had chain gangs busting rocks. We don't have any rocks around here, and especially not up at Parchman. And why would they be busting them? And on a dirt road? And why were the prisoners all totally out of rhythm with the music?<br/><br/>Second, where did the guys get gophers to eat? We don't have any gophers...that's a Western rodent. I think the Coens chose gophers because what they boys COULD have caught and eaten - squirrels or rabbits - are too cute and popular for movie fans to see spitted, roasted and eaten in a comedy. ""Let's just say 'gophers'; nobody likes gophers.""<br/><br/>Third, we don't have horned toads in Mississippi; those are Western toads. And the so-called ""toad"" that the fellows thought that Turturro's character was turned into by the siren was not even a toad; it was a frog.<br/><br/>And finally, the film showed a lack of knowledge of Mississippi dancing, music and dialog of that era. Bluegrass is not Mississippi music, for instance; it is Kentucky music. Most of the accents were fictitious ""generic southern,"" not Mississippi at all, and the dancing was just slapstick.<br/><br/>Still, a very entertaining movie. At OpinionSoup.com, we love it!"

","The Coen Brothers are weird.<br/><br/>If you take this as a known going into the movie, it will certainly help you know what to expect. That is, expect the unexpected.<br/><br/>O Brother, Where Art Thou? is a tale about three escaped convicts who are racing against time to get to a treasure. On the way, they encounter all sorts of colourful characters and do all sorts of interesting things. It is loosely based on The Odyssey, but since I've never actually read The Odyssey it would be difficult for me to draw parallels.<br/><br/>Parodies of everyone from Robert Johnson to the Carter Family show up at some point. There are hillbilly rednecks, a political election, a blind prophet, religious fanatics, some hooded KKK members, and a bunch of pyromaniacs with a penchant for killing.<br/><br/>Somehow in this hodgepodge, a plot (and I use the term loosely) gets strung together. However, this movie isn't about the plot, nor is it about the acting, even despite George Clooney's golden globe award. Each time his accent slipped I questioned how well he deserved that one. But none of that was the point. The bottom line is, this movie is very, very funny.<br/><br/>Of course, being able to pick out some of the references helps. I admit that I probably missed most of them, since many were very obscure, but there was still enough humour in there to entertain almost anyone.<br/><br/>Just don't go into the movie expecting something typical, because O Brother, Where Art Thou? is anything but."

","What we have here,is a charming fictional story with a much more wholesome period in American history as it's backdrop.Though I personally was not around in the 1930's,it's clear that the Coen Brothers remained as true to the depression era south as they possibly could.Also worthy of note is the film's soundtrack.The music is beautifully placed in the film,and is such a prominent part of the overall film that it can almost be considered an additional cast member. It contains songs that came from the heart of the songwriters,rather than board rooms filled with greedy record executives.Very enriching. The cast was excellent,with nearly flawless performances across the board.The only trouble with the film in my view is the depiction of cruelty to animals,which I am always against.Setting that aside,I have no doubt that this will be regarded as one the great films of the new century."

","O Brother, Where Art Thou? is a very different kind of film.

All set in the Deep South during the Depression, and all surrounded by some terrific folk music.<br/><br/>I thought this movie was a lot of fun. The plot is goofy, the characters are goofier, the situations are quite ridiculous but that's the point. It's the Coen brothers! Only they could take one of Homer's epic poems, set it in 1930's Alabama and throw in a jug band for good measure!<br/><br/>9 out of 10.

","I wasn't gonna bother commenting until I saw the amount of negative reviews. I feel compelled now to pay my respect to O Brother, Where Art Thou?<br/><br/>Sure, when I first heard that it was going to be The Odyssey retold in 30s Mississippi, I scoffed a little thinking that sounded so contrived. After watching Sullivan's Travels and Lady Eve, I had developed a deep appreciation for Preston Sturges' films; mainly the witty dialogue between people and physical comedy. I though maybe this O Brother .... film was a nod but also a riding-on-the-coattails-of-Hollwood-classics type of inside joke.<br/><br/>Who knows how the idea got started, but the end result is a fantastic movie.<br/><br/>I have to tell you a secret. Lean closer. Ready? (whisper)I never read The Odyssey. I was sick at home with mono that spring, and was exempt from it. But I'm glad in a way because I got to watch O Brother Where Art Thou? without even the slightest twinge of recollection of another story. I took the story as it went, as one should do when trying to get the most out of the film. Like others said. it's not like the similarities are glaringly obvious. For example, (SPOILER!!!) the part with the 'sirens', you can hear sirens vaguely in the background.<br/><br/>Finally, why wouldn't anyone not like a film that enhances their musical education? (The soundtrack to this is one of the best EVER) I already knew Emmylou Harris, but I was introduced to Alison Krauss, Gillian Welsh and Jon Hartford after seeing this.<br/><br/>And the comic timing is understated but perfect. It's not underestimating the intelligence of the audience with cheap humour. The jokes instead are mostly laced in with wordplay and irony. Who else could get away with the KKK dancing and singing the blues? <br/><br/>The Coen Brothers are awesome and this is a classic."

","I highly recommend this movie. This movie may be somewhat overrated by now.<br/><br/>If you didn't like it, you may have been expecting too much by the time you saw it. I think it's best to see a movie before the hype. This happened with the movie ""The Full Monty"". A lot of people saw it after all the media attention and then wondered what all the fuss was about.<br/><br/>I agree with other IMDb comments that Tim Blake Nelson is a standout, though George Clooney does a great job. The soundtrack with its bluegrass flavor is fabulous too. The movie has a fairly simple plot about the trials and tribulations of 3 convicts who escape a chain gang. Although they're minor criminals, they're very likable and you find yourself routing for their freedom and happiness. Some characters could have had bigger parts such as Holly Hunter's role. I liked the symbolism employed in the movie, especially the reference to the ""Wizard of Oz"" in the KK*K scene. The 3 convicts attack 3 clan members and steal their outfits to sneak into to a ceremony and save a friend of theirs just like the lion, tin man, and scarecrow did to 3 guardsmen when they broke into the castle to save Dorthy. <br/><br/>The ending scene is fantastic and not at all expected. Overall, see this film and enjoy the interesting characters."

Along the way, they encounter a blind black rail road man with no name and a prophecy about their future, a back stabbing relative of John's, a crazy gun toting thug by name of George ""Baby Face"" Nelson, three hot ""Sirens"" who get the boys drunk and haul John off to be tortured by the guys who are chasing them in return for George & Tim's whereabouts, a ""Cyclops"" played by John Goodman, and they even become known for a hit country song under the band name ""The Soggy Bottom Boys""! We also find out that George's wife is about to get married to another man and that she told their daughters that George died when he got hit by a train and the guy she's marrying is campaign manager to an ambitious racist politician who's also the member of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK). Then George reveals that there is no gold and there was no armored truck: ""I got sent up for practicing law without a license."" says George. He lied to them about the gold because he needed their help to escape because he wanted to get back to his wife and children and now must thwart the man trying to steal his family away from him. After rescuing their black guitar player Tommy from the KKK, they show up at a campaign show and play their song ""Man of Constant Sorrow"" and accidentally expose the ambitious politician as a Klansman. This earns them the gratitude of the town's current mayor and he pardons them of all previous crimes. Then George takes the boys to his old home because his wife won't patch things up with him until he finds their old wedding rings, but there they are found by the chain gang cops, one of them a man constantly wearing sunglasses, and they overlook what the mayor said about them and try to hang them, but after praying to God for a miracle, George and the gang are saved by the valley being flooded. They even see a cow on top of a farm roof!<br/><br/>Allegedly based on ""The Odyssey"" by Homer.<br/><br/>Personally I don't think the Coen are all that funny; critics are always raving about what masters they are of screwball comedy, but personally I see nothing screwy in their comedy.

To combine many elements of Homer's Odyssey with great music into the rich fabric of the 1930's Depression and wrap it all around such interesting characters is a true leap of imagination. Every character is interesting, not just the 3 leads.  Who else but the Cohen Brothers would have ever thought of it.<br/><br/>Like the movie Groundhog Day, this can be watched over & over, getting better each time as the insights and awareness of subtle shading and deeper meaning sink in.

These will add greatly to the understanding and appreciation of this fine film.

"Hairy_Lime","9","0","1","6 April 2004"," One of the Coen Bros. Best. SPOILERS
","Sometimes, Coen Brothers movies can come off as overly mannered.  Sometimes, that ruins the film; other times, you get O Brother Where Art Thou?  This movie does not exist in any kind of reality; the characters talk, move and think in a way that has no connection with how humans talk, move and think. And yet, this movie works almost completely.<br/><br/>Perhaps it's the strange mixture of mythic and human; perhaps it's the dialouge, perhaps its the way the Coen Brothers focus on absurdities of behavior and make them the key to the characters.  Or perhaps, the movie works because it is the funniest of the Coen Brothers movies.  The whole movie is shot in a sepia wash that makes the movie feel old; perhaps the style of the acting in the movie represents a time when the whole cinematic world was bitoned.  Or perhaps its that old-timey music.<br/><br/>Whatever.  The plot of the movie loosely follows the Odyssey, with a few obvious nods to the Wizard of Oz thrown in - the KKK Klose Order Drill team was outrageous.  Clooney, Turturro and Nelson play three convicts escaping from a prison chain gang - and apparently the devil as well.  Along the way, they meet the cyclops, turn into toads, are seduced by sirens, become old-timey singing stars, are nearly hung, are nearly drowned, and eat roast gopher.  (""Gopher, Everett?"" has become one of my favorite lines in recent movies; the way Nelson says it repeatedly, and the look of that poor gopher on a stick....).  In the end, they find a treasure, even if it is not the treasure they seek.<br/><br/>As I mentioned, the performances are incredibly unnatural and mannered, so it is hard to judge them by regular standards.  Still, Clooney, Turturro and Nelson - especially Nelson - all pull off their characters admirably.  And as always with the Coens, the direction is interesting.  Not as good as Fargo and Blood Simple, but still quite fine."

","After the disaster that was 'Raising Arizona', the Coens worked and worked until they created this.  As opposed to Paul Verhoeven, who hasn't changed his method since RoboCop, the Coens are an interesting pair.  Even in their failures (except 'Intolerable') their work is something to behold.  This isn't a failure.<br/><br/>The music is the undercurrent of the film, not the characters.  I frankly don't care for the particular country style (I could live without it),  but it serves its purpose as supporting the period.  We've certainly changed as a society in the last 70 years, hallelujah.<br/><br/>The Coens have the story structured wonderfully.  I thought a nonlinear timeline would work great for this story until I watched it again and realized that it is a nonlinear Odyssey.  Heck, it's better than the Odyssey!<br/><br/>What I really like is Clooney.  His character is a mix of his 'Three Kings' major with 'Ferris Bueller'.  Instead of obviously winking at the audience, he does it unconsciously.

I also found it evocative and moving as the trio of the hapless wandered through the Bible Belt in the time of the great depression. I really can't say the film had a leading actor, because the three protagonists were equally excellent. I loved the music and I have to say, I bought the CD for the sheer pleasure of hearing Man of Constant Sorrow', and Jail House Now'. The story oscillates from the comic to the ridiculous and on to the moving seamlessly, and how on earth it flopped in the Cinema is a mystery.<br/><br/>I believe this will be a cult movie in years to come and will be a defining moment in the career of George Clooney."

","...""O Brother, Where Art Thou?""'s title is reason enough to like this film. It is amazingly well done, one of the Coen's best, and the whole tone of the film - from the music to the shade of screen - is so dreamlike and creative that its hard not to like it.  It's funny, smart, sad, tense, tragic, dreamy and cool, all in one.<br/><br/>The story focuses on the adventures of three escaped convicts (George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson) on their way to find treasure in depression-era South U.S.A.  On their way they meet loads of colorful characters and even have a run-in with the Klu Klex Klan...and worse.<br/><br/>I have to say, the most remarkable thing about this movie is Clooney's performance.  I didn't think the guy had it in him, but he manages to pull his accented and bumblingly intelligent character well.  This definitely ranks up with ""Ocean's Eleven"" and ""Out of Sight"" for movies showing that yes, George can act.<br/><br/>The Coen's screenplay is also worth mentioning.  Ever since ""Miller's Crossing"" you'd expect a Coen movie to be filled with much smart, witty and entertaining dialogue.  You get what you expect.  'Witty' is an understatement for every word that exits every character's mouth.<br/><br/>For those of you looking for good Coen, I recommend this...and anything else, really, 8.5/10."

I suppose if you like standard sitcom-style comedy, you won't like it.<br/><br/>The beauty of the humour stems from how out of touch everybody is.  For example, George Clooney is a lawyer who escapes from prison, and is obsessed with his hair.

"Whitb1218","Null","0","1","14 November 2003"," Overall I give this movie a good rating..
","I recently watched the movie `Oh Brother Where Art Thou' after my class at school read the book, The Odyssey.  Apparently, the movie is supposed to be based on the book.  While I watched the movie, I was kind-of confused at first on how this movie could possibly relate to the book, but the more I thought about it the storyline was very much the same.<br/><br/>The book is about a man named Odysseus who fought in the Trojan War in Troy, but on his efforts to get home, he encountered many adventures.  He met plenty of new people on every island he landed on and he underwent many trials and hardships.  In the movie, Ulysses Everett McGill was a man that escaped his prison sentence so that he could get home to his family, and also find `the treasure'.  The movie covered the different adventures that him and his two prison mates went through to get to where they were going.<br/><br/>I thought that this movie was good.  It was funny and that is always an important element in a good movie.  The only theme that I really could pick out from this movie was the one about friends.  The three men in this movie stuck together through everything.  I think the filmmaker was trying to tell the audience how important it is to have friends.  We go through things so much easier with friends than we do by ourselves, and I think this movie is a good example of that. My favorite thing about this movie was the way that they got the characters to match the kind of life they were living.  The story takes place down south and I mean these characters looked and behaved just like old country hicks.  The quality of the characters was very well chosen.  Another thing I really liked was the use of the color in this film.  I don't know how they did it but by the way they used that faded coloring, it made the movie so much more realistic.  It was really believable that the movie could've been filmed back during the `old south' due to the usage of color.  I also really enjoyed the music in the movie.  The music was well chosen; it was very southern sounding and it actually matched the character scenes pretty well.<br/><br/>This movie was well made.  The storyline flowed pretty accurately throughout the whole movie and it wasn't hard to follow.  Overall, I give this movie a good rating and I think if you are looking for something to give your day a little dry humor, this would be the movie to watch!"

","I have always liked George Clooney, even though he was never my favorite actor. It seems that lately he's been involved in many `just average' movies.  O Brother, Where Art Thou? definitely breaks this trend.<br/><br/>Clooney presents himself as a clean-cut, smooth-talking escapee from a Southern chain gang. His character, Ulysses Everett McGill, is often getting himself into bad situations, but always managing to be able to get out of the `tight spot.'  This was a very hard role for Clooney to play because it differs so much from his norm.  The movie revolved mainly on McGill, so the success of the film was largely in part to Clooney's exceptional job. O Brother, Where Art Thou? brings with it a specific time and place.  The movie is set in the Deep South - Mississippi during the 1930's.  McGill is a criminal mastermind who was sent to prison for practicing law without a license.  He manages to convince his convince his absent-minded chain gang brothers, Delmar (played by Tim Blake Nelson) and Pete (played by John Turturro), to make a run for it.  For their help with escape McGill will take his brothers to his home to get a hidden treasure that soon will be washed away when a newly built dam will flood the area. I have heard many times that the final destination is not always as important as how you get there.  This is true for O Brother, Where Art Thou? There are many events that occur while the men are on their way to their destination.  The movie somewhat goes along with novel The Odyssey but set during the great depression south.  As the movie goes on, the similarities become more apparent.  In The Odyssey, the main character, Odysseus, is being forced to stay on an island far from his home.  This compares to McGill being in prison.  When Odysseus finally is aloud to leave the island it is the God's who keep him from making a swift journey home, where in O Brother, Where Art Thou? it is the police that inhibit McGill from completing the journey. Music plays an important part in the movie as well.  Music was an extremely important part of the depression-era south and the Coen brothers make this very evident as the movie goes on.  To make some extra money, the three escapee's team up with a black hitchhiker to record a catchy tune in a rural radio station.  As the song is passed over the airwaves it becomes a instant success and the `Soggy Bottom Boys' are a hit.  In the south at this time it was music that helped people to go on living and take their minds off the hard times to get through them.  This is taken to the extreme when the `Soggy Bottom Boys' are pardoned of their crimes for helping return the current Governor of Mississippi get re-elected when the Governor endorses the group. It does not surprise me George Clooney received the Golden Globe for best actor for his performance in O Brother, Where Art Thou?  The movie gave a new look to The Odyssey being set in depression-era Mississippi, but not one that completely stayed true to the book, but did do a nice job.  What really was a hit in O Brother, Where Art Thou? was the music.  It connects the viewer in a different kind of way.  This film was not one of the better films I have watched, but it was entertaining and that's the most important thing."
"mtm46","Null","0","1","13 November 2003"," Comparisons of The Odyssey to O Brother Where Art Thou
","Recently, I read `The Odyssey' translated by Allen Mandelbaum for my AP English class.  After we read the book, we watched `O Brother Where Art Thou.'  When my teacher first mentioned that we were going to watch this movie, I figured that it would be kind of close to what happened in the Odyssey.  When the movie began, I was very surprised at how different it was.  It was set in the 30's and the main characters were prison escapes compared to being set at a time just after the Trojan War and having the main character, Odysseus, a hero. In the movie, there were some similarities to the book but nothing really seemed to come across as a structured similarity.  The similarities seemed to be scattered throughout the movie in no particular order.  To me, the sheriff with the hound dog is the most realistic similarity to me because throughout the whole movie, the three men are trying to escape from him. Just like in The Odyssey, when Odysseus is trying to escape the wrath of Poseidon.  Another similarity that I can see between the book and the movie is the role of `Baby face.'  In the movie, he is a notorious bank robber that picks up the three men just after he had robbed a bank.  He supplies the three men with some of the money that he had stolen and when they go their separate ways, is caught by the police.  This is similar to the help that the Phaeacians gave to Odysseus when he landed on their island.  They gave him many gifts for him to take home and they also gave him escort to his homeland.  But, on their way home, Poseidon punished them for assisting Odysseus' return. One thing that I didn't understand about the movie was the flooding of the river when the three men were about to be hung.  I was thinking that it might be similar to the help that Odysseus received from Athena throughout the book and how if her help wasn't there, Odysseus would've gotten into much more trouble and maybe even had his life taken away.  But, that event could be interpreted in many different ways. Overall, I think the movie was pretty good, but, to me, comparing the movie to `The Odyssey,' makes the movie more confusing and less entertaining.  I read the book before the movie and I spent most of the time during the movie trying to figure out who represents who and what stands for what.  So, I would recommend watching the movie before reading the book just so the movie can be a little more enjoyable."
"sunbabe134","Null","0","1","13 November 2003"," ""Okay"" movie with AMAZING music!
","""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" is a movie based in 1930's Mississippi. It follows three convicts - Ulysses McGill, Pete, and Delmar.  I began watching the movie a few minutes into the beginning, so needless to say, I was a bit confused. That confusion followed me through out the whole movie. I knew that it was loosely based on ""The Odyssey"" but I think that may have gotten me a bit more confused because I was thinking it would be the exact same thing.  I was looking for something that wasn't there. The three actors were absolutely amazing!  It was because of them that I kept interest and even laughed now and then.  These guys were probably my favorite part of the movie.  I especially enjoyed the part where they thought Pete turned into a frog (which was symbolic of Circe and Odysseus' men being turned into pigs.)  It was so funny how they toted him around everywhere thinking that those women turned him into the frog. (Those women were symbolic of Homer's Sirens who tempted the crew with their song.)  My favorite character, because of this, would probably have to be Delmar. Delmar and Pete just brought an extra special feeling to the whole movie.  Their accents made them sound like funny southern boys and that's exactly what I believe the filmmakers were trying to portray.  With the way they acted and with their dialect, they added a little bit more of a comedic performance.  George Clooney also portrayed his character very well.  I especially like the little hair fetish that was added in.  That was not something that you'd expect from a 1930s Mississippi convict, but it was a really cute touch! Besides from those three characters, my next favorite part of the movie was the music!  This too was absolutely AMAZING!  I enjoyed it so much that I actually went to the library and got a copy of the soundtrack.  I loved the sound of it.  I really believe that it added to the movie.  The sound had a southern country vibe going on and it really helped set the whole setting.  The music really enhanced the story that the filmmakers were trying to get across.  It just put me in the setting and got me a little bit more interested. In fact, I enjoyed it so much that I plan on buying that CD pretty soon.  My teacher had mentioned that this movie won an award for its soundtrack and I absolutely believe that they deserved it. I recommend whoever enjoyed the movie to go out and listen to it! Like I mentioned earlier, the film is loosely based on Homer's ""The Odyssey.""  I knew that this was the case before I began watching the movie, so I think that I was comparing the two just a little bit too much.  The fact that I was doing this didn't give me much of a chance to focus on the unique plot of the movie.  There are some things that the two have in common, however.  For example, the three men stop along the trail because they hear a beautiful song.  This was the same situation that Odysseus and his men came across when they met the Sirens. Another similarity is that both the movie and the book had a ""Cyclops."" In the movie, however, the only real reason you could recognize him was because he only had one good eye and Cyclops in the book only had one eye as well.  Of course, George Clooney's character was supposed to represent Odysseus and the whole plot was supposed to resemble that of the book's. Both characters were trying to get home to their wives and families. Other than that, there are not many more similarities.  All in all, though, I would give this movie a seven.  Maybe if I ever see it again, I can pay closer attention to the movie's plot and come to appreciate it a little bit more!"

","O' Brother, Where Art Thou?<br/><br/>O' Brother, where art thou was a movie that paralleled Homer's epic the Odyssey.  Throughout the movie the display of comradery can easily be seen amongst the main characters- a belief shared in the Odyssey as well.<br/><br/>The movie was based around three men who escaped from a prison.  They are the run from the local police and encounter a blind man slowly traveling down the railroad.  They hitch a ride and are enlightened about their futures.  This act can be paralleled to Tiresias' speech, the main prediction to Odyssey about his future.<br/><br/>During the movie the three main characters not only encounter the local police, but also a group of three young singing women.  Throughout their hypnotic melodies, the three escapees fall in a state of total infatuation (surprise) with the singing muses.  The two men wake up later only to find their other partner in crime missing- I will not spoil the movie by saying who took him, but I think it's pretty obvious.  The two remaining men go out and begin to search for their missing amigo.<br/><br/>The singing muses are examples of the sirens that were utilized by Homer in the Odyssey.  The main character, Odysseus, had to survive their incessant songs in order to get home.  Obviously the women in O' Brother, Where Art Thou are completely different from the sirens in the Odyssey, but the fundamental idea remains the same: O' Brother, Where Art Thou walks hand-in-hand with the Odyssey.<br/><br/>Overall, I found the movie to very good.  The plot mimicked the Odyssey's main storyline- with a easy progression throughout the film.  The actors added a great deal of variety as well."

He played the role of Odysseus in this journey of 3 convicts on the run from a Mississippi prison in the 1930's and their journey to find a lost treasure.

They soon run into three seducing, beautiful sirens who turn Pete into a frog, according to Everett.  After bing ambushed by a corrupt Bible's salesman they find out that the sirens have turned in Pete to the police.  After busting him out they find out from Ulysses that there is no treasure.  He apparently wanted to stop his wife from remarrying. Pete and Everett happened to be chained to them.  With a suprise ending, and a run in with the law, the three bad boys end up on top.  Using creative camera angles and tricks, the director was able to bring about on adventerous and exciting film.  The director was also able to achieve this effect using sephia colors and creative music brightening the overall audience view and placing them into an open and adventerous mood.  My favorite part of the movie was when Ulysses, Pete, and Everett crash a KKK gathering to rescue their friend from being lynched.  On a scale of 1 - 10, this was an 8."
"bettisnd","Null","0","1","12 November 2003"," AP English, November 12th, 2003
","In my AP English class we recently watched the movie, O Brother, Where Art Thou?  I was somewhat disappointed with this movie because I had the expectation that it was going to have much more in common with The Odyssey, as the movie, The Thirteenth Warrior, had much in common with the story of Beowulf.  I do see a small resemblance, however, and understand now that it was not meant to be identical.  Some correlations I have made: Ulysses Everett McGill, played by George Clooney, represents Odysseus; Big Tan Teauge, played by John Goodman, represents Cyclops; Penny Wharvey McGill, played by Holly Hunter, represents Penelope. I notice in O Brother, Where Art Thou? as in the Odyssey, the overall main theme is the fact that a man wishes to return to his wife.  In this case, Ulysses is in jail and wants to be sure he gets home to be with his wife and children.  I respect his wish to get home, but question some of his actions. He started out with a lie, using his `friends', just so he would not have to take the journey by himself.  He broke out of jail and even used stolen money.  Ulysses constantly was running from authority and would take on fake appearances.  It seems as if he is under the impression that the end justifies the means.  I feel this is not the case at all, and Ulysses realized this when his friends confronted him about his motifs.  The end never justifies the means.  If you want a positive goal, then you should be willing to make sacrifices to get to this goal.  It is not right to take advantage of people and have no regard for others' feelings when trying to accomplish your goal. Ulysses did have a fine goal however.  He missed his wife and children and wanted to see them and make a life for them.  Unfortunately, even with his goal of providing for his family he took a bad route.  Ulysses did not want to take sacrifices and work hard to provide money for his family.  He chose to take the easy way out and that is how he ended up in jail.  This is another good example of how the end does not justify the means.  Even though Ulysses had a noble goal of taking care of his family, he went about it the wrong way and got himself into trouble with the law.  Hopefully he learned his lesson and was only kidding at the end of the story, when re-united with his wife, he told her that he was getting a fake dentist license to support them from now on."
"BryceEhrhardt","Null","0","1","11 November 2003"," O Brother, Where Art Thou?
","`O Brother, Where Art Thou?' is a movie that is based upon the book The Odyssey of Homer.  Throughout the entire story people and things with significance pop up in the movie that can be related with gods, people, and creatures in the book The Odyssey of Homer.  Examples of these people would be like Ulysses Everett McGill representing Odysseus in the movie.  The sirens were portrayed as the beautiful women singing on the river bank. John Goodman played a man by the name Big Dan Teague that portrayed Cyclops. He wore a white suit and a white patch over one of his eyes.  Ulysses' former wife was portrayed as Penelope, and her soon to be husband Vernon was portrayed as a suitor.  The old man who told Ulysses and his fellow convicts, Pete and Delmar there future that laid ahead of them could be related to the prophet Tiresias in the book The Odyssey of Homer.  Most of the challenges that they faced on the way to finding there treasure could be related to those challenges Odysseus face in The Odyssey of Homer.<br/><br/>`O Brother, Where Art Thou?' is an easy movie to understand for the most part, but I had the most trouble trying to figure out how Big Dan Teague knew that Ulysses, Pete, and Delmar had so much money with them. They never talked about it in public or anything like that, and never had it out on the table where they were eating in the restaurant.  How did he know? The best part of the movie to me would have to be how the movie related to The Odyssey of Homer in so many ways.  The people portrayed similar characteristics and the same events took place in both.  The book was more easier to understand after watching this movie.  Overall, this was a very good movie, but there was one thing that I did not like, and that being that after the flood, and after Ulysses, Pete and Delmar emerge from the water and saw the cow on the roof, the movie jumps to Ulysses and his wife walking there six daughters.  How did they get back together?  What happened to Pete and Delmar, and what did they end up doing with there life?  If you think about it, that is how The Odyssey of Homer also ended, with many unanswered questions.<br/><br/>While watching `O Brother, Where Art Thou?' I found a character that I really liked, and one that I did not like so much.  It is ironic that they would end up together as well.  I grew fond of Ulysses because of his great courage and fearlessness.  He always found a way to get himself, Pete, and Delmar out of `tight spots.'  On the other hand I did not like his wife as much because she lied to her children and told them that there dad had been hit by a train and killed.  Even, when she did see Ulysses again, she told them never to talk to strangers and that Ulysses was not there father.<br/><br/>I found the music in this film to be very interesting, and it fit right into the time period this movie was taking place in.  The music was from the 1920's and the lyrics even fit into the challenges that Ulysses and his two friends had to get through.  At the same time, the color in the film made it truly look like this movie was filmed in to the 1920's.  Combining these two things makes a great movie and that is what happened.  I even learned a few things about life back in the 1920's from this movie!<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to anyone, whether it be just for enjoyment, or if you are trying to find a way to understand The Odyssey of Homer a little bit more clearer.  There is some cursing in it, but nothing too bad. This movie is worth taking a couple of hours out of your day and watching.  I am sure that you will not be disappointed, I was not."

","I read the Odyssey.  I got the references to that book and the historical stuff like Robert Johnson - but you see, I don't laugh at something just because I get it.  The Coens seem to hope people will do just that - laugh at semi-esoteric references just because you recognize them, because you can feel superior to the yokels who aren't as well read, I guess.  But you see without punchlines it just isn't funny.  Many fairly pointless scenes just sort of peter out without so much as a chuckle. Beyond the reference ""comedy"" theres the same tired old jokes about southern hicks and whatnot. Yawn.  It certainly isn't the worst movie I've seen, it shows talent at times and it's purty to look at and all, but at the end of the day - it just ain't funny, charming, or even all that interesting.  But that's just me."
"melaniejbaker2003","10","0","1","4 October 2003"," HOMER MEETS THE WALTONS
","The eighth outing from the Coen Brothers, this film is a delight from the very first frame. The film is set during the Depression, in the Coens' version of the deep south, a south that glows with the gold tones of a sepia tinted photograph and features a supporting cast of weird and wonderful characters. Loosely based on Homer's Odyssey, it features George Clooney as Ulysses Everett McGill, a convict who escapes from a chain gang with 2 dim-witted side kicks, Pete (John Turturro) and Delmar (Tim Nelson Blake), in a bid to stop his ex-wife from remarrying.  Along the way they meet a blind oracle, a young black gee-tar player who has sold his soul to the devil, a manic-depressive bank robber, a trio of seductive sirens, an evil one-eyed Bible salesman, and also manage to influence the race for the governorship of the state of Mississippi, integrate the races in the deep south, and have a hit record as The Soggy Bottom Boys.<br/><br/>Clooney proves to be more than capable of handling himself in the Coen comedy universe, and gets some of the funniest moments of the film as the hair-obsessed Everett (the image of Clooney in a hair-net is one that is not going to go away).  Everett is a feckless petty crook, not nearly as smart as he thinks he is, but in the kingdom of the witless, the half-witted man is king.  Pete and Delmar are truly witless (dumber than a bag of hammers), and much of the film's comedy comes from their prat-falling and face pulling,  but just as much comes from the wonderful dialogue, which in places is so sharp it could cut itself.<br/><br/>Pappy O'Daniel: `Thank God your mammy died givin' birth. If she'd a seen ya she'd a died of shame!'<br/><br/>Everett: `Well ain't this place a geographical oddity, two weeks from everywhere!'<br/><br/>Tommy: `I had to be at that there crossroads last midnight, to sell my soul to the devil.' Everett: `Well ain't it a small world, spiritually speakin'?  Pete and Delmar just been baptised and saved. I guess I'm the only one that remains unaffiliated.' Delmar: `Oh son. And for that you traded your ever-lasting soul?' Tommy: `Well I wasn't usin' it.'<br/><br/>Throw in the wonderful gospel and blue-grass soundtrack, the tendency of many of the major characters to burst into song, the slightly over-the-top (in a good way) acting, and the dreamy, slightly out of reality quality of the southern setting, and the film starts to have the feel of an old-fashioned feel-good musical.  This culminates in a rally of the Klu Klux Klan, which is choreographed like an MGM musical, with marching blocks of knights of the KKK performing an elaborate dance and forming the shape of the cross.  Like the dance dream sequence at the bowling alley in The Big Lebowski, this is totally unexpected, but completely at one with the universe they have created.  The plot of the movie is rambling and episodic, much like the work on which it is based, with characters drifting in and out of the narrative, and no big emotional pay-off at the end - but that doesn't matter. What matters is the journey, and it's a journey well worth taking. Where else would you get to see a cow on the roof of a cotton shack, or a police van that shoots itself up from the inside out. Unmissable."

""What's the Rumpus?"" was a common question in Miller's Crossing along with other quick witted period dialog.<br/><br/>In ""Fargo"" it was that Minnesota slang ""Eh?""<br/><br/>In O' Brother Where Art Thou, a story based on Homer's Odessey, the look of the film was also a character right along with the dialog and speech patterns.<br/><br/>Every square inch of the movie was digitally enhanced (a first in the industry) to give the countryside a dried out dusty look.<br/><br/>
It was also damned funny in a very tongue in cheek way.  This is what I love about the fun films they make.  They poke fun but in a decidedly nice way. And if you get the joke it's a private shared joke.  And ""inside"" joke as it were.<br/><br/>The characters were a riot.  Ulysses Everett McGill the manically talkative con-man. Pete the dark and forbidding language mangler and Delmar O'Donnell the sweet clueless bumpkin.<br/><br/>Perhaps this wasn't the best Coen brothers movie ever.

"khatcher-2","6","0","1","25 September 2003"," Attractive and entertaining
","Though the story is not all that special - we have seen numerous stories of convicts on the run - this film is ultimately attractive for a number of different reasons. The interpretations displayed by the three run-aways is always acceptable or better, the photography is excellent, and a few songs from country' and negro spirituals add fine-tasting ingredients to the proceedings. Together with some handsome cars from the 1930's, the whole is an entertaining result - as long as you are not looking for anything too deep, philosophical or otherwise intellectual. Thus religious references - including the Ku Klux Klan - should not be taken seriously. Indeed, that is part of the point the Coen brothers - Jewish in origin - wanted to make: being neutral or non-believer often allows you to open your eyes to other points of view and not be critical of those who profess other religions. Which is perhaps the best religion of all .............<br/><br/>I cannot think of any other film at this moment in which George Clooney as Ulysses communicated to me better than in this film ......... or even John Turturro, come to think of it. The three escaped convicts played really likeable characters, which overode any shallowness the story-line might have had. Whether the original Odyssey by Homer really has much to do with this film is up to you: obviously it is with no disrespect nor by fortuitous accident, that the rotund politician went by the name of Homer, as well as the evident connection with the use of Ulysses. However, all that Mississippi countryside was filmed lovingly, with exquisite care playing with the sunlight.<br/><br/>I certainly found this film more attractively entertaining than the other famous film by the Coen brothers, `The big Lebowsky', and is worth the high side of 6½ on my scale."

","if you had been educated by as good a teacher as we have, you'd understand that these creative films that you rudely put in inverted commas, are the work of individuals who, despite the pressures of the industry, are able to express and share their own visions with the world. As a film student, i (and my good class mates) felt the need to try and open your narrow mind. Now you may not be able to appreciate this, or even why anyone would want to, but it is a great ability to analyse a film and make interpretations and connections as it enables us to expand our knowledge and enjoy films on a more intellectual level. This also allows us to view film as an art form, perhaps one of the most influential aspects of life, bringing alive our sensibilities, making us more human. The coen brothers may not appeal to you, and yes, their so called 'wierdness' may put you off, but surrealism is also a key feature of the Coen brothers films, (try Barton Fink).<br/><br/>The Coen brothers deserve your upmost respect for being brave enough to share their vision with the world, knowing perfectly well that there'd be narrow-minded people out there ready to criticise at every avaialable point. I urge you to reconsider to open your mind to these 'creative' films, and allow these films to transport you to alternative worlds where perhaps you may find a little 'wierdness'. Nicola agrees."

Arcana include:  A high shot of the car with the three leads passing a crossroad where a man is hitchhiking.  They stop and pick up ""Tommy Johnson"", who claims to have met the devil.  This is clearly Robert Johnson the great blues singer whom legend claims went to the crossroad and made a deal with the devil.  The governor trying to get elected by singing is historically Governor Jimmy Davis who wrote ""You Are My Sunshine.""  In the Odyssey,Odysseus' men were turned into swine.  This is much to much of a special effect for the Coen Brothers, so they had the sirens seemingly turned one of the crew into a frog.  The scene in the movie where the convicts are taken into a theater is clearly an homage to Preston Sturges' ""Sullivan's Travels"" where the convicts are shown a cartoon and the only bright spot in their dreary lives is the laughter that comes from the Mickey Mouse cartoon.  Odysseus blinds the Cyclops with a flaming stick and in the movie the One-eyed KKK monster is killed with a flaming stake to the eye.  ALl in all, rich and enjoyable.

If they had, this could have been a really smart movie.<br/><br/>As it is, it vaguely refers to parts of The Odyssey, without much<br/><br/>thought being put.  The few scenes that are inspired by The<br/><br/>Odyssey are clustered together and late in appearing. I got the<br/><br/>Sirens' part, but why mix that with Circe?  Why does the KKK<br/><br/>meeting represent Hades (Hades in not hell and is not limited to<br/><br/>'bad' people)?  What the heck is Cyclops doing there anyway?<br/><br/>These elements are too randomly included for the movie to ""be<br/><br/>based"" on The Odyssey.<br/><br/>One huge difference between O Brother and The Odyssey is the<br/><br/>character of Odysseus -he wasn't a thief, he was a king!  He<br/><br/>traveled 10 years to reach his home and lost all his men on the<br/><br/>way.  His outer beauty reflected his nobility and wit.  In a word, he<br/><br/>was perfect.  Although Clooney's character is a smartass, he's not<br/><br/>exactly smart.  Penelope is of course the other great character in<br/><br/>The Odyssey, where she patiently waits for Odysseus's return,<br/><br/>who , upon his return, kills all the suitors who abused the<br/><br/>hospitality they were offered.  O Brother also forgets Telemachus,<br/><br/>their son. If this movie intended to transpose scenes from The Odyssey onto<br/><br/>the rural American South, it could have done so in many different<br/><br/>ways, but I guess reading Homer should have been the first step.<br/><br/>Magic could have been out of it then.<br/><br/>I failed to find this movie 'hilarious' but I did find the photography<br/><br/>beautiful, as well as the incorporation of music.  I am not very<br/><br/>familiar with the Coen's films -I only saw Fargo and that was 2<br/><br/>weeks ago- but they seems stuck on idiocy, and I have a hard time<br/><br/>appreciating that.  Another thing they seem to do is open with a<br/><br/>general appeal. In O Brother the opening lines of The Odyssey<br/><br/>appear, and in Fargo we are told that the following story is true<br/><br/>(which isn't because there's a disclaimer with the end credits).  I'm<br/><br/>not sure what the point of these openings is since they're both<br/><br/>deceptive. Overall, this movie could have been full of genius with smart<br/><br/>humor and wonderful references, but I guess it falls short of<br/><br/>achieving that.  The end result is a little weak -or not as good as it<br/><br/>ought to be."

It's crazy, and it works most of the time. It's an odyssey inspired by Homer, though it isn't exactly ""based"" on it; from what I described up above it's really a jumping off point, as if the brothers took what they remembered from the story after reading it in school, and then put on their own ideas for the characters based on who could best play them. The film takes place in 1930's Mississippi where 3 convicts (Tim Blake Nelson, John Tuturro and in a Clark Gable-like face, George Clooney) escape to go look for a hidden treasure, but, like in the original Homer odyssey, there are their sidetracks (sirens) and villains (John Goodman does a good job as this villain).

","O Brother, Where Art Thou? 6.5/10<br/><br/>I didn't laugh out loud once. The Coen brothers should've went back to the drawing board on this one. Or, perhaps, they should have actually READ Homer's Odyssey rather than Cliff Notes, or not relied on it at all. The whole acknowledgement to Homer is just insulting. <br/><br/>The characters were simply too weird even for a Coen brothers film. How many blind men were there? Three or four? While I admit that Clooney had the best dialogue, he was simply too handsome--or out of place--for this film. I wanted to laugh whenever he went into one of those pseudo-intellectual riffs, but I couldn't. Something was wrong about them. (The film tried to explain it away later--Everett went up for practicing law w/o a license--but I wasn't convinced. That was just way too convenient storywise.)<br/><br/>
The only genuine thing I saw in all of O Brother was the Klan scene. When it came, I couldn't believe it. I was right at the edge of thunderous laughter, but after 2/3rds of squat, just I couldn't do it. I did, however, rewind the scene. It's probably the only thing I'll remember about the film. I'm not counting the backward trio's engaging song ""I'm a Man in Sorrow"", though. While I certainly liked it, it was an obvious plot device at its introduction. <br/><br/>Everything felt haphazard, truncated, predictable. I just couldn't get into it, which is unusual, because I'm a Coen Brother's fan. So, I don't think it was me. They (the Coen Brothers) were simply off the mark this time. Go see Blood Simple or Fargo instead. <br/><br/>6.5/10"

","First off, I went into the movie a little skeptical, yet hopeful that I would be pleasantly surprised.  Unfortunately, the best I can say for it is that it had a few clever scenes.<br/><br/>But for the most part, I found it to be predictable, slowly paced and the writing was... well, smug is the only word that seems to fit.

","This is a funny film, not hilarious, as some of these comments may lead you to believe, but funny and well written, if just a bit disjointed in parts.<br/><br/>The evocative Super 35 cinematography is outstanding, with the colors bleached to an almost moss-and-white spectrum that makes everything look humid, hot and smelly.<br/><br/>Clooney, as usual, is a very limited actor, all looks and one expression.

","The gangs of rock-cracking prisoners in the opening scene, all singing a dirge in harmony was a great way to start and promised some startling entertainment to follow.   But no! This contrived comedy with music just went down-hill after that.  Oh dear! just tell me when to laugh. The Ku Klux Klan scene was quite striking though it did not go anywhere, the ""sirens"" in their wet clinging garments were nicely seductive, the idea of carrying around a friend (turned into a toad) in a little box was intriguing and a furious escape from a barn all ablaze was exciting enough, but.... May be it was the melodramatic delivery of the lines and the strain of trying to understand the assumed southern accents that got at me.  No sir, this was a wasted evening for me and one of the worst films of the year. My advice, brother, is...forget it!"

The cinematography was beautiful, the story just funny enough, and I sang the songs in my head for days afterward.  It was a real injustice that this film was not nominated as best film among the Oscar set and just shows how little they really know.

","The music should co-star w/George Clooney in this wonderful movie about Depression-era escaped cons, traipsing thru rural Mississippi. The screenplay is an adaptation of Homer's The Odyssey, as cited in the opening credits. Very strong performances by Charles Durning, John Goodman, John Turturro. Holly Hunter was a big disappointment, however. She appeared, almost as an after thought.<br/><br/>The photography was beautiful, evocative of hot, humid summers in the South.

This was no exception in the light that they tell a good story but too many cameos and not enought intelligence sink this movie.  The Brothers never were ones to put the brightest people in there movies, Barton Fink aside.  But at least with movies like Rasing Arizona and Fargo the MUCH UNDERRATED Big Lebowski they didnt question the viewers intelligence.  This movie went from bad to worse and its a shame because it didnt have to.  There was 3 ideas that were used over and over and over again untill the movie was over.  Not much fun for the viewer.

The story (loosely based on Homer's epic poem ODYSSEY) is very entertaining.  The music was outstanding.<br/><br/>I only had two complaints.  First, the Coen brothers tried to hard to make this picture ""cute"" or ""off-the-wall.""  By setting the adventure story in the depression-era south the way they did, they did not have to expend all that effort and energy.  The nature of the idea alone could have carried it off by itself.<br/><br/>Second, George Clooney's acting was terrible.  He portrayed his role as a charicature as opposed to a character.

","Oof! This terrible movie, which I regret having wasted any time on, is built around racist stereotyping of the lowest sort, except the characters are white Southerners, so I guess that makes it okay.  According to ""O Brother Where Art Thou"", everyone in 1930's Mississippi was either a dancing Klansmen, a  dumb cracker, or a generic black victim (who gets virtually no lines in the film). <br/><br/>I think the low point (and there were many in this horrible movie) had to be putting Ralph Stanley's sublime masterpiece ""O Death"" into the mouth of the Klan Grand Dragon as the prelude to a lynching. For old-time music lovers, this is roughly the equivalent of what a Catholic would feel watching a porn actor belt out ""Ave Maria"" right before a big sex scene.<br/><br/>George Clooney proves once again that he can't act, John Turturro reminds everyone how well he can, Charles Durning gets a few laughs, and Gillian Welch, Emmylou Harris, and the rest of the singers get a paycheck at the expense of their immortal artistic souls.<br/><br/>How could the Coen Brothers, makers of some of the best movies of the last 20 years, be responsible for this travesty?"

","""O Brother"" is a meandering comedy set in 1930's Mississippi which tells of the misadventures of three chain-gang escapees. A highly original and creative piece of work, the film amuses, taunts, and teases as it delivers a cleverly crafted script, some unique characters, and simple fun with little fanfare. As with other Coen flicks, the hype is after the premier and comes from the audience...the best kind. Good fun most likely to be appreciated or understood by mature folks...people who remember pomade, spittoons, sparkling oil, and phosphates. Did that car really hit the cow?"
"CharltonBoy","3","0","3","13 April 2001"," Another bore from the Coen Brothers.
","I have cime to the conclusion that when it comes to films from the Coen brothers there is conspiracy going on. First it was Fargo,then The Big Lebowski and now this. Each of these films were given rave reviews for being classic comedies, the question is WHY????????????? Fargo was dull and if it wasnt for Willam H Macy would have been unwatchable. The Big Lebowski was as funny as piles and now this film takes the biscuit! O Brother Where Art Thou? is as unfunny as it is boring. Nothing of any significance happens to make the viewer laugh. Nothing happens to make this film interesting in ANY way. Goerge Clooney does his best but the poor script makes it impossible for him to come out of this with any merit. Who ever decided that this rubbish should be rewarded with a Golden Globe had fall for what most critics have...The Coen Con!

","A real let-down after the magnificent Fargo - one of my all-time favourites - and the highly entertaining The Big Lebowski. For me, Clooney's performance is nondescript and the movie desperately lacks someone in the lead role with screen charisma. The film plants ideas early on that take an eternity to come to fruition - such as the musical talents of the Soggy bottom boys - and consequently lacks pace. Other characters are underdeveloped and sloppily introduced. A big shame."

Fortunately, Barton Fink and The Big Lebowski had the same effect on me, so I thought the movie over for about a week and then I saw it again.  The fact is, this movie is such a flood of sights and sounds and has so much to think about and at which to laugh, there is simply no way to grasp it in one viewing.  <br/><br/>See it once, give yourself a few days to let it sink in, then see it a second time.

"ferguson-6","8","0","1","5 February 2001"," O Plot, Where Art Thou?
","Greetings again from the darkness.  Another quirky experience from the Coen's, who have provided some of my favorite moviegoing moments.  ""Blood Simple"" and ""Fargo"" are classics, and ""The Hudsucker Proxy"" ""Miller's Crossing"" and ""Barton Fink"" are right behind.  I was never a fan of ""Raising Arizona"", but this similar film has some really great touches.  No one casts more brilliantly than the Coens.  Not a fan of George Clooney, but he is outstanding in his role.  Many Coen regulars make their appearances (Holly Hunter, John Goodman, John Turturro) but I loved Tim Blake Nelson as Delmar. My favorite bits include the spoofs on legendary guitarist Robert(called Tommy in the film) Johnson selling his soul to the devil at the crossroads, and infamous bank robber George Nelson's (wonderfully played by Son of Sam actor Michael Badalucco) reaction to being called ""Baby Face"". As a film lover, I trust the Coens to push the envelope every time out.  Weak story in this one, but truly enjoyable nonetheless.  The funniest part is that after seeing this film, people are buying the soundtrack!  T Bone Burnett does a remarkable job of making one want to purchase a hillbilly CD."
"mercury-26","10","0","1","17 January 2001"," a musical journey
","""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" is unmistakably a Coen brothers film. I first noticed the common denominator between all their films when I was watching ""Fargo"" for the first time: These guys' films feel like they're made up as they go along, even if they're not. Fortunately, the results are always good (aside from the disappointing ""Big Lebowski"").<br/><br/>I suspect they employed their usual 'anything goes' strategy to ""O Brother"". This time though, whatever story there is seems to take a back seat to what the boys really hoped to accomplish with this film. In the liner notes to the film's soundtrack, the Coens describe the film as a sort of valentine to the music of the pre-Great Depression era. ""There are very few scenes in the movie that don't have an in-screen musical element to them,"" says Joel. Thinking back on the film, indeed, a scene not driven by music or built around music is hard to find. While the boys manage to piece together a quality story by merrying up folklore with the bonafide history of the South, it's all about incorporating the music, somehow, some way. ""O Brother"" is about as close as there is to a musical that isn't a musical.<br/><br/>To quote the liner notes again, ""Before a single frame of film was shot, these musicians and others created the 'canvas' upon which the colorful saga of O Brother Where ArtThou? would be painted"". So first they had their theme, namely, spirituality. The condition of the soul. Sin, punishment, and forgiveness. The Coens must have felt that as long as they abided by this theme, the story would take care of itself. Any story about the old South could be about the thick mist of good and evil spirits that inhabit it. It's the American home of both God and Beelzebub, of more angels and demons than any other region. One of the film's best sequences features escaped convicts Delmar and Pete (Tim Blake Nelson and John Turturro) wading into a river to be baptised and cleansed of all sins. In the very next scene the convicts (Nelson, Turturro, George Clooney) pick up a hitchhiker (aptly named Tommy Johnson, played by Chris Thomas King) at a crossroads, who tells them he's just sold his soul to the devil so he can play the guitar and make lots of money. The four of them then proceed to the next recording studio and cut a hit record together. Fantasic!<br/><br/>""O Brother"" is a playful, flaccid romp through the backwoods of Mississippi. I couldn't help but imagine how much fun these guys were having making this thing and the attitude is contageous. It's the year's funniest film. Ethan's too smart for his own good sometimes though, and a lot of it flies right over your head. The humor takes you by surprise but doesn't shock you.<br/><br/>""O Brother Where Art Thou"" won't be looked back upon as a Coen brothers masterpiece. It's no ""Fargo"" or ""Miller's Crossing"".<br/><br/>Grade: A-"

","I've always liked the Coen brothers' films, with my favorites being Raising Arizona and Fargo. This one is stylistically good and filmed very well, with some fun over-the-top performances from George Clooney et al., but for some reason it didn't resonate with me on any emotional level. I found it ultimately fairly forgettable. In short, it's my least favorite of their films. I probably won't see it again.
