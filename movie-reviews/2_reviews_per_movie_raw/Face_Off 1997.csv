","This is an epic action movie with everything and more: plane explosions, a jail break, boat chases, the latest scientific advances, and of course, the white doves flying off before a gun fight. It also has the premise of putting on someone else's face, which is an insane plot twist, which somehow turns out amazing. Also, if you don't already appreciate the gem to American cinema that Nicholas Cage is, prepare to be blown away."

","John Woo knows, if anybody, how to make good, stylish action. And that's exactly what this film is; good, cool, stylish action. The plot is great; fairly psychological and quite interesting. It has a fast(and remarkably even) pace, I don't think more than 30 minutes passes at any point in the movie without a giant action scene. All in all, I'd guess there are about four or five major shootouts, and two chase scenes which are each several minutes long(without getting repetitive, fortunately). The acting is excellent; every single major part is well-played. John Travolta, Nicolas Cage, Joan Allen, Alessandro Nivola, Gina Gershon, Dominique Swain... all give great, entirely believable performances. The best are definitely Travolta and Cage, though; fantastic, truly stellar performances. The characters are all well-written and credible, right down to the most minor one. The action is cool and very stylish, in every single action-scene. The theme of the film is great; of course, the story is completely unlikely, with the face-switching and all, but once you get past that, once you suspend disbelief, you'll most likely enjoy the film thoroughly. The script is excellent, plenty of action, drama, and thriller parts. Also, you gotta love the sharp contrast 3/4's into the movie, with the kid listening to sugary pop-music, while people are shooting intensely at each other. Great film. I recommend it to any fan of John Woo, Nicholas Cage, John Travolta and action films. 8/10"

","I consider John Woo to be one of the greatest action movie directors in the world,and ""Face/Off"" proves just that.However,the element that makes this film one of the most intense and spectacular action movies to ever come from Hollywood is the presence of two tremendously talented actors,both of whom are my favorites.Yes,when you have John Travolta and Nicholas Cage together in a movie ,the results are bound to be over the top. John Travolta plays Sean Archer,a dedicated FBI agent who survived a murder attempt by notorious criminal Castor Troy six years ago. However,tragically his son died instead of him and since than Archer is relentlessly chasing Troy.Nicholas Cage plays Troy,and the film begins with a spectacular chase where we see the sheer intensity generated by both these great actors,and you realize that this is not going to be just another action flick. Troy escapes,but his younger brother Pollux Troy(played by Alessandro Nivola) falls into Archer's hands,along with a floppy that contains the blueprint for a bomb to be detonated in downtown L.A. Pollux refuses to reveal the location of the bomb and then a desperate Archer is given an option that is so spine-chilling that Archer refuses immediately.Realizing soon that he has no other choice,he decides to do what he is asked to-to exchange his face for Troy's, and what's more,to alter his entire physical attributes,so that he can go to the prison where his brother is being kept,and fool him into believing that he is Troy and get the location of the bomb from him.The plan seems to work until the moment Castor realizes what has happened,puts on Archer's face,and sets out for revenge.He fools the FBI,fools Archer's wife and sleeps with her and just when one thinks that this is too much,the real Archer escapes prison and it's payback time. Both Travolta and Cage play their roles perfectly,and they do a fantastic job playing each other too. The rest of the cast simply fades away in comparison,and who cares ? Dominique Swain as Archer's rebellious daughter looks good on screen-but that's about it.Joan Allen as his wife is not too impressive either.Gina Gershon as Troy's lover seems much more real in comparison.John Woo provides the film with a novel and flawless script,and some of the best action sequences ever filmed.This film is an absolute must for any action fan,and definitely the best Woo ever made."

","""Face/Off"" is an excellent movie that will never get out of your head, it's that memorable. I saw this movie probably 6 or 7 years ago and I still think about it and finally bought it the other day.<br/><br/>The performances, this is it, folks. We have two of the finest and very popular actors: John Travolta and Nicholas Cage. These two are amazing, to transfer back and forth. John had to go from this kind, loving, and very sensitive man to a looney, cold-blooded, heartless maniac. Nicholas went from being the scary and perverted psycho to a helpless and struggling man trapped in this killer's body. My kudos to Nicholas, that was a tough performance to capture. I felt his pain, no one would believe that he was Sean Archer, who would after all? His body has been kidnapped from Castor Troy who is now playing around with his job, his daughter, and his wife. I felt so scarred for him, because I cannot imagine in a million years what that must feel like, the isolation, the abuse, and the feeling of utter helplessness. In my opinion, these are one of the best performances in 1997. The supporting cast of: Joan Allen, Gina Gershon, and Alessandro Nivola add so much, you get into the film entirely.<br/><br/>This is a very scary movie. This is identity theft gone terribly wrong and beyond any borders. I loved this movie and any other film fanatic will definitely enjoy it as well. It has great action, drama, romance, and dark comedy that bring together a terrific film.<br/><br/>10/10"

","From director John Woo comes this exhilarating action movie that takes a deadly cat-and-mouse game to the next level!

The daring plan quickly goes awry when he loses his own identity in the process, and discovers his arch-enemy is cohabiting with his family. Film's enjoyment depends on the viewer: you'll either condemn the story as absurd and far-fetched, or you'll buy into it and go along for this supercharged, over-the-top action extravaganza. Travolta and Cage are both extraordinarily good, and with Woo at the helm you know that you'd better hang on for dear life! Occasionally silly, with a plot that tosses credibility out the window, but still a helluva lot of fun. ***"
"Angry_Arguer","9","73","107","10 July 2003"," Corny. Crazy. Cool.
","Face/Off is amazing because it mixes an outrageously cornball plot with some of the best acting in an action movie.  How John Woo pulled it off is beyond me.  His visual imagery is flamboyant and decorative, yet never fails to deliver the goods.  There is always a flurry of images to grasp our attention.  Granted, his typical trademarks are here, but never does the script suffer from the same problems as in his other works.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage and John Travolta are phenomenal in their dual roles each.  The rest of the cast isn't very deep and is more filler than anything else.  The editing job feels underdone, particularly when the action sequences get to the ""overcooked"" staged.  Still, how many speedboat chases or airplane crashes are you going to see in a slow-motion?<br/><br/>Overall, a summer action movie that delivers in acting, directing, and most other departments.  4 out of 5 stars."
"Libretio","8","91","141","26 January 2000"," Woo's US breakthrough: A triumph!
","FACE/OFF <br/><br/>Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)<br/><br/>Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS<br/><br/>This magnificent thriller represents director John Woo's triumphant return to the kind of hyperkinetic, emotionally charged film-making which made him such a hot property in the first place. Following the artistic bankruptcy of his first two Hollywood projects, this one is a marriage of high-octane movie-making and mind-twisting narrative complexities. It's also one of the few American action movies which manages to strike a balance between crowd-pleasing set-pieces and domestic interludes, and renders them equally important. John Travolta and Nicolas Cage are perfectly matched as hero/villain (and vice versa!), whilst heavyweight theatre actress Joan Allen provides the narrative with much of its dramatic backbone in the role of Travolta's wife (the scene in which she is first confronted with her husband in Cage's body is almost identical to a similar scene in Terence Fisher's FRANKENSTEIN MUST BE DESTROYED [1969]). <br/><br/>Technically, the film is a blast, and Woo stages the action highlights with a visual grace and dexterity that is often breathtaking to behold. The climactic speedboat battle is probably the finest set-piece of Woo's career to date, and the script is overflowing with visual and thematic ironies that underscore the action highlights. In fact, the production has arguably more dramatic resonance than any other Hollywood blockbuster of the 1990s, but the dictates of American commercialism mean that Woo is only able to skate over the emotional surface of his characters and their moral dilemmas. The two main protagonists are much too cold and heartless to fully engage the audience's sympathies, and there's nothing here that matches the scorching human drama of, say, BULLET IN THE HEAD (1990). But for all that, FACE/OFF dares to go deeper than your average Hollywood action picture. It's clever, witty and thrilling, and it manages to accomplish the difficult task of feeding the brain whilst entertaining the eye."

","""Face/Off"" is a somewhat complicated action thriller which involves an obsessed FBI agent (John Travolta) who decides to become a comatose criminal (Nicolas Cage) by literally trading faces with him.  The purpose in doing this is to learn where a bomb is by going undercover in a maximum-security prison and getting the information from Cage's brother.  When Cage's character comes out of his coma, he decides to take Travolta's face.  Still with me?  In short Travolta's FBI agent is now Cage's crazed criminal and vise versa.  What follows is a wild and crazy thrill ride that is a bit hard to keep straight, but ultimately fun to watch and quite satisfying.  Overall a really good film.  4.5 out of 5 stars."
"rab40","3","105","173","21 September 2006"," Way too over the top
","The first time I saw this movie I thought to myself ""hey, this is pretty exciting."" After the first fight scene it quickly dawned on me, however that the action in this movie is all the same and none of it makes any sense (like every John Woo movie). First of all, lets examine the movie's main premise. Taking a face from one person and grafting it on another will not make them look exactly like them: there's their entire facial structure underneath to consider. The movie tries to briefly explain this and their two very different body types but it's very sketchy. Also, apparently medical science has progressed past scarring and major surgery patients can drive themselves home from the hospital the very same day.<br/><br/>Then there's the action. There are like three scenes where bad-John Travolta is in a 20 x 20 room with good-Nicholas Cage and both fail to shoot the other even with automatic weapons, yet John can kill 4 cops while simultaneously driving a high-speed boat. I understand that the good guy has to make it to the end, but the shootouts are so poorly coordinated that it's hard to believe a cross-eyed kid in a wheelchair could have fired as much as our two stars and failed to hit someone, especially when the squibs go off directly behind the person being shot at. The end seals the ridiculous deal: after missing with about 1000 gun shots, good-Cage finally finishes off his foe with the second of 2 harpoon guns that happened to be on a private leisure boat(why?), but only after John exerts about 500lbs of force with his hand on the gun's springs and staves off death for another few seconds. In conclusion, this movie is a bunch of cliché action that is too ludicrous to be entertaining. Don't waste your time with this or any other John Woo movie unless you enjoy seeing people not get shot and plenty of doves flying."
"dee.reid","10","17","24","11 September 2007"," ""Face/Off"" - Identity crisis?
","A movie about a hockey match, this isn't.<br/><br/>1997's ""Face/Off,"" the third (and to this date, most successful) American feature from Hong Kong action director John Woo, is everything a fan of Woo's Asian work could possibly hope for. It's a loud, fast-paced, and spectacularly violent epic helmed by a master craftsman. And even with this ambitious third American feature, it is vastly on par with the director's Hong Kong work and is very easily one of the best films of his career.<br/><br/>Woo made a name for himself back in Asia as the director of hyper-stylized, hard-hitting pot-boiler action films like ""The Killer"" (1989) and ""Hard Boiled"" (1992), where he made an art form of dual-pistol-wielding gun-play and action shoot-'em-up. You want action? John Woo is your man to go to. He made his first American feature with Jean-Claude Van Damme in ""Hard Target"" (1993) and followed it up with ""Broken Arrow"" in 1996. Now we're at ""Face/Off.""<br/><br/>""Face/Off"" stars a daring and intrepid Los Angeles F.B.I. agent named Sean Archer (John Travolta), who for the last six years has been on the trail of psycho freelance terrorist Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage) after he killed Archer's young son. So when Archer finally captures Troy (who's put into a coma as a result) within the film's opening 20 minutes, Archer thinks it's the last of his arch-nemesis.<br/><br/>But of course it's not over, not by a long shot. The screenplay by writers Mike Webb and Michael Colleary throws us a curve-ball in the form of something write out of a sci-fi medical novel: to save L.A. from biological annihilation, Archer must become his enemy and learn the location of said biological payload. Archer trades physical identities with Troy bu undergoing a radical surgical procedure to get Troy's sociopath younger brother Pollux (Alessandro Nivola) to give up the goods.<br/><br/>However, Troy comes out of his coma and assumes Archer's identity as an F.B.I. man, a job he comes to love and abuses with joyful glee, and even gets cozy with Archer's neglected wife Eve (Joan Allen) and daughter Jamie (Dominique Swain). His first move is to destroy all the evidence that proves each man's true identity and seemingly leaves no way to reverse the procedures when he kills everyone involved in the mission (how sick and twisted is he, anyway?). His next plan is to systematically eliminate his old allies to afford protection for himself and his brother. In the meantime, Archer (as Castor) is left to rot in a federal prison that the Geneva Convention doesn't know exists and has to find a way to get out to defeat his nemesis once and for all, even if it means actually ""becoming"" him, and using Troy's old buddies to his advantage. You want to talk about identity crisis?<br/><br/>10 years after its release, this movie is still as balletic and energetic, action-packed and exciting as it was all those years ago. John Travolta and Nicolas Cage were perfectly cast as the perfect hero and perfect villain in what was one of the hottest action movies of that year. The only problem is, though, both actors enjoy switching their roles and playing off each other in a vicious blood feud, although it seems that Travolta was having the most fun here, leaving Cage a little hard-pressed to remain on the sidelines as the hero. Hot off their success in movies such as ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994) and ""Leaving Las Vegas"" (1995), Travolta revels in Cage's bad guy performance (even if Cage is Cage and Travolta is Travolta - for only about 20 minutes each). Coldly sadistic and over-the-edge/brave and determined, you can tell who likes things best.<br/><br/>The film's action scenes, which there are plenty of, is where ""Face/Off"" chiefly excels at. Woo brings much of the gusto and gun-play loved by so many in his native land to a place that's foreign. Perhaps this is why his two earlier efforts may have been failures here in the U.S. (Yet, third time's a charm, right?) As if crises of identity weren't enough, Woo seemed to be going through a transformation himself, adjusting his craft for American audiences.<br/><br/>But with ""Face/Off,"" Woo proves to be at the top of his game, since he has the right actors, the right action and special effects, and the right stuff to pull it all off.<br/><br/>10/10"
"EvMcc","1","44","71","1 February 1999"," Redefines the word ""implausible""
","Plenty of action yes, of the 1000 bullets per second with no-one getting hurt variety, but a laughable plot.  Cage's face is removed and grafted onto Travolta; Travolta's original face is then saved for replacing at the end of his mission.  Obviously the face would be locked away somewhere safe and out of harm's way?  No, when Cage unexpectedly comes around he gets out of bed, looks through the window, and there, in the room right next to him and in a brightly illuminated jar is Travolta's face!  At this point I watched the video for a little longer to see if it could get any more ridiculous and when it started to, I turned it off.<br/><br/>One of the worst films I have seen in a long time."

Some of the greatest gun fights I have ever seen in any movie take place here, specifically the the cop vs criminal fight in the mansion, is it?

As an action film, this should be viewed and judged among its so to say 'species' - and as for me - it gets 5/5.<br/><br/>Why?<br/><br/>I'm pondering on it myself. I'm a girl; I should hate action movies and go watch romantic comedies instead (yuck!). I should search the screen for handsome hunks with bare torso and do other crazy, girlish things like that. 'Face/Off' doesn't have handsome men (come on! Travolta in his 40's and the ever sad, puppy-eyed Cage? No fun!). So what is in this film, that makes me watch it whenever I have a chance?<br/><br/>Let's see. The plot - no big deal. Good guy, bad guy, tragedy in the past, revenge, remorse etc. Been there, done that, in dozens of movies before. So what is there left?<br/><br/>Actors. Travolta playing Cage and vice versa. Fun to watch, especially Travolta the good bad guy (or the other way round, the bad good guy). Gershon - liked her in 'Bound', now she's straight. Too bad there's so little of her.<br/><br/>Directing. It's Johny Woo. It was the first film by him I saw, it stayed with me a long way. Why other directors can't stage a simple scene the way he does it - beats me. It's pure poetry; the music, the motion - at one time You forget the people are shooting there, because it all looks like a ballet... Yet, it's 'just' an action film; there's no need in getting too philosophical about it...Or is there?<br/><br/>The split personality. The fact that your worst enemy knows you better than you know yourself... Oh, stop it. It's just an action film.<br/><br/>I wish more action films were like that. Wishful thinking?..."

This movie drags on way past the comfort level. It keeps going from one improbable situation to another, linked by flashy chase scenes, until you're begging for some kind of resolution.<br/><br/>The acting of Nick Cage and John Travolta are just about what you would expect -- that is to say totally over-the-top. Chewing on the scenery is a polite term for what they do. <br/><br/>As for the talents of John Woo, well I've heard all about his ""violence as opera"" philosophy of film-making, but I just don't buy it. Every movie I've seen of his isn't scary, or exciting, or shocking -- its uncomfortable, like sitting on a sharp spike. <br/><br/>I saw this movie years ago in the theatre, but it still sticks with me -- I guess that should say something about its power, but years ago, I saw a dead deer sitting by the side of the road. It was rotting in the heat, its muscles had contracted, it smelled awful and it looked alot like a mummy -- that experience stuck with me too.

With time running out Archer is offered a terrible option - to switch faces with Troy and have surgery to alter his body shape.  After the surgery Archer goes undercover in prison to learn the location of the bomb.  However when in prison, Troy awakes from his coma, forces the doctors to give him Archer's face, kills everyone who knows about the mission and assumes Archer's life.  Trapped in prison, Archer is forced to escape from prison and join with Troy's gang to expose Troy - mayhem ensues.<br/><br/>This was Woo's third American film and it was the one he finally struck gold with.  The story is simply daft - don't try to pick holes in it because it's far too easy to do.  What makes the film is that the plot is glossed over by sheer spectacle and great action - you barely have a moment to catch your breath, never mind pick holes in the plot.  The action is fantastic throughout - plenty of trademark slow-mo, diving with two guns etc and all given such style.  In his other US films it all felt like Woo-lite, however here he is allowed to do just what he wants.  OK - the plot may not stand up in repeated viewing, but the action is superb!<br/><br/>Travolta and Cage both have great fun playing each other - they mange to swap roles really well.  Travolta has the most fun as he gets to ham it up as Troy for most of the time, but Cage has the better role as he plays the `good guy' for most of it.  Allen and Gershon are both good as the protagonist's partners but have little to do in this man's world.  Really it's all about Cage and Travolta and Woo - nobody else really matters.<br/><br/>Overall this may not be a great film due to the weakness of it's plot, but it is still a superb action movie.  Most action movies have poor plots - but not all can provide the huge amount of action and fun that Face/Off does. Fantastic!"
"blanche-2","8","18","33","2 October 2005"," Great action flick with an unusual twist
","I saw Face/Off in the theater and I enjoyed it very much. I say it's a great action flick with an unusual twist because there's some actual acting going on and a storyline. It's got a real sci-fi premise to it, switching faces, which feeds into the fantasy life of those of us who want to call 1-800-FACEOFF and get a Charlize Theron face.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage as a terrorist and John Travolta as a secret agent are both excellent, but when they switch identities - WOW. Travolta really turns it on and does a great job in Cage's persona. Cage is always good, and it's interesting to watch him do the more subdued Travolta persona. And when they're on screen together, it's great.<br/><br/>There's plenty of action and violence to keep the viewer entertained. To those who aren't particular fans of the genre, you will still enjoy this old ""Mission: Impossible"" premise where they put on those latex masks."
"kylopod","5","15","27","3 November 2005"," Too run-of-the-mill for its own good
","The body-switch genre is pretty lame when it's used as the basis for a comedy, probably because the idea is just not that funny. Attempting to transfer the same premise to a sci-fi action thriller, however, sounds like a good starting point. And I have to admit that this film's concept is quite clever: an FBI agent (John Travolta) goes undercover through a surgical operation in which his own face is replaced with that of a terrorist (Nicolas Cage) whom he recently apprehended. But the killer wakes up from his coma, steals Travolta's original face, and assumes his identity while the real man, who now resembles the killer, rots away in prison.<br/><br/>A willing suspension of disbelief is in order. Once the two men switch places, each looks exactly like the other, with no visible scars. In any case, it seems to me that Nicolas Cage's face probably would not fit on John Travolta's head, though my theory is not likely to be tested anytime soon.<br/><br/>Contrary to what many critics claimed, the actors do little to imitate each other's styles. Only briefly in the film do we get to see Cage as the villain and Travolta as the good guy, even though we are told those represent the ""real"" characters. Once they make the switch, each actor is in familiar territory, with Travolta more or less reprising his hip gangster role from ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Get Shorty,"" and Cage playing another one of his brooding outcast characters. Had the film made Travolta the fugitive and Cage the hoodlum taking over his life, that would have been slightly atypical for these actors.<br/><br/>At least the prison scenes are a little creative, albeit inexplicable. Travolta (with Cage's face) is sent to a facility where convicts are kept under control through the use of electronic tracing, high-powered magnets, and other improbable technology. These scenes would have made more sense in a futuristic sci-fi film, which in fact was what the original script intended. The director John Woo changed the setting to the contemporary world, but left in the bizarre penitentiary without a word of explanation. Regardless of all that, there is little doubt that the plot will find a way for Travolta's character to outsmart this seemingly impenetrable system, because otherwise there'd be no movie. It might have made more sense if they'd established Travolta as some sort of electronics expert; here, the basis for his escape is just arbitrary.<br/><br/>The rest of the film runs along similarly obligatory lines. Travolta must find his way home, get his face back, and prove his innocence, all the while thwarting the plans of the killer who has taken over his life. The final segment of the film is a virtuoso sequence of gunfights, chase scenes, and big explosions. But there's nothing in the story you couldn't predict a thousand miles off. This is typical assembly-line Hollywood, where even an ingenious idea gets treated with one cliché after the other, until finally being warped beyond recognition, kind of like the two characters' faces in this film."

Which it was originally written as a Sci-Fi/Action/Thriller. But director Woo and screenwriters changed the premise sightly to be in modern today instead. Travolta and Cage are extremely good in their roles by giving heart and soul to this excellent action movie. These two actors are also having an great time playing these characters Over the Top as well. Woo is an expert for creating memorable dynamic action sequences and as well making these characters human as well. There's one stand-out sequence, when the point of view of a little boy (David McCurley) is listening to ""Over the Raindow"" while watching People getting killed all over him is unexpectedly touching and beautiful in a dark way.<br/><br/>The DVD is a 10th anniversary edition, which this DVD is a 2-Disc Set.

Disc 2 includes an fascinating one-hour documentary of the film with many new interviews with the cast & crew (expect for Travolta and Cage, sadly ""although vintage interviews was used in the DVD""), 25 minute documentary of the films of John Woo and the original theatrical trailer. This film certainly made an impact, once it was release in the summer of 1997 and it went on to have an huge following. Once it released on Video and DVD. This film is still John Woo's best American film to date. I think it's one of those films that Woo will have an hard time to top this one. Because this is an extraordinary picture. Don't miss it. Plenty of familiar faces appears in bit parts, including an young Thomas Jane as a prisoner, John Bloom (Better known as Joe Bob Briggs) and Danny Masterson as a Would-Be Rapist.

","Possibly John Woo's greatest American film yet. Watching it brings out my emotions from start to finish and the action scenes were done with the style of a master director known as John Woo. Even though he has made some movies that are not that impressive, it seems that he uses the style of A Better Tomorrow 1 & 2, the emotions of The Killer and the action of Hard Boiled, and incorporates all of this to make one awesome blockbuster featuring top actors such as John Travolta and Nicholas Cage. These two actors make the movie work and if Woo used different actors it would not have worked. Travolta and Cage changing roles from good to bad and bad to good is superb as both actors change their emotions as the characters change their identities. A must see for all John Woo and action fans and definitely the movie to have as a collectors item. John Woo's American Masterpiece is worth every dollar you spend on it."

","Castor Troy (Nicholas Cage) is an accomplished international assassin & Shaun Archer (John Travolta) is the head of an anti-terrorism police force. While on a mission to kill Shaun, Troy accidentally kills Shaun's little son. So, Shaun now makes it his life's mission to bring Troy to justice & gain peace of mind for himself. When Troy goes into a coma during his escape from the police, Shaun learns that he is planning to blow up a square mile of the city. So, with the help of ultramodern technology, Shaun transforms into Troy to get the information about the location of the bomb from Troy's younger brother & only three people know about this. Then Troy wakes up from his coma, transforms himself into Shaun, kills everyone who knows about the procedure & goes to live in Shaun's home. Can the real Shaun protect his family and thousands of people and show he is not Troy to everybody? <br/><br/>Nicholas Cage is one of my favorite actors and this was coming on TV last night and I decided to see it as it had been close to a decade the last time I saw it and I didn't remember anything. Some of my friends told me that Cage could have played the Joker in Batman, if this performance was anything to go by and provided he still looked like it (he is not this good looking now). I completely agree with them on this. The level of insanity and brilliance produced by Nicholas Cage in this movie is simply mind-blowing for its time. I mean, the Joker was not the standard bar for maniac characters on screen at the time this movie was made and Cage made Troy such a chilling presence. Even as Shaun, Cage was perfect. John Travolta (this is my second Travolta movie after 'The Taking Of Pelham 123' last year) couldn't carry out Troy's maniac part very convincingly (or I should say, as convincingly as Cage), except in the climax with Shaun's daughter. But, he was perfect as Shaun. I thought that Troy was beginning to have good feelings for the daughter, while he was teaching her how to defend herself and was trying to look at life from a fresh perspective. But, that was blown out of the window and I found out that he never had any sort of feelings for anybody but himself and his brother. Joan Allen as Shaun's wife, Eve was fine in her short role. Pollux Troy also was very convincing as the nerdy and somewhat maniac brother of Castor Troy.<br/><br/>Though the premise of the story is too far-fetched and the shoot-out between the main protagonists, whenever they meet, is insanely non-stop throughout the movie, it still entertains because of the powerhouse performance by Nicholas Cage and very credible acting from John Travolta. I hated the fact that most of the action scenes were made just to satisfy the fans, the climax was half an hour for god's sake. With this concept and these incredible actors, Face/Off's acting and dramatic scenes were so good that it would still be a great film without the shoot outs.<br/><br/>7/10"

The opening scene with Castor Troy arriving at the airport, is a scene which I have seen at least a billion times. The music that supports that scene is so lavishly put together that it is mind bending. John Powell is a music prodigy. John Woo is a legend, his views of making movies has changed Hollywood. The way he portrays each character is a marvel. Their emotions can be felt, and the way he shows their anger and rage leaves the viewers speechless.

","It's a great movie, one of the best pure action flicks of all time, with some incredible gunfight sequences and all sorts of chemistry between the characters. But even for all of that, what makes ""Face/Off"" stand out as a true classic is Castor Troy. Castor, a gun-happy terrorist who's a bad boy taken to the next level, ranks among the most compelling, fascinating villains of all time. Despite being evil wrapped in flesh and bone, Castor is everything we want to be--powerful, confident, poised, and, best of all, the embodiment of cool. Cage brings it all across better than Travolta, but not by much. Troy, no matter which actor is portraying him, takes control of the movie and brings it to the next level. A great film."

","I'm clicking the spoiler button, but I can't actually conceive of how you could possibly spoil one of the worst, most utterly stupid plots it has ever been my misfortune to see. I watched it a few weeks ago and didn't bother to review it here, but I now feel I have to redress the balance a bit since so many people seem to think it's great.<br/><br/>What's so stupid? Well, the whole thing ... even assuming you could transplant faces, how can anyone possibly believe that someone with a completely different physique and mannerisms could fool even work colleagues, let alone a wife or a brother? How can we believe that Travolta would go into such a thing with only a couple of people knowing what he's done? Why did they leave Cage alive, and how on earth did he magically go from brain-dead to fully conscious at exactly the critical moment? How could Travolta-as-Cage almost effortlessly manage to break out of a maximum-security prison without even any advance planning? I could go on but I don't think I'll bother - I don't think the writers did.<br/><br/>The near-constant violence is also pretty unpleasant if you bother to think about it. It's common in this kind of action film for bystanders to die in great numbers without anyone apparently caring much, but this goes further than most because Travolta, supposedly on the side of law and order, manages to be responsible for the deaths of quite a few people on his own side, as well as the bad guys (it was slightly unclear in all the shooting whether he actually killed any himself or not). That also contrasts with a sickly sentimentalism about characters who are significant to the protagonists, notably their sons. I'm not generally that bothered by violence in films, but I can't help wondering if this kind of extreme-yet-sanitised violence does have some effect.<br/><br/>I find it hard to comment on the acting. I'm inclined to say that Travolta and Cage make a fair attempt under the circumstances, but that could also be read as saying that they are a bit better than a very bad plot!<br/><br/>About the only positive thing I can say is that the film has a lot of glossy, spectacular action sequences. If you really turn your brain off you can probably appreciate it just as an abstract exercise in film-making. Or on the other hand you could watch something else."

I thought the plot idea was ridiculous to an unvelievable degree, but it was actually outdone and rendered rather tame by the absolutely-no, obscenely-farcical `action' scenes.  There's really no need to go into specifics.  The movie started out horribly-with a ridiculous fight scene-and just got worse, and worse, and worse, and worse.

I will admit, the idea of swapping identies is kind of cool. However, this film does not get anymore original than that. It is all about the violence and people getting killed and things blowing up and major showdowns between characters. That's really all there is to it.

","From what I've seen of John Woo's films, when he does action it's always over-the-top and insanely cool, and this is no exception. This may very well be the pinnacle of 90s action in terms of the pure, insane cheesiness and awesome action.<br/><br/>The plot has Sean Archer (John Travolta) hunting down dangerous criminal Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage), who six years earlier killed his son. After apprehending him, Archer finds out that there's still a bomb threat, and with time running out and with no other alternatives, he decides to undergo a crazy procedure that will allow him to wear Troy's face and masquerade as him to get the info from his brother. Things go awry when Troy wakes up and puts on Archer's face, stealing his life.<br/><br/>The film's greatest strength is the two leads, who convincingly play each other. It helps that both actors are pretty over-the-top to begin with, and it gets even better when you see Travolta doing the best Nicolas Cage impersonation you'll ever see.<br/><br/>The action is just as awesome as you'd expect from a John Woo film, with improbable explosions and guns with seemingly infinite ammo all around. <br/><br/>The biggest problem I had with the movie is that the lead-up to killing Troy-as-Archer is really, REALLY long. There's a Mexican standoff, a church shootout, a hostage scene, a boat chase, it goes on and on and on, though it does lead to an awesome explosion and unconvincing stunt doubles. Still, that's not too much of a big deal because the action doesn't stop, but it can be a bit tiring.<br/><br/>If you like crazy awesome action, crazy awesome actors, or just craziness and awesomeness in general, then this is the film for you!"

","No, surgeons cannot carve your face off and graft it onto somebody else like they do to John Travolta and Nicolas Cage in ""Face/Off,"" a provocative, high-voltage crime thriller. Surgeons may eventually perfect this operation, but for now it is impossible. Just because real surgeons cannot cut off faces and slap them onto other people, however, need not deter their ersatz Hollywood counterparts. Face swapping makes for an audacious movie premise, especially when it plays a key part in the razzle-dazzle, bullet-riddled duel of champions from celebrated Hong Kong action helmer John Woo. If you've seen the Jean-Claude Van Damme thriller ""Hard Target"" or the previous Travolta epic ""Broken Arrow,"" you've been Woo-ed. If you've never rented Woo's super-charged video classics, such as ""The Killer,"" ""A Better Tomorrow,"" and ""Hard Boiled,"" you've missed some of the coolest thrillers since ""Miami Vice"" left the airwaves.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage is cast as the insanely evil terrorist Castor Troy. Troy shoots Federal Agent Sean Archer (John Travolta of ""Broken Arrow""), but his bullet passes through Archer and kills Archer's young son Michael. Archer has made it his crusade to capture Castor Troy. Six year later, Archer catches up with him. Castor has just planted a bomb with a plague that's ""a tad worse than Gulf War Syndrome."" Before Castor can fly away, a task force of choppers, cars, and SWAT sharpshooters converge on the airport. This scene evokes memories of the Bond movie ""License to Kill."" Like the Bond villain, Castor finds his jet stopped and the Feds swarming over it. He manages to kill a few before he is trapped in the deadly draft of a wind tunnel.<br/><br/>Everybody cheers Sean Archer. Castor lies in a coma, while his brother Pollux Troy (Alessandro Nivola in an effective performance) rots in prison. When the Feds inspect Troy's plane, they find a computer disc and learn about the bomb. Just when Archer thought it was safe to cross the street, BOOM! An initial dragnet of Castor Troy's accomplices yields a date, but Pollus refuses to talk. At least to anyone other than his brother Castor. That's when a black bag, super-secret operation is mounted. Hollis Miller (CCH Pounders of ""RoboCop 3"") persuades Archer to swap mugs with Troy. With the specter of a devastating plague in L.A., Archer consent to their harebrained scheme.<br/><br/>The ingenious Mike Werb and Michael Colleary screenplay piles on absurdities galore with the same reckless abandon that some fast food restaurants heap on the lettuce, pickles, and tomatoes. ""Face/Off"" spins itself off of the well worn plot when the good guy has to go so deep undercover that the only people who can help him are the first ones who the villains slay. If you've seen Burt Reynolds in Joseph Sargent's ""White Lightning"" (1973), or Paul Newman in John Huston's ""The MacKintosh Man"" (1973), or Johnny Depp in the recent Al Pacino caper ""Donnie Brasco,"" you know the plot basics. ""Face/Off"" is an unbelievable thriller that dresses itself up with realism. Even if half of the stuff in ""Face/Off"" couldn't happen, director John Woo stages it so that it looks not only pictorially possible but visually splendid. The idea that John Travolta and Nicolas Cage can swap bodies is hokum of a clever but far-fetched nature. So the movie makers rely on the indulgence of the audience. Of course, Travolta cannot become anything like Cage. But it's fun to see how their characters change in this out-of-body experience. And the movie makers go a step further when they include a surgical scene that is an homage to those old Hammer horror movies when Dr. Frankenstein dunked everything in a fish tank! If you like movies where the heroes spend a lot of time trading shots with each other, ""Face/Off"" should be the right caliber for you. The arsenal of weapons is impressive; especially Castor Troy's matched brace of gold-plated automatic pistols. Werb and Colleary chart the vendetta between Archer and Troy in a series of deliriously poetic shoot-outs that resemble a Sergio Leone extravaganza. You see bullets after they have been discharged leaving the barrel. Whenever it looks like it's going to run out of plot, ""Face/Off"" loosens a burst or two of ammo in a gunfight. You get to see a lot of reloading close-ups. Every time a bullet hits anything, whatever it struck erupts into a fountain of shards. And then you have the cameras gliding through all of this mayhem with stunt people jerking and tumbling, shell casings flying, and guys dodging bullets. Woo surprisingly keeps blood and gore to a minimum.<br/><br/>The heroes and villains in ""Face/Off"" want to destroy each other. Archer is the straight-arrow hero and Troy is the villain. It's a classic example of the struggle between good and evil. As villains go, Troy is mean to the marrow. He drips evil in a slinky, malignant way. He revels in violence for fun and profit. ""Face/Off"" tampers little with this image, except where Troy shows concern for his younger brother Pollux by constantly tying his shoes. When Castor gets his comeuppance, you want to cheer because he grows increasingly slimy as the plot thickens.<br/><br/>John Travolta alternates between jaw clenched expressions of rage and soul searching displays of agony. He allows his commitment to the law drive him beyond it. His heroism is tainted by grief for his dead son and his desire to kill Castor. This is one of Travolta's more toxic performances, especially when he absorbs Castor's personality.<br/><br/>The undersea prison in ""Face/Off"" is straight out of a sci-fi movie and another subtle hint about what director John Woo faced if he had remained in Hong Kong. In this prison, which is constructed of steel, the convicts wear steel boots. When a riot breaks out, the guards magnetize the convicts' boots and zap them with cattle prods. The symbolism of ""Face/Off"" is fundamental. Woo shows us that there is a little good and evil in us all."

","Magic Mirror on the wall, is this in your face action movie, the fairest one of all? Not really. Most of the time, I was laughing my face off due to the tongue-in-cheek action. Not to be confused with the series Face/Off, a makeup-F/X reality competition on the SyFy Channel. The movie, Face/Off is more like brain off, pay off film. Directed by John Woo, the silly premise movie tells the story of an FBI agent, Sean Archer (John Travolta) who goes undercover and assumes the identity of a ruthless terrorist, Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage) to foil a terrorist bomb threat. Soon, the plan backfires when the same criminal impersonates the cop with the same method, a face-transplant surgery. Now, it's up to Archer to prove that, he's the real Archer, and stop Castor from stealing his life. Without spoiling the movie too much, the film is full of director Woo's signature tiresome clichés like the overused of doves and over the top Gun Fu action sequences. It's nice to see Travolta and Cage each playing two different personalities, making both actors the protagonists and antagonists. In my opinion Nicolas Cage's acting is better than John Travolta's acting in this. Cage's gotten a lot of credit as a pretty good actor in a lot of good films in the past. But with the birth of the internet, people started to notice compilation videos of Cage's acting that showcased a certain craziness. Travolta's not so much. In this film, Cage goes total insane in certain scenes. The acting from these two was a bit over the top, but it's one of the charms of the film. The female characters are some of the worst written. Joan Allen as Archer's wife, Eve is just awful. She supposed to be a doctor, but she can't tell that Archer been replaced by somebody else. She's the wife, I would think she would know, every detail of her husband's body. She needed to do a blood test, just to prove that it isn't him. Honestly, how did Troy not notice that a needle's been stuck in him for a blood test? Does he not feel pain? Anyways, she discovers the truth, and waits forever to tell people about it, causing more death and mayhem. Not the best written character. There are bits in the movie that makes you scratch your head, puzzling, like how is Castor Troy, hard to find. He supposed to be the most secretive terrorist ever, yet he has a personal jet, nice suits and expensive rent-a-car. Another WTF moment is church choir scene at the LA Convention Center. Why are they there, and how did Castor Troy got away with groping with one of the choir girls, while wearing a priest outfit? So, he's OK about groping this choir girl, but help beat up Archer's daughter's boyfriend when he became a bit, too touchy toward Jamie (Dominique Swain). That doesn't make sense!? Also, didn't Troy earlier in the film, say and threatened to rape Jamie to her father's face. That was a bit odd. I have to criticize the fact that the film makes the villain more likable than the protagonist. It's weird that the villain makes a better father than the real hero who is never there. The protagonist seem a little bit creepier than Troy to his own family. He has the nerves to adopt a boy that mirror his dead kid without his wife, knowing. Then he has that awkward hand rub to the face. It's disturbing. No wonder, why Jamie is so mess up. The movie really goes crazy in its Sci-fiction premise, despite the settling of the film being 1997. The face surgery is bit out there in science fiction land. Don't ask how the surgery is reversed for the hero, toward the end, despite the Walsh institute being burned down. It's never explained. I like how the Walsh institute has no security just in case, Castor Troy wake up. I'm not even kidding: They leave Castor Troy with little to no security watching him throughout the majority of the first part of the film. Talking about security. That maximum, high tech secret oil rig prison that Archer-as-Castor Troy is sent to, is so surreal. Reusing props like the electric shock therapy and magnetic boots from 1993's Super Mario Bros the movie! Come on! The action is a hit than a miss. There were very entertaining. I like the Mexican stand-off at the church, it was pretty cool. I like the Mexican stand-off at the church, it was pretty cool. The Gun Fu action really did work. Still, there were some misses, I like how the stunt doubles, don't look anything like the real actors, during some of the action scenes or how a person that clearly got shot in the neck, is able to speak, very well. For a very silly movie, there were a lot of good scenes. The opening scene is a good example of this, where Troy tries to shoot Archer but kills Archer's son instead. To this film's credit, this is a pretty dramatic and emotional scene. John Travolta was able to show more emotional range. It's seem that the movie was trying to go with bigger themes like Christ references. Another is brotherhood, using Greek mythology names. Castor and Pollux were twin brothers of Helen of Troy that form the Gemini constellation, which is on the opposite side of the night sky from Sagittarius the Archer. The music score was mostly alright. I like the main theme. I dislike the use of ""Somewhere over the Rainbow"" playing over a gunfight. It was a bit jarring. Overall: I acknowledges that the corniness is what makes the film so fun. Only John Woo and these two unique actors, Cage & Travolta could pull something this whacky off. Great movie to watch. Good popcorn film to escape reality in."

","I had high expectations for the movie ""Face/0ff"" directed by John Woo. Woo's previous movies like Broken Arrow and Hard Boiled were fast-paced, action packed movies. I expected Face/Off to maintain the same standard that Woo's previous movies had. After watching Face/Off, I was convinced that it had surpassed his earlier movies by far. Not only are the action sequences and special effects literally spectacular and breath-taking, but the story-line is also entertaining.<br/><br/>I will not spoil the contents of the movie, unlike other reviews, but I will praise John Woo for making one of the best(if not the best) action flick of the 90's. John Travolta and Nicolas Cage display their talent beautifully, and supporting actors like Gina Gershon and Alessandro Nivola also contribute to making this is a highly enjoyable movie experience.<br/><br/>Face/Off is A MUST for all action lovers as well as all other movie lovers.

","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>There are films that are merely illustrated stories, and there are films that are centrally cinematic. There are so few of the latter, especially as mainstream products, that we should celebrate when one comes along. This one gets low marks from a lot of people because it superficially is dumb. After all, it is an excessively violent action movie with the double burden of two of the most offensive muggers working today. It has no sex.<br/><br/>But it has a cinematic soul. There are parts of this that are perfect. Parts of the `When you wish' sequence go over the line and the boat chase is mundane, but the church sequence and two others are as visually poetic as it gets without a story on the big screen. <br/><br/>The story is just an excuse, and is a simple construction, but some care has been given to details within those broad stokes: the face-wipe gesture, the `identity' of Dominique (of Dolores Haze fame, possibly the most invented identity in all literature -- Lolita), the cruel jabs at religious watering down of powerful myth, the careful cooptation of the Frankenstein ploy.<br/><br/>It also has Gina Gershon in a relatively minor role.

","Through his pain, grief, and suffering, FBI Agent Sean Archer (John Travolta) focuses all his attention on catching terrorist and con-artist Castor Troy (Nicholas Cage) no matter how long it takes. The theme in this film is revenge and selfishness. Sean Archer and his son were riding on a merry-go-round when Castor Troy shot Sean Archer. However, the bullet went through Sean Archer striking his son and killing him. Sean Archer decides that he must do one last thing to end Castor Troy and the haunt of him forever. He decides to assume the look of Castor Troy to put a stop to an annihilation of innocent people. Things don't go as planned and Castor Troy ends up assuming the look of Sean Archer. The real Sean Archer cannot wait to put Castor Troy to rest. The real Sean Archer ends up on his own because he looks as if he's Castor Troy and no one believes him not even his wife. Throughout this film Sean Archer does just that, he seeks revenge until Castor Troy has been put to rest and cannot harm his family anymore. The real Sean Archer was able to convince his wife that he is Sean Archer. They get the best surgeon to reverse the Face/Off.<br/><br/>Two techniques that show the theme of the film is its angle and the use of sound effects. When Sean Archer and Castor Troy fought the angles of the camera shot were incredible. The camera seems as if it is tilted to show the actual fall or knockdown of each character. The sound effects were also great in this film. There were tons of fighting and guns going off so the sound effects were very loud, especially when listening in surround sound."

","This film is about a policeman, Sean Archer who has been after a psychotic killer (Castor Troy) for a while. When Troy realizes that Sean is getting closer to him, he tries to kill him, and unfortunately he did it when Sean was playing with is son at the park. As Castor takes the shot, the bullet went through Sean and killed his son. Since then, Sean Archer dedicated his life to catch Castor Troy. After years eventually he did, putting Troy in a coma and just when he thought it was all over, Sean had to disguise himself as the person he hater the most by switching faces so he could find out through Castor's brother Pollux Troy where a bomb was set to blow. It was an undercover assignment so only three people knew about it. Unfortunately Castor recovers from his coma killing the only three people that know about his assignment and leaving him in prison as Castor Troy and roaming the streets as Sean Archer the policeman."
"moviesleuth2","10","3","4","30 June 2008"," Near brilliant
","Wow! This could have been such a bad movie! The story is ridiculous, and in the hands of someone less talented than John Woo, it could make no sense. More importantly, had the two leads been less talented, the premise would have been impossible to buy. Yet ""Face/Off"" is done so well that it is a near masterpiece.<br/><br/>Sean Archer (John Travolta) is an FBI agent who has spent his career tracking the terrorist Castor Troy (Nicholas Cage). When Archer finally catches Troy, he discovers that the terrorist has planted a bomb somewhere, and in order to find it, Archer has to (quite literally) switch faces with Troy to interrogate his paranoid-schizophrenic brother, Pollux (Alessandro Nivola). Of course, complications arise when Troy wakes up from his coma and takes Archer's face for himself. So now Archer is Troy and Troy is Archer! Like I said, the story is beyond ridiculous. But the script is written intelligently enough that the characters act realistically. But that is beside the point. There are two things that make this film great: an outstanding cast, and John Woo.<br/><br/>There was a time when movie stars were stars because of their acting ability, not because of how well they sold themselves to the tabloids and the celebrity gossip magazines. It shows here. John Travolta and Nicholas Cage have fun with their roles. They clearly studied each other's mannerisms and mimic them, so it's always clear that they are ACTING like their counterpart, not because the story says so.<br/><br/>But Cage and Travolta are not the only ones with memorable performances. The supporting actors are played by skilled thespians as well, all of whom care about the film enough to flesh out their parts. The villains are fleshed out enough that they cease to become really villains. We gain sympathy for them because they act like real people. Nick Cassavetes and especially the always wonderful Gina Gershon are prime examples. And it's also great to see Colm Feore and the always terrific CCH Pounder.<br/><br/>Then there is John Woo. Instead of taking the easy, safe way out and making it dumb, campy fun, he's got the guts and the skill to make it an full-out action movie. And it works. Of course, there are times when his little flourishes are too much, but that's just nit-picking.<br/><br/>""Face/Off"" comes so close to being a ten, SO CLOSE! It comes so close that I nearly gave it that rating, but after thinking it over I can't in good conscience do so. The reason? The ending. The main problem is Travolta. For 90% of the movie, he holds his own and does brilliant work. But in the film's last scenes he goes over the top and goes into ""Broken Arrow"" mode (ironically also a John Woo film), and it casts a pall over the last action sequence. So close, but no cigar.<br/><br/>Still, this is a great film, and a wild ride."
"vip_ebriega","10","3","4","15 May 2008"," Trading 'Faces'.
","My Take: The mindless action movie for smart people. <br/><br/>FACE/OFF is Hong Kong action director John Woo's 3rd Hollywood action effort, and it is in this one that he finally hits the stride. Woo deliver one heck of a punch and delivers one action scene after another...with style. FACE/OFF is action filmdom as an art form. There are many moments of violence and shootouts, but thanks to th very talented Woo, the action is in a style of his own. Slow-motion shots and all, FACE/OFF is not just a non-stop thrill machine that one quit for a second (from the opening credits to the seat-gripping climax, it hardly has time for small talk), it's also Woo's perfect ballet of style and violence. And if you think those to things don't go together, then you haven't seen FACE/OFF.<br/><br/>Perhaps one of the two best actors at work in action films is John Travolta and Nicolas Cage, and they prove the pride of their work in this movie. During the film's gloomy prologue, nice-guy family man cop Sean Archer (Travolta) is on a carousel with his little boy, while on top of the hill is eccentric terrorist Castor Troy (Cage), aiming his sniper at Archer but misses, and hits his son instead. Since then, Archer has devoted himself on bringing Castor down. After two years or so, he's still at it. ""We'll take a break, when the case breaks!"" Archer says angrily. When Archer does corner Castor in hi private plane (in one of the film's earliest action scenes), Archer brings Castor drop dead in a coma. Just when he thought it was over, secretly Castor and his brother Pullox (Alessandro Nivola) has already set up a bomb and Castor's brother, captured for interrogation, just won't talk. What does he do? Well, here it goes. Archer has to switch faces with the comatose Castor, go to prison with Pullox and make him talk. Oh! And he also must remain undercover. No one knows, even his wife Eve (Joan Allen), of the operation. Things get worse when Castor wakes up (!) from his comatose and asks for Archer's face. Silly plot as it is, but who cares. This give us a chance to see the good guy Travolta and bad guy Cage switch personalities for most of the film.<br/><br/>What else is good about FACE/OFF is how the characters are well-developed. Archer is a nice cop, but isn't the same as a husband and a father, as he is unable to handle his relationship with his wife and rebellious daughter Jamie (Dominique Swann). Castor Troy is what he is, a real villain everyone loves to hate. The supporting characters are surprisingly well-developed and interesting. We care about these batch of characters, more or less it's the action we want, and it's more than we get. The action scenes here, including the opening action fireworks and the boat chase climax is a seat-gripper. Then there's a number of shoot-outs and fist-fights that, under the style of Woo, is like a ballad... with guns and punches. FACE/OFF is action movies of the best order. It's one of the best action movies in years.<br/><br/>Rating: ***** out of 5."

John Woo started his Hollywood Career with Hard Target and Broken Arrow. It was his Third Movie that is his Best work in Hollywood. Face off has some Powerhouse performances from both John Travolta and Nicholas Cage who equally gave us a Brilliant performance. It is very hard to say, who acted better in the movie. Its like judging Al Pacino and Robert De Niro in Heat. They both had an equal amount of work, and had to act as each other, since they have a face off.

"ijonesiii","9","3","4","21 December 2005"," And I Don't Even Like Action Movies...
","Admittedly, I have never been a fan of action/adventure films. I don't know why...the genre has never appealed to me that much, so an endorsement from me regarding an action/adventure film is a big thing. And there are few action films that have totally riveted me from start to finish like FACE/OFF. This thoroughly original and truly exciting film is one the finest examples of this genre, mounted by proved action genius John Woo, who has become sort of the Sam Peckinpaugh of this generation. The movie centers a long standing cat-and-mouse game between a veteran FBI agent (John Travolta) and a demented career criminal (Nicolas Cage), who, many years ago, in an attempt to murder Travolta, murdered his son instead. Cage's Castor Troy has planted a bomb somewhere in Los Angeles and is then assumed to be dead. Travolta's Sean Archer can only learn where the bomb is from Castor's brother and the only way he can get the information from him is to become Castor Troy which involves a highly technical surgical procedure where Troy's face is removed from his comatose body and placed on Travolta's face. However, the story gets ugly when Castor awakens from his coma, has Travolta's face put on himself, and then murders everyone who knows about the plan. It's such an interesting story that the viewer can't help but become emotionally involved in and what a great acting challenge for these two actors, who, at times, must adapt each other's speech patterns and mannerisms in order to make this ruse work. Travolta and Cage do some of the best work of their respective careers here, almost to the point that you can forget who is who at what time. Joan Allen, one of the best actresses in the business, offers solid support, as Sean Archer's confused wife, caught in the middle of this deadly game and Gina Gershon makes a strong impression as Troy's girl and mother of his son, but this is Cage and Travolta's show all the way, and with the help of an intelligent screenplay and masterful direction, bring us one of the great action/adventure epics of the last 20 years."

","John Woo directs his best action movie to date starring John Travolta (Pulp Fiction, Saturday Night Fever) and Nicholas Cage (Leaving Las Vegas, The Rock). Cage's character Castor Troy is a terrorist and has hidden a bomb inside a large skyscraper, Travolta's Archer tracks Castor down in a show-off in an airfield while Castor is trying to escape. Archer knocks Castor unconscience during the fight, therefor he cannot interrogate Castor as to the location of the skyscraper bomb. Castor's brother Prevlux is the only other person who knows the location of the bomb. To retrieve the information Travolta unwillingly accepts the surgical procedure that replaces faces between Archer and Troy. Troy is left in his coma like sleepness at the lab with Archer's face and meanwhile Archer looks like Troy and infiltrates a prison where Prevlux is being held. Prevlux soon finds out Archer is a fake, but not before he gives him the location of the bomb. Troy wakes up, kills the science crew and destroys all information about the surgical procedure, now he has basically illegally assumed the full identity of Archer, and has access to Archer's work and family. Archer must fight back, being noticed always as Troy, he must win his friends and his family back, and must kill Troy.<br/><br/>Action packed from start to finish, literally. More entertaining than Titantic which was released the same year. This movie remains on most people's top 10 action movie lists, and for good reason. Action isn't all that this movie has to offer.

Unable to get Troy's gang to speak, Archer undergoes a secret mission using Castor Troy's face and voice and goes to prison to try and get Troy's brother to tell him where the bomb is hidden. But then Castor Troy comes out of his coma and all hell breaks loose as he takes Archer's identity.<br/><br/>
The best part of the movie is the story(but believe me, don't try to explain it to your friends before they see it, because it won't make any sense)which leads to an explosive finale between Travolta and Cage. They are brilliant in their roles.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 10/10"

Travolta and Cage seem to be going absolutely bonkers in this movie with exaggerated facial expressions and yells everywhere. In a lesser film, that would be annoying but here it's just icing on the cake for the great scenery, camera angles, original ideas, and great backstories. I really do sincerely sympathize with these characters and I wanted them to get out okay! The pacing is just incredible.

They're doing everything they can to understand not just their characters, but each other's characters. The scene with the face transplant is seriously one of the most intense I have ever seen in any movie. Then there's the scene where Cage awakens with no face and we finally get to see him in the reflection. It's such a haunting scene. There's so much variety in all the action and I found myself rooting for these fun and wacky characters.

","Face/Off, a master piece of the 90's, is a must watch film. This sweeping drama stars two paragons of Hollywood, Oscar Winner, Nicolas Cage, and John Travolta, of Michael fame. Nicolas Cage knows no bounds when playing a cheeky, but unsettling, Castor Troy, yet is able to capture family man Sean Archer with a profound execution. Not to be outdone, John Travolta's daring portrayal of Caster brings out this family man's inner demons. When one hoodwinks the other, the game is afoot. All in all, Cage and Travolta deliver a performance that dances into our souls that would make Curious George and The Man With The Yellow Hat proud.

","Face/off is definitely one of the most interesting films I have watched. The film is of course an Action Film, but it also managed to occupy the viewer's feelings and filled us with great agony about whether Sean Archer (John Travolta) will manage to get his life back from Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage). It is not only about shooting and fighting, there seems to be a lot of emotion and compassion here. The plot begins with an idea, that of Travolta using Castor Troy's face to penetrate his crew, which creates a lot of anguish about whether Travolta will be discovered. At the same time, we see his family and his past and we start to empathize with Sean Archer. Later, when Cage wakes from his coma, the plot gets really thrilling and empathizing, especially when Troy tries to approach Archer's family. Till the very last frame, the emotional part of the script is obvious. As for the leading actors, few can be said about Travolta and Cage of course. The way they play each other, the way they change their behavior, but also keep the original character's habits and manners, is unique. <br/><br/>The film is undoubtedly recommended."

","Directed by John Woo and starring John Travolta and Nicolas Cage at their best(you know, before their mutual careers nosedived off a cliff) Face/Off is an epic action/drama that goes beyond the usual explosions and gun fights, giving the audience something more to think about.<br/><br/>The idea of two characters literally swapping faces with the CGI technology of the 90's would've been completely ludicrous and laughable had it not been for the performances of Travolta and Cage. Both actors playing the sociopathic Castor Troy are BRILLIANT. And oddly enough both of them bring something different to the same character without making it seem like two different people playing the same role.<br/><br/>And of course with John Woo at the helm the directing and action are fantastic. There is a particular moment during a fight where the two main characters to turn face one another with a mirror in between them that just blows your mind.<br/><br/>This is my favourite movie of all time and makes me nostalgic for the days of the 90's action movies."

","Face/Off is an action picture in every sense of the word. Too many over the top chase sequences? Check. Too-long running time? Check. Nicolas Cage? Check. Bad? No possible way. It's a seasoned original action picture with surprisingly great performance, excellent sound, editing, and visuals, and nail-biting thrills. <br/><br/>Nicolas Cage, possibly the king of action pictures shares the stage with john Travolta and together they have more chemistry than 3/4 of the romantic comedies today. It's a Clairice Starling/Hannibal Lecter pair. Can you imagine if Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins did what Travolta and Cage do here, switch faces? That would've been interesting. <br/><br/>Both deliver to my surprise, terrific performances. Travolta pretty much amazed me here. He has emotional depth for both characters he portrays. It's Oscar nomination work that never gets considered because of the nature of his film (i.e. Matt Damon in Bourne). Both men could've stolen the show in the Nicolas Cage role, and they both are sublime in it. But it is the John Ttravolta character that was the challenge. When Travolta is actually in his original character he's just as solid and great as he is in the Cage character. Cage falls a little behind with Travolta's character, but picks himself up when he confronts Joan Allen. From there on he's on Travolta's level. <br/><br/>Joan Allen, I fell like I talk about her in every review, delivers yet another fantastic performance. How does she do it?<br/><br/>Face/Off is features incredible tech stuff, fine acting, a very original (not always believable) script, and the action may carry on for a while, but it very well-done; 8."

"sebbezw","2","11","23","22 January 2006"," How can a movie like this get such high ratings?
","There is only one thing that circulated in my head during this movie: ""When the h*ll is it gonna end?"". In spite of the presence of one of my all-time favorite actors, Nicholas Cage, it don't get much better than a simple Van Damme-movie. I mean, how often does a man agree to change face with a dead man just to change it back later? Even if he does it to prevent a catastrophe, I doubt that any man would agree to that. There are dozens of other methods to prevent disasters. OK, now I've revealed a lot of the movie to you. If you haven't seen it yet (which I hope) you have probably lose some of your desperate will to see it, but I can tell you: Don't waste your time on this crap. It is just a silly combination. A silly combination between fancy action scenes, mega dramatic events and some hidden jokes. And those movies who are produced that way are one of the things I hate the most. You probably haven't missed that John Travolta is in one of the leading roles in this movie, and even if you are one of he's biggest fans, you don't want to see this movie. He does a sterile, cold, stiff work in this movie. As you (probably) know, Cage and Travolta switch roles during the movie, and Cage gives both roles shine and character, but Travolta cant handle any of them. Maybe he shouldn't have agreed on the offer once it came up. But don't get me wrong, it isn't Travoltas fault that this movie is a turkey. With such silly script, no one could make this movie good. Not Robert DeNiro, not Harrison Ford, not Mel Gibson, not anyone. And I suppose that nobody can if they are gonna make a remake. And if they will, I wont see it. I regret I've seen this movie."
"MovieAddict2016","9","7","13","31 January 2004"," A spectacular action film with a silly plot but great execution...
","All action films should be as utterly exhilarating as ""Face/Off."" Alas, the majority of them (I'd say 99%) are nothing but worthless retreads of iconic films such as ""Alien,"" ""The Terminator,"" ""Lethal Weapon,"" ""Speed,"" ""The Matrix,"" etc. Originality isn't one of Hollywood's strongest traits these days. <br/><br/>I'm the guy who's seen it all: Big explosions, car chases, over-exaggerated slow-motion stunts done with poorly-conceived visual effects. In short, I've seen just about everything there is to see in an action film.<br/><br/>
But here's a movie that made me sit back in my seat and stare in awe. It's hard to explain why, exactly, ""Face/Off"" works so very well. With a less talented director than John Woo behind the project, this could have turned into an undistinct, boring action flick with a poor idea and poor execution.<br/><br/>Woo makes the silly idea seem quite convincing. In fact, the plot reminds me of an Andrew Niccol movie--original, fun, and seriously flawed. But the flaws aren't explained and it's better that way. Nothing in ""Face/Off"" could ever be done with a few surgical incisions--but the movie doesn't care about that, and neither do we.<br/><br/>The movie is about two archenemies who switch faces. There's Sean Archer (John Travolta), an FBI agent/family man, and Caster Troy (Nicolas Cage). Archer is gruff and strict when it comes to his job; co-workers cower as they see him enter the room. When he is delivered a bottle of champagne after capturing Troy, he sends it away. The job isn't finished yet, so why should there be any celebrations?<br/><br/>Years ago, Troy tried to assassinate Archer but ended up killing his son, instead. For years, Archer has had a personal vendetta to bring down Troy--but it's been hard. Troy is a sly devil, and in the opening sequence, he is finally knocked out by Archer and sent to a maximum security hospital.<br/><br/>The problem is that prior to his capture, Troy planted a devastatingly powerful bomb inside a building somewhere in the city. The FBI can't figure out where it was hidden, and so Archer volunteers to follow through with a top-secret plan: He switches faces with Troy, so that he can be put in jail with Troy's brother, who helped him plant the bomb. After figuring out where it is, he can then return to his old face.<br/><br/>The switching of the faces is done with the type of cosmetic surgery that aging Hollywood beauties would love to have: The doctor and his team make incisions, pull off the two guys' faces, and then sow them onto each other. Then they take away body fat and put in some hair implants--everything to make the two guys look like each other.<br/><br/>Archer--with Troy's face--is sent to prison and collects the information from Troy's brother. But trouble arises, because before Archer can switch faces again, he finds out that tragedy struck the lab where everything was performed: The doctor is dead, and so are all the people who knew about the operation. The only person alive is Caster Troy--wearing Archer's face.<br/><br/>Left stranded in prison, with Troy posing as himself back on the outside (living with his family, playing FBI man), Archer (with Troy's face) escapes from prison and tries to warn his family about who is playing daddy. But it's hard to do, since his own wife thinks he's someone who killed their only son.<br/><br/>That's where the film really succeeds; it has some great ideas, and the very thought of becoming the man you hate and then being stuck in prison for your whole life, living out his life sentence, is gut-wrenching. When you first see Troy enter the prison with Archer's face and parade around in front of a chained Archer, it really makes you feel queasy.<br/><br/>This is an extravagant and amazing action film, and the last great John Woo movie ever made before he became a commercialized Hollywood hack (no offense, Woo, but ""Windtalkers"" sucked).<br/><br/>Cage and Travolta are great at playing each other--Travolta turns on the charm factor when he's imitating Cage, and Cage turns on the overwhelmed everyman as he's playing Travolta. Bad acting really could have harmed a film like ""Face/Off."" Here, it only makes an already excellent action movie even better.<br/><br/>4.5/5 stars.<br/><br/><ul><li>John Ulmer</li></ul>"

","Oh dear. F. Scott Fitzgerald once wrote that 'character IS action'. I wonder what he may have said on seeing this film? My suspicions were first aroused within the first 7 seconds of the film in which John Travolta is simpering on a fairground ride with a child with a haircut so bad that he simply had to be American. When the poor 'bowl cut' blighter was blown away by Nicholas Cage (with seemingly an enormous caterpillar on his upper lip), I began to think that I was in trouble. To say that these characters were one dimensional would be to insult, well, one dimension. They blunder around talking lines that truly no-one in the whole world would ever say outside of an action movie.<br/><br/>To think that John Woo has come to this, he made superlative action movies in Hong Kong but the rubbish that he makes in the US is in danger of making us forget all that. There are many of the trademark Woo incidents, people leaping diagonally through the air with a gun in each hand (and always in each hand, I wonder if it is a John Woo fantasy for us to discover a species which has 3 arms, my my, we would have a veritable arms race then!), gunfights in churches etc etc. The subtleties that do appear in his HK films are simply lost here under a welter of bullets, bad acting and a simply woeful script. Yes, some of the stunts are very good, but how many times can you see a stunt and be amazed, by and large they are merely variations on the same theme. Remove them and what are you left with? Really, really bad acting by John Travolta and a performance by Nicholas Cage that makes me think that he felt like buying a new swimming pool when this script turned up. I was little surprised by Travolta ('Battlefield Earth' anyone?) but could this really be the same Cage from 'Leaving Las Vegas'?.<br/><br/>Luckily the picture failed on my copy for the last 3 minutes so I was spared Travolta getting his own face back, re-uniting with his lovely (Doctor) wife, connecting with his once wild daughter and now taking over the upbringing of Cage's son (who incidentally also had a very bad, bowl type american brat haircut). If only i had lost the sound as well then maybe I wouldn't have been left wincing with utter agony as much as I did.<br/><br/>I only wish that I could give this utter trash -1000000000000000 let alone only 1.

Either that or everyone else drank a gallon of cough syrup before seeing the film.<br/><br/>The acting was horrible, the plot twists could be seen a mile away, and the ending dragged on for an eternity.  Getting beaten in the head while driving a speed boat is a little far fetched, only to leap back into action after a much-needed four seconds of rest.<br/><br/>Someone hits you in the head, you typically fall down.

This is my second favourite action movie after ""The Rock"". I'm a huge fan of Nicolas Cage. And Cage perfectly redeems that faith inside me. Every Cage movie for me seems to have the smartest punch-lines. This one again was no less.<br/><br/>Cage and Travolta do an exchange of faces(literally!) after the former, a high profile con-man falls prey to a super cop's(Travolta) vengeance who seeks to unveil the con-mans diabolical machinations. How they exchange faces is something that the movie alone can enunciate ! Both Cage and Travolta do an immensely pleasing job with their respective characters and even with the exchanged boots. One of the greatest action movie directors of our time, John Woo certainly needs no more labels. From the Learjet to the Oil Steamer, its quality action all way long.

I mean come on, we are supposed to believe that a face can be taken off one person and put on to another with out even leaving a scar? So let's say we can overlook that, now we shouldn't notice that they also must have switched hair lines and bodies. How stupid are we? Apparently stupid enough to believe that once again, the central people in this John Woo film can stand in front of a machine gun for as long as they like, and only come away with a few nicks and cuts. There is a line between good action and just plain dumb. Woo blows past that line and never looks back. The only good thing I can say about this film is that Travolta blows Cage's one dimensional butt off the screen. John does a very good job of creating two different people. Cage does not."
"hitchcockthelegend","10","5","9","16 January 2010"," It's like looking in a mirror, only, not.
","There's a tendency to undervalue the action movie. Certainly there's a wide expanse of land in cinema world where film fans reside, where the thought of praising an action film for being ""classic"" cinema is considered treason against the very word. Yet some of the artistry involved in the genre's leading lights is purely sublime, regardless of how bizarre and unlikely the plot is. Enter John Woo's berserker, ear splitting, high octane actioner, Face/Off. Rightly sitting along side the likes of Die Hard and Predator as genre pieces that showcase how good things can be when it all comes together, Woo's movie is as much fun as you could wish to have for over two hours of explosive, fantastical, unadulterated cinema.<br/><br/>The plot sees John Travolta's serious family man cop, Sean Archer, devote his life to catching unbalanced maniacal bad guy Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage). There's some bad history between the two and when Archer manages to capture both Troy and his equally vile brother, Pollux (Alessandro Nivola), it would seem to be closure for Archer and his family. However, it's found that the Troy's have left a ticking bomb somewhere in Los Angeles, and if undetected it will flatten L.A. and kill practically everyone. So, Archer undergoes a revolutionary face-swapping procedure with the now comatose Castor and sets about getting the information from the incarcerated Pollux. But wait!, Castor wakes up and turns the tables by assuming Archer's identity, setting the wheels in motion for each man to live the others life until the Face/Off between the pair will decide their respective fate.<br/><br/>Unbelievable? Of course. Who cares? Well nobody should really, because surely going into a film like this one is expecting the ludicrous. Both Cage and Travolta are superbly realising the spectacular nature of the script, and being mesmerising in the duality of the roles into the bargain. Make no bones about it, Woo and his team have crafted a benchmark action movie. There's a trail of thought that suggests that Woo basically keeps making the same movie, that's a fair enough point, sure enough, all of his staple action sequences and traits are evident in Face/Off. Yet Woo has delved into his characters, given them some flesh on their action bones, and then upped the anti in action set pieces to cloak them in chaotic beauty. From the opening Jet escape/pursuit set up, to the outrageous speed boat finale, the film is one long exhilarating breath taker. Joan Allen, Gina Gershon, Dominique Swain & Nick Cassavetes all file into the background playing important characters who are rightly secondary to the protagonists, while a ream of extras come and go as each are dispatched in a hail of Woo inspired carnage. The pace never sags and the eyes and ears are treated to a vibrancy that is often sadly missing from many other big budgeted action blockbusters.<br/><br/>This is a masterpiece of action cinema, so even as a Orson Welles crane shot is a magnificent thing, so it be with the sight of two stunt men flailing thru the air in a spray of exploding water. Oh yes sir, this is a classic alright. 10/10"

For those of you who haven't seen it I won't tell you anything else about the movie other than it was awesome. Its one of my favorite movies because of the story, the characters, the action, drama, suspense, and humor. John Travolta is fantastic as Sean Archer a determined FBI Agent and Nicolas Cage is equally impressive as his nemesis Castor Troy a psychopathic terrorist. The rest of the supporting cast including Joan Allen, Gina Gershon, Nick Cassavates, and Alessandro Nivola are excellent in their roles adding a lot to each of their characters in the movie. With plenty of action, drama, suspense, thrills, and powerhouse performances from both of it's lead actors (especially when their characters switch identities) you can't go wrong with a movie like Face Off.

I think Broken Arrow (1996) is much better action movie, I think it has a lot of better action sequences, the pacing is better, the characters are better. John Travolta's acting performance in Broken Arrow is over the top, but it seems more natural in Face/Off! Christian Slater is better than Nicolas Cage. Christian Slater is not the greatest actor in the world, but he is not over acting the point where I am laughing my ass off when I am watching an episode of Looney Tunes! <br/><br/>That is how I feel I hate this film and I think it has ridicules plot, ridicules premise and ridicules acting. Especially from Nicolas Cage, his Quotes: ""I'm ready, Ready for the big ride, BABY!"" Diiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!! Diiiiiiiieeeeee!!!!! It is stupid, the lines are ridiculous! The assassination of Sean Archer's 6.year old son the beginning scene is evil and lame. Cage touching a girl 's but in the church and treating women's like a piece of garbage I really hated that. Their first showdown between Travolta and Cage on the airport and Cage is singing it is really ridicules. Cage screaming like a girl I am Castor Troy and Diiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeeeeee are really hilarious Lol they are all funny ha ha.<br/><br/>Like is said as a kid Con Air introduced me in to The Rock and Face/Off my mom bought me those three films on VHS and as a kid i like this film as an adult I don't. Face/Off and Mission: Impossible II introduced me in to John Woo films, before that I didn't know the director.<br/><br/>More problems I have with this film: Nicolas Cage kills a 6 year old child with a fake mustache. Nicholas Cage kills a women, John Travolta want's to kill a child it is ridicules. Nicholas Cage is dressed as a priest and he is touching a girl's but in a church, what is wrong with this picture?! <br/><br/>Start's well John Travolta is the good guy FBI Agent, while Nicholas Cage is the bad guy, I like the beginning the way it was. Suddenly both of the actors change their roles which I don't like at all! I thought Travolta as the villain was the worst terrorist villain ever! <br/><br/>I haven't seen this movie over years on VHS so I bought a Blu-Ray watching this film on Blu-ray for the first time over the years as an adult I was seriously disappointed! I was bored out of my mind from this film! The movie was boring and I didn't see any spectacular action in this film at all! This is Nicolas Cage and John Travolta's worst acting performance ever. <br/><br/>Nicholas Cage is on drugs trough entire film and even for been a good/bad guy he is high and he is on drugs. I don't care for any of the characters in this film at all! I am sick of this film I think people love's it only because of action and it is the most overrated American action film that John Woo directed! I think their is a lot of people out there that don't like this film. I think this film is a time waster and a stinker!<br/><br/>The only action scene that I did like was the prison break escape when Nicolas Cage jumps of the cliff from prison in to a water. But again this escape makes no logical to me, how did Nicolas Cage saved him self when he jumped in to the see, when he was of shore miles away. I think it would took him days to save him self at all, when he didn't had any boat by him self, I even think he would drowned. <br/><br/>I don't see a point liking this film at all, I love Hard Target to death than this overrated trash! Broken Arrow is even way better film than this. John Travolta is way better in Broken Arrow than in here! <br/><br/>I enjoy Hard Target way more than this film, Hard Boiled, Broken Arrow, Paycheck and The Killer are one of my favorite John Woo films I rather watch those than Face/ Off! <br/><br/>The 'Over the Rainbow' crap is probably the worst gun play in the film ever made. Putting a kid during a shoot outs while playing the song 'Over the Rainbow' crap! I hate that scene because people keep dying in this movie, you see a woman been shoot to death from FBI Agents in a bar I really don't like this film. It's not his magnum opus like critics and fans would have you believe. Hard Target is my all-time favorite Woo film. I do think Broken Arrow is better than Face/Off, and I hated the Siskel & Ebert mind change. That seemed pointless to me, obviously he enjoyed it the first time or he wouldn't have been so adamant about a thumbs up.<br/><br/>Con Air (1997), The Rock (1996), National Treasure (2004), National Treasure: Book of Secrets (2007) and Gone in Sixty Seconds (2000) are all Nicolas Cage movies that are miles way better for me than this overrated trash! <br/><br/>John Woo films, that are MILES way better than Face/Off and they are all time classic for me: Hard Target (1993), Hard Boiled (1992), Broken Arrow (1996), Paycheck (2003) and The Killer (1989) are MILES way better films. I rather watch those films! <br/><br/>And yes, I have enjoyed Paycheck miles ways better, than I did this fake action film, rating for me is F 1/10."
"TheBigSick","Null","4","7","17 September 2017"," The best action film by the best action director
","This movie simply shows why John Woo is the top action director of the last three decades, who reshapes the Hong Kong cinema and highly influences the American cinema. <br/><br/>The action sequences are brilliant and well-choreographed as always. The plane chase in the first act, and the Mexican standoff and the speedboat chase in Act 4, are absolutely thrilling and astonishing. <br/><br/>John Travolta and Nicholas Cage both give their career-best performances, in the sense that each of them has to play the role of the other actor and that they superbly make it."
"Leofwine_draca","9","4","7","10 July 2016"," Action masterpiece from John Woo
","John Woo's third film made in America returns to the classy days of HARD TARGET after the dismal failure of BROKEN ARROW. Based on an outlandish premise (two people swap faces and identities), there is more plot here than other action films of our time. Thanks to some great acting, the action, when it comes, is all the better as it involves characters we care about.<br/><br/>Travolta and Cage relish the opportunity to play both bad guys and good guys, but Cage is definitely more at home in the role of a hero (his villainous turn at the beginning of the film is just too slimy and makes you feel like turning off). Cage proves himself as more than just an action man, and conveys brilliantly the feelings of a man trapped with a face that is not his own, and frequently is called to cry and show despair. On the other hand, Travolta gets to replay the same over the top, outlandish villain that he did in BROKEN ARROW, which borders on irritating yet for the most part is fun to watch. You can't deny that these two leads both deliver polished performances. The supporting cast is a good one too, with Joan Allen and Gina Gershon excelling themselves as partners caught up in the gunfire.<br/><br/>However, the action itself is the most important thing, and Woo outdoes himself here, from the opening shootout in an aircraft hangar to the wildly exciting, edge-of-your-seat speedboat chase at the film's finale. In between we have some poetic moments, epic battles staged to the tune of Somewhere Over the Rainbow, more bullets than you can shake a stick at, and plenty of adrenaline pumping instances such as Cage's escape from prison. Wonderful, and because I like it so much, I don't want to spoil anymore of it for you. Instead, go and watch it yourself."
"DarthVoorhees","9","4","7","25 August 2007"," A staple of the action genre
","When you add John Woo to a script as clever as this you know the finished product will be outstanding. The script is inspired beyond belief. It is a scary concept when you think about it and Woo uses this to his advantage.<br/><br/>The story here deserves as much praise as the fantastic action. This premise is so disturbing that this could have worked in more than one genre. It could have been a drama,horror or a cat and mouse thriller and it would have worked each time. Woo is able to have fun with the action but he creates a story with a real hero in it.<br/><br/>Sean Archer is one of the great action heroes. He isn't a John McClain or a Rambo, he's a real human being who went through hell. You feel great pain when he shows the wound that he wishes had killed him so his five year old son would have lived. When offered this bizarre assignment to save Los Angeles from destruction, he hesitates. Is it worth becoming the man who killed your son to save lives? He is torn psychologically. The best scene in the film is where he looks at a picture of his son through the face of the man who killed him.<br/><br/>Troy isn't a great villain but when he is shown against the very likable Archer we despise him. The scene where Troy and Archer meet up at the maximum security prison gives you chills.<br/><br/>I know a lot of people only really care about the action(Which is fantastic like all other John Woo films) but this story is what makes the movie not the action.<br/><br/>My only few complaints deal with how Troy is portrayed. He is a sadistic clown when he should be downright evil. The final battle between Troy and Archer draws out a little long too but we can forgive Woo for that.<br/><br/>Great picture,definitely pick up that new DVD of it."
"theshadow908","8","4","7","1 February 2007"," Awesome action film.
","Face/Off tells the story of an FBI agent named Sean Archer who is in charge of taking down a dangerous terrorist named Castor Troy. Troy is also responsible for the death of Archer's son 6 years earlier. When Archer puts Troy into a coma, he discovers that there is a bomb ticking somewhere, and only Troy's brother knows where it is. Archer decides to undergo a new surgery that transforms him into Castor Troy by taking Troy's face and putting it on his head so he can find out the location of the bomb. Unfortunately, Castor wakes from his coma and forces the doctors to turn him into Sean Archer. Now Castor Troy is living with Archer's family while Archer sits in jail. He must now figure out a way to escape and convince everybody that his is who he says he is, as well as take Castor Troy down once and for all. This is an amazing action movie that's loads of fun to watch.<br/><br/>First off, the plot of this movie is pretty cool. Originally it was meant to be set in the future, but I think the story would have been way to generic if it was. Thankfully they set it in the present day, and I think it really does the movie justice. Apart from having a really cool original story, the movie features some really awesome action sequences that for the most part are pretty believable, and for me, believable action sequences make an action movie so much better. I think there was a really good balance between actual story and the action, which is good.<br/><br/>The acting is very good in this film. This is a perfect film to show acting range. When it starts out John Travolta is the good cop and Nicholas Cage is the sadistic maniac, and then they suddenly switch roles, and it goes off perfectly. John Travolta plays Nicholas Cage playing a psycho really well, and Nicholas Cage does a good job of playing John Travolta playing a good cop. Truthfully, I liked Nicholas Cage better in the role of Sean Archer than John Travolta, and I'm happy that was the way it was through the majority of the movie rather than vice versa.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great piece of work from John Woo, a really fun and entertaining action film, actually a good film all around.<br/><br/>8/10"

","When i saw this movie, i thought it was just gonna another lame action movie like Mission Imposible 2. But then when i finished the movie, i was stunned on how this movie is great. It has great story and action in it. Travolta and Cage really did a good job on this movie and think this movie should be remembered like Die Hard. The movies action scene is fantastic, i mean the action never stops from beginning to the final part. It also had great effects on it where they took out the travolta's and cage's face.

","Where do we start? Magna boots in a secret prison? The institute for face changing? Cage vs Travolta? John Woo and his meaningless symbolism? How many doves can this guy film? The premise is ridiculous, the acting is horrible, and the direction is at best obnoxious. The one question that this movie poses is the following: If two men switch faces, can they die? Apparently at least one can, but it sure takes a whole lot of effort.I never laughed so hard at the movies. I literally fell out of my seat laughing at this film. Boy, was the floor dirty. The unintentional humor of this movie is the only redeeming quality. Cage and Travolta are the two worst actors out there, so it was enjoyable to watch them out-unact each other. Cage won, however, with his pathetic head shake in the prison escape, trying to cajole his fellow escapee from killing anymore prison guards. Easily one of the worst films in the history of Hollywood."
"efishman412","1","7","16","22 February 2007"," Oh my G-d, this movie is bad!!
","I am going to be brief with this one as there is not much to say about this spectacle of horrible, horrible, film-making. <br/><br/>The action in this so-called movie is so over-the-top, so ridiculous, that it makes you long for the gritty realism of Middle Earth. I fully expected Ents along with Harry Potter to fly out of nowhere on Aladdin's rug to join in the action in downtown L.A.<br/><br/>John Woo, for shame!! Although, it must be said that the dramatic moments in the film were somewhat well done. However, since they were bookended by such campy action so as to suck dry any momentum that resulted from them.<br/><br/>I would have forgiven this if THERE WAS EVEN A HINT OF A STORY HERE, but sadly, there isn't.

It has great action ,drama and romance. I would highly recommend to peoples who are keen on action films"
"seymourblack-1","8","3","5","7 August 2017"," Action All The Way
","The changing faces of good and evil add some extra layers of fun, mayhem and confusion to this exciting John Woo blockbuster which could best be described as ""action all the way"". Its plot anticipates a time when face transplants are able to be carried out quickly and easily without leaving unsightly scars and uses this premise to put a different spin on the long-established film noir preoccupation with issues of identity. It's also a story about obsession and revenge but overall its main focus is its numerous action sequences which are so skilfully conceived and perfectly executed that they elevate its various chases, shootouts and explosions etc. to a far higher level of excellence than can be seen in most films of this type.<br/><br/>Since he was injured and his 5-year old son was killed when a terrorist called Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage) tried to assassinate him six years ago, FBI Agent Sean Archer (John Travolta) has been obsessed with capturing his nemesis and bringing him to justice. The opportunity to do so arises when Sean and some members of his anti-terrorist team catch up with Castor and his brother Pollux (Alessandro Nivola) at Los Angeles International Airport. A chase follows which ends with Castor being apprehended and transferred to a high-security hospital where he remains in a coma with no expectation that he'll ever recover. When it comes to light that, shortly before being caught, Castor had planted a bomb with a nerve gas and biological payload that was powerful enough to flatten a square mile of L.A., urgent action becomes necessary to deal with the threat.<br/><br/>As Pollux Troy is the only person (other than the comatose Castor) who knows where the bomb is and wouldn't be prepared to discuss the information with anyone other than his brother, a special ops officer comes up with a proposal for Sean to go through a radical surgical procedure which would involve transplanting Castor's face onto Sean's skull so that, posing as Castor, Sean could elicit the information he needs from Pollux. Feeling that he has no real choice in the matter, Sean goes ahead with the surgery and looking identical to Castor is transferred to Erewhon Prison where he makes contact with Pollux and gets the information he needs.<br/><br/>A serious problem arises however, when Castor unexpectedly regains consciousness and with the help of some of his gang members, forces Sean's doctor to transplant Sean's face onto his own skull before proceeding to kill the doctor and every one of the small team who knew about Sean's top secret mission. Castor (looking like Sean) then goes on to exploit his new appearance by posing as Sean at his workplace and in his home whilst Sean is left in a tight spot until he starts a riot and escapes from prison so that he can hunt down Castor Troy one last time.<br/><br/>One of the major benefits of this movie's far-fetched plot is that it affords John Travolta and Nicolas Cage the opportunities to turn in a couple of great performances because as well as their action work, they both do brilliantly at establishing their own characters before going on to adopt each other's characteristics, in order to make their identity swaps seem credible. The fact that they both meet the demands of their roles so comprehensively, whilst also appearing to have such a lot of fun in the process, makes their contributions both tremendously accomplished and highly entertaining to watch.<br/><br/>Sean Archer's quest for revenge took over his life for 6 years during which all his important relationships suffered and Joan Allen and Dominique Swain give a couple of fine supporting performances as his long-suffering wife and daughter.<br/><br/>""Face/Off"" begins brightly with some breathtaking action that includes an assassination attempt, a game of chicken (involving a helicopter and a plane) and a spectacular crash (when a plane flies into a hangar) and all of this takes place so rapidly and amongst various chases and bursts of gunfire, that it's impossible not to be impressed. Numerous other action sequences such as the tense prison escape, an astonishing shootout at Castor Troy's headquarters and the speedboat chase that provides the movie with its finale, are also highly impressive. ""Face/Off"" is a lot of fun and deserves recognition for its exhilarating action, its technical brilliance and the entertaining way in which it succeeds in doing exactly what it set out to do."
"IM_d_BS","8","3","5","31 October 2016"," Insane
","Quite possibly the most insane movie ever made. Words cannot describe the chaos that reigns in this movie. It's a movie that's good at what it's doing, but I have no idea what this movie is doing. Action is taken to such a ridiculous level that the opening sequence would easily be the finale of most normal action movies. No brakes. Nothing subtle. The acting is so far over the top it begins to mock itself in it's own twisted reality warping psychosis. Direction? Is some mutant offspring of Japanese anime and American 80's action? I think. So may insane things happen so suddenly and without logic, and you have no time to process any of it. You just yell ""what!?"" at the screen over and over again. Story? Plot? Backstory? Logical development? Shut up nerd! No time for that! Here's even more action! Go ahead ask someone to explain what you just saw... too late! This other random thing just happened. This is Face/Off. Deal with it."
"The Grand Master","9","3","5","8 August 2016"," A cracking over the top action/thriller that is still enjoyable almost 20 years later.
","Face/Off utilizes a very original story that is made even more enjoyable with over the top action and crackling one liners. John Travolta and Nicolas Cage make a great pairing as the respective hero and villain who both share the role throughout the movie. Director John Woo who is well known for his non-stop kinetic action sequences has done an excellent job with one of the biggest mega blockbusters of 1997.<br/><br/>The movie starts with freelance terrorist Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage) attempting to assassinate FBI agent Sean Archer (John Travolta). Though Sean survives the gunshot, his son Michael is accidentally killed. Six years later, the grief stricken Sean Archer has dedicated everything to take down his sworn enemy Castor Troy. Following a breakthrough in which the FBI and the LAPD converge on the Los Angeles International Airport to intercept Castor Troy and his brother Pollux, a gunfight ensues which sees a number of FBI agents killed, Pollux arrested, and Castor knocked into a coma but not before taunting Sean that he has a bomb somewhere that will wipe out all of Los Angeles. At the urging of his partner Tito Biondi (Robert Wisdom), Archer secretly undergoes a highly experimental face transplant procedure by Dr. Malcolm Walsh (Colm Feore) and Dr. Miller (C.C.H Pounder) to take on Castor's face and appearance including a special voice box to sound like his arch enemy. Sean/Castor is taken undercover to a maximum security prison to obtain the location of the whereabouts of the bomb from his brother Pollux who is also in the same prison. The mission appears to go smoothly until Castor Troy awakens from his coma and adopts Sean Archer's face and appearance. Unbeknownst to Sean's long suffering wife Eve (Joan Allen) and his rebellious daughter Jamie (Dominique Swain), Castor/Sean integrates himself into their lives and his FBI colleagues who now see him as a public hero are none the wiser. Sean/Castor must fight his way to take down Castor/Sean once and for all and to regain his own identity back.<br/><br/>John Travolta and Nicolas Cage are both brilliantly cast as the hero and villain who both adopt each other's identities. You can tell the difference between the intense Sean Archer and the flamboyant Castor Troy and when the roles are reversed.<br/><br/>John Woo who made his mark in Hong Kong with action classics such as The Killer (1989) and Hard Boiled (1992) and exploded onto the Hollywood scene with Hard Target (1993) continues to trail blaze through Hollywood with this mega hit.<br/><br/>It's hard to believe that Face/Off is almost 20 years old but like a fine wine, this over the top action/thriller is still an enjoyable classic over time and to this day is still recognised as one of the finest action movies of the 90's.<br/><br/>9/10."

","Face Off (1997): Dir: John Woo / Cast: John Travolta, Nicolas Cage, Joan Allen, Gina Gershon, Nick Cassavetes: Clever and exhilarating action film advertising two individuals whose faces are removed but the title really references a battle of wills. It stars John Travolta as agent Sean Archer and Nicolas Cage as terrorist Castor Troy. Archer's son is killed when Troy makes an attempt on his life. When he captures Troy unconscious it is learned that a bomb exits in the city and that Troy's brother knows the location. Archer will don Troy's face through a surgical procedure to gain information but Troy gains consciousness and dons Archer's face thus retaliates in the same manner. Action is exhilarating and extremely violent but John Woo is skilled and create better ideas than he had with Broken Arrow. Travolta and Cage are brilliant. Archer is placed within a circumstance where he may have to damage his own body to bring justice. Troy is a great villain whom takes credit for Archer's work and takes advantage of his family. Joan Allen as Archer's wife will have to face harsh realities yet reap the benefits in the end. Gina Gershon as Troy's girlfriend is honorable yet needs Archer to hold a promise. Nick Cassavetes holds a key role as a criminal in the joint. Theme of physical identity is strong particularly when Archer may have to sacrifice his own. Score: 9 / 10"

","For a moment, picture yourself going to a movie, to relax and feeling good and just escape. Now you get through the double doors after getting your tickets and you sit down. You see fifty-seven movie pre-views before your movie starts, then the movie 'Face off' starts to play. You're happy and getting comfortable. Now, if you have seen this feature, you need to be completely honest. Even when you wanted escapism, say pure escapism, this Travolta Cage and WOo picture starts to pick up speed, way too fast and far, far too unbelievably. I know there are people who will disagree, I could really care less. There are too many movies out there that can fit the bill without pretty much slapping you in the face. This was not like a cold water rushing thrill ride as much as it is a full on frontal assault on your sense of creative intelligence. Face-Off is go, go, go but no, no show! I mean with a great cast, a poorly written action-drama, that falls flat. It made a good amount of money in the theaters no doubt about that. But then look at the voting public at large, look at some of the presidents 'voted' in by the public and think 'Okay, well just because there is a lot of money in something or with someone, it doesn't mean that it's good, or right. <br/><br/>Alright, take for example, so many John WoO movies feature the ballet dance numbers for that wondrous 'flowing' effect. In large part in many of his features that has played out well...in this case it just got played, 'Off'. Honestly now, Olivia Newton John? In the middle of a 100-200 round per minute fire fight?? This isn't escape anymore it might as well be Barney the purple dinosaur, in action. There could be so many other tracks that they could have scored to this intense section of the movie, but they decided that Ms. John was the one. The truth is, I love Olivia, I always have. In this case for me and many others it was just wrong. <br/><br/>The rest of this was a parade of mindless, ballet flowing dance move poorly scripted over commercialized crap, in a cinema setting. The camera shots were over done as well as the acting and thus the believability was swapped out for a heavy on image and nodda on intelligent film making. Although I have to ad that the color and camera lens filters were outstanding!! Outstanding. No lying there.<br/><br/>And with all of WoO's talents he couldn't have set this up and executed the story without literally executing this story? The concept is interesting, it has a heart beat, and that makes that escapism is the story line, but how it was done lacked, and lacked big time. I wish I could have helped rewrite and direct this film. Oh well. (*)<br/><br/>Not recommended for the real discriminating action film buff."
"philip_vanderveken","7","3","5","23 February 2005"," A very nice action movie with plenty of breathtaking moments
","It's been a while since I've had some good fun with an action movie that didn't annoy me too much for I don't know what reasons. And I have to admit: even though it didn't have the strongest start, ""Face/Off"" gave me a very good time thanks to the very good acting from John Travolta and Nicholas Cage and the interesting directing and camera work by John Woo.<br/><br/>Sean Archer (Travolta) is an FBI agent who has been chasing Caster Troy (Cage) for six years. He has been chasing Troy for six years, because Troy tried to shoot Archer and was able to hit him, but ended up killing Archer's son instead. When Archer finally succeeds in apprehending Troy, Troy tells him that, even though Archer arrests him, he has lost anyway, because Troy has planted a bomb somewhere. First they are convinced that he's bluffing, but when they arrest Troy's brother Pollux, they find out he was telling the truth and that there is a biological bomb somewhere. To find out where exactly, Archer will have to do something that has never been done before. Because Caster got in a deep coma and his fellows (who are all in jail now) think he's dead, Archer will take over his face. Thanks to some experimental cosmetic surgery, doctors are able to peel of Troy's face and put it on Archer's head. Archer, who now looks like Troy, goes to the jail, tries to find out everything about the bomb by questioning ""his"" accomplices, but of course something goes wrong. Troy awakes from his coma, takes over Archer's face (which was being preserved for the duration of the mission) and takes over Archer's life...<br/><br/>In the beginning, the movie isn't all that excellent. Only when both men have switched faces and identity, the real fun starts, reaching a climax during the last 45 minutes. Then there is plenty of action in the movie and often John Woo has portrayed it in a very original and spectacular way. But the real stars of this movie are Nicholas Cage and John Travolta. In the beginning of the movie I thought they weren't exactly casted perfectly. I thought it would be better for Cage to play the FBI agent and Travolta the terrorist (I didn't know yet what was to come), and was very pleased to see them play each other afterwards. It's very clear that they had a lot of fun doing that, which is very positive for the movie.<br/><br/>All in all this was one of the best action movies I've seen lately. And despite the fact that the beginning wasn't the strongest, I still had some great fun with it. That's why I give it a 7/10, perhaps even a 7.5/10"
"ChrisTreborn","10","3","5","14 February 2005"," "" The Modern Classic ""
","Like I said, it's a classic, a modern classic. A great action movie that combines the Asian themes in American style. I doubt when would we see another action movie as excellent as Face/Off. A film that brilliantly blends action and plot in an equalized harmony.<br/><br/>Face/Off (Spoilers******)<br/><br/>Directed by acclaimed Honk Kong director John Woo who famous for his artistic violent and action sequences brings this complicated story about Human identity. This revolutionary action/sci-fi story was written by Mike Werb and Michael Colleary. It was originally set in the future and marked to be the first action vehicle for the two BOX OFFICE HEAVY WEIGHTS ARNOLD and STALLONE to star together. But it was later altered, the sci-fi element was changed into the present time and the casting was redone after Woo approached the film.<br/><br/>Six years ago the terrorist Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage) attempted to kill Sean Archer (John Travolta), a vengeful FBI agent and it resulted in the brutal murder of Archer's young son. Since then the hunt for Troy has not only been a part of Archer's job, it's also been personal. <br/><br/>Now, finally and after the loss of many men, Archer takes Troy in custody by knocking him into a coma. Archer's quest then ended but with a new turn, he learns of a biochemical bomb that Troy has planted somewhere in downtown L.A. How can Archer possibly locate the bomb and prevent it from taking out an entire city street?<br/><br/>With Troy in a coma and his cohorts unwilling to talk, Archer is convinced by his colleagues that there's only one way to uncover Troy's plan--Archer must become Troy.<br/><br/>Through supreme, state of the art surgery, Archer can assume the actual face of the now comatose Castor Troy, go undercover in prison where Troy's brother (Allesandro Nivola) is being held, and gain information from him. Archer disagrees with this plan, especially wearing the face of the man who killed his son. But someone has to take that step, someone who knows everything about Troy and the only man who knows him better was Archer and thus he agrees to the assignment, and transformed into Castor Troy himself and went for the mission. <br/><br/>Unfortunately in the police lab, the real Castor Troy awakes from his coma, shocked to find that what they have done with his face. That makes him to take the face of Archer, destroying the police lab, killing the authorities and all evidence that proves who Archer really is. Thus in this side the terrorist is now the FBI man, and decides to mess up everything in a new form!<br/><br/>The rest of the story was just amazing-mind blowing. When we see each transformed character on the screen we just immerse in the swapped character portrayal of each, rather than the two different actors who play them. Travolta and Cage did a tremendous work by copying off each others acting style and mannerisms which all makes it a more interesting and thrilling chapter. They just heavenly live on each body, as villain and as hero, forcing the audience to constantly pay attention not only to the face they see on screen, but the personality underneath it.<br/><br/>And all the credit goes to brilliance of John Woo. An emotionally complicated story of two different persons as each character struggles with their own identities when the boundaries between ""the good guy"" and ""the bad guy"" become blurred. It was his idea to cast John Travolta and Nicolas Cage for those challenging role which was originally intended for Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone in a futuristic world sci-fi thriller.<br/><br/>John Woo covered that sci-fi story sides with a more human touch. That makes the movie a better intriguing psychological thriller, than a usual action flick. He combined the original plot with his talented story telling styles in an American way. <br/><br/>His trademarks the slow-motion, firing guns, flying doves, business suite with sun glass all match up with the story. My favorite scene is (Cage) Troy praying in the church before the final shootout.<br/><br/>A great touching movie beyond that of a usual action flick.I give this movie 10 out of 10!<br/><br/>Face/Off = FACE DOWN."
"Sfpsycho415","10","3","5","23 December 2004"," The best action film of all time!----10/10
","Action movies are one of my very favorite genres. The excitement in them is unmatched, and the heroes and villains at the heart of them are so darn cool. Well, this goes for the great action movies anyway, most of which came out between 1987 and 1997, a ten year period i like to call, ""The Action Movie Revolution"". It started with Lethal Weapon. It went on to include such classics as Die Hard, Bad Boys, the Rock, and Con Air. And it ended with Face/Off.<br/><br/>John Woo's Face/Off has to be, in my opinion, the best action movie ever made. The action is non-stop, cool and original. The story line is one of a kind, with a hint of science fiction, but true to it's action origins. And the two leads, John Travolta and Nicolas Cage pull of some incredible movie magic by transforming from good to evil and back again with amazing convincement.<br/><br/>When the movie starts, John Travolta plays Sean Archer, an FBI agent who is trailing the terrorist that killed his son. Nicolas Cage plays said terrorist, Castor Troy, a diabolical killer with a taste for women and Chicklets. But after supposedly killing Troy, Archer goes under a cutting edge surgery (no pun intended) to transform into Troy (even putting in a phony voicebox that produces his rival's voice) to infiltrate his organization and take down his buddies in crime. But soon afterward, the real Troy, who was being kept alive long enough to preserve his face, awakens and forces the doctors to turn him into Archer. So now it's Travolta playing Troy playing Archer, and Cage playing Archer playing Troy.<br/><br/>If this sounds like a horrible, convoluted storyline, it's because it is. But when it is on screen, it makes more sense. Not to mention it is surrounded by a tons of awesome shootouts directed by action master Woo, a wicked speedboat chase, an amazing cast of top-notch actors, and a great soundtrack. This is the last great action movie and nothing after it has come close. That's why we should give the CGI a rest and get back to blowing s**t up the right way. 10/10"
"Boba_Fett1138","10","3","5","12 September 2003"," Action movies don't get any better then this.
","Is ""Face/Off"" the best action movie ever made? In my opinion it is.<br/><br/>There are lot's of elements that make ""Face/Off"" different and better from other action movies. The Woo-ism is most definitely one of those elements. With Woo-ism I mean the special style John Woo always uses in his movies. Trademark John Woo style is the use of slow motion. The use of it is perfect and never overused, it certainly adds to the atmosphere and contributes to the perfectionism of the movie.<br/><br/>The story itself is just too ridiculous for words (even though face transplants have recently become possible) but somehow the story becomes believable. Maybe it's because of the directing or maybe it's because of the acting or maybe it's because of both. That another thing that's different from other action action movies: The acting. The cast is perfect and not just some 2nd class action star Rambo-Wannabee actors. The cast is full with big names, but the ones that steal the show are John Travolta and Nicolas Cage, they imitate each other perfect. It's certainly Nicolas Cage's best role till date.<br/><br/>Another great element is of course the action itself. The actions is superb and very cool! There are some really memorable scene's with of course the famous mirror scene as one of them. (Even though John Woo used it before in one of his lesser known movies; ""Hard Target"" with Jean-Claude Van Damme)<br/><br/>John Powell's musical score also adds to the movie and so does the cinematography from Oliver Wood and the editing from Steven Kemper and Christian Wagner.<br/><br/>I can't really name one bad thing about this movie. Everything is simply perfect, the directing, the acting, the story the sub-plots, the characters the dialog. Everything feels right!<br/><br/>Not just an average action movie.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

"nims-1975","10","2","3","22 September 2018"," Tense awesome action and excellent acting by Travolta and Cage
","Face/Off is an absolutely brilliant thriller by director John Woo and which has excellent acting by John Travolta and Nicolas Cage. This film is an action packed film, full of hard, tense action and is a film which was very enjoyable to watch and is a film which I also loved watching. The acting by John Travolta as Sean Archer, Nicolas Cage as Castor Troy, Joan Allen as Eve Archer, Alessandro Nivola as Pollux Troy, Gina Gershon as Sasha Hassler and Dominique Swain as Jamie Archer was absolutely brilliant. I haven't seen many John Travolta films and only have 2 of his films on DVD, 1) Grease, 2) Face/Off, but besides Grease this film was awesome and Travoltas acting as Sean Archer was absolutely brilliant. Nicolas Cages acting as Castor Troy was also absolutely brilliant and I loved watching the controversy between Sean Archer and Castor Troy. Face/Off really had lots of great things about it and was a tense psychological thriller which involved Sean Archer having to go through facial surgery to become Castor Troy and for Castor Troy to become Sean Archer which caused confusion and tension amongst others including Sean Archers wife and daughter. The real Sean Archer who was Castor Troy was a more calmer man towards Eve and Jamie Archer, but the real Castor Troy was a more evil and too over the top man towards Eve and Jamie and had to be killed by the real Sean Archer. Face/Off is a thriller that I definitely recommend and it is a thriller that you're going to love if you haven't seen it."
"ElMaruecan82","8","2","3","24 April 2014"," Like looking in the mirror...
","Well, let's face it, for all its (over)use of cases, shootouts and stunts as spectacular as they're formulaic, ""Face/Off"" is more than your average show-off action-packed thriller. The film stands off above all its peers thanks to one simple but genius premise, so creative and incongruous, you've got to wonder how come they waited till Cinema was 100 years to think about having the hero and the villain switching their faces, and see where this is getting, not that it would have required many special effects, right? <br/><br/>I can imagine, not without excitement, the brainstorm that lead to the plot genesis: the two guys have to hate each other, the villain isn't just the antagonist, he's the hero's nemesis, so a cop and a criminal isn't enough, how about making it personal like say, the bad guy accidentally kills the hero's son, the hero's got a reason to hate him and apparently the villain seems to hold some serious grieves against him, that's for the reciprocity. What next? Well, how about the big question, why would they switch the faces? Well, because the hero will have to pass as the bad guy to know a secret, what kind of secret, the kind of emergency life-and-death secrets, a code of some sort bingo, a bomb.<br/><br/>Now, we need someone the bad guy trusts blindly, let's give him a brother and while you're at it, give them some kind of legendary pairing names, Achilles and Ajax, Romulus and Remus or Castor and Pollux we progress. So, suppose they take Castor's face and implant it on the hero, let's call him Sean (like John but more original), everyone would know? No, it has to be a secret mission to ensure its success. Wait; will Castor remain face-less? Of course not, this is where it's getting tricky. Suppose he wakes up, he discovers the plan and ask the doctors to implant Sean's face on his before getting rid of them. Wow, talk about the perfect set-up, I can only imagine the first face-to-face between the two guys. Now, we've got our first 'great and memorable moment'.<br/><br/>And the creative implications of the film are countless, the immersion of the criminal within the very family he dispossessed from one son, his luscious looks on 'his' own daughter, or the bad guy having to team up with criminals. But wait, how about the initial motive, the bomb and all that stuff? Well this is the icing on the cake, Castor tells his brother who he is, he discards the bomb and he's the town hero. Now I'm sure it didn't take more than an hour to get the spine of the film and this is not to diminish its merit, but to highlight the positive effects of inventiveness. All it takes is one hell of an idea and the rest is only coverage, the writing, the spectacular effects, all the most significant departments of film-making are involved, on the top of them: acting.<br/><br/>It goes without saying that the film couldn't have existed if Castor was played by Danny De Vito and Sean by Arnold Schwarzenegger, although the premise of a spoof-remake would be hilarious. So they needed two actors of the same size shape and caliber, well, I guess they got it right with John Travolta and Nicholas Cage, two of the most bankable actors of the 90's, fittingly blue-eyed, hairy-chested and equally tall and strong. Well, of course, the suspension of disbelief asks more from us. Many persons would point out the possibility of the cop's wife to notice some differences in some specific parts of their husbands' anatomy. Although, it's not improbable that in the heat of the passion, a woman wouldn't notice, but then how about the hands, feet, well, it asks a lot but let's not to be too technical.<br/><br/>Indeed, one of the film's strengths is not to focus too much on the scientific material, ""Face/Off"" could easily be labeled as Sci-fi movie, but it focuses more on the change of personalities and the way too men who hate each other, learn to live in another skin. It's an insightful examination of the eternal correlation between what we are and how we look, and that the whole 'don't look at me' can't work in real life. I have one scene in mind right now, when the daughter helps Castor because she simply can't believe he is not her father. But I got so carried away by those details that I forgot I had to talk about the acting, which is the little spice the film provided, for our greatest delight, and for both Travolta and Cage who certainly took it as an extraordinary challenge.<br/><br/>I recently suggested a poll asking which of the two actors gave the better performance as the other's character. Now, I realize it's an unfair question, because the two actors didn't try to impersonate each other, not quite. They played their personal version of good guys and villains, and made them match. Nicholas Cage has a unique way to make his eye bulge and look demonically frightening while Travolta puts it all in that devilish smile and menacing eyes, obviously with Travolta's face, you can't mimic expression made possible with Cage's. But Cage has also an extraordinary capacity to look sad and sensitive, it's all in the eyes again  and Travolta's puts it in the smile, and it works again. I rooted for Cage as a good guy equally as for Travolta and thought they were charismatic as bad guys.<br/><br/>""Face-Off"" might be labeled as an action pop-corn movie but its power and awesomeness lies on the fact that it didn't take Woo's directing skills (indeed, it's spectacular from A to Z) for granted but involve everything that makes movies worth to watch, and naturally, it didn't make the unforgivable mistake to deprive us from a mirror-scene."

","Hey, guys! This is not a chick-flick movie and for sure you're not going to say, ""It's lame, so boring!"" Face/off is a hardcore, breath-taking; action, crime, thriller movie directed by John Woo in 1997. John Woo is known for Mission Impossible II with Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt. I love this movie; it's one of Nicolas Cage's movies I've ever watched aside from Con Air. This movie is all about this tough federal bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent, Sean Archer (John Travolta), who has been chasing to seize Caster Troy (Nicolas cage), the terrorist who has no conscience, mastermind behind bombings, assassinations, murder, kidnapping and the most dangerous and most brilliant criminal. John Travolta and his team found a way to capture Caster Troy (Nicolas Cage) through this black bag operation, but nobody should ever know about this suicidal operation, not even Sean Archer's wife, Dr. Eve Archer (Joan Allen). It's a plastic surgery procedure at Walsh Institute supervised by Dr. Walsh. The procedure will remove and switch each other's face. Meaning John Travolta will be Nicolas Cage and vice versa. Nicolas Cage planted a bomb at the L.A. Convention that only he and his brother Pollux Troy (Alessandro Nivola), know and the government is trying to figure out where this bomb is at. Meanwhile, after Caster Troy and his brother's police encounter at the private plane port, a plane's exhaust running hot, hit Caster Troy's body towards a huge screen vents which made him suffer comatose, but they caught Pollux Troy. FBI agents tried to interrogate people related to Caster Troy to find out the location of the bomb. Sean Archer even threat Sasha (Gina Gershon), Troy's girlfriend, that if she will not tell the truth, he'll take away her child. Sasha's brother asked Archer about his dead son, he's convince that Troy annihilate his son. Now, Sean Archer doesn't have any choice, but to say yes to their secluded mission. Agent Hollis convinced Sean Archer to do it, since Caster Troy is a turnip and he is the only one who can deactivate the bomb and besides, this will be the only way penalize and emplace Caster Troy behind bars from killing his loving son, Michael. Sean Archer went home to see his wife and daughter Jaime before the operation, he said, ""I'll be gone for a while;"" and promised that it will be the last and he will definite spend more time with his family. Sean Archer wished to Dr. Walsh; to put his gun shot scar back on his chest because it reminds him of his son, and gave Tito (FBI agent), his wedding ring; they've trimmed Archer's hair and planted a microchip into his larynx to duplicate Troy's voice. Archer didn't like wearing his enemy's face, he abruptly became violent, threw hospital mirror scintillating, cussed and swear everyone and cried, and knowing the next move is to lift him to Arrow One prison. There Archer is a citizen of nowhere, wearing a pair of boots made of metal, locked down on the floor surrounded by a ground full of magnetic field so, there's no way to escape. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, at the Walsh Institute where they kept Caster Troy, he miraculously woke up from coma; removed his bandage and felt blood on his face. He called his friend with a husky, shaking, voice and told him that someone took his face off with a help of a doctor and two FBI agents. They abduct Dr. Walsh and the other two agents behind the operation, tied them up, poured gasoline on them and burnt them alive together with the evidences that will prove Sean Archer's real personality. In the Arrow One prison, Sean Archer got a visitor—it's Caster Troy wearing his face and wedding ring, laughing crazy on how their mission failed and told Sean Archer (Troy's face), ""I've got a government job to abuse and a wife to f***! Isn't that amazing?"" teasing and making him mad. Archer's now finding out how to escape Arrow One prison to tell his wife Eve that he's Sean Archer. <br/><br/>Face/Off is a great, action packed movie, tons of enigmatic scenes and stunts, big actors involved, with 7.3 stars, received lots of awards, a MUST watch movie."

","Face/Off starts in Los Angeles where international terrorist & all round bad guy Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage) has just planted a huge bomb at an exhibition center that will has the potential to kill thousands, however special ops agent Sean Archer (John Travolta) & his team have been tracking Troy for years & after a lead comes good they discover that Troy is about to take off in a private jet. Archer & his team get there in time & stop Troy from leaving Los Angeles but Troy is badly injured in a shoot-out & ends up in a coma. On a computer disk found on Troy there are plans for the bomb & Archer know's that Troy has planted it somewhere. The only other person who would know where the bomb is happens to be Troy's brother Pollux (Alessandro Nivola) but he obviously won't talk to Archer or the authorities so in an elaborate plan to fool Pollux into revealing the location of the bomb cutting edge medical procedures are used to surgically attach Troy's face onto Archer but the plan goes awry when Troy wakes up from his coma & has Archer's face surgically attached & takes over his life as the real Archer is trapped in prison as everyone thinks he's the real Castor Troy...<br/><br/>Directed by John Woo this was originally released back in 1997 & I saw it around that time when it came out on DVD & since then I hadn't seen it again until last night & I have to confess that I was rather disappointed with Face/Off & it's one of those films that is nowhere near as good as I remember it. I guess when we are younger we are more easily pleased & the two impressive action scenes which bookend the film are most people's overriding memory of Face/Off which conceals the fact that the hour & a half between those two sequences in my opinion is rather dry & boring. The script features the usual Woo trademarks of honour, revenge, trust, loss & flying doves but I must admit I found it all a bit pedestrian. The initial shoot-out at the airport & the switching of faces is neat & pacey but after that the films slows right down as the drama kicks in & in a film with a fairly silly premise serious drama just doesn't quite work. The basic idea of having the hero & villain swap identities to the extent where they assume each other's lives & what effect that has on them is amusing for a short time but it wears thin pretty quickly as you count down the minutes the inevitable showdown between the two. Having said that the film is perfectly entertaining & has a few excellent stand-out action set-pieces that really stay in the memory.<br/><br/>The film has some very impressive action scenes & they are stylishly shot with an actual steadicam you we can actually see what's going on! The violence is moderate consisting of mostly shoot-outs but they are choreographed with flair & panache. The science involved in the face transplant scenes is total nonsense & didn't sit well with me, what about Castor's teeth? Did they take all of Archer's own teeth out & replace them? You really do have to suspend your disbelief & just about everything you know about medical science to believe the procedures on show here & that's a big problem, since you don't believe it the film never quite recovers or works as it is intended. Apparently Face/Off was going to be set in the future but it was changed to the present & I definitely think the story as a whole would have been a lot more plausible set at some point in the near future.<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $80,000,000 this actually turned a profit which slightly surprises me, to be honest eighty big ones sounds like a lot of money to me & apart from the opening & closing action scenes I am not quite sure where it all went although Travolta was paid apparently paid a cool $15,000,000 while Cage got a more modest yet still not bad $6,000,000 so that's over twenty million of the budget gone already. The acting is alright, Travolta puts in a good performance while Cage less so.<br/><br/>Face/Off is a film you will remember for several excellent action set-pieces that stay in the memory much longer than the sub standard soap opera drama that passes for much of the middle ninety minutes.

","When Sean Archer (as Castor Troy) carefully put the walkman head set over little Adam's ears and the roars of gunfire, violence and death were overcome by ""Somewhere Over The Rainbow"", my emotion for ""Face/Off"" was confirmed.  It was the single greatest action film ever made mainly because it was so much more.  Its drama within its action is more compelling than any other action film.<br/><br/>The film is driven by two strong performances by Travolta and Cage and helmed by the best action director in the business, John Woo.  The originality of the story goes way beyond the usual bad vs. good storyline. The premise of good becoming bad and vise versa is thought-provoking and has incredible possibilities, all of which are exploited beautifully within this film.  Imagine the repercussions of taking on the identity of your greatest nemesis and your son's murderer.  Looking in the mirror and seeing everything you have come to hate.  Knowing that your worst enemy in sleeping with your wife and comforting your daughter.  Everyone you trust wants you dead and everyone you hate wants to help.  A story with elements such as these has already gone well beyond all action films to date by examining the nature of good and evil and there co-existence rather than showing them. What comes next meets the all expectations of the story.<br/><br/>With action sequences that leave you breathless and always move the story forward, with characters that you really come to care for or really come to hate, and with a level of entertainment which is off the existing charts. The film makes you think, the film lets you let yourself go and it takes action films to a new zenith - one that will now be very difficult to duplicate."

","This movie is nothing short of spectacular. Not only do the main characters exchange identies, they exchange several thousand rounds of gunfire. Many of the action scenes make most modern action films anemic by comparison. From an airport shoot-out to a dazzlying speedboat chase, the action and violence never lets up. I will admit that the plot may seem implausible, but that helps keep the audience occupied with the movie's action scenes and convincing performances. Overall, if you are looking for a top-notch action film, Face/Off will be your best bet."
"SKG-2","10","2","3","19 February 1999"," Best American action movie ever
","The reason why I like John Woo's Chinese films(what I've seen, anyway; ""The Killer"", ""Once a Thief"", ""Hard-Boiled"") and dislike most American action films by comparison (or even not by comparison) is they feel like they were made by a human being, while American action films feel like they were ground out by a machine.  Woo films have plots which, while they may be implausible, are worth following, characters to care about, actors who get involved, and oh yes, spellbinding action.  Whereas American action films, except the few good ones, have stupid plots, monoliths as heroes, terrible dialogue, cardboard characters, and just one blowup scene after another.<br/><br/>In ""Hard Target"" and ""Broken Arrow"", Woo had moments, but you could sense him being hemmed in by Hollywood.  With ""Face/Off"", he finally gets to cut loose. Sure the story is implausible, but you don't think about it while you're watching it, because you're so caught up in it.  And unlike Hollywood action films, where you don't care about who gets killed because neither do the characters, here you do care.  Woo has said in interviews how much he liked old Hollywood musicals, and he choreographs his films like them.  ""Hard Target"" and Broken Arrow"" didn't feel like that, but this one does.  And in Travolta and Cage, he has actors perfectly suited not only to his action flair, but also the operatic storyline.<br/><br/>Travolta was flat as the bad guy in ""Broken Arrow"", but here he gets to bring out his gift for parody, and he's quite enjoyable (and gets the film's best line; ""Lies, mistrust, mixed messages; this is turning into a real marriage"").  He's also good as Archer.  The real story here, though, is Cage.  He's great as the bad guy, but when he's called on to provide the emotional heart of the film, he does it in spades, especially in the scene where he's Archer wearing Castor Troy's face for the first time.  The other actors are all good as well.  I hope American action filmmakers learn from this film and make more movies like this."

Travolta and Cage make a marvelous team. They give their characters (who are in very unique and sometimes unbelievable situations) great dramatic flair. Cage's performance is yet another showcasing of his Oscar-caliber talent.<br/><br/>With an adrenaline-injected and haunting musical score from Hans Zimmer protege, John Powell, and action sequences that have John Woo written all over them, you really can't go wrong.

Yet, it was always willing to pause momentarily, to appreciate the artistic beauty and color of a scene, or to relish the drama of a slow-motion shot.<br/><br/>""Face/Off"" is simply the best film I've seen in a long time.

Face/Off has a few spectacular action scenes (even that much-maligned boat chase is better than anything I've seen a Jerry Bruckheimer movie), which are beautifully choreographed.  It also mixes in a nice touch of emotion and melodrama, and has a few brilliant, Hitchcock-esque moments (the bullet-in-the-mirror scene, for one).

"Nigel St. Buggering","8","2","3","11 February 2001"," John Woo's best American film...and nearly on par with his Hong Kong work
","Representing the first (and possibly last) time that an American studio left Woo alone and let him do what he does, ""Face/Off"" is the most thrilling and original American action film since ""Die Hard"".  It's ironic that the talent had to be brought in from Hong Kong.<br/><br/>The best of Woo's Hong Kong work reflects a fascination with duality; two men who become so close (either through hatred OR friendship) that they are almost two sides of the same person.  Here that concept is taken to extremes in a science fiction device which forces two mortal enemies to trade physical likenesses.  It's a daring idea for a serious action film, and Woo may be one of the very few directors who could pull it off.<br/><br/>The action sequences are, of course, stunning, but that's only half of the Woo formula.  His tragic-opera approach to melodrama is here as well, starting right from the opening scene that creates a permanent and intense connection between the two characters.  And while neither Travolta nor Cage could replace Chow Yun-Fat, they are worthy substitutes under Woo's direction.  They look credible in the both-guns-blazing shootouts, and they seem to be having a great time playing each other's acting styles against one another.<br/><br/>While the final scene may be a bit over-the-top, and it may run a bit long, this still joins the ranks of the best of American action alongside ""Die Hard"", ""Lethal Weapon"", and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""."

Thinking about the details of this film can cause serious brain damage or laughing cramps, whichever comes first. By switching faces, both actors seem to get completely different bone structures too. We know now that a great way of losing fat is taking Nicholas Cage's face. Not only that, it cuts your laundry bill considerably. Cage is shot at, ducks down on a dusty floor, barely escapes an explosion, takes a speed boat THROUGH an exploding coast guard boat, is dragged at high speeds through the water, is launched onto a beach, fights some more in the sand and ends up... with a spotless white shirt, a seemingly freshly pressed black tux and a smashing tie. What a guy! If you don't take things too seriously, this film offers great entertainment."

","John Woo has never been one to let reality get in the way of a good story. Nor will he waste time with character development when simply labelling each of his cast with a signature trait or two will give them each enough drive to propel the plot through its twists, turns and face-offs. This is a Greek tragedy on steroids - arch enemies being trapped in the bodies of their Nemesis, each experiencing life through the eyes (literally) of their persecutor. Even the names of the criminal brothers tips off the classical tale - Castor and Pollux. (Castor and Pollux Troy no less!)

In the movie, they do what few actors before them have done: they get to play each other. They do it so convincingly that the only way to tell which one is which is to watch Dominique Swain and Joan Allen react to a given situation. (Swain and Allen play the daughter and wife of John Travolta's character, respectively).<br/><br/>From the first shot fired at the beginning of the movie to the final fight between Travolta and Cage, Face/Off is nothing short of spectacular. Woo uses violence as an art form to tell a very emotional and very powerful story. The violence in the movie is absolutely necessary in telling the story, just as it is in ""The Matrix"". Without Woo's over-the-top action sequences, Face/Off would be just another sci-fi drama, and the futuristic world the screenplay originally intended for the movie would be absolutely necessary.<br/><br/>Rating: 4 stars out of 4"

When the theme kicks in just as Cage's boat jumps through the police boat, I still get chills. Some may complain that it is too drawn out, but the movie has to build to an ending that is this oversized.

","There is a moment in ""Face/ Off"" when Sean Archer (John Travolta), a member of a secret FBI anti-terrorist team, confronts the comatose body of Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage), his archenemy, in the hospital.<br/><br/>""You're keeping him alive?"" he asks incredulously. ""Relax,"" says a medical man. ""He's a turnip."" To prove it, he puts out his cigarette on Troy's arm. Troy won't feel a thing when his face is surgically removed in order to be transplanted to Archer's skull, so the FBI man can enter prison disguised as Troy and get information about a deadly biological bomb.<br/><br/>That exchange of faces and identities is the inspiration for ""Face/Off,"" the new John Woo action thriller, which contains enough plot for an entire series. It's a gimme, for example, that as gravely injured as he may be, Troy will snap out of his coma and force a doctor to transplant Archer's face onto his own bloody skull - so that the lawman and the outlaw end up looking exactly like the other.<br/><br/>This is an actor's dream, and Travolta and Cage make the most of it. They spend most of the movie acting as if they're in each other's bodies - Travolta acting like Cage, and vice versa. Through the plot device of a microchip implanted in his larynx, Travolta is allegedly able to sound more like Cage - enough, maybe, to fool the terrorist's paranoid brother, who is in prison and knows the secret of the biological weapon.<br/><br/>The movie is above all an action thriller. John Woo, whose previous American films include ""Broken Arrow"" with Travolta, likes spectacular stunts in unlikely settings, and the movie includes chases involving an airplane (which crashes into a hangar) and speedboats (which crash into piers and each other). There also are weird settings, including the high-security prison where the inmates wear magnetized boots that allow security to keep track of every footstep.<br/><br/>The high-tech stuff is flawlessly done, but the intriguing elements of the movie involve the performances. Travolta and Cage do not use dubbed voices, and don't try to imitate each other's speaking voices precisely when ""occupying"" each other's bodies. Instead, knowing that the sound of a voice is created to some degree by the larynx of his host body, they provide suggestions of each other's speech and vocal patterns, along with subtle physical characteristics. The movie's premise is that only the faces change - so each actor also finds ways to suggest that he is not the original inhabitant of his body. (Troy-as-Archer at one point refers unhappily to Archer's ""ridiculous chin,"" and the fact that it's Travolta playing Cage criticizing Travolta is typical of the spins they put on the situation.) For the Archer character, who begins inside Travolta's body and then spends most of the movie inside Cage's, the challenge is to fool a convict brother so suspicious that even when faced with the face of his own brother, he's cautious. For Troy, it's even trickier: He goes home to Archer's family, including his wife (Joan Allen) and confused teenage daughter (Dominique Swain), and has to convince them that he's the husband and father they know. The wife in particular is surprised by the renewed ardor of a husband whose thoughts, for years, have been on revenge rather than romance. (Meanwhile, Archer as Troy is confronted by Troy's girlfriend, played by Gina Gershon).<br/><br/>Woo, who became famous for his Hong Kong action pictures before hiring on in Hollywood, is a director overflowing with invention. He works here with an original screenplay by Mike Werb and Michael Colleary, which explores the strange implications of the face-swap. One of the issues they touch on involves how much our appearance shapes our personality: If sweet, shaggy John Travolta looked like angular, sardonic Nicolas Cage, would he act any differently? The summers of 1996 and 1997 have both been dominated by big-budget special effects extravaganzas. It's interesting that Cage has been in three of them: ""The Rock,"" ""Con Air"" and now ""Face/ Off."" He brings a quirkiness to the material that's useful. Given the undeniable fact that the plot of ""Face/Off"" is utterly absurd, it would be strange to see a traditional action hero playing it straight. Cage adds a spin. And here I was about to write: ""For example, when he first sees Travolta's teenage daughter, he quips, 'The plot thickens.' But of course it is Travolta who sees Travolta's teenage daughter, because it is Travolta playing the Cage character.<br/><br/>You see what thickets this plot constructs; it's as if Travolta adds the spin courtesy of Cage's personality, while Cage mellows in the direction of Travolta. Better to conclude that the two actors, working together, have devised a very entertaining way of being each other while being themselves.<br/><br/>This business of exchanged identities is of course not new to drama. Shakespeare enjoyed having characters play each other (see ""Twelfth Night""), and in Chinese and Japanese plays it's common for masks to be used to suggest identity swaps. Here, using big movie stars and asking them to play each other, Woo and his writers find a terrific counterpoint to the action scenes: All through the movie, you find yourself reinterpreting every scene as you realize the ""other"" character is ""really"" playing it."

","Stylized and chaotic action sequences are an indispensible ingredient of John Woo films, and Face/Off is no different in that aspect.With an ensemble star-studded cast comprising Nicolas Cage and John Travolta, and the implementation of the in-vogue conceptualization of plastic surgery as the central idea in order to apprehend a nefarious criminal, the film maybe deemed inconceivable all the same as it departs from the traditional realm of scientific knowledge(as is evident in the process of plastic surgery portrayed in the movie).
Sean Archer(FBI Detective) embarks on a hunt to intercept his arch-rival Castor Troy, with personal scores to settle.Archer's vendetta against Castor culminates years later in an ambush wherein Castor and his slow-witted accomplice Pollux are ensnared and Castor concedes the knowledge of a bomb ticking away in a specific location of the city, but fails to digress into it's location, as he slips into a coma.Archer, in order for Pollux to reveal the bomb location undergoes plastic surgery, swapping his face with his nemesis, Troy.
In an unexpected turn of events, which may seem as an erratic misconception, intricately woven in the exquisite acting performances of both Travolta and Cage and sketchy action sequences.
The plot may appear to be quite weak and illusionary, but the movie rides on the coattails of scintillating action sequences and adept acting.With Troy scheming to wreck Archer while Archer striving to apprehend Troy, the film all the same, proves to be a perfect entertainer with barely a moment available to catch your breath.
It may just be Woo's third American endeavour, but this movie established him in the realm of action movies, and may be regarded as one of the unsurpassable action movies till date."

I suppose the phrase could also refer to a bad film that one enjoys regardless of its sub-par nature, but even this is slightly flawed logic: art is subjective and if you think a film is good, then it is good (there are no 'guilty pleasures'). In any case, John Woo's 'Face/Off (1997)' is an expertly-made piece of 'B-movie' entertainment, one with a well-written script that may be silly but is only smartly so. It's as 'schlocky' as it is precise. That is to say that it's as dumb as they come but it's twice as fun. Every moment feels hand-crafted to be just as over-the-top as it needs to, sublimely toeing the line between self-serious and almost satirical, and the overall result is undeniably a blast. From the extended, smoky set-pieces to the balls-to-the-wall but emotive performances to Woo's ostentatious auteur signatures, the picture just flies by and keeps you smiling, essentially, every step of the way. Travolta as Cage and Cage as Travolta is as iconic and complex a cinematic pairing as there has ever been and it is pulled off impeccably. I'd even go so far as to say this is Cage's best performance, as he excels in both of his roles. Travolta is fine, but he stands out far more when he's in his villainous position. Still, the characters, quite remarkably, always come before the actors (the protagonist always seems like the protagonist, no matter who is playing him and vice versa). Indeed, there are actually some pretty intelligent ideas at play here and the way in which the narrative undercuts itself at certain points really is inspired. At the same time, though, the plot itself doesn't necessarily hold up to all that much scrutiny outside of its basic beats and requires a considerable amount of suspension of disbelief even within its own world. At the end of the day, I wouldn't have it any other way. This is a surprisingly good feature that takes the best elements of its disparate aspects and mashes them together rather successfully. It's entertaining. 7/10"

","While many films live on for their atmosphere and morals, this will be remembered for its pure and unbridled action. Director John Woo's mastery of cinematic action is exemplified in this two hour thrill ride as John Travolta and Nicholas Cage clash in a mano a mano battle to the death. Dealing with themes of obsession and the devastating effects of vengeance, Face/Off is a masterclass in high octane film-making which manages never to stray into the absurd or the excessive. The sheer level of acting talent holds the film above others in its genre, as Travolta plays Cage playing Travolta and vice versa, tangled in a brutal battle of wits game of cat and mouse which culminates in an adrenaline fueled finale like no other."

"Desertman84","10","1","1","11 October 2012"," Face/Off Is Must-See
","Face/Off is an action thriller film directed by John Woo.It features Nicolas Cage and John Travolta together with Joan Allen,Alessandro Nivola,Gina Gershon,Dominique Swain,Nick Cassavetes,Harve Presnell,Colm Feore and C. C. H. Pounder. The two both play an FBI agent and a terrorist, sworn enemies who assume the physical appearance of one another.It exemplifies Woo's signature gun fu and heroic bloodshed action sequences, and has Travolta and Cage each playing two personalities. <br/><br/>Sean Archer, an FBI agent obsessed with capturing Castor Troy, a criminal genius who years before killed Archer's son while trying to assassinate the agent. Archer's single-minded pursuit of Troy has caused serious harm to his marriage, but Archer thinks the light may have appeared at the end of the tunnel when a seriously wounded Troy is captured in a bloody shootout. However, it turns out that Troy has planted a time bomb, with a biological payload that could destroy the entire city of Los Angeles and Troy isn't about to say where it is. The only other person who knows the bomb's location is Troy's brother, Pollux, who is no more helpful than Castor. FBI scientists hatch a plan: they have developed an experimental surgery which would allow them to graft Troy's face temporarily on Archer's head and allow him to question Pollux as if he were his brother. But after Archer has taken Troy's face, Troy regains consciousness and forces the doctors to give him Archer's face. Now the criminal mastermind has the FBI at his disposal, and the lawman is underground with few places to turn. <br/><br/>Travolta vamps Cage's tics and flamboyant excess with the grace of a dancer after his transformation from cop to criminal, while Cage plays the sullen, bottled-up agent excruciatingly trapped behind the face of the man who killed his son. His attempts to live up to the terrorist's reputation become cathartic explosions of violence that both thrill and terrify him. This is merely icing on the cake for action fans, the dramatic backbone for some of the most visceral action thrills ever. Woo fills the screen with one show-stopping set piece after another, bringing a poetic grace to the action freak out with sweeping camera-work and sophisticated editing. This marriage of melodrama and mayhem ups the ante from cops-and-robbers clichés to a conflict of near-mythic levels.This brutal, stunningly choreographed spectacle weaves together lyrical beauty, blasphemy, sadistic cruelty and grotesque sentimentality with breathtakingly smooth assurance."

","This is a movie I can watch again and again; it's definitely entertaining. The concept behind this movie is interesting and very cool but there are so many flaws in the plot, things that could have been done differently to make it a little more believable. It was weird that while they are on the surgery table getting their face easily laser cut then suctioned off that someone is cutting John Travolta's hair. You can see the hair go everywhere! There is no way that anyone would be okay with doing a haircut and surgery at the same time. Other than that and a few other things that could easily have been different it is a good movie. Nicholas Cage's character is especially well done."
"BA_Harrison","9","1","1","23 February 2012"," John Woo proves his worth.
","A brave cop and a despicable criminal swapping faces to assume each other's identity has got to be one of the most far-fetched ideas for an action flick ever; but as patently silly and flawed as the premise for Face/Off is, it still proves to be an extremely entertaining film, it's brilliance being down to the sheer audacity of cast and director, who never allow the ridiculous nature of the story to get in the way of the fun.<br/><br/>After the rather lukewarm reception that critics gave his first two US movies (Hard Target and Broken Arrow), director John Woo was clearly determined to restore his reputation as a master of action cinema and went all out to impress: Face/Off is bursting at the seams with brilliantly choreographed mayhem, explosive action set-pieces, and Woo's unmistakable movie-trademarks—endless shooting (including the obligatory two-handed gun-play and Mexican stand-offs), doves, churches, gratuitous slo-mo, and inner turmoil and emotional strife for goodies and baddies alike (Sean Archer's identity crisis, Castor's grief at his brother's death, Sasha Hassler's fear for her child).<br/><br/>This ultra-stylish, uber-kinetic direction from a director out to prove his worth, combined with hilariously unrestrained performances from Travolta and Cage, more than compensates for the movie's more questionable aspects (such as Archer's lack of remorse at maiming and killing umpteen guards during his prison break) and goes to make Face/Off an absolute blast from start to finish.<br/><br/>8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb."
"The-Sarkologist","9","1","1","27 January 2012"," An Action film with meaning
","This movie rocks. Where John Woo failed in Broken Arrow he really succeeded here. The movie is fast and the action sequences are brilliant. On top of that Woo has some brilliant cinematographic shots. He shows the shots down at the most appropriate moments and thus the scene becomes really effective.<br/><br/>The plot is sort of simple. It is about an FBI agent, Sean Archer, who is chasing terrorist Castor Troy. The opening on the movie has Castor and his brother Pollux (as in the Greek mythological figures Castor and Pollux) caught after they chase down a jet and a huge gunfight through an airplane hanger. The problem is is that Castor has planted a bomb somewhere and Archer needs to find it before he detonates it. Castor is in a coma and Pollux is in prison; so using the most advanced surgical techniques, Archer swaps faces with Castor and infiltrates the prison. Then the twist happens. Castor wakes up to find his face missing and Archers face just lying around, so he takes his face and the roles reverse.<br/><br/>Woo states that this movie is about trial through suffering. This is very much true in Archer's case. Only three people know that he has swapped faces with Castor and those three are murdered. This means that Castor walks in and takes over his life leaving Archer stuck in prison with no way to prove that he is not Castor. Castor walks around with the power of Archer and no morals, while Archer has to fight back yet he finds himself struggling with facing many temptations as people believe him to be Castor. He cannot reveal himself because that means that he will die, yet to become Castor in personality means that he will turn his back on everything that he believes in.<br/><br/>After Castor is first arrested, everybody is cheering Archer, but Woo does an interesting thing here. Archer does not bask in the glory of his success, but rather his mind is on those who had lost their lives trying to catch Castor. Woo is subtly trying to show us here that though the action scenes here are brilliant, there is death and suffering behind them. Archer is not an emotionless cop who doesn't care about the nameless agents who are killed. To Archer each of the people that are killed were his colleagues and there is an attachment to them. Even when they are trying to kill him when he is Castor he cannot bring himself to kill them for they are his friends.<br/><br/>Another interesting idea that comes out of the film is the idea about how beauty is only skin deep. What we see on the outside is not really what we see on the inside. Woo has done this by simply switching faces. Though one person may seem to be nice on the outside, on the inside they are rotten to the core. We see the body of Archer go bad while the body of Castor go good. Though one person may be very good, there are other motivations behind this deep down, while those who are incredibly bad, as is Castor, are not beyond redemption."

"nightixu","Null","1","1","11 August 2011"," One of the best action films ever!!!
","Basically, this is a Hollywood version of a hong kong action film. John Woo is a great action film director and he made the classic Hard Boiled with Chow Yun Fatt. With this film, there are all the stylized gun fights that characterizes a John Woo film. Its just amazing. Its like John Travolta said, the way John Woo makes his film, is like a dance. Its not a Die Hard nor is it a Matrix. But i feel it has the best of both. The story is pretty far fetched. Sean Archer played by Travolta, is the cop out for revenge against Castor Troy played by Cage who tried to assassinate him but ended up killing his son instead. Troy is captured after an amazing gun battle. They end up swapping faces and lives. Some of the parts are hard to believe but in the end, its a movie and its not meant to be taken so seriously. <br/><br/>You can expect at least 40 minutes of just pure action scenes. Explosions, gun battles and the likes. One thing i admire about this film is that the action scenes are raw and hardcore yet at the same time smooth and stylish. They took the best from the east and the west put them together. Its like a predecessor to the matrix but without the bullet time. When you actually see how they shoot their guns, their movements, the jumping out shots, its just amazing. There isn't a minute that bores you. The characters are interesting as well. Castor Troy is a flamboyant and ruthless character. Abit like the joker from batman. He's likable as a villain but detestable as well. Sean Archer you can relate to him. He's lost his son and his relationship with his family is deteriorating but he wants to put an end to all this and you're just rooting for him. <br/><br/>Thats the thing about action films. Its not just about the action. You need a good story and good characters. This movie has both and damn good action. That's why i gave it a 9. Just go along for the ride. Pretty ridiculous story but a good one nonetheless."

The plot line is actually touching, and at the end (I am NOT spoiling anything), I actually cried. When you watch Face/Off, you can like Travolta and hate Cage before the surgery, and switch who you like and hate after it, etc. The music, the sounds, and how they are done, the sheer artfulness of this film are unmatched in action movies, even 14 years later."

The first fifteen minutes of the film is better than any final third of any other action film previously released, and the image of Cage getting out of the car is truly iconic.<br/><br/>The best part of the film though is the house siege, where Cage (as Archer) puts headphones on the little boy so he doesn't get scared.<br/><br/>Then we are treated to a few minutes of brutality to 'over the rainbow'.<br/><br/>Even though the film is over two hours long, it never really gives up, and the narration and editing of this film is flawless.<br/><br/>The ending is a little lame, but doesn't really affect the overall product.<br/><br/>A brilliant action movie, Interesting Science fiction, and a testimony to letting things finally go."

","I think the first time I came across Face/Off was when I was about 8 or 9 years old, and had walked in on my parents watching it. Of course at the time, I neither registered nor understood the film and it wasn't until about a year ago that a friend of mine recommended it to me saying it was ""one of the greatest movies"" she had ever watched. After watching it for the second time, I was completely hooked. I had never been much of a fan of action movies, but this film really stuck in my mind. The plot is captivating and the characters themselves are intriguing, and brilliantly played, especially by Nicolas Cage. I think this movie did him a lot of justice, considering he isn't one of the most liked actors around, to say the least (yet I can't seem to understand why). Unfortunately, not many people remember his role in Face/Off as it is quite old. I think the film was brilliantly produced, considering that it was made over 10 years ago, and will always be one of my favourites. I would definitely recommend this if you are interested in action films with a twist."
"rocky_lifter69","8","1","1","28 March 2009"," Lame Title But Great Movie
","OK, I know the title is supposed to be kind of a joke. ""Hey, they're gonna fight each other AND they have their faces taken off! I have the PERFECT name for this movie!"" But I can forgive the weak name because the premise and action are actual up to par.<br/><br/>Starring Nicolas Cage (before his recent binge of stinkers) and John Travolta (before we all realized how untalented he was), the movie follows an FBI agent (Travolta, at least at the beginning) who has his face switched with that of his comatose nemesis (who just so happens to be the murdered of his son) in order to infiltrate a prison and retrieve information about a bomb. So Travolta becomes Cage and enters this prison, just in time for the coma to end and a faceless Cage to become Travolta. And because the ""mission"" was highly secretive and known only to a few people, Bad Guy (as I will refer to him) kills anyone who knew Good Guy was in the pen. So Bad Guy gets to go home and sleep in Good Guy's bed while he rots in jail. Well, Good Guy is able to break out and convince his wife that Bad Guy is not really him, all leading to the aforementioned face off.<br/><br/>The acting is about what you'd expect from a late 90s Nicolas Cage. Travolta has some fun being the crazy man and Joan Allen does a good job as Dr. Wife caught in the middle.<br/><br/>As an action film with some suspense mixed in, the films works quite well. It's not the smartest movie ever made but it will keep your attention. Definitely worth a viewing if you need some gun fire set to a good gimmick."

It really shows both of the actor's range. Everything was perfect, even down to their facial expressions and mannerisms. Amazing.

"Otoboke","Null","1","1","22 December 2008"," Escapist entertainment at its purist.
","Out of all the movie genres available today, none please me more when pulled off correctly than the too often lame and castrated action movie. Face/Off, a feature that knows action and pulls it off eloquently, does more to get the adrenaline pumping than most of the genre's more standard fare, and while it certainly doesn't do much if anything- remarkably new, there's enough done extremely well to satisfy anyone's thirst for stylised, balls-to-the-wall action. It also represents peaks in both lead stars careers, which both have arguably failed to revisit upon subsequent tours of the genre; sure it's not Shakespeare and it's not Oscar nominee material, but that's all part of Woo's otherworldly charm here. Face/Off is more science-fiction than drama, but with a healthy dose of intellectually informed subtext and some brilliant character dynamics, the movie manages to grip from beginning to end, providing a healthy dose of escapist entertainment at its purist.<br/><br/>Telling the undeniably hammy story of Sean Archer and Caster Troy two arch nemesis types on the opposite ends of the law- where both end up swapping faces and in turn identities, Face/Off at base level is certainly cut from the same cloth as The Wizard of Oz in terms of its fantastic nature, but that doesn't mean that it loses its value as entertainment; rather, it reinforces it. Of course this is a story that seems perfect for your average sixties Star Trek episode, but again, that is all part of the charm. Not only is the premise an interesting one in itself, but Woo and his writers capitalise fully on the setup consistently, playing out the dynamics of the two characters' convoluted predicament with some juicy focus on character and the dualism of good and evil. It's the kind of movie that has to be taken further through the mind than face value, because, while Woo does well to give his movie a nice, comfortable balance between fantasy and reality, it's the ideas and nuances of this shift in character and themes that gives the movie its edge.<br/><br/>To say that Face/Off exists as a fine testament to both Travolta and Cage's skills as actors would be something of an understatement. To be sure, both play as Woo's puppets in his exaggerated, over the top world where people accentuate their shadings of black or white, but they do it so well that the caricature style becomes one with the movie itself. Furthermore, the dynamics that are involved here, from switching between personalities and in effect playing each other, the actors are given work here that extents far beyond the asking price of your average action thriller. As a duo, the two work well together as well as on their own; from the snarly façade of Castor Troy to the tormented psyche of Sean Archer, both actors embody both personalities as best as they can and often give life to moments that would easy to be glossed over if not played through Woo's absurdly glamorized and in turn engrossing style.<br/><br/>But let's not fall under any pretence here; Face/Off is first and foremost, an action movie. Yes, there are some great characters, touching drama and intellectually rewarding themes on dualism and metaphysical questions on personality and psychology, but all of this is given the bench to what Woo has arguably always been best at. This direct focus on huge, ridiculously potent action full to the brim with explosions, gunfire, violence and people flying through the air, forms what is quite possibly all that is best about the Hollywood action movie. With a distinct lack of shaky-cam syndrome and a larger desire to show how grand his images are, Woo delivers a visual and aural spectacle which is best to be taken on pure entertainment terms. One can easily point holes in nearly every aspect of the movie's plot, character and action, but it's hard to be so cynical when you're given masterfully executed shots that put so many other so-called action movies to shame.<br/><br/>When it comes to speaking for the action genre, one can't remain positive without thinking of how bloated and derivative it has become over the recent years. Yet looking back almost decade and watching Face/Off, it's somewhat uplifting to see that many years after its inception, there's still people out there capable of delivering the no-frills, no-nonsense excitement that made the genre such a formidable audience pleaser in the first place. Yes, this is by no means a cinematic classic, but its one of those movies that will likely be kept alongside such movies as Die Hard and Con Air, ready to be watched time and time again just for the sheer fun of it. Cinema, as much as it would like to deceive us, rarely does manage to deliver the true essence of fun; Face/Off is an excellent reminder that such movies don't always have to end up being mundane and formulaic.<br/><br/><ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>"
"agelshaxe","8","1","1","3 August 2008"," John Woo in the USA
","I didn't really know what to expect when I decided to see Face/Off. I love all the movies John Woo made back in Hong Kong, they are all fantastic. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for some of his Hollywood endeavors such as the sadly mediocre M-I:2 . I was afraid, but I decided to give Face/Off a chance.<br/><br/>I wasn't disappointed. Though the basic science-fiction-esquire premise is kinda sorta very silly, it is ultimately a small nitpick in the face of the main performances and the action.<br/><br/>Indeed, Nick Cage and John Travolta do a good job at exchanging faces, roles, personalities, whatever and it makes for some entertaining situations. The rest of the cast, however, is pretty boring and I was most disappointed to see how Joan Allen just seems to stand around with big, wide eyes...<br/><br/>Then there are the big, fat, juicy John Woo action scenes. At first it was kind of strange seeing Cage and Travolta diving into the air, Matrix-style, like Chow-Yun Fat, but I quickly got used to it. The action scenes didn't disappoint, with gun-blazing, slow-mo extravaganzas and a final explosive chase which actually made me giggle with glee. And I have seen a lot of good action movies--including most of John Woo's.<br/><br/>So, in the end, I was glad to have seen Face/Off, as it made me see a John Woo movie I hadn't yet. Despite a pretty silly premise, this is a good action movie... Have fun !"

It had a good basic concept, admittedly, albeit scientifically implausible, and fairly poorly executed within the movie (ie. not very believable to start off with, completely unbelievable by the time the film finished with it).<br/><br/>But I struggled on and did my best to suspend my substantial disbelief (not an easy task) and watched a film which would have worked better with a touch of knowing humour running through it played absolutely straight, by Cage especially.<br/><br/>My wife kept howling with laughter as each event more ludicrous than the last hove into view. She particularly found the much-vaunted action sequences hilarious, as millions of rounds of ammunition were expended in loving slow motion, destroying vast quantities of fixtures, fittings and decor, motor vehicles, and anything else which was capable of having at least 20 squibs planted in it, but with no one capable of hitting the people they were aiming at, other than the Castor Troy character (whoever happened to be playing him at the time). Oh, and the Archer character (as played by Cage) being able to wound the good guys with pinpoint accuracy, so as to remain a good guy himself.<br/><br/>The vomit-inducing appearance of the ironic replacement son at the end was - well, vomit-inducing, and nearly as funny as the incredibly obvious set up when Gina Gershon was killed.<br/><br/>Joan Allen had the single most unflattering hairdo ever committed to celluloid.<br/><br/>And for all that, it was fairly entertaining, with Travolta looking as if he was having fun.<br/><br/>But don't ever get taken in by those reviews which count this one of the all-time great action thrillers. It's not. It's drivel. Seriously, it's major drivel - fun, perhaps, but complete tosh from start to finish."

Now going to the performances: Have you ever seen a film where two characters switch each other's places and have them act as their other character, yet you don't believe the authenticity in there? Well, in this film, John Travolta and Nicolas Cage won me over. They played their other characters so well, that you find yourself thinking if they're really the other character. I know, it gets confusing. But this is an accomplishment.<br/><br/>""Face/Off"" isn't just a popcorn, summer, action flick. It's a darn good one. The characters are diverse.

Terrific to watch, even if it's preposterous and filled with superficial glitz. John Travolta and Nicolas Cage are both terrific as themselves—and as each other! <br/><br/>No doubt this kind of trading places story could have really interesting psychological depths—and that movie is waiting to be made—but here they choose to play up the sensational aspects (sleeping with the other's wife, etc.).

It's seriously funny and almost joyous, even as lots of people get unceremoniously killed. Even the ridiculous first scene, which goes on a very very very long time, is all about outdoing James Bond in outrageous chase and shoot-em-up scenes.<br/><br/>If the movie lacks class, or wants some subtle aspects here and there, or even needs strong female roles, there is a kind of deliberate pedal to the floor aspect here that is perfect.

","Face Off (1997) would mark the last time John Woo would show flashes of his former self in a mainstream Action film (I don't care what people say, Black Jack was quite interesting). The movie reunites John Travolta and John Woo in another action flick. This time he acts opposite of Nicolas Cage (Coppola) in a tale about dopplegangers, hidden sides and secrets. The action scenes are filmed quite well but they lack something that I can't explain and the stunt work is too obvious. John Woo also digs deep into his past work to re-use a lot of his older action set pieces. But is the film watchable?<br/><br/>Two rivals ,one an Fedeal Agent(John Travolta) and the other a Worldwide wanted criminal(Nicolas Cage) have a blood feud that has reached it's limits. When the two finally have it out in a high impact fire fight outside an airport, one is captured whilst the is showered with praises. But it doesn't end just there. What happens next has to be seen to be believed. <br/><br/>Not a true classic like his earlier films, but this will be the best it'll ever get for mainstream John Woo. Without an action director to direct the scenes, Woo's films are nothing more than a shell of his former self. Maybe he should spend a few shekels and hire him for future film projects. Until then we'll just have to settle for rehashed action scenes from a director who just happened to be in the right place at the right time. Maybe he should go back to making comedies or learned more form his mentor Chang Cheh.<br/><br/>Recommended for fans of John Woo's Hollywood work."

Excellent breakneck actioner/psychological thriller with obsessed FBI agent Travolta out to infiltrate looney tune killing master criminal Cage's operation of setting off a bomb in LA by state-of-the-art surgery grafting Cage's face onto Travolta (and then vice versea as the plot thickens).  Sounds dumb but with a crackling screenplay by Mike Werb and Michael Colleary, the film takes hold with some unexpected humor (and for that matter humanity), deft action sequences and acting tour-de-forces from its leads (both getting to be Good and Evil); think of it as `Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde' meets James Bond with a touch of Greek tragedy.  High octane violence underscored masterfully by auteur impresario John Woo who choreographs the coolest gunfights with a balletic, operatic grace and the elan of Travolta and Cage results in one helluva film.

Face/Off may come off as your classic, fake, cliché action flick, but if you take a minute to look deeper into portions of the movie, you'll find symbolisms, commentary, parallelisms, and irony that will knock your socks off; the story is woven thick.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of this movie was the recurring concept of the dominant vs the subordinant (Archer is dominant, Troy is subordinant), conveying the idea that the oppressor can learn just as much from the oppressed as the oppressed is supposed to learn from the oppressor.

The direction from John Woo is awesome, the action scenes are well filmed, the acting is good, and this is a one of a kind movie.<br/><br/>The problem is that the action scenes are drawn out to the point where they can become way too long. With movies like this, it doesn't matter how much action there is, it just has to end at some point in time. One scene that everyone says is great is the boat chase at the end. There is a lot of shooting and explosions in the boat chase, but there is another movie that I saw a similar boat chase in. That movie is called Patriot Games. I think Patriot Games is a great, but highly underrated movie. The speed boat chase in the end of that movie was dark, intense, and action packed. The speed boat chase in this movie was intense and action packed, but seemed like too much of a cliché. The only other bad thing about this movie is that at times, the script isn't very well written and the conversations can become unrealistic.<br/><br/>Those were the so so parts that I mentioned above, now I will mention the good parts. The action scenes are intense and they are awesome. This is a creative movie, especially with the way that a maniac terrorist and a secret agent swap identities. I haven't seen any other movies that are based around that premise. In one of John Woo's other films called Mission: Impossible 2, there is a scene involving masks to hide identities, but in that movie, it gets very confusing.<br/><br/>Nicholas Cage is great as a maniac terrorist, and John Travolta is great as a secret agent, but they are even better when they are both on the screen at the same time.<br/><br/>This is worth watching, and there is plenty of action.

But things take a turn for the worst when Troy shows up with Archer's face.<br/><br/>Yes, this synopsis may sound a bit convoluted and murky, but the film makes it work at almost every hairpin turn. In fact, that is half the fun of the film. I watched this film when I was a kid, and loved it. And nothing has changed in ten years. Through every suspense filled moment, the film packs on one hell of a wallop, both through its clever trade-off of action and emotion. Yes, it has its moments where things happen that clearly never can, but the rest of this dead serious romp is very much based heavily in the real (and the predicted real). Indeed some of the thrilling stunts are right in tune with the usual crap spoon fed by Michael Bay (who actually directed Cage in his best work to date, The Rock, just before this film), but the majority of the actions that these characters do are based quite blatantly in the real world.<br/><br/>The stunts and action set pieces are all brilliantly constructed from head to toe, and never once does anything look fake. It has all the trimmings of a John Woo film, from the pigeons to the double handed gun fights to the grand explosions to even the elevated use of slow motion, and never once does it take itself for granted. Right from the scene in the chase/shootout scene in the airport hanger that begins right after the credits conclude, you know you are in the hands of a master action storyteller. Woo takes great pride in how he envisions and creates his sequences, and every single scene action-packed or not, has that aura about it. Unlike the aforementioned Bay or even The Wachowskis, every detail looks perfectly thought out and even more perfectly directed. It is hard to spot blemishes in everything that is going on, and even harder to pick out the fabricated from the realistic (considering how little an amount of CGI is actually used in the film).<br/><br/>But the real drive of the film is in the acting, and it is fairly well done across the board. Both Travolta and Cage are clearly above the material, but they do a wonderful job conveying most of the absolutely devastating emotions shown throughout the film. Both play off of each other well, and both do an even better job aping the other's performance. While I did really enjoy Cage here (more so as the good guy), it is Travolta who gives the better performance. He just brings such an evil zest to the Troy role that we never really get to see as an audience. Yeah, he was over-the-top in Broken Arrow, fabulously poignant in Pulp Fiction, and at one of his all-time highs in Swordfish, but his deliciously evil turn here is what really shows off his talent and range. The otherwise all around good guy playing someone who is the quintessentially evil bad-ass. His every delivery just has that solid, methodical brilliance to it, and seeing it again was a real treat.<br/><br/>Supporting turns from Joan Allen as Archer's wife, Dominique Swain as Archer's daughter, Gina Gershon as Troy's moll and Nivola are all particularly well acted. Yes, they are overshadowed by the two main characters, but they put in some fine performances all on their own.<br/><br/>What kills the movie a little are some of the blatant plot-holes, inconsistencies and some really goofy dialogue (that stupid hand thing still bothers me too). I understand some of the movie should be tongue-in-cheek, but some of the scenes just got a little out of control. Just the sheer idea of swapping faces is a frightening idea all in itself. But then why does no one quite grasp the changes that these characters are clearly going through? Why do we not even know more than just a slight backstory on neither Archer nor Troy? Questions like these bothered me ever since I first saw the film so many years ago, and they only continue to echo. I understand the whole movie hinges on the idea of revenge for Archer's son's murder and everyone not knowing the truth except Archer and Troy, but some of their actions are just far too bizarre for someone to not notice. This may be a problem having changed the script so vastly from its original science-fiction form, but it just never quite jives as easy as it should.<br/><br/>I must admit, even though it is quite obviously an action film, Face/Off will always so much more than that. The undertones that run throughout the film are so heavily dramatic, that if you take away the action scenes, you still could have a taut and calculating character drama. The painstaking work done by Woo and his crew to make this film so much more original than it could have been is crystal clear throughout the film. Its sheer predictions of a dystopic face swapping ability is enough to make the film valid and not dated in the current year, but at the same time, shows just how imaginative movies used to be. Problems or not, I can only hope that Face/Off continues to stand the test of time.<br/><br/>8/10.<br/><br/>(Portions of this review originally appeared on http://www.dvdfanatic.com)."

","There's a lot to say about this film so i'll start with how well the casting was done, both actors did amazingly as Sean archer and Castor troy. I think Nicolas cage did a better job as the bad guy but you know. The acting was superb (for the most part). Joan Allen played her character well. The only actor i weren't sure of the acting was Castor troy's girlfriend, i'm sorry i don't know her name. But i think her acting was kind of poor especially her line ""Really? Really?"" when they invade the apartment. Her acting was brought back by the whole other cast's performance. <br/><br/>One flaw- The tacky scenes at the end and beginning shouldn't have been so lovey-dovey... the black and white was good but on the feriswheel shouldn't have had the music... however i suppose no film can be perfect....<br/><br/>Overall i have to say John Woo did an excellent job as the director and the way Travolta and Cage gelled as the two sides of the law was brilliant... this film i can watch over and over and i cant get bored... i know most of the one liners from it and i have to say this is one of my favourites...

"barnabyrudge","7","2","4","4 May 2006"," Outrageous actioner, with a lunatic plot that is actually quite refreshing.
","By 1997, the action genre was looking a little stale. The biggest problem was that each new action movie that came along was trying to out-bang the one before. There's only so far you can go with spectacular stunts and explosions. There has to come a point when you hit a kind of ceiling and the only direction left is back down. By 1997 action movie makers had hit this ceiling and were merely churning out film after film that had virtually the same plot. The actors and the backgrounds may have varied from movie to movie, but the general essence remained identical - and therein lay the staleness. That's why Face/Off is such an enjoyable action movie. It manages to sock across a new plot - something different to the norm, something not seen before - and the result is a sense of freshness that is rare for the genre.<br/><br/>Special agent Sean Archer (John Travolta) is devastated when his young son Michael is killed by a sniper's bullet meant for him. The sniper was psycho Castor Troy (Nicholas Cage), and Archer subsequently dedicates his life to tracking down and nailing this rotten villain. After many years, Archer finally catches up with his nemesis at an L.A. airfield. The encounter ends with Castor being thrown into a wall by the force of a jet engine, an event which leaves him in a coma. All is not as well as one might expect, as before being rendered comatose Castor planted a time bomb, capable of vaporising everything within a square mile, somewhere in the city. The only person who knows the location of the bomb is Castor's paranoid, imprisoned brother Pollux (Alessandro Nivola), but with his big brother indefinitely unconscious there seems no hope of Pollux giving away his secret. Archer is persuaded to undergo radical surgery that will allow him to look like Castor - to literally ""wear"" his body and face - so that he can go to jail posing as Troy, and get the truth out of unsuspecting Pollux. But the plan backfires when Archer (now, bizarrely, played by Cage) is undercover in prison.... for the real Castor (now played by Travolta) comes out of his coma and turns the table on his adversary. The good guy is trapped in jail and the only people who know his true identity are killed; meanwhile the bad guy is out on the streets being hailed by everyone as a national hero!<br/><br/>Face/Off is totally absurd, but a lot of fun. The absurdness is almost deliberate, like an outrageous catalyst used to kick-start the ensuing proceedings. Cage and Travolta have a tremendous time aping each other's character once their ""faces"" have been switched; Nivola is twitchy to a fault as Castor's hyper-anxious brother; and Joan Allen has a super role as Archer's understandably bewildered wife. John Woo orchestrates the action very cleverly, with his usual slow motion flourishes, and some hair-raising sequences. There are occasional talky moments that teeter somewhere between tedium and melodrama, but when the pyrotechnics take over Woo delivers the goods. Face/Off is a very enjoyable actioner, just outlandish enough to be an effective clichÃ©-breaker."
"ed-414","1","2","4","14 November 2005"," give it a miss
","Some bad script & acting spoils what could have been a really good film. Some moments of good acting spoilt by strange twists in the plot, makes this a hodge podge. First half of film is reminiscent of the bad tom cruise films of old. Cocky characters aimed at juvenile audiences?<br/><br/>What was essential a good idea gets mixed up on the cutting room floor, leaving a disjointed film.<br/><br/>It is almost a patchwork quilt of ideas jumbled together, mixing tear jerking movements with ridiculous somersaults by the characters. Some of the fight scenes go on forever, is it meant to be a parody? who knows."
"Antagonisten","8","2","4","23 January 2005"," Perfect mix
","John Woo has always been one of my favorite action directors. And this is somewhat of his crowning achievement. The perfect mix between Hollywood and Hong Kong you might say.<br/><br/>The terrorist and criminal Castor Troy (Nicholas Cage) has placed a dirty bomb somewhere. Agent Sean Archer (John Travolta) has been chasing Troy for a long time and now he is close to catching him. But things go out of control and Troy falls into a coma. Now the only person who knows the location of the bomb is Troys brother Pollux. Now Archer has to go undercover looking like Troy to get his brother to reveal the location of the bomb.<br/><br/>This movie has a story that stretches reality quite a bit. But in the end that doesn't really matter. Because this might be the ultimate action movie. Why? Simply because John Woo here manages to mix his Hong Kong-brand of action sequences with the plot and acting of Hollywood. Both Travolta and Cage are majestic as the two enemies. And this is bullet ballet as it's best. Woo uses every trick in the book. Slow-motion, dual pistols and a pace that never lets you up for air.<br/><br/>Unlike Woo's Hong Kong outings (most notably The Killer and Hard-boiled) this movie has a story that holds together though, and the actors to pull it off. The disturbing elements of confusing plot turns that are almost always present in Hong Kong are also gone. Allt this combines in making this one of my top-three action movies of all time.<br/><br/>I rate this 8/10."
"mr_movie_2004","Null","2","4","20 April 2004"," An action masterpiece
","To begin, I must state that this film is not for people who can't take unrealistic and over the top action, or accept medically scientifically impossible medical procedures.  If you can't take in a moive and realize that it is taking place removed from reality, this film is not for you.  In my opinion, action movies should not be realistic.  I watch them to escape from the real world, not to go over and over and point out what couldn't or wouldn't happen in real life.<br/><br/>If you can accept that, then you will love Face Off.  Action maestro John Woo, best known by his ardent followers for his over the top and incredibly kinetic Hong Kong action films such as A Better Tomorrow 1 and 2, The Killer and Hard Boiled, and most famous in the US for his box office smash Mission Impossible 2, delivers a film that, while not quite on the level of his best work from Hong Kong, is clearly his best American film to date.  And beyond that, a film that blows most other American action films out of the water. <br/><br/>
Woo has the inate ability to make almost anything look good from a purely visual standpoint.  He takes a simple thing like Nicholas Cage exiting a car and makes it look incredibly stylish and cool.  Give him this kind of budget and R-rating, and look out.  The action scenes in this movie are dazzling, replete with Woo's trademark slow motion shootouts and his one on one stand offs between enemies with guns pointed at each other at point blank range. This is bolstered by the resources he had at hand for this project, and he spares no expense in massive explosions.  And the final boat chase is one of the best staged action sequences in years.<br/><br/>He also does a nice job handling the more dramatic moments in the film, aided by the very strong performances of both lead actors.  Travolta and Cage both play the roles of the narcissistic, sadistic, over the top Castor Troy and the depressed, work obsessed family man Sean Archer very well.  And while the script certainly has a few corny moments, especially the final scene, but it also includes some very funny dialogue and one liners, and provides the viewers with characters that are interesting and sympathetic. <br/><br/>
This movie is not perfect from an overall standpoint, but as a major studio action movie it is about as close as you're going to get.  Watching it just reminds us the massive impact that John Woo has had on action cinema worldwide, and his style has perhaps lost some of its impact now because of the host of imitators he has, most notably Michael Bay who directed The Rock and Bad Boys 1 and 2, and The Wachowski Brothers, famous for The Matrix trilogy.  Unfortunately John Woo's career has been sidetracked by studio execs unwilling to compromise and allow him to make the types of movies he really wants to make, and Face Off remains the only great action film he's made in America.  But it is a great one."
"Coxer99","8","2","4","18 June 1999"," Face/Off

"outsider-2","2","2","4","5 April 1999"," A tragic affair(3.5/10)
","It's sad to see John Woo wasting his many talents on movies such as this one. A handful of well-choreographed scenes can't save a movie. Ridiculous cliches, with lots of over-acting and grimacing by both Travolta and Cage ruins the entire film. If Woo keeps making films like these (the big hit, once a thief) he's got one less fan."
"helpless_dancer","8","2","4","29 March 1999"," good action, lots of gunplay
","Travolta and Cage did a good job in this non-stop action thriller. An FBI agent [Travolta] switches indentities with a terrorist [Cage]. He does this to get information on the location of a bomb in a major American city from the terrorist's brother. The plan fails, and the agent is stuck with the evil man's identity. This, of course, allows the terrorist to take on the FBI agent's life, because the agent is stuck in the pen with no one to vouch for his real identity. The two adversaries meet again and the stuff hits the fan. Lots of killing and violence in this one."

The aperance of Travolta and Cage was superb. John Woo is definetely the best director of action movies. The story is unique(one thing that rarely happens cause almost all of the action movies have the same topic). Also this is quite unpredictable, it's not a thriller but you're not even a little bit sure of what will happen in the end. 10/10. The best action movie of these last five years."
"Willie-12","7","2","4","14 November 2001"," I enjoyed this one
","Face Off was the best summer movie of 1997, hands down.  This was probably the first John Woo movie I had seen, and I must admit I wasn't quite ready for his powerfully charged way of bringing action to the screen (wasn't quite ready, but loved every minute of it).  Cage and Travolta were perfect in these roles, and they very convincingly played the two main characters well.  This must have been an opportunity of a life time...to be able to prove your ability and skill as an actor by playing the villain and the hero in the same movie.  Sure it has been done before, but not this uniquely.  I still can't get over one particular scene in the movie, a scene that was very powerful, and almost touching in a violent sort of way (if that is possible).  **could be viewed as minor spoiler** It involved Travolta playing the Troy character when he realized his brother had just been killed.  I still remember that police officer looking at Travolta thinking he was  Sean Archer, and saying rather coldly ""sir, it's only Pollux Troy."" Travolta, as Castor Troy then looked at him with a dead stare that would have sent chills through even the bravest person's bones, lifted his gun in one swift move, and put a bullet in the officer's head, killing him instantly.  I remember thinking ""boy that was brutal.""  But I also remember thinking ""I would probably have felt like doing the same thing to someone who had just insulted a recently deceased close family member of mine."" Grant it, Castor Troy was a nasty, rotten character, but for that one brief second, in his moment of grief, you could almost sympathize with him.  Very powerful stuff!  That much substance isn't really found in the rest of the movie, but it doesn't matter.  If you just take it for what it is, a high powered, well acted, action movie, then you will be satisfied.  But hey, that's just my opinion."

"gtryf","8","2","4","8 December 2000"," One of the best movies of its kind
","I'm not a big fan of action thrillers but I've got to hand it out to this one. The plot is not really original; in many fantasy movies the villain appears in the form of the good guy and wreaks havoc -- but this is an action movie, nothing supernatural, it's all done by a surgical operation, and this is what makes this movie original: it's an action movie that moves on the grounds of what was fantasy up to now.<br/><br/>Moreover the performances of the two stars are stunning. Both actors can assume both the twisted persona that is Troy and the conscious cop that is Archer -- and they're both eerily convincing. Of course, this is what you would except from two excellent actors such as Travolta and Cage, but this film gives you the opportunity to see how two entirely different characters can be played by the same person in the same movie.<br/><br/>On the downside, I found that the final showdown was a bit too lengthy for my taste. Awesome visual and sound effects, but I think that if the director had cut out 5-6 minutes from it then the movie would be at the top.<br/><br/>Overall an 8/10."
"Kryptik Kritik","Null","2","4","9 November 2000"," A Unique, Original, Classy and Stylish Gem
","This film kicks ass! It's definitely the most original and unique films that have come around in a long, long, time. However, there are some things I didn't like about the film... ... For example: the genesis of the plot for one. There were only a handful of cops who urge Travolta to undergo a face-lift with Cage in the first place, and in case something goes terribly wrong, they decide that they're the only ones qualified to know about the operation. Exactly, where they going to get clearance for that kind of a bold move? Realistically, it would involve a lot of red-tape to do something like that, and would leave more than a handful of people who know about it, if the government would even go for it. So of course, when Cage wakes up with his face torn off, he kills the surgeon, the rest of those who know about it, leaving him without any proof of his real identity. It's highly doubtful that someone who's been knocked into a coma, sedated in order to be put through a face-lift, is suddenly going to snap out of it, all of the sudden. <br/><br/>However, Travolta and Cage's performances make up for this entirely. The rest of the story seems to work out fine, and is a high octane ride the rest of the way. The only other thing I can nitpick about, is Travolta's conduct as a cop, and the fact that during this time no one becomes suspicious - not noticing any behavior changes or something of the sort, until his own wife works up the nerve to take a blood sample. <br/><br/>Though it's not too terribly realistic, IMHO, it's still entertaining as hell, and anyone who likes an actioner should get this one."

","When I first heard of this movie, I was so excited to see it. And I am glad that I did. This movie has a good storyline, good character development, good acting, it is very fast paced and it has really good action sequences. This movie stars Nicolas Cage and John Travolta. In this movie the protagonist and the antagonist switch faces through a type of plastic surgery. John Travolta did a good job playing the main character who undergoes the surgery to have his face swapped with the bad guys face. He did especially well when he played the bad guy wearing the good guys face. Nicolas Cage did very well playing the bad guy who had his face removed through the surgery. And then he gets the surgeon who performed the surgery to plant the good guys face onto his. He especially did well playing the good guy wearing the bad guys face. The thing I like the most about this movie is the role reversals between the John Travolta character and the Nicolas Cage Character. Hands off to John Woo for a job well done.

","Throughout the 80's John Woo along with others like Sam Raimi and Tery Gilliam was the cult fans favorite and known to them as the best action movie maker in the world Face/Off is Woo at his over the top, furiously paced finest, the story might be highly implausible and its handling hysterical but it serves to give the film the playground that both Woo and his actors thrive in. The action scenes are tremendous, staged as only Woo really can and strangely for this usually vacuous genre there is a strange kind of social commentary about the importance of family and marriage that has been overlooked by many. Up there definitely as one of the best action/adventure films ever. I give this movie a 8 out of a 10 for being put together as a great action movie."

","What a film!! You may be able to dump two of the greatest actors in a script and maybe get away with it, but John Woo has managed to pull off a well-attached movie on the side. The action sequences are well done, the storyline intriguing enough, but the real catcher are the performances. You WILL get sucked in to the characters, and the emotional pull is fantastic. The family tie-in is sublimely performed by Joan Allen and Gina Gershon's lead, and the reversal of roles shows the mettle of the two main actors. Travolta's performance as the troubled family man in the services of the FBI was equaled only by Nic Cage's performance as Castor Troy who, if developed into a full movie, could have been one of the best ""bad guys"" of Hollywood. Don't let the title fool you - this may be one of the greatest action movies. A well-suited soundtrack, and great supporting cast - you will NOT be disappointed."

","I saw this movie when it just got out in '97 and I thought it was awesome. At 17 it was the bomb! I write this fresh from a second view and I must say (older and wiser) that Face/Off has lost some of its appeal. As a pure no-brainer-action flick it is easily on par with everything Hollywood can throw at it today and it is surely as a such it should be viewed. The action is insanely over the top as is to be expected from Woo, John T and Nicolas C's acting does small wonders with the often cheesy script and the plot, while ingenious in its concept, suffers from numerous, obviously dumb, flaws. I often found myself laughing at the turn of events (of course he wakes up without face, alone and unguarded only to sum the prior events up within 30 seconds and with a phone within grasp:-). The buildup to the epic conclusion seems strained and uninspired and the ending itself wallows in cheese.<br/><br/>To sum it up: great as a Saturday hangover movie with loads of cola and crisps or with a sixpack and a couple of buddies. Don't watch this with your...well...with anyone who likes to interrupt the action to point out that ""it wouldn't explode in real life!""...hmmm."

","A truly fantastic idea for a movie. I feel they (the film-makers) should have made it with the futuristic approach.<br/><br/>Woo and Travolta had already done this style of action flick before. Travolta, particularly when cast as Castor Troy acts like a carbon-copy of how he acted in Broken Arrow. Nicolas Cage is far better in both roles, he looks more in shape, scarier, and suitably way, way over the top, particularly as Castor Troy. The special visual and sound effects are outstanding, Woo uses his traditional slow-motion and gun-play to full-effect, also the earlier action scenes are better than in other films, Woo does action better than anyone else - forget The Matrix. Unfortunately, Cage and Travolta both look a little too old to be playing the fights out at times - hence noticeable stunt doubles. However, dark and very brutal in stages, Face/Off does look on screen like an action film that stands out from the rest- it would be interesting to see the film before the censors caught it, instead of the toned down cinema, video, DVD and TV versions. In conclusion, a must-see even 7 years after it's release."

","Nicolas Cage and John Travolta in a John Woo movie. How could this possibly fail?

The criminal falls into a coma but has left a bomb big enough to level an entire city. The cop undergoes radical surgery and has the criminal's face grafted onto his own skull, so that he looks exactly like him. He then goes into prison to ask the brother about the bomb.<br/><br/>And that's just the start of the film! It's total brain-out' popcorn fodder, but of the very highest order as Woo pulls out all the stops to create some of the most memorable action sequences in recent memory.

","For an actor, this must be great fun - to play the ultimate bad guy, and the good one, too. The former is easier than the latter, since good guys usually are pretty blank. Maybe that is evidence of good just not being natural, or at least not exciting.<br/><br/>Anyway, Travolta manages both roles, doing the good guy with small means and great care, and letting the bad guy stand out like fireworks, but still imply ambiguity, short moments on the verge of regret. Cage, though, has trouble with both. The good guy he makes a bit too sweet, and the bad guy superficial, like a parody.<br/><br/>I wonder why. Acting is a complicated art, having emotions and instinct as its sources. Probably, what an actor needs most of all is the ability to sympathize with the role, find that facet in oneself which somehow correlates to the character. It might be, then, that Travolta has more facets within himself to utilize, or more readily searches them out."

","[Lots of spoilers].  Exchanged identities always make for an interesting story when done accurately (see Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, Mark Twain's `Those Extraordinary Twins' or even Pudd'nhead Wilson), and this is one that's done right!  The substitution of identities, guises, and faces is the thrust of esteemed cult/action director John (Hard-Bolied, The Killer) Woo's Face/Off, a really weird movie.  Full of more riveting twists, layered plotlines, and nerve-racking action than just about anything since The Usual Suspects, I'm both surprised and refreshed that something this creatively twisted rolled off the Hollywood mass production line and was revered by popular culture.  Better yet, I'm happy as hell that both Nicolas Cage and John Travolta had the balls to play such bizarre characters! <br/><br/>Travolta's character, adamant FBI agent Sean Archer, goes underground to investigate the location of a biological weapon planted by his arch rival, the sadistic terrorist-for-hire who killed his son, Castor Troy (Cage).  In doing so, Archer undergoes a radical procedure in `advanced medical technology' that involves the surgical removal of Troy's face Â– it's actually transplanted onto his bare skull in order to enter prison disguised and obtain information from Castor's paranoid schizophrenic brother, Pollux (Alessandro Nivola).  But things go haywire when Troy, emerging from a coma, transforms into Archer and wreaks some serious havoc upon his life, both at work and at home. `A game of cat-and-mouse' hardly describes the paradoxical contest that Archer and Troy, each trapped in the enemy's body, engage forces in. The evil Troy goes home to Archer's wife (Joan Allen) and teenage daughter (Dominique Swain), convincing them that he's the husband and father they know.  Yes, for years, Archer has been no-nonsense and unromantic -- imagine the surprise of Archer's wife when the `new' Archer treats her like a new lover!  Meanwhile, Archer is sent to a high-security prison where the inmates wear magnetized boots that allow security to keep track of every footstep. Woo gleefully harvests Machiavellian versions of the good and bad epitome of morality and depravity, constructing a flip-flop plot that involves the families of both characters and an awesome mirror stand-off scene where both characters, trapped in the other's body, gaze at their own reflection (which in reality is the other person behind the mirror).  This is one movie you shouldn't miss!"

","I'm not sure what happened when this film came out.  It was like the John Woo Fan Club decided this was in fact the best action film ever, and those fans who could spell went on to hail it as an allegory of our times, a social commentary, a fundamental battle of good vs evil, best special effects ever, yadda yadda yadda.<br/><br/>I watched it and thought ""Hmm.  That's 2 hours of my life I won't get back.""<br/><br/>Don't misunderstand me - I'm not some hairless, vegan excuse for a man, nor am I someone who only watches impenetrable European angst dramas.  I love action movies, and I really like Nicolas Cage and John Travolta, but I thought this film was put together as some sort of showcase for the pyrotechnic stunt coordinators, and they completely forgot to plot the movie beyond a few scribblings on the back of a napkin.<br/><br/>I gave the movie 7/10, so I didn't hate it.  I thought the leads were charismatic (in a ridiculously over-the-top way), I thought Gina Gershon did a great job of looking amazing and had a few good lines, and although obvious within the plot - I enjoyed the scenes where 'Castor Troy' proves himself to be a more protective and passionate husband than 'Sean Archer', particularly the 'Al Bundy-esque' scenes with the daughter's boyfriend.<br/><br/>That said, I remember the PR interviews at the time going on and on about how Cage & Travolta spent ages studying each other's mannerisms to 'pretend' to be the other one under his skin.  Well, I've seen more restrained subtlety on Saturday morning kids TV, and that whole touchy-face thing Archer does is ridiculous to the point of comedy - even a particularly touchy-feely blind person wouldn't stroke everybody's face every time he sees them!  And although I feel a little guilty about saying it, I don't think Joan Allen was a very convincing casting (and that's not a comment on her acting) - just on the fact that she could almost have played Travolta's mother.  With the notable exception of Gershon, Troy's gang were a forgettable bunch of characatured misfits, and his brother (Pillox?) was an unsympathetic nuisance.<br/><br/>On the action itself - the 'stopping the plane taking off' was silly, the gunfight in the hanger was silly (reminded me of the A-Team's shooting accuracy, only without the humour), the very notion of an FBI agent secretly undergoing a radical (and speedy) complete face-lift was laughable (Darkman was more convincing), the magnetic-boots prison was straight out of a Christopher Lambert movie, I couldn't concentrate anyway because Archer's boss and the prison bully-guard were both in Fargo, the prison scenes were cliched and dumb, the moments where Archer turns to Troy's friends were predictable and not very well acted, the FBI raid was another triumph of OTT destruction (and that mirror face-off, well - silly).. ..I did like the scenes where Troy plays Archer's father/husband role.. ..then we're back to a cliched shootout in a chapel (John Woo - your white doves just look like a spoof-joke now..  and (c)Reservoir Dogs for the stand-off - I don't care where it may have been done before), the speedboat chase which was WAY below James Bond standard (pretty poor actually), and then the mega-obvious harpoon gun setup, leading to a convenient happy ending.<br/><br/>I watched Face/Off on TV again (it's about the third time now), because I wanted to consider it again, and you know what - it was still silly rubbish. Entertaining rubbish, but still rubbish.<br/><br/>PS. I really liked Mission Impossible 2, so I'm not totally against Woo either.  Still, if I want to see top-notch action, I'll choose Dobermann or Leon anyday.<br/><br/>PPS.

"b-a-h TNT-6","6","0","0","26 May 2002"," Action, action, action... ok, enough...
","Spoiler Alert Most of the people who like John Woo seem to like him because of his mastery at shooting action scenes. While I am not a conossieur of Woo's cinematic career, after witnessing Mission: Impossible II -- a film that was as big a box office success as it was a debacle in the creativity department -- and the superior Face/Off, I must say that while Woo's talent at putting action onscreen is noteworthy, it seems also his biggest weakness. Under his direction, explosions and stylized cartoon-like violence are sometimes superbly done, sometimes overlong and overblown; but the real problem with Woo's action is when it grows obtrusive and it becomes tedium in a script that should have been tight and tense. Mission: Impossible II was all tedium, and it constantly resorted to slow-mo shootings and explosions to hide the fact that the script was as lame as they come. Face/Off, despite the preposterous premise, has a script that is tight and intense in more than one occasion, but that also goes limp towards the end when more than a few interesting plot points are simply shaken off by action sequences.<br/><br/>Sean Archer (John Travolta) is a FBI agent who, during an attempt to stop the notorious master criminal Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage) lost his young son. Archer, a man dedicated to his family and his job, struggles with the pain caused by the loss and is looking forward to finally arrest Troy; six years later the occasion finally comes and, after a sensational airplane chase, Archer captures both Castor Troy's brother Pollux (Alessandro Nivola) and Castor Troy himself who, victim of an accident, is taken to an hospital in an apparently irreversible coma. Buth things are not as easy as they seem.<br/><br/>Apparently, a major bomb had been planted somewhere in Los Angeles and the two criminal brothers are the only ones who know where it is located and how to disarm it. But as Pollux -- who does not know about his brother's accident -- refuses to reveal any details unless he can speak to Castor, there is nothing left to do but have Sean Archer himself go through a few cosmetic changes, a little bit of liposuction, and a facial surgery to (gulp!) wear Castor Troy's real face! And what if the real Castor Troy suddenly wakes up and 'wears' Archer's face, so that one looks exactly like the other? Yep, you've guessed it right.<br/><br/>I heard a lot of people complaining about how 'unrealistic' and 'unbelievable' the premise is. Well people, get over it. Blaming this film of being unrealistic is like blaming Being John Malkovich of the same thing. I am as picky as the next guy when it comes to implausibility, but there are movies meant to be realism and movies that are not. Suspension of disbelief, and tons of it, is obviously essential for Face/Off.<br/><br/>Providing we accept the impossible premise, the film stays for the most part enjoyable, before it eventually goes overboard and becomes a chaotic action overkill. We are provided with a plot, the swap of identities, that has been used a lot of times in cinema and literary works, especially for comedies. Here however, it is used with dramatic efficacy in quite a few scenes, and it delivers some scenes that are emotionally engaging and tense, and that at times even scratch the surface of intellectually challenging material. Not that script is without flaws; the sequence where Sean Archer (now played by Nicolas Cage!) escapes from a maximum security prison, for instance, is quite sloppy and hard to digest. But seeing the two arch-enemies exploring each other's world and trying to cope with it, thereby becoming the other person, is definitely interesting.<br/><br/>This also brings me to the bad part of the movie; while Face/Off does not have the ambition of being a 'thought-provoking' or philosophical movie, I simply do not understand the need of shaking off certain plot points through overlong action scenes whose outcome is absolutely predictable. Also, action -- no matter how well shot -- is involving as long as it is used with parsimony; the initial sequence that leads to the arrest of the Troy brothers is perfect, because it stops before getting tiresome. The final hero vs. villain sequence not only is overlong, but it does not feel right: suddenly, everything between the two enemies -- including a hint at emotional attachment to each other's world -- is resolved by a sequence where all the villains die and all the good people stay alive, and where people miss their targets whenever the director feels like we need to see more. It feels as the film is afraid of having become a thriller more than an action movie.<br/><br/>The acting by the two leads is fairly good. Neither of them is between my favorite actors, but I enjoyed them much more here than I did in many other movies.<br/><br/>Face/Off is both a moderate success and a moderate failure but, despite all its flaws, gets my recommendation. Although I doubt Woo will ever become one of my favorite directors, I must say that this film gave me the impression that he can, indeed, do good things.<br/><br/>6/10"

And that's the problem - John Woo has made a lot of films and I'm afraid he has ran out of ideas, and those ideas in Face/Off have been done before, only much better.<br/><br/>His first american movie (Hard Target) was very subdued and the choice of Van Damme made the film just another run-of-the-mill action movie.<br/><br/>Broken Arrow was only slightly better, this time he managed to get a couple of decent actors, but you still feel that Woo doesn't have full directorial control in this movie and it just kind of stumbles towards its predictable conclusion.<br/><br/>With Face/Off, you have to be able to suspend your disbelief, but I'm sorry - face and body swapping - er, very hard to believe.

","FACE/OFF isn't really your same old action guy film, but it's original in terms of John Woo's style of directing. This is the first movie I've seen from the guy who gave us HARD-BOILED, and obviously, Hollywood needs him more than B.B.B.B. (Big Budget Block Busters, to be exact). What I have learned is that his films have a distinctive trademark: the guy holding two guns at one time. The question of the hour is: will it appeal to everybody? Pretty much to say, yes, thanks to the familiar ""faces"" of John Travolta and Nicholas Cage, who swap skins in beating the living hell out of each other. Some more face-to-face action would've been appreciated for this ultra-lengthy feature that has you wondering when it's going to be over, but both are truly incredible in the well-crafted action bits given. I felt Cage fared better overall, but Travolta, still showing off his grinny expression, proves that a Hollywood comeback requires a much needed and much stronger level of momentum. There's so much here that it has you shrouded in mystery about what's going to happen later on, and who will win at the end? FACE/OFF is unusually strange in its storyline, so maybe a few more viewings would help gain some better understanding (please, I've seen enough of 140 minutes already!). Comedianne Margaret Cho is an unexpected surprise here, trading her stand-up comedy routines for dramatic roles. John Woo could be a driving force behind Hollywood action / intrigue movies in the coming years, and is he making anymore lately? Let's hope so!"

"FilmFlaneur","Null","0","0","12 April 2001"," Woo's Best American Picture so Far
","After a rocky start with 'Hard Target', Woo's early American film career continued in an upward trajectory with the underrated 'Broken Arrow', before culminating in this film, a highly characteristic deconstruction of the American thriller. (One might argue that then a disconcerting falling-off began with 'Mission Impossible 2', but that's another matter.) Once again Woo uses Travolta to good effect, establishing him as a preferred actor only this time in a plot that is, to say the least, bizarre. 'Face/Off' - at least to those who carp about such things - is unrealistic, unconvincing and, frequently, just down right silly. In this film it seems, the 'willing suspension of disbelief' has to be suspended so high, and so frequently, that it is almost out of sight.<br/><br/>But criticisms circling around the questionable realism of the film are missing the point. Woo comes from a film-making tradition where 'common sense' and 'logic' (particularly in action/fantasy pictures) are not considered by viewers as important as they are to audiences here. Stunts and plot lines regularly defy what would be our natural expectations and logic, grounded as we are in the different Western, realist tradition. In his film Woo uses the distancing, and peculiar advantage, that this cultural difference brings, creating an ironic comment on the action film, as well as indulging his own thematic obsessions. <br/><br/>The 'face/off' procedure is simply a plot device, a MacGuffin (to borrow Hitchcock's term for a red herring) allowing Woo's exploration of these concerns. In this light, it's not important that the operation is plainly absurd, or that Cage and Travolta are obviously different body shapes. What matters is the play that this change thereafter allows the director on identity, moral values, audience expectation, acting styles  - and all the rest.<br/><br/>As if the underline this, Woo has the actors make a unique, artificial 'face off' movement (down the face with their hands) when the magic words are spoken on screen, a visible mantra to the whole procedure. The implausibility is thereby *emphasised*, not hidden, a dramatic device made into a flourish, not a liability. Woo in short doesn't care about plausibility, because his true concerns lay elsewhere.<br/><br/>But the sniffing at Woo's substantial achievement continues. Yet no one criticises Franju's 'Les Yeux Sans Visage' - which is equally ridiculous in its central conceit - even though there we are supposed to take the operation seriously. Perhaps because this type of event is 'allowed' without raised eyebrows, in our regular horror tradition we wave it through. In Frankenheimer's 'Seconds', to take another example, Rock Hudson is miraculously (and to my mind absurdly) created out of a body of a shorter, middle aged man. 'Seconds' is a (good) film without a post-modern idea in its head - yet has won plaudits because of the wider social issues it addresses away from the unconvincing new identity-creation.<br/><br/>'Face/Off', in short, requires a more sophisticated response from some critics and action fans than it has so far received. A comparison with some of the less complex and more mindless action pictures that appeared at the same time (the overrated 'The Rock' for instance) reveals considerable strengths and virtues. Whereas other action films come and go, 'Face/Off' remains obstinately in the mind, teasing the genre, inviting repeated viewings."

It was a good film, but kind of reminded me of Broken Arrow, the Rock, Die Hard, etc etc.  Maybe its cause they have the same stars, but I think it has more to do with the similarities.  They represent the evolution of the action film over the decades.  We go from Dirty Hairy to Die Hard, to the Matrix, and beyond. What will be the next evolution is not known, but I hope it doesn't end up like Mission Impossible 2 (which is also a John Woo film).  Mission Impossible 2 was like to action, how Spinal Tap was to Rock and Roll.  It completely exposes the excess, and how too much can be a bad thing. Anyways, you have to wonder how John Travolta's wife in the movie didn't notice that something was wrong with her husband when the two main characters made the switch.  ""Honey, did you get smaller at work?""  ""Honey, your nipples are hairy now.""  ""Honey, why is your (you know what) now 12 inches?""  Just little problematic things that she should have noticed.

","Going into 'Face/Off' I was expecting something along the lines of 'Speed' (my favourite action film), and because of this I felt a little cheated coming out. The movie is unlike most of today's high-tech big budget action movies, it feels more like a Hong Kong kung fu movie without the kung fu than anything else I've ever seen. In 'Broken Arrow', John Woo's previous outing (also starring John Travolta), the characters are big, larger than life, even a little cartoonish, and that's what made the movie so enjoyable. Here there is absolutely none of that, almost no humor in the script (Travolta- who was a great over the top villain in the previous film, seems to have no fun here). Even so, the movie is still well worth seeing, especially for the brilliantly executed action sequences<br/><br/>	One thing that really got to me after a while lies in the sound and script. Even other sound heard in the movie is either a gunshot, or a character saying the name 'Sean'. You'd think that after a couple dozen times we'd get the point that the main character's name is Sean. God. That and Castor, a name that was uttered at least thirty times.<br/><br/>	Much of the movie was dark and grungy, harder to sit through thaan the warm and sunny 'Broken Arrow' or 'Speed'. It was very different from most of today's movies, and that can be both a good thing and a bad thing. Thankfully the movie features powerhouse performances from both Travolta, and especially Nicolas Cage, in his best performance since 'Leaving Las Vegas'.<br/><br/>	It's easy to see where the hugely massive budget went, since it obviously didn't go to the supporting cast, which is littered with names no one has ever or will ever hear(d) of. Instead it went towards the action sequences, which, as I've already mentioned, are the best part of the movie.<br/><br/>	One odd thing is that for the last five minutes, the movie quickly changes tone, which is actually quite effective, and just reinforces the fact that Travolta's comeback wasn't a fluke<br/><br/>	See it only if you're a fan of Travolta, Cage or Woo, otherwise you're likely to be disappointed.<br/><br/>6/10"

","Director John Woo really shows his talents off with this entertaining film that is part Sci-Fi and action/drama. Castor Troy(Nicolas Cage)is an eccentric bad ass who's planted a bomb that will blow up a good chunk of Los Angeles. Sean Archer(John Travolta)is the Fed Agent who through a revolutionary medical procedure takes the face of an unconscious Troy to find the whereabouts of the bomb. While the real Archer is in prison in Troy's stead; the real Troy takes on the appearance of Archer. Both men portray the other so well that their confrontation and revelation of the switch makes for a fantastic finale.<br/><br/>Travolta and Cage must have had fun honing the other's detailed mannerisms and moves. Both turn in an incredible performance. Also in the cast are: Joan Allen, Alessandro Nivola, Dominique Swain and the most alluring Gina Gershon."

","This is a basically bad movie unless you just want to sit back and enjoy off the hook performances from Nick Cage and John Travolta.  Both stars were great, playing both parts.  The plot, simple-minded and unbelievable, tries hard to screw up their fun.  <br/><br/>Apparently, the two main characters are indestructible; no matter what is done to them they survive in fighting trim.  Everyone else, well they are just a bunch of goonoid targets.<br/><br/>Spoiler Alert<br/><br/>The movie begins with the murder of a child (a time honored movie no-no). We are shown major surgeries with no scars, no healing time or after effects. We are asked to accept that Nick and John have similar head types, body styles, shoe sizes, etc. We are treated to gun battles galore in which elite cops and FBI couldn't hit the broad side of a barn with multiple clips in their Uzis.  And wasn't that boat chase right out of James Bond?<br/><br/>Despite all this, I enjoyed the picture because the two stars were great, having lots of fun with it, and were both on the screen almost all the time."

","This is a decent action movie with a great premise.<br/><br/>The only problem I had with premise is that it's impossible. The doctors in the movie say that changing Archer and Troy's identities around is simple, and the face swapping thing in the movie is believable but when the procedure is done Archer's skull all the sudden changed in to Troy's and the movie says nothing about this.<br/><br/>The other big problem I had with this movie is that sometimes in action scenes Archer and Troy are clearly not Cage and Travolta but they're stunt-actors. The all actions scenes were great though, I can't really single out one because they're all equally great, but if I had to pick a favorite it would be the one in the church because it's a typical John Woo scene. This movie also made good use of slow-motion and definitely didn't over use it, and it really deserved the Oscar nomination for it's sound effects editing.<br/><br/>As far as the acting goes I definitely preferred Travolta because he did a great job acting like Cage. But Cage wasn't bad either he just did his standard overacting, but it worked perfectly for the role so I really enjoyed his performance.<br/><br/>So because I just couldn't except the identity changing but it was a nice idea and the movie had good action and acting I give this movie 7,3."
"bowmanblue","8","2","5","16 March 2015"," One of the most over-the-top films ever made (and great fun too)
","'Face/Off' is a kind of simple film for simple people (and I'm including myself in that demographic). Take one bad guy (Nicholas Cage – cranked up to 11) and then, through a series of bizarre and totally implausible events, he finds himself with his face – literally – swapped with the good guy/cop (John Travolta –also doing his best to crank his performance up to 11) who's out to catch him. Now, no one believes which one is which and the two of them start trying to take over each other's lives (while trying to murder each other, obviously).<br/><br/>If that brief plot summary hasn't made you ask more than a few questions regarding the hows and whys of it all, then you really are an expert at suspending your disbelief. Most people would already be picking holes in the story. So, if you're looking for a watertight plot with no holes in it, you probably should really skip this one.<br/><br/>Luckily, Face/Off his just so much fun that you'll find it easy to gloss over the general absurdities of it all, sit back, break open the popcorn and just roll with it. It is one of the most obviously over-the-top films ever made and, if the plot wasn't over-the-top enough, then the two leads – Cage and Travolta – spend the film constantly trying to outdo each other as to how extreme they can make their performances. So, take the over-the-top film, add the completely over-the-top performances then, just to finish it off, add the completely unrealistic gunfights and those weird 'Hollywood-type' explosions where fireworks seem to shoot out of the flames.<br/><br/>What you effectively have here is a B-movie with a decent cast and budget. It carries the film through and will always elevate it over the general mediocre action flicks that go straight to DVD. Basically, it's a classic – not in the same way as the 'Godfather' or 'Empire Strikes Back,' but it is a classic for what it is – and what it is is big, dumb, stupid fun. So, if you can appreciate that sort of film, you should definitely get something out of this.<br/><br/>Best bit: Nicholas Cage dressed as a priest 'headbanging' in a chorus. I will remember that until the day I die."

","John Woo certainly knows how to deliver an action movie. <br/><br/>Plot In A Paragraph: FBI Agent Sean Archer (John Travolta) is still grieving for his dead son Michael. His son's killer is a powerful master criminal, Castor Troy (Nic Cage) When Archer finally captures Castor, (in a battle that leaves Troy in a coma) he finds out that Troy has planted a bomb that will destroy the entire city of Los Angeles. Unfortunately the only other person who knows its location is Castor's brother Pollux, and he refuses to talk. So Archer undergoes a special operation by a doctor that can cut off people's faces, and can place a person's face onto another person. However, Troy somehow regains consciousness and now wants revenge. <br/><br/>Both Nic Cage (his fourth good movie in a row, following ""Leaving Las Vegas"", ""The Rock"" and ""Con Air"") and and John Travolta (Still riding high after ""Pulp Fiction) have put in some awful performances over the years, but both of them are in top form here. Dominique Swain is fine as Jamie, Travolta's daughter as is Gina Gershon and Thomas Jane in his small role.<br/><br/>The plot is ridiculous, but when has that ever mattered in an action movie?? It's a fun ride all the same. Thanks mainly to the performances of the two leads. My bug bearer of policemen and killers never being able to hit the target when it actually matters, is here and sadly in great supply. <br/><br/>Interestingly Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone were originally in mind to play the lead roles, but when John Woo was brought in to direct, he decided to go with John Travolta and Nic Cage."

That is probably even more annoying than the horrid acting.

"jboothmillard","8","2","5","8 November 2005"," Face/Off
","The title of the film refers to two things, the battle between the villain and the hero, and literally faces coming off, from director John Woo (Broken Arrow, Mission: Impossible II). Basically Sean Archer (John Travolta) lost his little boy when he was killed (accidently) by the evil Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage). Five years on, Sean manages to catch Troy, and he is put in a coma, but he did not stop a bomb set before. To find the bomb, he has to question Troy's brother Pollux (Jurassic Park III's Alessandro Nivola) in prison, and the only way he can do this is to become him, with the latest surgery they can transplant Castor's face and connect it to his. Sean as Castor now in prison manages to fool the brother into telling the location of the bomb, but he wasn't counting on the real Castor waking up from his coma (because of the pain) and taking his face! Sean is very angry when Castor tells him he'll be banging his wife Dr. Eve Archer (The Bourne Supremacy's Joan Allen), but he manages to escape the prison, and is now on the run, and hiding out in Castor's hideouts till he get to his wife and convince her it is him underneath the face she so fears. What is really interesting is both men have to see the family lives they both share, Castor (as Sean don't forget) has to see the grave stone of the boy he killed, and Sean (vice versa) finds out that Castor has a son with on-off lover Sasha Hassler (Bound's Gina Gershon), oh, and Sean does manage eventually to convince his wife that behind the face of Castor he is him, but in the end, after the final large fight Castor had to die, Sean gets his face back, and because Sasha died, the son lives with his family. Also starring Dominique Swain as Jamie Archer, Nick Cassavetes as Dietrich Hassler, Patch Adams' Harve Presnell as Victor Lazarro, Colm Feore as Dr. Malcolm Walsh and Volcano's John Carroll Lynch as Walton the Prison Guard. Travolta and Cage play each other perfectly, and the chase sequences and violence is really cool. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Sound Effects Editing. John Travolta was number 46, and Nicolas Cage number 33 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Travolta was also number 38 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, he was number 63 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and he was also number 46 on The World's Greatest Actor.

What is this - the Good Bits Messiah for Cretins?  But then, all of ""Face/Off"" is similarly mangled and over-edited.<br/><br/>The basic conceit is silly, not that it's the silliness I object to - Sean Archer (played by John Travolta and Nicholas Cage) swaps faces with Castor Troy (played by Nicholas Cage and John Travolta).  I mean, literally. Archer and Troy don't just disguise themselves as one another; they literally SWAP FACES.  Imagine a film predating heart transplants, in which the hero and villain (again, literally) swap hearts.  Is that gross, or what?  Well, this is grosser.  I wouldn't have minded in the least if the face-swapping had been non-literal, and accomplished by supernatural means, but it isn't: we actually SEE the gruesome medical procedure, and thereafter it's hard to look at either actor's face without shuddering.<br/><br/>Ugh.<br/><br/>I find it hard to believe that Woo believed in what he was doing in this film - while the almost-as-silly ""Mission: Impossible 2"" had visual poetry, ""Face/Off"" just has visual gimmickry, and, I swear, twice as many edits. (Should I see Woo's earlier, Hong Kong work?  No doubt I should.

I thought it was completely lacking in credibility on almost every level. If there was a deeper meaning, I must have missed it. Travolta's performance was so over the top I found it difficult to watch most of his scenes. I did think there were some bright spots: Cage was pretty good after the ""switch"", and the supporting cast did fairly well, though most of them were given little to work with. The action scenes were fairly impressive, but I felt at least half of them had little to no relevance to what was going on.

The script has lots of logical errors, like a governmental agency lead by an emotionally involved man. Really, Sean Archer would only do some archival work, if anything, after losing his son through a sniper. And what about his marriage? I cannot understand (in any movie), how a stressed marriage is rescued just by some shoot outs? And why is it just a handful of bullets that can make ""wild"" teenager into good suburban citizens? And why does nobody wonder how (the wrong) Archer could possibly deactivate the big bomb in just one minute when all the experts could not do it in hours?<br/><br/>And what of Cage and Travolta -- well, I haven't seen this much hamming (especially on Travolta's side) since ...

","I remember watching this in the cinema in November 1997 with 698 other people (a full house) and only me and my pal hated it. Which is weird because I expected it to be great. The original script for the film had it set in the future but Woo insisted it be written in present day to not distract the audience. But the only thing that distracted me was how dull the film was.<br/><br/>Since coming to Hollywood John Woo has done little to impress. He mad a very strong debut with Hard Target but the film was cut to shreds and the impact severely muted. Broken Arrow was thoroughly unexciting and Face/Off is not much better.<br/><br/>The bulk of the blame lies not with Woo but with Travolta. As Sean Archer he's fine. But as soon as he becomes Castor Troy he turns the camp all the way up to 11. Face/Off eventually becomes an unashamed pantomime. Cage, as both characters, is very good. But Travolta takes Troy to the same place he took Vic Deakins in Broken Arrow. It's like he assumes that no matter what he does, it's automatically cool because IT'S A JOHN WOO FILM. Sorry, but that logic doesn't work out in real life.<br/><br/>The plot, while being crafty, doesn't really do much. Exactly what does Troy plan after becoming Archer? To look like his enemy for the rest of his life? If not it was a bad idea burning down the Plastic Surgery Joint then. Some interesting imagery is used and the subtext gives the movie a sharper edge despite its superficial appearance. All the 'gun ballet' stuff does is glamorise guns. And that's becoming real old hat.<br/><br/>Weird tho, when you think that this film is written by the folks that gave us The Mask and Death Wish V: The Face of Death. And John Woo would also dabble in face swapping later on with Mission: Impossible 2.<br/><br/>

"Horst_In_Translation","6","1","2","7 January 2020"," Extremely unrealistic, but a lot of fun at times
","""Face/Off"" is an American (mostly) English-language live action film from 1997, so this one is already over 20 years old, getting closer to 25 in fact, and it is a pretty long movie at almost 2 hours and 20 minutes. The director is John Woo and, fittingly with Asian filmmakers also making big waves these days, here we have a really successful and prolific Chinese director who made many films in his own country, but this one here is maybe his most known Hollywood movie. It is also a definite contender for most known for writers Werb and Colleary. As for the cast: You see the two big players already on the poster here on imdb. Reading this is about a cop and a terrorist, I initially thought Travolta would be the bad guy, but nope it is the other way around. Or is it really? Actually I was right if we consider the face change for the majority of the film. Just not in terms of beginning and end. Okay, I listed the actors already. Travolta was an Oscar nominee at that point and Cage just won his Oscar for ""Leaving Las Vegas"" right before this film was made. The biggest supporting player is Joan Allen, actually the only supporting player with decent baity material, and if we believe awards bodies she was also at her peak back then scoring two Oscar nominations in the mid-90s. But this film here did not score any acting Academy Award noms. It did get in for sound though and it seems accurate, for it is maybe the film's best aspect. Technically, it is a pretty good film for sure. I am generally not too big on action sequences and I must say I did not enjoy them as much here as others did maybe, but the early scene with the airplane, then the big spectacular shootout at the terrorists' headquarter and finally the boat scene weren't too bad. As for the shootout I mentioned in the middle, they used a somewhat different version of Judy Garland's ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" and that was an interesting pick obviously chosen to create a great deal of contrast there because all we see is bullets flying around, people being killed and lots of screaming and at the same time we hear such a harmonic tune. I wished it could have really worked, but it did not. At least not for me.<br/><br/>Anyway, I already said in the title that this is a very unrealistic film. It definitely is. Even if we do not focus too much on the general idea of scientists being able to give one character's face to another and people really think immediately it is him, there is a lot more I can only accept from the guilty pleasure perspective. Like the moment Cage's character sees his bloody face, he immediately knows what to do and has a plan. I mean I don't say they should have him go insane like many probably would, but come on at least give him like a day or two to calm down and understand what happened. Yes he is a very capable and straight-forward guy, but still. Next example would be how they actually managed to kill everybody who knew about the face change (somewhat perfect title for this film really). I mean how would they know who was involved. And also how does his boss not know (the one with the heart attack later on). Archer (not Sterling) seems like such a role model who would always follow protocol, so I think the boss definitely should have known. Another thing I found hard to believe is that there is apparently no time for the face to recover and it is all fixed immediately, no pain, no rest, nothing. I mean Travolta's character even gets punched hard to the face when in jail and this may not be the very best idea taking into account the surgery he just had. And still it's not a problem. Also the film takes place in 1997 as we see on one occasion, so if they had moved it to the year 2030 or so, then maybe I could say okay with what according to them science could do in 2030 it is acceptable, but just telling us there are secret programs that made this possible in 1997 does not work for me. Speaking about the prison, there I thought it was unrealistic that he somewhat manages to bond with the guy who really hated him because he slept with his wife and sister and this came so out of nowhere before he got the electric shocks that I find it difficult to believe this was all his plan and he knew it would work. Too much concidence. Also not very credible how he really got away from the island in the end. Sometimes he felt like a superhero and his thirst for revenge and for getting his life/wife back can only explain so much. So yeah, I think it is a very unrealistic film all in all, even if we accept the idea that a guy actually agrees to give up his face (even if just for a while) and it all works out from the surgery perspective. I mean even that in the end he gets his old face back as if nothing happened. Unreal.<br/><br/>But there are good moments too, many actually. I liked all the parts that involved Allen's character. Her not knowing that she stands at her son's grave with the actual killer was a really tense moment. Or also her actual husband trying to convince her who he really is. This was nicely done and handled, also the way Allen acted in all these scenes. If anybody deserved an acting nomination from the cast, then it would have been her. It was a challenging role and I cannot criticize anything. I mean the idea of her not knowing it is somebody else when seeing him naked or even having sex is difficult to grasp, but let's be real here. How could she? The truth is so absurd. So as for the two leads, I am writing this as somebody who likes Travolta. More than Cage at least, but both had okay moments. The scenes with the daughter were awkwardly funny like how he would really be interested in screwing her, but it may be difficult as she thinks he is her dad, even if all of a sudden a much more virile version. Also I mention the scene with the suitor in the car. Now it's always fun to see Travolta beat up others no denying. How actually the bad guy gives her the knife afterwards was also a smart inclusion with how she uses it against him eventually. Or how she apologises to her real dad at the very end worked well too, comedically and dramatically. Maybe storywise they could have done more with the scar Travolta's character has. And there are some smart parallels here. Like how both characters act towards the other's kids. Made me also wonder if Cage's character could have turned out differently had he known he has a boy. Or how they act towards each other's loves. Not sure if ""love"" is the right word for Cage's character. At the end, there is of course the super happy ending that the orphan boy now gets a new family and the family at the center of the film gets a new member. Not a replacament for the son, but maybe something they can give all the love that was taken from them back in the day. So overall, this film is not a failure. You just should not watch it if you are in the mood for an authentic realistic crime thriller because for that, it is just too absurd on many occasions. I explained these occasions before. Still, if you like Travolta and Cage or love at least one from the duo, then this is absolutely worth seeing. The supporting cast is also solid, even if most of them have only one scene. I can see why it has such a high rating here on imdb, but the fact that also critics loved it apparently I must admit surprises me a bit. I thought they would have been harsher here. So from me it is a thumbs-up for this movie. Not one of my favorites from its year, but I say that you can go watch it if you haven't already."

","John Woo is well known for his action films. Some are good, some aren't. Face/Off could have been among his best and also among one of the best action films ever made. But Woo insisted on one major drawback throughout the entire film. His ridiculous and continuous use of slow motion during virtually every single action scene, and there are probably dozens.
 If Woo had a scene where a bicycle flew off a cliff he'd have it explode. There's no such scene in this movie thank goodness, but I wouldn't put it past him. Explosions can be highly entertaining but only if they fit the scene. Blowing up everything in sight just because you can is lazy. Apparently the majority of reviewers here fell for Woo's lame tricks where instead of him saying watch my movie he's screaming look at me. Oh well, what can you expect in a world filled with sheep?"

"sme_no_densetsu","6","1","2","14 September 2015"," Ridiculous, over the top & clichéd
","""Face/Off"" stands as John Woo's best received Hollywood film and a minor action classic. The story concerns an FBI agent (John Travolta) who undergoes a surgical procedure to impersonate a notorious criminal (Nicolas Cage) in the hopes of thwarting a terror plot. Unfortunately for him, the tables are turned when said criminal then impersonates him and kills all who are aware of his transformation.<br/><br/>The far-fetched premise is an easy target for detractors of the movie but I don't think it's too bad in and of itself. For me, the thing that sinks the movie is that this is only one in a long series of unlikely and sometimes logic-defying situations cooked up by the screenwriters. Fans say that the movie isn't meant to be taken seriously but I disagree; the movie sometimes tries to be serious and is all the more laughable because of it.<br/><br/>When it comes to the leads, Travolta & Cage let loose with some of the most over the top acting of their careers (which is saying something). While this can be entertaining to a certain degree, it's overdone to such an extent that the characters quickly become cartoonish. The supporting cast is actually pretty decent but, unfortunately, the script saddles everyone with hackneyed material.<br/><br/>Being a John Woo film, I was expecting at least some quality in the action scenes but even those seemed to be uninspired. His trademarks are in evidence throughout but the set-pieces are ultimately more style than substance. Woo's direction of the dramatic scenes is likewise glossy, sometimes distractingly so.<br/><br/>In the end, I expect that ""Face/Off"" is one of those 'love it or hate it' movies. I can't say that I absolutely hate it but I definitely don't think that it deserves the amount of praise that it gets. If you can look past (or embrace) the movie's many nonsensical elements and the rampant overacting you may well enjoy it."

","When 'Face/Off' first came out in 1997, it was impressive but not great. However I co-incidentally watched the movie again, seventeen years on and I truly loved it. Perhaps some parts of the film and more notably the epic performances of Nicholas Cage and John Travolta may have been missed first time around. Both Cage and Travolta are brilliant as they play the roles of good and evil, with Nicholas Cage giving his best career performance as psychopathic 'Castor Troy'. The film has great action, which in itself is never enough, what it also has is drama, emotion and interesting female characters. This is not often the case with action orientated movies but Face/Off is more than that, it is an experience of 90's movies at it's best !!"

"needie94","10","1","2","26 April 2014"," The Ultimate Face Off
","Most people have this overall idea that action films involving shootouts and violence are generally for guys only; however, as a female, I do enjoy a good action film every now and then. Face/Off is an awesome example of a good action film that is sure to amaze. With the use of two dynamic Hollywood actors, intense shootout scenes, and visuals that appear to be realistic; it was sure to capture my attention. In the movie, John Travolta plays the well-loved, good FBI Agent, Sean Archer, that is bound-determined to put the evil, vindictive Nicholas Cage's character, Castor Troy, behind bars for the murder of his son. However, in order for him to accomplish this, Archer must find a way to get inside Troy's head and figure out what he can do to stop him. The only, what seemed to be reasonable solution at the time, was for him to trade physical features (more specifically faces) with Castor Troy. This gives Archer an open view into the deadly secrets of Troy; however, what would happen if Castor got a hold of Archer's face? Absolute chaos, and that's exactly what happens. Sean Archer with Troy's face, and Castor Troy with Archer's face. So what makes this movie so great? The John Travolta and Nicholas Cage character switch-up. Travolta as the evil, vindictive character, Troy, was humorously interesting. He gave the character a little bit of flare through his evil charm to take over good-cop Archer's family and gave the audience a laugh when he covered up his face-change to Archer's daughter by telling her ""Papa's gotta a brand new bag. Ow!"" as he left her room. In comparison, Nicholas Cage, the now defenseless Archer eager to get his life back, plays the character with a more exposure of emotion as he struggles to get his life back to the way it was. <br/><br/>As most people know this is an action film, but what they don't know is how intense and suspenseful the shoot-outs are. There are many parts of the movie that are pretty intense, like when Castor Troy (as John Travolta) is on one side of a mirror and Sean Archer (as Nicholas Cage) is on the other side. They're both aware of each other's being as they communicate back and forth. Then, when Troy states ""Plan B, let's just kill each other"". They both turn to look into the mirror and fire their guns; this penetrates to an extreme shootout that ends with someone falling through a ceiling window. Throughout the whole scene, and movie, you're on the end of your seat wondering what's going to happen next, which is very exciting! <br/><br/>Have you ever been in an operating room and witnessed a surgery? If not, here's your chance. The graphics and visuals of the face transfer scene when John Travolta's face is lasered off and put on Nicholas Cage's body seems so real that it's hard to believe that it's not. The use of taking the measurements of their faces and using computer software makes it work. Not to mention they even level out the hair length and color to make it look the same. Realistically you know it didn't happen; however, it's hard to not believe because of how legit it actually looks. All in all, this is a great movie that will leave you on the end of your seat. If you like intensity, realistic graphics and visuals, and a twist to the common good guy verse bad guy storyline; this is the movie for you!"
"PassPopcorn","8","1","2","19 July 2013"," Pass the Popcorn review
","Everyone knows that both John Travolta and Nicolas Cage have strange acting careers – both of them starred in some great movies and both of them starred in some awful movies. Actually, nowadays it seems they act only in awful-to-average movies, which is a shame since I think both of them are talented actors. Face/Off is a 1997 action movie directed by the famous action movie director John Woo and it serves as a proof of how Cage and Travolta are really good actors. And it's also one of the better movies in both their careers.<br/><br/>Face/Off is a story about two men – one is a cop named Sean Archer (John Travolta) and one is a crazy terrorist named Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage). Troy has killed Archer's son several years ago and since then the two have been mortal enemies. One day Archer finally manages to capture Troy and accidentally puts him in a coma – but not before he finds out the place where Troy has put a bomb meant to explode in a couple of days. So, Archer undergoes heavy surgery and switches faces with Troy in an attempt to speak with Castor Troy's brother - Pollux Troy (Alessandro Nivola) – and find out where they planted the bomb. The plan backfires when Castor Troy wakes up from his coma and takes Archer's face. The two then start a dangerous game of cat and mouse.<br/><br/>The best thing about Face/Off are the performances. Both Cage and Travolta had to play two completely different people with completely different personalities; and they were very successful in doing so. Interestingly enough both of them are better at playing the eccentric lunatic Castor Troy than in playing the part of the stoic cop Sean Archer. And if history taught us anything, it is that Nicolas Cage is absolutely amazing in playing crazy people. In the beginning of the movie, we see Cage dressed up as a priest who starts headbanging and dancing in front of a choir that is singing Hallelujah. If that's not a good enough reason to see this movie, I don't know what is. Although this is mainly a performance driven movie, the action in it is pretty decent and some action scenes were brilliantly directed.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, other action scenes appeared to me as somewhat pretentious and overblown, mostly towards the end of the movie. This isn't necessarily a bad thing in action movies but it goes completely against the depressive tone of the rest of the movie. Face/Off is essentially a movie about identity crisis and dealing with the possibility of someone else living with your family; it doesn't need exaggerated action scenes. However, in spite of that, Face/Off is still a fun movie with wonderful performances that will leave you satisfied. It is a rather worthy collaboration of two talented actors who deserve much more out of their careers.<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/"
"huigodehuigelaar","8","1","2","26 June 2013"," sin A Special Agent, determined to take revenge on a freewheeling terrorist and slayer of his son, changes faces with his worst enemy in order to save the day.
","This a review I wrote for my blog (cagedcinema.tumblr.com) When I started this blog I wasn't quite sure with what film I'd want to kick off my reviews of the films of Nicolas Cage. His filmography is quite vast; clocking almost 70 films (and more to come). Also, the huge differences between some of his films (in quality and in tone/genre/style) make it hard to choose a good ""entry-level"" film that exemplifies the qualities of Nicolas Cage. Eventually, though, my eyes lay on John Woo's Face/Off: A film that perfectly introduces the screen presence of Cage. Please bear with me with the following description of the film's plot, because it's going to be complicated. Face/Off, John Woo's (Hardboiled, Mission: Impossible II) third American film, stars John Travolta as FBI Special Agent Sean Archer, a sober and driven man who dedicated his life to take revenge on freewheeling terrorist Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage), the assassin of his son. The grief for his lost son results in Archer neglecting his wife and daughter; his wife hasn't had sex in months and his daughter is full of teenage angst. Quickly though, Archer seems to get his revenge when a vehicle and action packed shootout in and around an airport hanger results in Castor Troy getting incapacitated. The villain seems to be defeated, but problems arise: Troy has planted a chemical bomb somewhere in LA. Time is ticking and the main source for information regarding the whereabouts of the bomb, Castor Troy, is in a coma. In order to save the day, Sean Archer –through an unlikely construction - has to become Castor Troy now to retrieve Intel on the bomb from Troy's paranoid and incarcerated brother Pollux (Alessandro Nivola). This is where the plot gets interesting. A surgeon switches Sean's face with the face of Castor and alters the other bodily features of the reluctant agent. When Archer wakes up after the procedure, he wakes up in the body of his archenemy. Thus now Nicolas Cage has to act like he is the character of John Travolta! It gets even more interesting when, after Archer (still in the body of Troy/Cage) is being brought to the prison of Troy's brother, Castor Troy wakes up from his coma without a face. He forces the same surgeon to perform the opposite transplantation: Caster Troy becomes Sean Archer, Nicolas Cage becomes John Travolta. After the operation Troy makes sure to neatly erase all the evidence of this operation (read: killing everyone involved). Now the whole film revolts on the two actors acting like they are each other. This results in some brilliant bits. For instance John Travolta (with the personality of Cage's character) making fun of his own ridiculous chin, or Nicolas Cage (with the personality of Travolta's character) taking too much drugs with the villains henchmen: bragging probably tripping on drugs for the first time ""I'm going to take his face Off!"" while he is crawling over the floor. For both of the rivals the physical metamorphosis has severe psychological implications as well. Villain and womanizer Troy has to play a family man, while white knight Archer reluctantly has to hang out with criminal friends and followers of Troy. Archer even finds out, without Troy knowing that his nemesis has a son of his own. Although both characters are clearly not comfortable in their role – which becomes painfully clear by the laughing of the characters that evolves in pitiful cries – they both bring some of the qualities of their personality (Archers' conscience and Troy's joyful swagger) to the lives of their opponents. Still, this is all in between the over-the-top action scenes, with shootouts, set pieces and visual effects unlike any other film. Hyper stylized action scenes are a signature of John Woo, and this film is clearly no exception. Fireworks literally explode everywhere, while the hero and villain dive, roll and almost fly through the extravagant sets. In some films the action scenes can't really keep me interested because of their lack of emotional significance and originality, but this films absurd and sometimes hilarious sequencing kept me very excited. Juxtaposed against all the grotesque action scenes are the showdowns that take place on a more personal level. The encounters between the opponents throughout the film are executed very well. I found the showdown between Castor and Sean in a room full of mirrors very clever. Face/Off is very difficult film to follow. When the final ""face-off"" (pun inevitable) of the film draws near, it's not quite clear who is on whose side and why. Still, the film provides enough character development and motivation to keep its viewers interested in the plot. I have to say that this is maybe the action film with some of the most interesting character developments. Above all, the most enjoyable part of this film is seeing Nicolas Cage and John Travolta act like each other. Both deliver amazing performances. The script forces John Travolta to play outside of his body; including the typical Cage freak-outs and looks, while Cage's has to keep his performance more weighted; as if he is a prisoner of his own body. Still both of the actors, fortunately, get to show off their fame-making style of acting more than enough. Face/Off is a ridiculous film. With a premises that is full of gimmicks and ambiguities, action scenes that are unbelievably extravagant and a script full of cheesy lines (""It's like looking in the mirror, but only NOT""). Also it is a film made with passion and enthusiasm, screaming fun in almost every scene (some are quite sad though). This is a kind of action flick that doesn't get made in this day and age anymore. In the end Face/off also shows how Nicolas Cage can handle both his theatrical out-of-body style of acting and a more restricted and introvert role at once, therefore I think this is the perfect start for everyone interested in giving the cinema of Nicolas Cage a change."
"joe12361","8","1","2","24 April 2013"," Faces off well.
","This is a decent film, if you are able to look past the very poor sequence in the medical centre, where the face transplants supposedly take place, and the laughable scene where the surgeon 'calibrates' Archer's voice using an implanted microchip (how is this meant to work exactly?), to make it resemble Troy's. The film reminds me a lot of ""The Hot Chick"", where effectively the characters have switched bodies, and this leads to interesting complications. Although unlike The Hot Chick, in Face/Off the characters are both male. The way in which each man acts to try and fit the other's personality is sometimes comical, especially the scene where Archer is carousing with Troy's cohorts and has a difficult time impersonating the other man. The contrasting lifestyles of the two men make an interesting play on their attempts to mould themselves to the other's identity."
"ebiros2","7","1","2","26 December 2012"," Best of Cage and Travolta
","This is one of the early Nicholas Cage movie that I like. Him and John Travolta swaps position by swapping faces of each other, but the evil Travolta has hard time convincing his daughter that he's still the same dad that she knows.<br/><br/>Cage has a problem convincing that he's actually the good guy. Movie features good plot, suspense, and great acting by Cage and Travolta. <br/><br/>Usually when two strong actors gets together, the plot gets murky because focus of the story goes between them. Nicholas Cage is one actor that seems to be able to work his way around the personalities of any actor he co-stars with. The story flows seamlessly between this rather confusing exchange of faces and characters in my opinion due to the flexibility of his style. Consequently, the movie has the best of Cage and Travolta on screen.<br/><br/>This is one of the best action movie from the '90s, and is recommended for viewing."
"lagudafuad","8","1","2","17 December 2012"," One of my favorite action film
","There is no better action film out there than the one that this duo (Travolta and Cage) dug up in Face/Off, with heavy budget being put down for the intense action scenes depicted in this movie, director John Woo won the Saturn Awards for Best Directing as he leads us down a path where we discover the repercussion of a life without forgiveness.<br/><br/>The movie's high point is the speedboat chase towards the ending of the film, the scene got a MTV Movie Awards for Best Action Scene and the movie duo won Best Duo (in the MTV Movie Awards) for Travolta and Cage.<br/><br/>The movie tries to show the effects of personal feuds and how if not well contained can ruin lives of those we love and nothing sets off to show us this lesson than this classic that has its tales drawn from Greek mythological feud between Hector and Achilles. The names Castor and Pollux also come from a pair of brothers in Greek mythology. The wonderful face off scene at the end between the two leads that had doves flying around is similar to Woo's classic 1989 Hong Kong film The Killer.<br/><br/>The movie plot is about Sean Archer (John Travolta) an FBI Agent who has been chasing down a criminal crime Lord Castor Troy (Nicholas Cage) for years. Their feud led to the death of Archer's son Michael and Archer strongly believes that his son's killer is his sworn enemy Castor Troy. <br/><br/>Archer finally cornered Castor one day and a fight broke out and Troy got knocked out cold. But Archer later finds out that Troy has planted a bomb somewhere in Los Angeles and the only other person who knows the bomb location is Castor's brother Pollux, who refuses to talk. <br/><br/>To get Pollux to talk a special operation doctor provided a solution that will require cutting off the face of Troy and placing it on Archer, Archer undergoes the surgery with the knowledge of limited people, so as to keep the operation hidden and takes the face of Troy to go undercover. <br/><br/>But things go wrong when Castor Troy somehow regains consciousness and now wants revenge on Archer for taking his face and the first thing Troy does is to kill everybody who knows about the operation.<br/><br/>Face/Off was highly hyped before its release which happened to be same year that Titanic (1997) was released, Face/Off lived up to the hype, making you the audience wanting to watch the film over and over again because one ride is not enough; It was also a commercial success making thrice its worth in the box office. Face/Off Holds a 94 percent ""Fresh"" rating on Rotten Tomatoes the only thing that separates this movie from old time classics like Mad Max is the intense use of action set pieces.<br/><br/>The acting by this two is one I will not forget soon, when watching the movie on its release I wanted to be an action hero like one of them. Face/Off to me is a classic and one of the best action films I have seen till date.<br/><br/>www.lagsreviews.com"
"JoeG29","7","1","2","29 November 2012"," A mostly great movie with some garbage thrown in.
","Face/Off is good movie with an original plot. Unfortunately, there is also the standard garbage to endure. First there is the obligatory Christian bashing. In this movie they have Nicholas Cage dress as a priest, then while posing as a priest, he molests a girl singing in a church choir, then gyrates, swears and talks like a pervert. I wonder if the Jews running Hollywood would have permitted Cage to dress up like a Rabbi, walk into a synagogue, molest children, and talk like a pervert? This is why many people no longer go to the movies. Then, we are told to believe that the head of the FBI office where John Travolta's character works is a black man. Also, the top special ops person working with the FBI is portrayed by a black woman. In real life, there would be thousands of better qualified white men for each position. But Hollywood is forcing the myth of the Superior Black down our throats, no matter how much it clashes with reality. If you can stomach the above garbage, the movie is otherwise very good."
"showtrmp","3","1","2","3 April 2012"," An ""art"" movie in the worst sense
","""Face Off"" has an irresistible premise, a marvelous cast, a painstaking director with a distinctive, risky style, and nonstop action. Yet I found it abominable.<br/><br/>The ludicrous plot devices have been enumerated by many; they could be excused in a silly, trashy action movie in which a sense of parody is already built in. What happens here is some kind of first; John Woo's care and attention--his ""art"", some would say--does nothing but point up the inauthenticity of every scene. There isn't a moment that rings true, or that rings false in an entertaining manner. Everyone is familiar by now with the mass-shootout scene in which the hero enters a villain's lair with a single machine gun, dispatches dozens of armed enemies, and emerges unscathed; it's become a new convention. Here, said scene is shot in slo-mo and underscored with a rapturous soprano version of ""Over the Rainbow"". Woo is saying (pretentiously) that there can be no real beauty in the world anymore; everything is tainted and corrupt. And he lingers so lovingly on the multi-angle shots of evil thugs' bodies being pulverized that we start to feel like Malcolm McDowell in ""Clockwork Orange"", strapped to a chair with our eyes stapled open. We aren't entertained OR elevated, as Woo hopes; we're just being pushed around.<br/><br/>The movie opens with what in most action films would be a finale; John Travolta's haunted police detective, whose son has been murdered by a sadistic sicko (Nicholas Cage), chases him down at an airport hangar. There are so many flying stunts, crashing stuntmen, and noise that the movie has nowhere to go (without blowing up the audience). Eventually the face-switching premise kicks in, and the movie makes its first REAL mistake--it introduces that force-of-nature actress CCH Pounder (whose voice and temperament are reminiscent of an African-American Colleen Dewhurst), and asks us to believe that she could be overpowered and murdered by Nicholas Cage!!!! She would crumple him into a Brillo pad and use him to do the windows! If the movie had let her survive and serve as Travolta's sidekick, we might have had something to ground us. Instead, we're stuck with a movie full of John Travolta acting like Nicholas Cage and Nicholas Cage acting like John Travolta (just what I always wanted for Christmas) and stuffed with Woo's trademark overdirected destruction orgies, which critics and action fans have dutifully lauded with all the usual adjectives--""dazzling"", ""hyperkinetic"", and, of course, ""balletic."" (ick is right). A climactic shootout in a church featuring heavily symbolic doves made me rather ill; this should have ended the movie, but we're thrown into yet another (by this time) yawn-inducing chase involving a powerboat. Can anyone guess the outcome? This may be the most exhausting movie ever made; it's all set pieces--it's like watching a musical with nothing but production numbers. Afterward, you just want to lie down and listen to elevator music for several days."
"Doug384","5","1","2","2 July 2010"," This has a 7.3 rating from IMDb users unbelievable!
","I saw in the theaters when it was released in 1997. I just recently saw it again on cable TV and decided to look up a couple of details. I am truly shocked that the majority of almost 100,000 IMDb users who saw this average action film gave it a 7, 8, 9 or 10 rating! When I originally left the theater, and now years later seeing it again for the second time, I shake my head and wonder why anyone would rate this movie any higher than a 6. Simply put, it is an unexceptional movie... even for a 90s popcorn action flick.<br/><br/>The voting bar for mindless action films MUST be lower than the same for all other genres. That's it. That's got to be the only explanation for the 7.3 rating Face/off currently has.<br/><br/>All you need to know about Face/Off is that it's absolutely NOT John Travolta's, Nic Cage's, or director John Woo's best action movie work, nor is it a movie that ought to be included in a list of the top 10 best popcorn action films of the 90s as the high IMDb rating might indicate.<br/><br/>If you have nothing else to do for 2 hours and 18 minutes and but watch an average action film that has a lot of people jumping in the air shooting guns, extended chase sequences that go on and on and on, and various big explosions but an completely unrealistic and implausible plot lacking any real substance, then be my guest."
"lonchaney20","9","1","2","15 May 2010"," ""I could eat a peach for hours.""
","Awesome. Nicolas Cage does what he usually does (i.e. act completely insane) while John Travolta does his best Nicolas Cage impression (and it's not a bad one, either!). I just have one question: why is it that every American movie that John Woo made after this so monumentally sucks? Sure, this is not exactly a great movie, but it still has moments of brilliance recalling his masterpieces like The Killer and A Better Tomorrow. In many ways this is a perfect distillation of the major Woo themes for American audiences: brotherhood, duality, heroic bloodshed, the man of action who must choose between his job and his love, lots and lots of doves, etc. A Woo primer, if you will. <br/><br/>Admittedly guys like Nicolas Cage and John Travolta don't flow as naturally into the Woo-niverse (see what I did there?) as the great Chow Yun-Fat does, but it sure is fun to see them constantly one-upping each other in the OTT game. Say what you will about this film: it may not be great art, but it is great entertainment made by a great filmmaker (who just happened to make a lot of terrible movies after this)."
"khanbaliq2","8","1","2","6 May 2010"," The third time was the charm for director John Woo in Hollywood, as his 1997 blockbuster Face/Off reached the passionate intensity of his best Hong Kong works.
","Face/Off is a fascinating film in so many ways.

It just about comes off amid some spectacular John Woo-trademark violence, though it can also be viewed as ludicrously, riotously funny.

"hnt_dnl","10","1","2","1 July 2009"," Best action film of the 1990s
","Maybe the 90s weren't so bad! Seems like the 1980s were packed with great, unique, memorable action flicks (THE TERMINATOR, LETHAL WEAPON, ROBOCOP, DIE HARD, etc.), but what about the 90s? All you really had in the early 90s were sequels/retreads of all those great 80s flicks and none (in my opinion) near as good as the originals. The 90s got all ""serious"" on us moviegoers. Action movies seemed to be fading away. Then, all of a sudden, in 1997 (really a year of some great films) the action film was taken to an entirely new level with FACE/OFF! Really, I think FACE/OFF is the best action flick of that decade and its not even close! And like all those 80s action flicks I named previously, FACE/OFF has a story and heart. That is why all those films remain great today and why FACE/OFF is great. It's not just action.<br/><br/>FACE/OFF stars iconic actors John Travolta (fresh off of a career re-generation with PULP FICTION, BROKEN ARROW, and GET SHORTY) and Nicolas Cage (fresh off a Best Actor win for LEAVING LAS VEGAS). Let me just say this before I finish this review: Travolta and Cage are superb! These 2 actors had the unenviable task of having to essentially become the other and both pulled it off brilliantly. I didn't see a false note in either performance.<br/><br/>Travolta plays senior FBI agent Sean Archer, a world-weary man whose son was coldly murdered (he was supposed to die) 8 years earlier by vicious villain Castor Troy (Cage). The exciting opening scene at the airport results in Troy's capture and he is seemingly mortally wounded, but still barely alive. Before his ""death"", Troy told Archer that he planted a bomb somewhere in LA and so the CSI scientists at FBI headquarters convince Archer that they can ""remove"" Troy's face and put it on Archer so that Archer can infiltrate the maximum security prison where Troy's brother Nestor (played by Alessandro Nivola) is being held and get him to reveal the location of the bomb. The prison scenes are exciting as well as the prisoners wear computer-tracked boots that monitor their every move and location. Now Cage is playing Archer and does get Nestor to reveal the whereabouts, but he is stuck in the prison as his contact has been murdered by Troy, who awoke from his coma to see that he has no face. So he puts on Archer's face, so now Travolta is playing Troy. Got all that? <br/><br/>Archer is flabbergasted that Troy has his face and breaks out of prison and must assume Troy's identity until he can figure all this out. The general authorities are unaware of all this as the only person who knew (other than Archer) is dead. It's a convoluted plot, but brilliantly executed due to the gusto performances by the 2 leads, a solid script, and invigorating action scenes. The supporting cast is excellent as well: the aforementioned Nivola, Joan Allen (very sexy as Archer's wife; she has chemistry with both Travolta and Cage), Gina Gershon as Troy's lady, and Dominique Swain as Archer's daughter.<br/><br/>The great John Woo directed FACE/OFF and he has crafted an original, thought-provoking thriller that essentially re-generated the action genre after it seemed like it was dying a slow death in the 90s. FACE/OFF is a great addition to the all-time great action films."

","face off is one of the best action movies in the history of Hollywood,the cast is great with john Travolta(absolutely my favorite actor) and nick cage one of the best actors in this days . the movie mix action with a great drama, which helped the success of this movie just like any other woo movie such as A BETTER TOMORROW or THE KILLER -even hard target was watchable-. also we see a very detailed story almost perfect ,idon't know if any one noticed but Sean archer(john travolta) hold the gun with both hands right in front of his face,Castor troy(cage) hold the gun with one hand,then after they switched faces the way they hold the gun also switch(you can notice this in the church standoff). the conclusion is this movie should have been in the top 250 so easy ,i am not saying that this is the best movie ever made but movies like this one and the negotiator and much more deserved a lot more than that,let's make a little comparison between face off and heat for example you'll find no difference between'em.

So if you're not such a big Woo Fan as I am, you might object with my rating and think that I rated movie 1 or 2 stars too high.<br/><br/>The Face/Off story isn't new, but it is told with great bravura from John Woo. The actors are good too, although I think that Travolta might be the only weak link ... and still he's strong enough. No match for N.

"fmarkland32","7","1","2","3 September 2006"," One of Woo's better American efforts...
","John Travolta and Nicolas Cage are on the opposite sides of the law. Travolta is Sean Archer an FBI agent who is trying to bring down Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage) while succeeding in almost killing Troy, Archer is faced with the position of having to get surgery that involves trading faces. So Archer does so and becomes Castor Troy to find out the location of a nerve gas bomb however when Troy awakens without a face he forces the doctors to give him Archer's face and now Archer with Troy's face on must not only fight off Castor Troy but also his former allies who think he is the terrorist they are after. Did you get the plot? Suffice to say Face-Off is ridiculous and of course has gaping plot holes. (Isn't Cage and Travolta different heights and different in body structure?) Also the movie is way too long and could have been edited down by thirty minutes. That being said Face Off works fairly well and the action sequences are exciting if a bit too ludicrous. Also what makes this enjoyable is that Woo has managed to craft a movie that works because the characters sell it, Cage is very good as the good guy and provides some excellent acting in the quieter scenes where Travolta is even more impressive in his good guy role and villainous role. It also has it's share of some exceptionally brutal moments which Woo seems to be employing again after the noticeably tame Broken Arrow. Here Woo seems willing to go over the top and in the end gives us a product which feels the closest to his hometown charm that made him one of the best filmmakers in his country. Some people have balked at it's ludicrous story but really this is Woo operating at almost maximum velocity.<br/><br/>* * * out of 4-(Good)"

Normmally it can be expected from Nicolas Cage but also John Travolta proofs that he has a marvelous acting capability. The action scenes are wonderful by John Woo! never get bored with the long scenes until the last action scene, in fact it is a little bit long. the sub-characters also fit quite well. there are lots of moments that is stunning during the movie. the only thing there is understandable; how Sean archer swim without noticed while he was escaping from jail which in the middle of some ocean. There are also things happening strangely in the movies. You may that it will not happen in the real life and so on. But these things can be tolerated for an extra ordinary story."

","I first saw this film when I was 15 when it first came out on DVD and I watched it at a friend's house. It was an experience I will never forget! First of all John Travolta is absolutely brilliant as Castor Troy, when he is Castor Troy. I always like it when he plays a bad guy for he always has that factor which makes the character extremely likable. Some scenes are pretty intense but I won't spoil them for you but I do warn you this film is not for the faint-hearted in some scenes. Pollux in the film is incredibly disturbing as Castor's close brother, who is mentally unstable. The film's climax is the adrenaline junkie's dream in film as an incredibly quick boat chase. It is even quite surprising how exciting it is.<br/><br/>This film was incredible and completely exceeded expectations. Even though this is still definitely no kiddie film and I didn't understand it completely at 15 but I still think this is one of the Action genre's best example on film"

","Every once in a while, you just have to sit down with a big bowl of popcorn and watch an action flick. The trick is finding one that is both fun and intelligent.<br/><br/>Face/Off falls under this category. Unlike brainless shoot-em-up movies, this flick is enhanced by the theatrical talents of Nicholas Cage and John Travolta. Cage's performance reflects similar tones and faces from Con Air, and Travolta's in the same mold as his movie Swordfish.<br/><br/>The key to enjoying this movie, however, is to engage in a willing suspension of disbelief. If you look at this movie with a critical eye and say to yourself 'this is so unreal' before disgustedly turning off the TV, then you're missing out. Once you get past the surreal premise of the film, it becomes exciting and intriguing, and a thrill ride through two great performances by Cage and Travolta."

When Archer finally catches Troy (who is in a coma) They discover that there is a bomb in a building. They need to know how to disarm it and the only way is to get Troy's brother to disarm it.So Archer goes under a procedure to Literally ""become"" Troy.Unfortunately Troy wakes up and gets the doctors to give him Archers face.

","I hadn't watched this movie in almost 7 years, so I figured it was about time I see it again. I considerably enjoyed it. Travolta and Cage are two of the more charismatic actors out there, and having them play off each other in this fashion makes for a darn good movie. The opportunity for the actors to play both personalities helps you really get into each character's life and discover what drives him and where his flaws lie. As far as the cinematography is concerned, I felt it was up-to-par, nothing spectacular, but certainly not a below-average effort for the kind of films John Woo has given us in the past. This is also the kind of movie where you have all these other great supporting actors. At the time, they weren't A-List celebs, but now that you've seen them in other projects (Thomas Jane, Dominique Swain, Colm Feore) you suddenly have that moment of recognition - ""Hey, its that guy, from that other movie! I totally forgot he was in this!"" As for Nic Cage, it was totally his movie. Travolta is cool, no doubt, but this was way more a Nic Cage movie. I don't know what it is, but I can honestly say I've liked every one of his movies I've seen. Overall, I'd say great movie, excellent acting, and awesome action.

But this is THE best action movie of all time. Great and simple story and interestingly told through great action, and this movie really has the best acting I have ever seen in an action movie. Travolta being Caster Troy is just astonishing, especially the scene where Travolta goes into prison to meet Cage (Archer), the way he smiles, the way he speaks, the way he moves is just pure Travolta cool. And Cage also was amazing, especially when he was in jail where he got into a fight with a fellow prisoner, you see him hating and feeling sorry for himself for doing the face surgery, but simultaneously he is ""transforming"" into Caster Troy and violently beating the prisoner up. This Travolta, Cage, and John Woo combination is undoubtedly one of the greatest actions films ever made."

","""Face/Off"" is the tale of Shawn Archer (John Travolta) hunting down the killer of his son Michael six years after the fact. But when Travolta finally catches the killer (Nicolas Cage), he learns about a bomb that will destroy Los Angeles. The only way to find and defuse the bomb is to surgically steal the face of Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage) and infiltrate his den of murderers.<br/><br/>The effects of this film are great, first of all. Whoever designed the removed faces made them so lifelike I was quite shocked. In the same part of the film where a laser is creating a new ear for a man, I was very impressed. The explosions were also nice, though nothing you won't see in every other action film. Some things required suspended disbelief, because I find it hard to believe that Cage's character could have stolen Travolta's face, body and voice without anyone stopping him and then afterwards without Travolta's wife and kids catching on. And the fact their body types are so dissimilar. But whatever.<br/><br/>John Travolta can't act as usual (although when he is supposed to be Cage in Travolta's body he does pretty well)... but Nicolas Cage picks up his slack. Cage in a porno mustache? Yes! Cage as a sexually deviant, dancing priest? Yes! Cage with a bomb that has a big glowing Jolly Roger on it? Yes! Cage being crazy delicious? Oh yes, yes, yes! Why is Dominique Swain wearing crimped hair? But besides that, good choice to play the teenage daughter (especially with ""Lolita"" coming out the same year). I'm sure more than a few people paused or rewatched her key scenes a few times.<br/><br/>Two cool scenes: shooting the mirrors, where each must confront themselves as the other to destroy the other as themselves. And the ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" montage... so beautifully out of place! While the ending is incredibly sick in my opinion (some would call it heartwarming), overall this delivers everything an action picture should. Maybe it needed less Travolta and more Dominique Swain, but the Cage made the bitter pill go down like a peach. <br/><br/>Everything you are going to want from a John Yoo film. Recommended."

It really is a first class action film from the legend that is John Woo, and I recommend it to everybody (who's 18+ of course, lol).

There is in fact technology today in the medical community that facial transplants are possible! So it is a true technological miracle.

","As a young filmmaker myself, this movie not only catches me with the suspense and action but the overall plot is pretty good. Yeah there were a few goofs but if you're trying to keep up with the story and enjoy the sequences rather than spot and bash them you wont really notice. John Woo has a particular habit of bringing these wicked action scenes but needs to keep in mind the overall ""realism"" of them. Sure its just a movie, and maybe his flaws are deliberate but we don't want to be reminded of those two facts. I haven't just seen this movie recently, nor have i just seen it once, in my opinion this is probably one the best action films ever made. Considering that two years later ""The Matrix"" and well lets face it. It was pretty action packed with those subtle biblical references. But the problem with that movie...almost everything was CG, and in a movie like Face/Off we see those eye popping thrills that make this film a great.

The beginning may seem like the end of another mediocre action movie, and then-Castor is caught, telling Archer that L.A. will be destroyed by a bomb that he set.<br/><br/>And then everything gets interesting.<br/><br/>To find out where the bomb is, Archer goes into an extensive surgery to make himself look and sound just like Castor Troy. This is very interesting, because now Nicholas Cage acts like John Travolta trying to act like Nicholas Cage. It's all very cool. Castor comes back, and decides to-what else? Get revenge on Archer by becoming Archer. Once again, Travolta acts like Nicholas Cage trying to impersonate John Travolta. A prison break and a high-rise shootout later, Archer gets to his wife, who believes his story. Then, well, everything starts to lose steam. The story is no longer about the characters in the third act, it's about gunfights and explosions. This part is still good, however, because of John Woo's expert directing and the impressive pyrotechnics (all right, so I'm congratulating slow-mo explosions. Sue me.).<br/><br/>In the first and third act, this is an above-average action movie, but the middle of the movie is so good that it makes the whole thing great. Nicholas Cage, Joan Allen, and John Travolta's performances don't hurt, either. Overall, this is not the best action movie ever made, but it's definitely worth picking up.<br/><br/>8 out of 10."

","What a great film... I am an action-film fan, and this film was a great way to entertain the audience with our favorite stars from ""The Rock"", ""Broken Arrow"", ""Pulp Fiction"", and many more... together!!! In the film, John Travolta plays an FBI agent who is hunting down arch-terrorist Nicholas Cage. Cage is in control of a very violent group of thugs and he is accused by the FBI of many violent acts of terrorism. He is not Osama bin Laden or Abu Musab al-Zarqawi supporting global jihad and personally beheading innocent hostages with a dull knife, but he is still quite a vicious man. After Cage is captured by Travolta and his crew, he is obviously facing a lengthy prison term... The only problem is that the rest of Cage's organization has not yet been infiltrated by the bureau! What better way for Travolta to get ""on the inside"" than by coming Cage himself?<br/><br/>So doctors perform a complicated surgical operation during which Travolta receives the face of Cage and his body is surgically operated on so as to appear quite similar and pass off as Cage himself. Travolta has so ""become"" his enemy Cage that he even fools Cage's closest family members and ""friends"" and even has to serve part of Cage's prison term before he breaks out. Once out of prison, Travolta (now wearing Cage's face) has to not only find the real Cage (who has stolen Travolta's face as well and escaped from the hospital where the operation took place) and take him down but also get closer with Cage's group for important information and convince his own family that HE is the real Travolta, not Nicholas Cage the murderous terrorist whose face he is wearing. <br/><br/>This film is an slam-bang thriller from start to finish that should be seen by all film fans whether you really like action as I do, or not. Please feel free to email me with any questions or comments..."
"Matt_Layden","8","1","2","27 May 2005"," Cage/Travolta switch roles........brilliant.
","John Woo is the so called master of action films, where he puts heavy on the action and light on the characters, he does this again with FACE/Off, but what makes this film different is the fact that the characters actually switch roles in it, which makes it more interesting then his previous ""american films"".<br/><br/>We see the actors brilliantly display hate/love and imitate each other. Without this element, this film would probably fall flat on it's face in the action genre and become a fading memory, instead of making it's mark in film Other then the fact that they switch roles, what makes this film different from it's other rivals? Not that much, it's your typical gun fights here, explosions there, chase scene here, but does that mean that it makes it not enjoyable? Certainly not. <br/><br/>There are tons of scenes where the bullets fly for those action hounds and of course the movie has the signature double gun from hard boiled and Woo's birds flying away. Woo has a talented eye for action, but not very much for characters, does that harm this film, a little, but again with the fact that the actors in it, portray different personalities, you don't really get a sense of that, you feel for the character of Archer and his dead son. CAGE, who is a personal fav, gives a great performance, but it's TRAVOLTA, the ""bad guy' who gets the glory in this film for having a fun time.<br/><br/>The story is laughable, but fun and that's what this movie is, pure fun. It does have emotional parts of it, but it does little for people who go to see this movie, unless your a sappy person who cries at the death of everybody. The ending is a little inane, but forgivable in this film. It could have had a better ending, which would have made the film go down in history as a great action film, instead of a fun action film, which is what so many action films are like today."
"TexasMovieBuff","10","1","2","16 April 2005"," The definitive of how an Action/Thriller should be...
","How can I start? Plain and simple, this film is just straight up bad ass. You have everything you would want in an action movie.<br/><br/>To really summarize this film in a humdrum style would be an injustice.<br/><br/>First you take 2 really good actors in Cage and Travolta, combined with a good supporting cast of Allen and Gershon, mixed with a bipolar style of filmmaker in Woo, and you get something really special.<br/><br/>Now when I say ""bipolar"" about John Woo, what I really mean is that his films are on an uneven level of bad or good. He'll have his good moments (A Better Tomorrow, The Killer), and his bad (Windtalkers, Hard Target). He just doesn't know what script to pick and choose... but with Face/Off, he succeeded immensely.<br/><br/>It really does have everything that you would want in an action movie... in any movie in really. Once you pop this in, you know what's expected: Action/Thriller... but what's not expected are the other elements that keep you coming back for more.<br/><br/>What Woo added in this is the dramatic factor... you actually CARE about these characters. You feel pain for Sean Archer and his wife and you want him to get his revenge. You want him to win so bad against this egotistical and demented Castor Troy that you bite down on your popcorn harder to see if he gets his just desserts... but that's what brings you to the other element...<br/><br/>Woo also added another layer of content that is so vital, yet so fun... which is that it is also a Dark-Comedy. Not like other action movies where they give you a one-liner that brings a smile to your face after the protagonist says something ironic after a mundane moment of a thrilling action sequence that has just happened, but you actually laugh out loud at some moments. That's why you also connect with Castor Troy. He's a devilish man, but sometimes he can be likable (in very few moments, mind you, he's still a horrible guy).<br/><br/>These reasons are why this film excels above and beyond the tagging of just another ""Action/Thriller"".<br/><br/>All of this brought together by Woo's great direction action sequences, great acting, and a pretty good score to boot, you will find yourself on the edge of your seat waiting to see what happens next.<br/><br/>I really do recommend that everyone see this film. Whether you are an indie kid looking for solace out of a film, or are just an average movie-goer looking for a dumb-fun movie, this is the film that everyone needs to view at least once. Trust me, you won't be sorry."
"NyghtOwl","8","1","2","27 January 2005"," ""No more drugs for that man!""
","Aside from giving that classic quote to our vocabulary, this remains John Woo's best American film. It also represents twin peaks for its action leads, John Travolta (who was experiencing a post-""Pulp Fiction"" career renaissance and Nic Cage (completing his ""action trilogy"" which began with ""The Rock"" and continued with the equally improbable ""Con Air."" In ""Face/Off"", the situations are so extreme as to be upsetting to the sensitive viewer. The screenplay has a genuine sense of sadism towards the Archer character, but is equally cruel to the Troy character for very different reasons. As the FBI man slides into drug-addled depravity and the life of a hunted man, the terrorist learns what it's like to be a family man who has to help his new ""wife"" bear the tragedies that were created by his own hand. Yes, the ending is over the top with heavy borrowing from other boat- chase flicks (""Live and Let Die,"" ""Patriot Games"") but by the time this movie gets to its slam-bang finish, it's all anticlimax. Emotions are the key in ""Face/Off"" and what makes it stand above its explosive brethren as an example of the thinking person's action flick."

","Quite seriously, some people really having a problem with suspending belief in these kinds of movies.<br/><br/>Of COURSE you can't swap peoples faces over and expect the bodies to accept the changes, and it's pretty obvious that you can't fool family members into thinking you are who you are. It is equally impossible to shoot a bullet-proof windscreen thirty times and have all the bullets bounce off without making a scratch. But that happens in ALL the Bond movies and no one EVER complains about that. And do you think it is possible to create a uranium-powered car with today's technology that can go back and forward through time when it hits eighty eight miles an hour? NO! But it happens in Back to the Future. But that is not AT ALL what the movie is about. It's about one thing and one thing only ACTION!<br/><br/>It contains some stunning special effects, outstanding acting, and some of the best action scenes EVER put onto the screen. John Woo is great as an action director, and that is what he did.<br/><br/>So if you are in half minds about this film, watch it, because it is an excellent action movie as long as you don't read into it.

"supertom-3","9","1","2","23 July 2004"," The first American Woo film not to insult the genius of the man!
","John Woo's best film in Hollywood and probably will sadly never be surpassed. He has been wasted post Hong Kong but this was a genuinely class action movie. The plot itself is about as logical as flushing the toilet and then crapping, but the convoluted story takes a back seat to interesting character development. Its Sci-Fi elements don't take too much focus which is good, and unlike Woo to do so anyway. The film has John Travolta and Nic Cage both playing opposite characters, Travolta playing a more refined and less showy role than usual and Cage playing his usual extravagant role, then the two roles are traded as their characters get their faces swapped. There is an interesting dynamic as both actors play both to their usual types (very theatrical) and against type (more refined). Not to mention the psychological elements of the character with both having to wear the face of their Nemesis who they despise. It is particularly interesting from Archers point of view because he begins to hate himself and almost can't take what is happening to him. Of course as you expect with Woo the action is first rate, albeit with mucho doubling for Cage and Travolta. What is amazing now though is that face transplants are possible, so who knows perhaps one day soon we could take on someones whole identity. ****1/2"

","The plot to this film is totally outrageous and extremely far-fetched (only Hollywood could really get away with it), but because the two leads (John Travolta and Nicolas Cage) are so good at being each other, it almost makes you forget about the unrealistic premise of the film. As unbelievable as the story is, this film is very entertaining, thanks of course, as already mentioned, to the performances of both Cage and Travolta and also the distinct and electrifying John Woo action sequences. The action scenes are definately a highlight. All of the performances in this film, besides the leads are also very good, and Woo is able to build tension and suspense in a way that he couldn't really achieve in Hard Target.

Add to that music that makes the dark vision of the movie come alive and you have a perfect action film.  John Travolta and Nicolas Cage each play Castor Troy and Sean Archer to perfection.  They get the evil and good parts down to such accuracy that it becomes creepy at times to think that someone we think is good could turn out to be evil.  Joan Allen and Dominique Swain are extraordinary as the family of Sean Archer who unknowingly take in the villain as their husband and father.

"Gary25","8","1","2","22 July 2002"," Woo's First American Triumph
","Throughout the 80's John Woo along with others like Sam Raimi and Tery Gilliam was the cult fans favourite and known to them as the best action movie maker in the world.  It took the rest of the film world a while though to notice, maybe the hand-over of Hong Kong to Communist China (openly loathed by Woo) forced him to make his way to Hollywood before the studios were really willing to have him.  The result of this the disappointing Hard Target and unrecognisable Broken Arrow but somehow Woo was given another chance and took it with great relish.<br/><br/>Face/Off is Woo at his over the top, furiously paced finest, the story might be highly implausable and its hadling hysterical but it serves to give the film the playground that both Woo and his actors thrive in.  The action scenes are tremendous, staged as only Woo really can and strangely for this usually vacuous genre there is a strange kind of social commentary about the importance of family and marriage that has been overlooked by many.  Up there definitely as one of the best action/adventure films ever 4/5"
"chrisbrown6453","7","1","2","21 May 2002"," Giving new meaning to the words face lift.
","Face/Off is the quintessential summer movie. It's big, fast, violent, action-packed. It's also smart, clever and immensely entertaining. John Travolta and Nicholas Cage play the leads, and I guess you could describe their over-the-top performances as ""ripe."" Travolta is the good guy, Sean, a law enforcement officer willing to go beyond the call of duty to put a stop to bad guy Castor (Cage). Can Sean save Los Angeles from a poison-gas bomb planted by Castor and his demented brother? In the course of events that could lead to a possible L.A. wipeout, the two leads get to trade identities, families and, yes, even faces. Travolta and Cage seem to be having a ball goofing on each other and we share in their fun. The energetic direction is by Hong Kong master John Woo (yes, the very same Woo responsible for killing Mission Impossible II) in his best Hollywood outing by far. Woo certainly knows his way around a chase and a fight (he's been referred to as ""the Mozart of mayhem""), but he also manages some genuinely resonant human drama this time out. A must-see."

The special effects for the surgery were very realistic, considering the fact that the surgery is impossible as described.  John Travolta and Nicholas Cage work wonderfully together and did outstanding jobs in mimicing each others movements for after the surgery.

That bit always irritates me.<br/><br/>Few movies boasts as many ""cool"" scenes as this one though. How about Castor Troy (Cage) walking to his private jet with his coat flapping in the wind? Or the mirror-scene in which Archer and Troy are looking in the mirrors and still aiming at their enemies face (complicated I know).

","Travolta plays this FBI top agent whose sole purpose in life for 10 years has been to catch the terrorist Castor Troy (Cage) because he, by mistake, shot and killed Travolta's son. In a bloodbath which leads to Castor's capture he falls into a coma but is kept alive. At this point the story becomes original by doing the unimaginable when Travolta becomes Cage and vice versa. The rest of the story is simply them getting at each other and screwing up each others lives, Travolta's in particular.<br/><br/>John Woo with his first Hollywood hit and it is a big one and will be followed by Mission: impossible 2 this year. Travolta with another great movie (ever since Pulp Fiction he has been flawless) but Cage is more convincing as the family man.<br/><br/>When one looks at this movie one sees two great and popular actors and Hong Kong's finest action director, one cannot miss and one does not. It has an original plot-line and action scenes you've never seen before (or at least not as well done). Basically it's just a fun movie and a sure winner if you're looking for a video rental.

"barts","Null","1","2","10 April 1999"," A CLASSIC ACTION MOVIE!
","When this movie came out in the summer of 1997, I must have seen it three times!  It scared me to picture a situation of having a convict and I switch faces, because I would be screwed like Sean Archer(the good one) in this movie was!  I think that both men, Cage and Travolta, did a good job switching the personalities as well as their faces.  I liked it better the action movie, Broken Arrow that was released a year before this one was. Now the action was very good in this, which leads me to my complaint of 90's action movies:TOO MUCH ACTION, AND NOT ENOUGH PLOT.  My younger brother and I agree that all of the action movies of the 1990's don't have the same touch as the 1980's ones did. In the 1980's, movies like 48 Hours had good acting, and the plot was interesting.  In the 1990's, it seems as though every action movie is trying to become an oscar.  But that must be the trend.  In the 1950's, sci-fi's were popular.  In the 1960's it was spaghetti westerns.  In the 1970's and 1980's, there were many horror and comedy movies.  But I am sure in the next 10 years, we will be saying how much we missed excessive action movies."
"tiger-48","Null","1","2","5 April 1999"," Woo's Hollywood masterpiece
","For anyone who has seen ""The Killer"" or ""Hard-Boiled"", you probably will not be blown away by ""Face/Off"". As good as Face/Off may seem, we have to remember it is still given the Hollywood treatment. Less guns, less bullets, less death, and a happy ending. Of course, for the regular neutered American filmgoer, this seems like a GOOD thing. But for REAL hardened action fans, this Hollywood intervention is an unwelcome intrusion. For all the fireworks in Face/Off, it still does not even come close to matching up with even ten minutes of ""Hard-Boiled"" or ""The Killer"". These two Hong Kong movies are John Woo's REAL masterpieces, not tied down by any ropes or watered-down to fit the standards of any major movie company.<br/><br/>However, that being said, Face/Off is certainly a masterpiece in American standards. Woo manages to still offer us an energetic and eye-pleasing action movie despite being tied down by Hollywood. The plot in this movie, while comical, is very engaging. A little known fact about this movie is that it was originally meant to be set in the future. That would better explain the validity of the operation AND that wacky futuristic prison. However, Woo refused to do this, and the movie is much better because of it.<br/><br/>The complications of Castor Troy turning into Sean Archer and vice versa are brilliant. Sean turns into the very man he has loathed and despised. He is reminded of him every time he looks in the mirror. Castor, on the other hand, turns into the man who has been chasing him with passion for years. This turn of events causes major psychological trauma for both characters (although Cage's character shows it a lot more). The extent of these emotions are limited on screen as Woo chooses to push that aspect of the story away and instead focus on the action. Good choice!<br/><br/>Make no bones about it, this is not a psychological drama. It has John Woo behind the camera, so it's a full-tilt action film. As in his Hong Kong films, Woo manages to make EVERYONE look more cool than they really are. Case in point, has Cage EVER looked cooler than the opening scene when he exits his car and his overcoat goes flapping around in the wind?<br/><br/>The most brilliant example of Woo's genius is the scene when Cage and Travolta are back-to-back with each other with only a mirror separating them. When they both turn away and point guns at each other's image, you can't help but get chills at how brilliant this is. They're both pointing their guns at the very man they hate, and even though it is really themselves, shooting at that image could kill the enemy. As complicated as it is smart, Face/Off has many scenes that envoke chills like this.<br/><br/>And of course, the raw unorthodoxed action...the only moment that this film felt like a Hong Kong movie was the scene when Cage slides on the floor to shoot at the SWAT member breaking into their hideout. The camera follows Cage sliding on the ground while sparks fly all around him. This just screamed Hong Kong action all the while and it was beautiful! The final church shootout was ripped off from ""The Killer"" (but severely diluted), and the boat scene was also something out of ""The Killer"". That being said, both were well-done and actually made the movie!<br/><br/>The plot does seem a bit far-fetched, but it is as interesting as it is implausible. People need to stop looking at this film as a true-life action film and start looking at it like a sci-fi film (since that's what it was originally supposed to be). That is, keep your mind open and you won't be tied down by the physics and technology of today. Take the story as it is and breathe in the premise of the story and not the reality of it. Seen in that light, Face/Off is certainly an action masterpiece and one that John Woo should be proud of despite its lack of punch and flair that was present in The Killer and Hard-Boiled."
"echan","8","1","2","3 April 1999"," John Woo really hit it off
","There's everything in this film.<br/><br/>Maybe it's too soon to say this, but I haven't seen any action film as exciting as this one before.<br/><br/>The drama. I don't think many actors out there are able to switch roles like that so perfectly.<br/><br/>The action. From the beginning to the end. Sometimes it's heavy enough to stop your heart pumping.<br/><br/>The directing. John Woo really impressed me. He used every possible way, sound effects, lighting, special effects, camera positions and angles to increase tension and impact. His previous film Broken Arrow impressed me enough already, but in this one he's even more incredible. No wonder why he's famous.<br/><br/>However I only gave it an eight. Simply because my brother doesn't like it as much as I do, but he doesn't have any reasons for it. *shrug* Maybe he thinks it's too cruel, but that's what turns me on."
"Kitz-3","8","1","2","20 March 1999"," Not too typical.
","One cannot say I'm a big action movie fan, but I don't entirely dismiss the genre, and Face/Off is one reason why.  It's not too typical or cliche, it's intelligent but still full of hard-hitting, gun-blasting action.  It's great.  Plus, Face/Off made me realize just how cool Nicholas Cage is."
"Ricicle","Null","1","2","24 February 1999"," Stop criticising it because you liked it really
","It seems that many people have got bad things to say about Face/Off. The implausibility of the plot filled with ridiculous loopholes is the main bone of contention. The point I would like to make is that all the people who criticised it probably watched it all the way through. Obviously the storyline is flawed but who cares as long as its entertainment even if that entertainment is at superficial rather than on a serious level. The film, if overlong, is good value. Not a classic but not something that should be so violently condemned. Too many people are getting too high and mighty. It doesn't take much IQ to realise its faults but give the film a break and enjoy it at a light hearted level."
"andreas-19","7","1","2","13 November 1998"," interesting plot
","What happens, if two people change their identities and nobody who knew about it is still alive. A cop (Travolta) becomes a criminal, and a criminal (Cage) becomes a cop... interesting. Cage plays as great as usual, but sadly there must be another man, and this one is played by Travolta. For me, this is the reason why I can't vote Face/Off higher than seven out of ten."
"Old Joe","Null","1","2","5 February 2002"," In order to catch him, he must become him.
","I remember the first time I watched Face/Off, and boy did it blow me away. I have always had a lot respect for John Travolta as an actor, but this movie made me sit up and take notice not only of Travolta, but Nicolas Cage and the director, John Woo. Face/Off is undoubtedly one of Hollywood's greatest action movies ever made.<br/><br/>Face/Off Â… the ultimate game of cat and mouse. To avenge the senseless murder of his son, FBI agent Sean Archer undergoes radical new surgery allowing him to switch faces with the comatose terrorist Castor Troy and assume his identity. But when Castor awakes and assumes Sean's identity, the real Sean is thrust into an unimaginable nightmare, fighting not only for his life but also those of his wife and daughter! <br/><br/>Well what do you say about this movie? It is a blast. Action from start to finish. I disagree that the storyline is silly, considering the way the audience is taken on such a great ride with both Castor Troy and Sean Archer. I thought the script was very well written by Mike Werb and Michael Colleary. Then you have the touches put in by director John Woo. Woo is a fine director, with this being one of his best films. His other movies include Broken Arrow,  Hard Target and Blackjack. He also directed a very disappointing sequel, that being Mission: Impossible II. That film was rather boring for the most part and only started to heat up at the end. Anyway Woo did a brilliant job on Face/Off.<br/><br/>The main stars are Hollywood legends. John Travolta and Nicolas Cage take on both roles as Sean Archer/Castor Troy. Both make the most of being two different characters. The way they act in this movie, they make you believe that the two have really traded places. It is difficult to say who was the better of the two in this film, because they both did a great job.<br/><br/>
Cage has had a great career. Of course winning an Oscar for his terrific role in the film Leaving Los Vegas, in addition to the big hits like The Rock, Con Air, City Of Angels, Gone In Sixty Seconds and The Family Man. These were all great movies. Travolta is probably Hollywood's most well-known actor. A strong member of the church of scientology, he has done some great films as well. These include Grease (who will ever forget that film?), The Look Whose Talking series, the popular Pulp Fiction, which put him back on the movie map, Broken Arrow and his latest hit Swordfish, alongside Hollywood's newest star Hugh Jackman. Travolta has done some bad films, none more bad than the science-fiction movie, Battlefield Earth, which was a real flop.<br/><br/>There are some other good cast members in Face/Off. They include Gina Gershon, who plays Castor's partner of sorts, Sasha Hassler. Then you have Joan Allen who plays Sean Archer's wife, Dr Eve Archer. Dominique Swain is good in her role as the rebellious teenage daughter of the Archer's, Jamie. Finally the role of Castor's brother, Pollax Troy, was well performed by Alessandro Nivola. He was great in the movie, Best Laid Plans.<br/><br/>There are some powerful scenes in this movie. None more so, than the scene where we see the two arch enemies looking at themselves in the mirror, about to try and shoot each other to death. Then of course you have the surgery scene where we see them actually taking off the character's faces. This scene looks so real, that you would believe the surgery really did take place. The action scenes in Face/Off are all great, with the final boat chase, breathless.<br/><br/>It is known that they are starting to perform surgery like what was acted in this movie, for real, which is amazing. I am going to stick my neck out here and say that Face/Off is my favourite film of all-time. Now some people might think that is weird, but this film is terrific. If you like a bit of action, thrown in with a bit of intrigue and suspense then this film is for you. Face/Off is summed up beautifully by Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle who wrote: <br/><br/>`In ``Face/Off,'' a principled FBI agent and a psychotic terrorist switch faces. Switching faces means the two actors -- John Travolta and Nicolas Cage -- have to switch roles. But more than switch roles, they switch styles. Travolta adopts Cage's abrupt gestures and crazy laugh; Cage amazingly embodies Travolta's soulfulness'. <br/><br/>That is spot on. So if you want to see one great action films of our time, sit back, relax and watch Face/Off.  It's like looking in a mirror. Only... not!<br/><br/>Rating: 5 Stars or 10/10"

Woo gives his film fantastic character development.<br/><br/>Here's the set-up, An FBI agent (John Travolta) hunts down the cold blooded terrorist (Nicholas Cage) who murdered his infant child years ago.  The terrorist is knocked into a coma during a chase.  The FBI know the terrorist has planted a bomb somewhere, but can't get this info out of the terroists' captured associates.  So, Travolta has to have Cage's face grafted on, take on Cage's characterisitics, and try to stop this attack.  This is a fast moving film about two dreaded enemies who have to live each other's lives, harm those they love.<br/><br/>This is the best film directed by Hong Kong bred John Woo.

The energy and panache that they both put into each of the characters is outstanding.<br/><br/>The concept of the film and the plot are strong, and the action scenes are as dynamic as you could hope for.

I know this because my Mum really enjoyed the film and she enjoys things like needlework and gardening, and although the film didn't include any of these particular elements in it, she does tell me it had some underlying sentiment in the story line which made the film for her.

You can tell they were having a blast."
"Rob500","8","1","2","7 November 1998"," It's a case of ""third time lucky"" as John Woo finally makes his Hollywood breakthrough.
","After two false-starts in his Hollywood career, namely ""Hard Target"" and ""Broken Arrow"", John Woo has finally made the successful transition from Hong Kong to Tinseltown.  Fans of the legendary director's many Oriental ""urban thrillers"" should lap up this stylishly realised thrill-ride involving swapped identites, jaw-dropping visuals and guns galore.<br/><br/>The plot sees F.B.I. agent Sean Archer (John Travolta) out to seek revenge on arch-criminal Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage) after the senseless murder of his young son.  After a bullet-riddled opening shoot-out Troy is left comatosed and his gun-toting brother Pollux (Alissandro Nivola) is locked up, but their reign of terror is far from over.  Aware of the fact that Troy has left a bomb capable of taking out the entire city ticking somewhere in LA, Archer is unable to extract the location of said explosive device from either Pollux or Troy's entire gang. It seems that all hope is lost until Archer is convinced to undergo radical surgery to effectively ""become"" his rival; his face is removed from his skull and replaced with that of Troy.  A little haircut here, a touch of lypo-suction there and abracadabra!  Archer is now the spitting image of his foe and can be placed behind bars in order to extrapolate the exact location of the bomb from ""brother"" Pollux. However, things get a little out-of-hand when Troy awakens from his coma, steals Archer's face, destroys all evidence of the mission and escapes.  On hearing this, Archer (Cage) manages to break-out of jail and resume his deadly game of cat-and-mouse with his nemisis Troy (Travolta).<br/><br/>Confused?  Believe me, it's a lot easier to comprehend when you're viewing it.  ""Face/Off"" is possibly the first action film since ""Die Hard"" to combine edge-of-the-seat thrills with a riveting plot.  The script is bursting with energy, emotion, witty dialogue and dark humour.  Shoot-outs aside, the finer points of the film involve the Archer-faced Troy romancing his vegence-seeking enemy's wife.<br/><br/>Travolta and Cage are adpet at playing both good and bad guys; Travolta's villain is super-cool, whilst Cage brings a nervously dark edge to the hero. Superb support is offered from Joan Allen (Man Hunter) as Archer's lonely wife, Dominique Swain (Lolita) as his estranged daughter, and Alissandro Nivola (I Want You) as Castor's paranoid young brother.<br/><br/>Holding the entire movie together is Woo's outstanding direction, including slow-motion shoot-outs, double pistol action and Mexican stand-offs.  Fans of his earlier collaborations with Chow Yun Fat will not be disappointed. Wrap it all up with a rousing score from John Powell and you've got yourself the best mainstream Hollywood action flick in years."

","John Woo's ""Face off"" is not an art-film or in any way important. It's just old-fashioned entertainment, fine-tuned to the singular art of pleasing you, while at the same time throwing a couple of home-truths in your general direction... The non-stop action leave your senses stunned and satiated, and sends you out of the cinema in the warm and enjoyable knowledge of money well spent. In my case, that doesn't happen very often. ""Face off"", utter rubbish really, triumphs in its manic insistence on justice being served, no matter what. The ""Count of Monte Christo""- theme (very old hat!) is served up like it was piping hot, and the action seems fresh and inventive. John Woo is also one of the few action-directors who remain true to the rules of the genre. That is, although the editor goes wild, the camera flies off in every direction, the bombs explode all over the place: You never experience vertigo or dizzy spells (like in that,""Armageddon""-horror!). In a John Woo action-scene you know where you are.You know where the actors are positioned. And you know where the danger is coming from.<br/><br/>Simple, really.

This is definately one of those invasion of privacy thrillers where even though its completely absurd about the face switching thing ( maybe its in the future or something) you still question the fact that maybe all isn't what it seems. Probably the most intriguing thing about the movie is how Cage and Travolta's characters not only switch faces but also how the lives around them are invaded and corrupted. The movie offers some great shoot-outs, which is why I love the movie, but the boat chase at the end seems out of place in an intelligent movie like this.

It was fun for me to see a good guy (initially Travolta, FBI agent and a good father and husband) getting Cage's face and gazing at himself at the mirror in an innocent astonishment (it's just after you saw Cage as a bandit in the beginning of the movie). Vice versa, initial Travolta looks not natural until he gets into the gangster's skin. Maybe it's a matter of habits, but I would really prefer to see these two actors playing bad guys. All the other movies where they were peaceful and good (or just such scenes) didn't grip me at all.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the action itself is great, I did enjoy the movie in general.

John Travolta plays Sean Archer, who is a FBI-agent.  Nicolas Cage plays Castor Troy, a psychotic terrorist. While the opening credits are still running, Archers son is killed at a theme park.  The murderer is Troy, and this is how Archers obsession of killing Troy starts. 6 years later, Archer and his FBI buddies traps Troy at an airport.  Troy reveals that he has hidden a bomb somewhere in L.A., just before Archer blows him away with a jet engine, and Troy falls into a coma. Troy`s brother is the only one who knows where the bomb is hidden, so Archer must take on Troy`s face and body, in order to know where the bomb is. While Archer is undercover in prison, Troy wakes from his coma, takes on Archers face and VOILA`!  The two characters have know changed identity. <br/><br/>The fact that John Woo is on board as director is visible in every shot. The action scenes are gorgeous to look at, but not as violent as some people believe.  Face/Off is indeed a very violent film, but it is kindergarten when compared to John Woo`s Hong-Kong movies like Hard Boiled and The Killer.

","""Face/Off"" is easily my favorite action movie of all time.  It has all of the elements necessary for a good movie- 1.) A good (not all believable) plot, 2.) Convincing acting, 3.) John Travolta and Nicholas Cage doing some of their best work, and 4.) John Woo directing it.  If you add all four of those things together, you will get a hit movie.  I knew that my friends would like the movie, but I was amazed at how much the critics enjoyed it as well.<br/><br/>This movie should be seen for the action and comedy.  I would not recommend that little kids see this due to some images at the start of the movie. (those that have seen it know what I am talking about)<br/><br/>Travolta and Cage were great together.

Now this film is just over two hours long and as you know after this time if there's not plenty of action or a half decent story line to keep you glued then you lose the plot, become bored, irritated and and want to bash the person over the head who recommended it to you in the video shop. (personal experience).  Well this film will keep you watching to the end, with hair-raising stunts and your mind constantly telling you keep watching, I want to see what will happen next. Well maybe.  Anyway enough gibber gabber let's get to the plot. Well John Travolta plays an F.B.I agent who's mission is to bring in one of the world's most deadliest terrorists (Nicholas Cage).  Cage was hired ten years earlier at the start of the film to take out Travolta, but missed and hit is son, who died.  Travolta is angry at this as you can imagine and he works day and night trying to figure out cage's next move.  To try and find out where cage has hidden a bomb in New York, the story becomes complicated as Travolta is asked to do something by his superiors which well without giving anymore of the story away, let's just say most people, wouldn't do.

","Great concept, but poorly executed!<br/><br/>According to the chronology of the film, John Travolta's character morphed into Nicholas Cage's, and was fully-functioning before the reverse happened. So, we're to believe that not only one, but two consecutive face transplants can occur, and the patients fully recover within a 9 day period?! Since this is the whole premise of the film, it falls completely apart at that point.<br/><br/>Also, were their penises also transplanted, or did the wife/girlfriend not see the husband/boyfriend naked? Surely they would have noticed!<br/><br/>What about the FBI agents who were in on the initial operation? How come they would not have been made aware when the switchback was, supposedly, done? When Cage came in looking like Travolta, shouldn't they have known something was up?!<br/><br/>I fell asleep on and off throughout it, so maybe I missed a couple of things.

"ycho-29371","8","1","3","29 May 2017"," One of the best 90's action movies...
","Face Off is one of the popular 90's action flicks of that decade. It is directed by a well-known Hong Kong director and who legitimately majorly influenced action films or sequences nowadays, known for chaotic action sequences, Mexican Standoffs, and frequent usage of slow motion. This film contains all of these aspects, as well as the addition of the two famous actions stars, John Travolta, and Nicolas Cage. <br/><br/>As the film title states, the film starts with a soul of an FBI agent named Sean Archer (John Travolta) and his very young son getting shot and nearly assassinated by one of the mob terrorists named Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage). Sean Archer's son persists dead from the gunfire. After a few years later, Castor and some of his mob crews are captured from the FBI operation group led by Sean Archer. However, in order to foil an extortion plot, Sean, the FBI agent goes into a facial transplant surgery and exchanges with Castor for 7 days. He has assumed an identical identity of the Castor as he looks exactly similar with his plantation and whirls to obtain the location and the codes of a massive bomb that can wipe out several and tons of lives. However, everything goes perversely when the real Castor Troy wakes up from a coma before expected and gets the same facial transplant surgery for Sean's face. <br/><br/>This is such a different and an original concept that has never been taken before. In the film, it illustrates this very brief shortly as it is supposedly more shed into a genre of Sci-Fi. This could be mistaken as for the most preponderance of the film continues for a period of time of events happening between the accidentally switched life of Sean and Castor as they both premiere experience and endure the risks and faith of their new lives. John Travolta first plays an FBI agent who is desperate for revenge and his family's conditions but as the facial transplant surgery befalls to him, we see the face of a terrorist implanted to the main hero and faithful FBI agent who secretly needs to extract information about a bomb terror in a city. John Travolta is wickedly entertaining to watch his presence and his physical and mental change of a person, he acts smoothly and quiet, but later performances wicked, frightening yet hilarious and a person who has a heavy sexual desire. He outtakes the personal yet wonderfully disorganized life of the original Sean and makes the outcome of running it and changing the course to his desire of style. Nicolas Cage first plays the after the character of John Travolta the boss of a terror organization but later transfigures to a vulnerable hero who gets yanked into a thoroughly unexpected harsh situation. Nicolas Cage is the best aspect that could be supplemented to this film, as he is at his prime best, courageous and peddles the likability of his character. <br/><br/>As this is an action flick, it executes the action as expected from a 90's action film. The action here is remarkably entertaining. Additionally, audiences can assert that the stunts are somewhat dangerous and when an action sequence ensues, a stunt double has been replaced with the actors. Like all cheesy 90's action flicks, the action is competitively identical yet entertaining as usual. John Woo's direction makes the normal average 90's action flick, more upscale and procreates some of the revolutionary action sequences and styles that are continued throughout until nowadays. Additionally, he definitely borrows the elements from his previous foreign action films making this action fresh at the time of period. Aside from the entertaining and cool action sequences, this film frequently has a heavy-handed dramatic weight as the two opposite characters change. We have an empathy to Nicolas Cage's character Sean as we want his accomplishment of rejoining with his wife and family to obtain the joy-ness and true laughter. <br/><br/>Overall, Face Off is one of the better 90's action flicks. It consists of cool and utterly entertaining 90's John Woo's action sequences, an original idea, and sometimes a heavy dramatic weight to the vulnerability of the hero. It could be diverted into a dumb-fun 90's action flick or a well-wrought Sci-Fi and action film.<br/><br/>Grade: A"
"Screen_Blitz","8","1","3","23 November 2015"," Inventive action-packed John Woo thrill ride
","Hong Kong action film Director John Woo brings stellar action and thrills in this action-packed popcorn flick, starring John Travolta and Nicolas Cage who compete in one of the most exhilarating and inventive games of Cat-and-Mouse ever brought together on film. John Travolta plays Sean Archer, a FBI agent and devoted father and husband who is devastated by the cold murder of his son Michael by a ruthless terrorist Castor Troy (played by Nicolas Cage). Six years pass, Troy is still alive and hatches a diabolical plan to use a powerful bomb to blow a city. After seemingly killing Troy in a violent shootout, Archer is assigned on a mission to acquire the information from on the bomb's location from Troy's evil goons, and this plan involves Archer undergoing a medical surgery that removes his facial identity and replaces it with Troy's. While Archer is sent on the island where Troy's henchman are incarcerated, Troy wakes up and undergoes the same surgery to steal Archer's facial identity. It is up Archer is escape the prison and go after Troy who begins using his identity.<br/><br/>John Woo packs a punch with some intense, stylized action sequences and elegant action set pieces, along with an abnormal plot that work surprisingly well. This movie follows a stylish story of two men who are literally put into each other's shoes and begin experiencing each other's life and appearance, and John Woo does some amazing experimenting with this concept; switching back and forth from John Travolta's character posing as Nicolas Cage's character to outwit his goons with some intense gunfights and interrogations, to Nicolas Cage's character posing as John Travolta to commit a flirtatious life with his wife and teenage daughter and sabotage his job at the FBI. When Travolta and Cage eventually come face-to-face for the first time as each other, the pulse-pounding gun shootouts ensue and build up into a stunning climax at the end set with some good visuals, and its all fun to watch. The performances are solid and the plot moves at a reasonable pace, and with consistency. <br/><br/>Face/Off sets a great example of how action movies should be and it takes a position as the one of the most entertaining action flicks of its decade. Actions fans will be pleased by this film as well as those looking for a great action flick."
"NateWatchesCoolMovies","10","1","3","21 November 2015"," Utter class, a scorching masterpiece
","Nicolas Cage Week: Day 6<br/><br/>There's action movies, and there's action movies... and then there's Face/Off. For me it's the snowy peak of hyper real, larger than life spectacles of sound, fury and music, composed by none other than Chinese maestro John Woo, whose first few films with Chow Yun Fat (The Killer, Hard Boiled and A Better Tomorrow are classics and textbooks for anyone looking to step into the genre) were a major success both back home and overseas, before making his first venture into American cinema with this solid gold masterpiece. From beginning to end it fires on all cylinders, never missing a beat or churning out an awkward moment, just a continuous ballet of bullets, largely drawn characters and set pieces all revolving together in perfect synergy, so that the two and a half hour running time feels slight. John Travolta and Nic Cage are simmering in the lead roles, each getting to showcase their rugged, hangdog hero elements as well as the playful boiling points of their violent, psychotic sides as well. They also get to parody each other splendidly, and let's be honest, who better than these two infinitely eccentric titans of twitchy, idiosyncratic work? Travolta plays gruff, world weary FBI Agent Sean Archer, on a relentless, revenge fuelled warpath against heinous, evil terrorist Castor Troy (Cage). When a kamikaze raid on his forces at an airport (the opening sequence will have your heart bouncing) leads to his capture and unfortunate coma, Archer races to find a solution before a bomb hidden somewhere in the LA area goes off. He is introduced to a hilarious, cutting edge medical science program in which faces can be transplanted onto other bodies, effectively transforming someone into... Nicolas Cage. He goes for it, and is implanted into the severely maximum security prison where Castor's creepy brother (Alessandro Nivola) is held, attempting to learn the whereabouts of aforementioned explosive device. Troy wakes from his slumber though, and forces the medical team to put Archer's face on him, and viola, suddenly Cage is Travolta and Travolta is Cage. They launch an all out war of insane proportions on each other, dragging each of their families and associates into one of the most jaw dropping, satisfying series of set pieces and battles I've ever seen in a film. The climactic shoot out in the church, the chaotic prison break and iconic stunt jump into the ocean, the boat chase that makes The Fast And The Furious look like a hotwheels commercial, the opening airport explosion, the incendiary raid on Troy's dockside safe house; all absolute stunners that will rock any sound system and inject the genre with a giddy love of mayhem for years to come. Cage and Travolta are at times so over the top we feel like they wandered in from a David Lynch film, but therein lies the fun of both their work: they're two mustangs cutting loose, trying to one up each other in both the deranged and the emotional departments, and their efforts carry the movie along on a thunderous, dizzying high of histrionics both introverted and screamingly extroverted. The supporting cast is dotted with old familiar faces too. Standouts include Joan Allen as poor Archer's confused, vulnerable wife, sexy Gina Gershon as Troy's tough old flame Sasha and Nick Cassavetes steals the show as his associate and partner in scumbuggery Dietrich (""Hey man, we had some laughs""), but there's also awesome work from Colm Feore, Robert Wisdom, Margaret Cho, Harve Presnell, CCH Pounder, John Carroll Lynch, Dominique Swain, Thomas Jane and Tommy Flanagan too. John Powell's raging, operatic score resonates uncannily with the events unfolding on screen with grace and fluidity of an expert making magic, as does Woo's flawless direction, and the talents of every person involved. It's in a word, epic."
"mattiasflgrtll6","9","1","3","10 September 2015"," The most fun watching an action movie you'll have!
","At its worst, action is crammed in just to showcase some special effects and extensive car chases. But at its best, we have a crazy wild ride to invest ourselves in! This is the latter case.<br/><br/>The opening is the darkest part of the movie. We have a happy father going on the carnival with his son, and suddenly his boy is shot... Castor Troy, the killer, unfortunately gets away. Until one day, when Sean Archer finally catches him! But there is one problem left: Troy planted a bomb which will destroy Los Angeles and Archer is the only one who can stop it! The best way to do it though? Going undercover as Troy by undergoing a surgery where Archer's face is cut off and replaced by Troy. And even getting a voice box so he can talk like him. However, more trouble stirs up when the real Castor wakes up and forces the doctor to give him Archer's face as well. And what we have are two faces with the wrong personalities...<br/><br/>The plot sounds ludicrous, doesn't it? But that's also part of the charm! It's so impossibly complicated, yet the movie manages to make it work. And it's all thanks to the hilarious dialogue throughout, which is a mix of delicate wit, flat-out bizarreness and dark humor. In fact, this movie has so many laughs that it's a mystery why it's never listed as a comedy. John Travolta gets to go completely nuts with this movie as he for one of the few times in his career plays a villain. Equally, maybe even more, great is Nicolas Cage as his counterpart. He has shown that he can both be a great, great actor and someone who is just very entertaining to watch. Here, he is both! He is WAY over-the-top, and still you completely buy it. He hands out one of the greatest performances of his life.<br/><br/>There are a few other side characters I really like too, such as Pollux Troy, Jamie Archer and Dietrich, who by the way has one of the best lines in the movie (""Hey Sean, how's your dead son?""). Almost every single character is exaggerated and sometimes you are not sure if the movie is self-aware or takes itself very seriously. Either way, it's a wonderful movie!<br/><br/>The one weak aspect I guess would be that the ending is not very good, as it's very cheesy and doesn't fit with the rest of the movie. Thankfully, there's an alternate ending, which I thought was far better. So I guess the movie is as awesome as it could be after all!"
"danielloe","7","1","3","13 June 2015"," Classic over-the-top ridiculous fun
","*WARNING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* Okay, so imagine a movie starring two of the biggest over-actors ever, and directed by the director of Mission Impossible 2, where said over-actors play each other. Yes, that is the plot of Face/Off, and the movie is one of the most entertaining movies ever. I'm not sure if this was supposed to be funny (I think it was), but it was hilarious. Watching Nic Cage play an exaggerated version of himself, and John Travolta do the same, was one of the funniest movie concepts ever. John Woo (the director) should also not go uncredited, as he adds his own blend of cheesy fun to the mix by playing the entire thing with a straight face. Well, sort of, if you've seen the movie, you know what I mean, if you haven't, let me explain. There are a few action scenes where the characters are doing the most ridiculous stunts you can imagine, and then we get some slo-mo and cheesy, melodramatic music to accompany it. This movie doesn't sound like it would be so great, but it is. This movie is long, but it was an absolute blast from beginning to end. But, we've covered the humor already, let's talk about the cast a little more thoroughly. I am a big Nicolas Cage fan, and think the guy is very funny, and his mere presence makes almost any movie worth watching. John Travolta I haven't seen in much besides this, but his acting skills don't seem as impressive. In this movie he's very funny, but I think that might be the script more than anything else, because basically we get to see two people playing Nicolas Cage. Yeah, if you can imagine that, you'll know you're in for a big treat with this movie. There are a few co-stars, who are hardly noticeable next to Cage and Travolta who chew up screen time, but they are there. Castor Troy has a machine gun toting girl-friend who guns down dozens of cops who attack their base, but she's still treated as a hero, and Archer (in Troy's body) is okay with it. The implausibility of the movie is part of what makes it so good. Troy has some other buddies, none of whom do much, and then there's Archer's family and friends. Literally every other FBI agent hunting Troy is faceless, none of them have any personality and I don't remember any of their names, but that's okay. Travolta and Cage provide enough personality for a whole trilogy. Archer's wife is a decent actress, but again, it's a pretty thankless role. Archer's daughter is pretty generic, but she gets a bit more personality, and brings it a very funny moment when Troy (in Archer's body) attacks her boyfriend. It's funnier than it sounds. The action is insanely over-the-top, kind of like Mission Impossible 2 action, but slightly toned down. However, it is over-the-top in a funny way. In the end Face/Off is a hilarious movie filled with great dialogue, very funny acting, over-the-top action, and a crazy story. If you want to see the quintessential crazy Nicolas Cage movie, watch Face/Off. You won't be disappointed."
"jfgibson73","7","1","3","3 May 2015"," Lots of Fun
","Here is one of the wildest movies ever to be released as a summer action blockbuster. The director lets Cage and Travolta go crazy, and mines the ridiculous premise to maximum effect. A sick killer and obsessed cop switch places and basically do a better job in each others' shoes. It seems to be saying that we all take those who are closest to us for granted. But it also has some insane shootouts and well earned humor. My favorite was how the terrorist turned out to be a better father to the cop's troubled teen. Travolta is especially fun trying to sound like Nicolas Cage, and the whole thing has an epic feel. They don't let little details get in the way, so if airtight logic is your thing, this won't work. But it's not sloppy or disposable either. It's big dumb fun."

He literally takes his face off, and then put another mans face on. I love that the title is really accurate. The man who's face he took, also murdered his son, because he was trying to kill him. It's all going according to plan, until the criminal wakes up from his coma, kills some people, gets out of the lab, and impersonates his look-alike. Since no one knows they've switched faces, except the people that are now dead, the FBI agent has to get out and get his counterpart back in jail before he does something to his wife. I didn't mention anyones name, because I honestly can't remember is Nicolas Cage played the good guy and then the bad guy or if he was the bad guy and then the good guy.

","BROKEN ARROW had already made me a John Woo fan when FACE/OFF was first released, and I was all over this movie. The camera moves, the dazzling gun play, the exciting shootouts . . . and the doves. Woo's brand of guns akimbo fight scenes worked its magic on my teenage brain in the worst way. And what's really satisfying about FACE/OFF is that those action scenes hold up. The big setpieces are well-choreographed and even intense, especially with the big speedboat chase. <br/><br/>It was really cool in the mid-'90s to see such a big Hollywood action bonanza with a sci-fi bent: two arch-nemeses literally swapping faces and effectively switching places with each other. This angle does demand a lot from the audience (and if you're turned off by this movie, you'll probably start punching holes in the logic), but it's the two stars that hold this up and make it all worthwhile. Half the fun of the whole thing is just watching John Travolta and Nicolas Cage effectively switch roles; Cage plays the tortured and vulnerable character while Travolta chews the scenery (to the hilt). Travolta makes for a great heavy, and it's pretty cool to see him let it all hang out. <br/><br/>It's a hell of an action movie and a great showcase of talent from the two leads. <br/><br/>8/10"

","I watch this film because people say was one of the best action films ever. I like Cage and Travolta, and action movies in general, so I give it a shot with open arms.<br/><br/>Sadly to say, I didn't like it. Don't necessarily hate it, but was so hard to buy several things about the story. I can take science fiction and fake things (hollywood style), but this time they go too far. Is like is too obvious they want to tell the story as they want, that they don't care is absurd in so many ways. The story and the way was develop is too fake that lose the charm.<br/><br/>Action was good, although sometimes was too long. At the end I just really get bored saying to my self ""no more action, just finish the movie"". Strange since I like so much action movies. And effects are cool. But, I don't know. Was like pushing too much in the same things, over and over.<br/><br/>If you only care about action, there are a million movies I could recommend before Face Off, like Commando, Die Hard, Rocky, Lethal weapon, True Lies, etc. These movies I mention not only have great action too, but also have more realistic and interesting stories. At least are more satisfactory to watch.<br/><br/>Face Off one of the best action films? No way. You might like it, but say is one of the best is absurd.<br/><br/>I am not watching this movie again, nor will recommend it to anyone."
"Odocoileus","1","1","3","17 December 2010"," So awful that all bad movies should be measured by this one
","Suspension of reality is needed for many movies, but those that make implausible action tolerable provide a basis for the ability. Face off fails to do that. The movie is beyond being implausible to the point of being vapid and annoying. Impossible self surgery and no recovery time followed by absurd chase scenes with debilitating wounds makes Face Off worthy of every insult and bad movie award ever devised or imagined. I hope the worst for every body who worked on this movie for foisting such crap on the public. It is shocking how this movie gets such a high rating. It must be true that is not possible to underestimate the stupidity of the public."
"Quinoa1984","9","1","3","21 April 2010"," could be preposterous... actually, it is, but Woo,Travolta/Cage make it astounding and entertaining
","John Woo hit a high-point in his US film career in Face/Off, where he took the method of filming action scenes like mad operas (or the other way around) that he did in a film like Hard Target and put it in the context of an actually strong script. This doesn't mean that the concept that's presented - that a terrorist who knows where a gigantic bomb in LA will detonate, and is now in a coma, and whose face is ripped off and put on the secret agent who was tracking him for years so the agent can find out the bomb's whereabouts and then the terrorist wakes up from the coma and puts on the agent's face - is entirely plausible. Not for a second. The film was originally set in the future, which is easy to see, and in other hands (less capable ones) it could be a stupid sci-fi channel original movie.<br/><br/>In John Woo he sees that the character set-ups and relationships are way too strong to ignore, and the line drawn between supposed good and bad can be blurred in the face of such an outrageous/clever premise. He hits new heights in filming his action sequences, from the gun battles (and boy there's a lot) to the big motor-boat chase that happens as the climax, to little but wild things like putting 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow' for just a half a minute in a blazing gun battle scene. The action has that thrilling sensation of movement and dazzle that Woo had in his HK flicks; if any film comes closest to the relentless intensity of something like Hard Boiled, it's this one (and you know it's just shamelessly by its maker in that church scene, with the doves and the church and the guns and the Mexican stand-off and so on).<br/><br/>I haven't mentioned the stars yet? This is a must to understand the appeal of Face/Off (or, for some, the lack thereof). Nicolas Cage and John Travolta get to have their cake and eat it, play the good but conflicted hero agent Archer (Travolta-cum-Cage) and the overly dastardly villain who just likes to have FUN in big capital letters (Cage-cum-Travolta). While the writing creates some subtext as to deeper levels of interpretation- I'm sure the film could easily be a Jungian thesis project- the actors just enjoy trying (and succeeding) to catch up to Woo's level of high-voltage action and mayhem. Both actors eat up scenery, or sometimes just let the double-level of meaning in the scene take over. When Cage dances in the Priest-frock and sings with the chorus, we know he's going to town, and when Travolta (as that character) smokes a cigarette the first time around his daughter (""Papa's got a brand new bag"") we can feel the gleeful horror in the room.<br/><br/>Sure, eventually the characters are put into a matter of just fists-on-fists, which seems to diminish what other variables of outcome these characters could get into. But then again, it's also a not-guilty pleasure of Hollywood popcorn movie-making, smart and effective in drawing out the characters' conflicts and what those around them have to come to realize (or not, as they may be dead sooner rather than later), and, more often than not, it's cheerfully funny in itself. It's like a comic-book concept brought to life and pumped with Woo-stylized bullets and octane - or, in another way, it's like what Michael Bay films try so hard to be and fall flat on their faces in chaos."

","The face off thing doesn't work if you take a mesomorph build guy and an ectomorph build one. The whole face is shaped following the bone structure which is completely different for Cage and Travolta. Even if you would assume they have made some magic technique to make the face fit, you still have the body that is completely different.<br/><br/>This may sound like unimportant, but it really made the complete film untrustworthy. they should have chosen two guys with very similar body types.<br/><br/>If you ignore this problem a 7/10 would probably OK for this movie, but since I couldn't ignore such an obvious fact i wouldn't give it more than a 6.5 out of 10."

An overall amazing movie. Nicholas Cage and John Travolta both deliver extremely intense and heart-felt performances, which is to be expected from the two legends of the silver screen. This movie is so intriguing and provocative, a shocking situation of decision around every turn, in which one can examine the true content of human nature and the human spirit.

","I have always been inclined to judge movies not so much on an absolute scale, but relative to the amount of talent and budget that went into the production. It's one thing when a low-budget effort put together by a bunch of no-talents ends up being a worthless piece of schlock. It's quite another when a big-budget studio production and a cast of compelling actors combine to give the world something that is totally devoid of artistic merit and offers less than zero in entertainment value. Judged by this criteria ""Face Off"" may well be the worst movie in the history of the universe.<br/><br/>As with all really bad movies the key ingredient here is a really bad script. (Or did they have a script? Maybe they just made up this mess on the fly while they were shooting.) Anyways, the script is totally contrived, implausible, predictable - and any other adjective that applies to a really bad script. <br/><br/>I mean how many times can Travolta and Cage shoot at each other from point blank range in a five-minute sequence and not kill each other? As the insults to one's intelligence kept coming and coming I found myself going from bored to angry. I guess I shouldn't take it so personally. The better thing to do would be to not persevere through the entire length of such a bad picture."

Then watch them again.<br/><br/>The action is brilliant, but mediocre compared to some of John Woo's other work. It's all there, guns, doves, freezeframes, slo-mo, and whathaveyou.<br/><br/>The characters are completely unbelievable and one dimensional, who say and do very cheesy things.

"ProfessorX","Null","1","3","21 June 2003"," One of the best action movies ever made.
","After non-events, such as the disappointing HARD TARGET and the fun-but-insignicant BROKEN ARROW, John Woo finally achieved his potential for making great action movies with Hollywood's money.<br/><br/> Using an amusingly improbable plot, Woo fleshes the bones of the script with some truly amazing action sequences, such as the speedboat chase and the apartment shoot-out. Woo shines as bright in the West that he did in the East, with films like THE KILLER and HARD-BOILED. Starting with a scene that most films would be happy to climax with, a jumbo-jet and chopper chase, notorious villain Castor Troy (snarling Nicholas Cage) is comatose. All is said done, until anti-terrorist agent Sean Archer (John Travolta) discovers that Troy has planted a bomb somewhere in downtown LA, to go off any time soon. So, through the wonders of medical science, Archer swaps faces with Troy, to infiltrate a high security prison and get the location of the bomb off Troy's weedy brother. But problems begin when the real Castor Troy wakes up, sans mug, and decides to get his own back by nicking Archer's. Roles are reversed, in a very Grecian way.<br/><br/> Travolta and Cage bounce off each other fantastically well, and it is good two potentially brilliant actors working in unison so well. Supporting cast, such as Joan Allen, the delicious Domanique Swain, and the ever reliable CCH Pounder add good back-up. The story could not be more implausible if Dolph Lundgren played Travolta's wife, or if suddenly Charles Bronson turned up in a blonde wig as his daughter, but you can forgive that for the sheer breakneck speed Woo goes at, and the fact that how original the plot actually is.  One of the truly great action thrillers of the '90s, this breathed new life into a genre dominated by yet more LETHAL WEAPONs, Arnie, and Stallone. A new, interesting variation on the old Good vs. Evil theme, with a neat schizophrenic twist in its tale. If you haven't it already, I urge you too now - it's the best movie John Woo will ever make in the West, espcially if you've seen (groan) M:I-2 and WINDTALKERS.  Go, see, now."

","Oh Boy!  This one is about 3 months past ripe!  You need a gas mask or an on hand ambulance to make it all the way through this one.  John Travolta goes from Pulp Fiction to this, how dumb. Nicholas Cage, everybody's favorite rusty robot, plays another bad role. Well, maybe it's the role that plays a bad actor.  Either way, as expected this film sucked like a giant Hoover vacuum hose in a tornado.  Nicholas Cage as expected, chewed on his tongue and babbled a lot of lunacy, while casting expressions that made me want to jump into the screen to check for his pulse. The question remains, Why do people love Nicholas Cage?  If this were Shakespearean times Nicholas Cage would be lucky to get a job playing the witch's cauldron in Macbeth.  The guy casts an aura that has only been rivaled by gravel and asphalt.  Satan if you are out there, enquiring minds want to know how many films you gave Cage for his soul?  When will we be rid of the violent, putrid stench that is Nicholas Cage?  Most importantly, is hell an eternity of Nicholas Cage films?  If so, maybe that is all preachers need to focus on to scare the Jesus into people."

","I was truly shocked at just how bad this movie is. Having never seen a John Woo flick before, I was kind of expecting a dumb-but-stylish action thriller.<br/><br/>Well, it actually surpassed my expectations as to its dumbness; although a silly premise or plot device doesn't necessarily kill a movie (e.g., CASABLANCA, with it's ""letters of transit"" and apparent lack of an extradition treaty between Berlin and Vichy), a movie cannot survive when the premise, every plot device, and every character is completely stupid.<br/><br/>The real surprise was that Woo's style (with which he is obviously deeply in love) is absolutely ridiculous. I'm not even talking about a lack of realism, which I expected, having seen clips of that whole silly ""shoot-two-guns-while-flying-through-the-air"" nonsense. I mean, it all just *looks* stupid. Steven Seagal did better than this in ON DEADLY GROUND (though ODG is an even worse movie overall). And it's made even more ludicrous by the fact that Woo has far too much respect for his own nonexistent talent.<br/><br/>Did anyone else find Nicolas Cage's emoting to be alternately amusing and sick-making? I've heard of scenery-chewing, but Cage just makes a pig of himself here. Lots of people have mentioned Travolta's awful hamminess (and I'm certainly not disagreeing), but I think Cage is the worse offender."

","This movie ranks up there with the best. Travolta and Cage must take on each others identity, and they really pull it off. Cage, as Castor Troy is a totally fanatical killer. He shows this in the beginning of the movie when Travolta catches up to him, and they have guns on each other. Travolta hates the idea of taking on Cages' identity to find out where he has hidden a bomb. The idea of ""transplanting"" faces is not too far-fetched in this day and age. Travolta gives a great performance as Archer. He must deal with the murder of his son, and face the man who did it. It is great to see how these characters face off against each other. Troy's character really surfaces when he goes to the prison to visit Archer and says, ""You'll be here for the next hundred years."" Archers' love for his wife is unquestioned, and it is the love that ultimately gets him through."

They, along with Woo, should have left the set of this movie with paper bags over their faces.  At least the stars can hope that the ridiculous confusion over who is who in the movie will stun viewers so completely that even after they leave the theatre Travolta and Cage remain bungled up in their minds. That way they can be blamed for each others' mistakes, and the ultimate mistake of agreeing to be in this movie.  Woo, on the other hand has no such alter-alibi to save his reputation.<br/><br/>The plot and script are so unbelievably terrible in this movie that... that it's not even comical.  In all honesty though, Cage and Travolta are good actors and they mostly do a good job with their parts...mostly.  It would have been good for this movie if less proficient actors had been used.  That way all elements of this film would have been comically bad--direction, plot, script, and acting-- and a viewer could laugh throughout, instead of feeling sad for Cage and Travolta.<br/><br/>Way too much shooting with the stars wearing the Hollywood ""magic, invisible bullet forcefield"" and everyone else jumping in front of the guns.  There is this ridiculous scene near the end where they have a shootout in some isolated church. Doves flying around, pictures of Mary and statues of Christ share slo-mo frames with firing guns and dying people.  Why?  I don't know.  I certainly hope that Woo didn't intend for this to be poetic or symbolic or something like that; there was no basis for it, it was just plain stupid.<br/><br/>At any rate, Woo is not completely without redemption in his career.

Let's just face the awful truth: In EVERY action scene in this movie, not a single, solitary cop or Fed would have been shot, let alone killed.<br/><br/>
John Woo works well as a director when the action has a ""reality"" to it. Police bullets just don't bounce off the side of a Lear jet, while the bad guy guns down cops. It just doesn't happen!

The DVD states, right to the point, that the Execs thought it needed more guns and more bodies, and boy did ""Face/Off"" deliver. Jumping to the end of this ""any excuse for a stunt"" movie is the ""shot and run over by the speed boat"" stunt. Like the L.A.

I know the point of action films is to be high budget and unrealistic, but this was into a whole new realm of unfeasible.<br/><br/>Pulp Fiction may have revitalised Travolta's career in the '94, but it's career choices like Face/Off and Battlefield Earth that mean he's regressed all the way back to 1993.

"sterlinrivera-2000","10","0","1","13 February 2020"," An Insanely Unique Action Film
","Face/Off is from the director of Broken Arrow, John Woo, and I can definitely say it is just as awesome and entertaining as Broken Arrow in terms of story, action, acting, and pacing.<br/><br/>Face/Off is about a terrorist, Castor Troy (Nicholas Cage) that attempts to kill FBI agent Sean Archer (John Travolta), but ends up killing his son. Then years go by and Sean finally catches Castor and knocks him out cold. Castor is then put in a coma, and Sean finds out that Castor has a bomb planted somewhere, and the only people that know about it is Castor himself and his brother, Pollux (Alessandro Nivola). Sean then goes into a procedure where doctors remove his face, and put Castor's face on to Sean's so that he can go to a prison to find out info about the bomb from Pollux. Then Castor wakes up with no face, forces the doctors to put Sean's face on to his, and he torches everything so that no one knows about the procedure. Now it is up to Sean (in Castor's body) to stop Castor (in Sean's body) as Castor has some deliciously evil plans up his sleeves.<br/><br/>Face/Off has such an awesome concept to it. I love the whole idea of the hero and villan switching faces and personalities. On top of that, the story was very well constructed and put together neatly.
The acting is very good from everyone. Really Travolta and Cage are the only two recognizable actors in this film, but everyone else did a great job. I didn't even mind Cage as he was crazy and bizarre at times in the film. He did a neat job at doing that.
The action, just like Broken Arrow, is the best part of the movie. It has quite a bit of explosions, gun firing, violence, etc. I love how, also like Broken Arrow, we get an incredible showdown between the villan and the hero towards the end.<br/><br/>Bottom line, Face/Off is a wicked cool action film and is just as amazing as Broken Arrow on so many levels."

","FBI veteran Archer is finally catching his sworn enemy, Castor. He learns that this powerful criminal has set up a bomb that will blow up the whole city, but since Castor is in a coma there is no way to question him. So he decides to do a face transplant and posing as Castor tries to find out the location of the bomb. Meanwhile, Castor wakes up without a face, forces the surgeon to transplant Archer's face to him and takes over his identity, both in the FBI and in private life, making Archer's life a total mess.<br/><br/>This action thriller with a sci-fi premise is full of plot twists and represents a wild ride from start to finish.

""Face/Off"" isn't a great film, but it is an absolute riot."
"ronakkotian","7","0","1","19 August 2019"," Highly entertaining but quite silly
","John Woo's Face/Off is a classic amongst the many action films made in Hollywood. This movie belongs to the 90s. It's a movie that is very entertaining to watch but has quite a few flaws in terms of its storyline.<br/><br/>Face/Off follows Sean Archer, an FBI agent who goes through a surgery to look like the criminal Castor Troy in order to stop an attack on the city. However, trouble ensues when Castor Troy takes on the look of Sean Archer.<br/><br/>Let me start off with the acting as that is the most credible part of the movie. John Travolta and Nicolas Cage are solid throughout. It's not easy to play two very contrasting personalities but both of them make it look extremely simple. Without Travolta and Cage, this film wouldn't be as entertaining. All the other supporting actors do justice to their roles as well.<br/><br/>John Woo's direction is good but it could definitely be better. Majority of the time, Woo's direction is really good but the area where he falters is the shootout scenes. During the shootout segments you can tell something is going on but you don't what since you don't directly see the action taking place. There is just a lot of quick cutting and shots of guns being fired. In the final action sequence you can tell where a stunt double has been used instead of the actors. There were some errors as well during the action scenes. In one scene where Castor shoots an agent, you can see the wire being used to move the agent backwards. A lot of films have errors like this but they aren't as visible as the ones in Face/Off.<br/><br/>The actual storyline of this film is very creative and unique but parts of it doesn't make sense. Both actors have a very different physique so how do they change their body structure so quickly after the surgery? The surgical procedure itself would take a long time to recover from but the film shows an instant recovery. Like this, there are quite a lot of plot holes within the script.<br/><br/>Face/Off isn't a perfect film. In fact it's nowhere near one. The entire premise has a lot of areas that aren't patched up but what sells this movie is the ridiculous action scenes and impeccible acting from Travolta and Cage."

But when Castor awakens after surgery,he ends up taking Sean's face and posing as Sean.<br/><br/>Overall it was a very good flick.

All I saw was John Travolta and Nick Cage acting; I was never engrossed in the actual characters. The action scenes are so over the top as well that I couldn't buy into it.

"one9eighty","5","0","1","11 July 2018"," Facing off with faces off in Face/Off
","Nicolas Cage and John Travolta face off, in, err, in Face Off, where they literally have a face off. Confused? Meh - don't be, it's a no brainer action film more than a thought provoking epic. Travolta is a cop, Cage is criminal. Cage gets captured and ends up in a coma, but the cops need to know what Cage knew, so they get Travolta to very literally swap faces with Cage - because it's that easy, quick and clean :D . Travolta, as Cage, then goes undercover as Cage to stop a terrorist plot - but unbeknown to Travolta, Cage comes out of his coma and escapes. He put on Travolta's face - living as Travolta with his wife and child. Cage destroys all the evidence previously linking him and his gang to the crimes, and while he's at it he destroys the facility (and staff) who can reverse the face swap procedure. Cage and Travolta meet, setting up a twist in the plot, confirming that Travolta (as Cage) needs to become more criminal if he's going to escape the prison he's in, while Cage (as Travolta) needs to be a little nicer if he's going to get away with things scot free. Of course, the middle ground shows what both of them would be like, if in their own lives, they took a characteristic of each other. <br/><br/>This film comes straight from the 90's, where a fart of an idea would end up being the plot for an action movie. A lot of the acting is over the top, but intentionally done so in order to allow Travolta and Cage to mimic one and other, plus it gives the audience an easy in to see who is who, despite the faces appearing on-screen. There is plenty of action - there are plenty of gun shots (most of which seem to miss - in a small room Cage and Travolta can unload automatic guns and still miss each other, but when aiming for henchmen they seem to have pin point accuracy), but don't be surprised to see stunt cables, visible squibs or planted explosives on display - a bit lazy. This film was never going to win any major awards, but it won't drive you to smashing up the TV if you happen to catch it repeated one night. It's not the worst film but I've got to be realistic when rating it and compare it to other films of the era and genre, I can only give this a 5 out of 10 at most. A typical John Woo film, lots of action, little plot, stylised imagery, hardly any depth, a little bit corny, featuring totally unrealistic occurrences for the hell of it. The film probably helped John Woo's cult status, but it didn't do anything to move cinema forward."
"classicsoncall","7","0","1","15 June 2018"," ""It's like looking in a mirror, only not!""
","The sci-fi aspect of the story is commendable but things get somewhat preposterous rather quickly. The difference in size between John Travolta and Nicolas Cage should have triggered some kind of reaction in the other characters they dealt with, not to mention their proportionally different shaped heads. Travolta's is a lot rounder while Cage has a more elongated aspect. Certainly Sean Archer's wife Eva (Joan Allen) should have figured something was wrong when she shared a bed with Sean's replacement. Additionally, as Archer (Travolta) assumed Castor Troy's (Cage) identity, he didn't have much of a problem with multiple law enforcement authorities getting killed in the line of duty, not to mention stealing a car when the opportunity arose. Some FBI agent! <br/><br/>I'll say this, if Nicolas Cage wasn't a pro-wrestling fan I'd be surprised. During the jail break with Ivan Dubov (Chris Bauer), he let out with a handful of Whoo's! that would have made Ric Flair proud. You know, I thought it was pretty dumb when Sean (as Castor) derided brother Pollux (Alessandro Nivola) after learning of the bomb plant at the Los Angeles Convention Center. That was just an unforced error that wasn't necessary.<br/><br/>The film's primary audience is the action/adventure crowd and on that score the picture delivers. The boat crash to wind things up at the finale is simply spectacular, even if the logistics of the high speed chase on water defies credibility. With identities back in place for the closing scene, anyone who didn't see Sasha's (Gina Gershon) son Adam coming around to fill the vacuum left by young Michael (Myles Jeffrey) from the film's opening scene, well you just weren't paying attention. All's well that ends well I guess."

After capturing Castor and his brother Pollux Troy (Alessandro Nivola), they find a plan for a massive nerve gas bomb. Pollux refuses to talk to anybody but his brother Castor. That's when they come up with a plan to switch faces, but it all backfires.<br/><br/>This is the pinnacle of ridiculousness that is John Woo. And he's loving every bit of it. The action is ridiculous. The story is ridiculous. The science is ridiculous. And most of all, it doesn't matter. John Woo is about big action, lots of gun, and pointing guns at each other without firing. For John Woo fans, it really doesn't get much better than this.<br/><br/>The actors do have to play two polar opposite parts. It's probably not as difficult as one imagines.

The two actors are rightfully having a blast in this movie, playing outsized and campy action villains and heroes.<br/><br/>However I find the movie lacking in its vapidity and many extraneous scenes. Many of the characters are poorly acted and written, and there is little sense in the story. Despite its style and masterful execution, I still find it lacking, even as a piece of pure fluff entertainment. The movie is outrageous and entertaining, but nevertheless, pretty horrendous."

That was enough for me to give it a bad rating. Also, people's bodies don't fly back ten feet from a gun shot. The most hilarious part is in the boat chase, nick cage starts barefoot water skiing.

Try the rest of the movie, which is as silly as any of the old silent Keystone Komedies-no exaggeration. The villain is skinny while the policeman is a fatso-yet we're supposed to believe only the faces were changed. Even the wife is fooled, until she is told to do a blood test on her supposed husband.

The firefights in where everybody is diving, the slow motion, the marksmen who are bad shots, the dramatic Mexican standoffs, the use of doves, just the general over the top sequences are not mean't to portray realism but rather the intensity of the situation. And it works.<br/><br/>This also has to be the best body swap film. Freaky Friday and a whole bunch of other works are just... played out. This is much more refreshing, seeing it being done through medical technology instead of some contrived magic spell. Not only that but its not meant to be quirky, that is not to say the movie is without some laughs.<br/><br/>However there are some things that are sort of cheesy, the maniacal laughter, the whole peaches thing and the face caress. Those are minor however.<br/><br/>John Woo is the man. There should be to an extent more Hong Kong directors in Hollywood with a lot of creative control. And I'm sorry Bollywood fans, your directors are inept to this task (I'm only saying this because I'm of Indian descent). It's only a matter of time we see another heroic bloodshed Hollywood film."

","Sean Archer is a covert anti-terrorism big shot who doesn't fool around. Caster Troy is a terrorist for hire who doesn't fool around either. Wait! Actually he does fool around. In fact, he's the horniest wild-eyed evil-doer you will see in any story whether it be on page or on screen. All the dude needs to do is cup an ass and he has a mangasm. Imagine the Joker lost his make-up and injected himself with Charlie Sheen's tiger blood. Top it off with a Caesar hairdo and the result is a man who is not quite charming or funny but thinks he's both. When Cage trades the Castor character for Archer with Castor face, the mangasms are replaced by sappy uber-emoting. But Cage's performance is a study in subtlety. There's a few nervous breakdowns and a few emotional outbursts but it's all with a measure of restraint. It's a wonder that the other characters don't drown in man tears but it's still remarkably poised. Goons and gunsmiths shoot and miss each other over and over again. But it's okay because they look soooo cool doing it. And a John Woo film wouldn't be Wooey without Woo birds – aka doves, or are they pigeons? Whatever they are, they're Catholic and feel most at home at a coastal church where guns are going off. Prepare to get a ferocious facial of furious fun. This movie will blow your face off!"

","If you can watch a John Woo film without being on the edge of your seat, I'm pretty sure you have no pulse. ""Face/Off"" is such an inventive movie when it comes to style, the techniques are just dazzling and all the action scenes are well above classic shoot-em-ups. I especially love that scene where hero and villain are standing back to back, Woo already sorta did that in ""Hard Target"" but somehow it's even better here. ""Face/Off"" is not all action scenes though. The plot, though completely nonsensical, is very compelling as well. It relies heavily on John Travolta and Nicholas Cage being able to switch characters without effort, and I'm glad to say neither actor disappoints. The way they pick up each other's traits is just brilliant. Even the family subplot of this movie is good, and family subplots in action movies are NEVER any good. Usually they're tacked on at the last minute in a desperate attempt to give characters depth, but in ""Face/Off"" it's an essential part of the story. ""Face/Off"" may be a dumb action flick to some, but it's a dumb action flick with one hell of a heart."

","A revolutionary medical technique allows an undercover agent to take the physical appearance of a major criminal and infiltrate his organization.<br/><br/>The greatest trick the film pulls off is it's disguise as the most ridiculous film ever. John Woo knows this. He beholds this. Then he faces it, and changes it into an actual GOOD movie... The thing that really surprised me the most was it's acting. John Travolta and Nicholas Cage (as crazy as it seems) make this film. Their acting was phenomenal, and the fact that John Woo somehow inserted good acting into an action film is beyond me. The antics in this movie seemed a little far-fetched, quite, but it seemed like John Woo made this work. He made it work where it looked normal to us. The action, next alongside the acting, was fantastic. I've seen Mission: Impossible 2, which John Woo did a horrible job in and made every action scene far-fetched, but this film makes it realistic. There's real, gritty action that literally makes you at the edge of your seat. My favorite was the scene where the baddie's hideout got demolished. The kid has headphones on, listening to Over the Rainbow, while he watches people getting brutally shot to death. Something magical beholds itself inside this film, and for this being John Woo's first American film, he needs more like it. I mean EVERYTHING will pull you into it's far-fetched world of un-believable nonsense, but guess what? It actually, somehow, works. <br/><br/>The question your asking yourself right now ""Should I should it?"" Well I'm going to give you a split-second to think and shout out YES. But that is only if you can forgive it's preposterous-ness and enjoy it for making it work. If only you can understand that we need a little bizarre things to make things work. 8/10."
"oneguyrambling","8","0","1","27 December 2011"," If you go Brain / Out, you'll enjoy Face / Off. (Read before crying).
","The only thing that really needs a transplant in order to enjoy Face/Off more completely is a brain, preferably with that of a goldfish (for people who enjoy Transformers that procedure seems to have been successful).<br/><br/>When evil and vicious criminal Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage initially) inadvertently kills Sean Archer's (John Travolta at first) kid in a botched hit, then Archer nearly jails Castor's brother Pollix and nearly kills Castor in the bloody operation to nab him, it is fair to assume that the two would never be good buddies.<br/><br/>But upon learning that a bomb has been planted somewhere in Los Angeles and is prepped to blow in coming days more desperate action is required.<br/><br/>Frankly insane action.<br/><br/>It is agreed that Archer needs to uncover the location and details of the bomb from imprisoned Pollix. To do this he must appear to be a friendly face, and whose face be more friendly than brother Castor?!? To that point Castor's body was kept on ice, for what reason who knows? In any case a five minute operation peels off Castor's face and has it plopped onto Archer's (his is peeled and kept to one side for replacing later). Seriously that's how they did it! Cut around the edges and peel the thing off.<br/><br/>No scars, nothing if this technology was available over a decade ago how come Heidi Montag and Tara Reid look like scarecrows made out of sacks? Into prison goes Archer to see ""brother"" Pollix, in an operation so secret that not even his wife can know Ummmmm, why? Is she such a security risk? But. while Archer is away and using his face Castor awakes in what you would think is a maximum security area – but no. Within a short time he has rounded up everyone who knows (HOW?) and killed them in one fell swoop.<br/><br/>Then assuming no-one else knows out the door he goes to inhabit the life of one Sean Archer, including his job, home and marital bed.<br/><br/>(Soooo many questions! How did he know the security code at home? How did he know where he worked? Where stuff was? Pin Numbers?) Of course now that everyone who knows the deal are dead bar Archer and Castor, so Castor is outside playing cops and hubbies, while Archer is in a maximum security prison with no means of escape.<br/><br/>Again ummmmm: Might I propose a hypothetical Archer tells the true story, and when no-one believes suggests maybe fingerprints, blood types etc? And people who have known either guy for years never twig??? Nope? OK so in escaping dozens of wardens and security members are killed, followed by Travolta and Cage overacting at least 175% MORE than they already do – and they're both huuuuge over-actors – and leaping around Los Angeles blazing away with two pistols and automatic weapons for about an hour, gunning down perhaps hundreds of innocent cops and bystanders and hitting everyone is sight – but strangely they never manage to hit each other even from point blank range.<br/><br/>The film is a little overlong and suffers from being overly sentimental and clumsily emotional and symbolic we get it, Travolta loves his family and misses his kid, we shouldn't need to be reminded of it every 12 seconds.<br/><br/>So why a pretty generous 7.5? Easy, John Woo knows his action, and even though the film is a half an hour too long another half hour is spent in various shootouts and chase scenes, including a frankly ludicrous but nonetheless entertaining finale with an 8 gun (!) Mexican stand-off, speedboats and a harpoon gun fight that makes the film worth watching by itself.<br/><br/>Again this film falls into the ""Really?"" category of entertaining disbelief with Con Air, The Rock and Bad Boys. Is it odd that Nic Cage is in three of those named, all within 2 years? Aaahh who cares, Face / Off might not make a lick of sense if you dare think about it, but the action sequences justify turning the other cheek – even if it wasn't yours originally If you go Brain / Out, you'll enjoy Face / Off.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 7.5 / 10. Entertaining escapism, excellent action sequences and baffling plot events; to paraphrase a legendary hip hop group ""Let's Face / Off the Woo is back!"""
"Tweekums","8","0","1","19 March 2011"," Travolta and Cage swap roles
","Of John Woo's Hollywood Films that I've seen this is the one that comes closest to capturing the excitement of the films he made when he was still in Hong Kong. John Travolta plays FBI agent Sean Archer, whose son was killed six years previously by Castor Troy, played by Nicolas Cage. Since that time Archer has been desperate to capture Troy and one day he succeeds in capturing Castor and his brother Pollux. Castor is in an apparently permanent coma and Pollux is sent to a maximum-security prison. It looks like the case is solved until it emerges that the brother's have planted a chemical weapon in Los Angeles that is set to go off within a week. The only person alive to know where the bomb is located is Pollux and he won't tell anybody other than his brother. To get the information Archer undergoes radical surgery; he literally wears Castor's face. While he is in prison the real Castor awakens and takes Archer's face and his life. Having killed everybody who knew about the face swap Archer is trapped in prison while Castor uses his new FBI position to get his brother released, defuse the bomb and become a hero. Archer must then escape from prison and use criminal contacts that think he is Troy to regain his life and his face.<br/><br/>This is a proper action film with plenty of shooting, fighting and explosions. Travolta and Cage are fine in their roles; it was fun watching them switch characters after their faces were swapped. Those looking for John Woo's hallmarks won't be disappointed; there are plenty of times where the characters stand with guns in each other's faces and a gun fight in a church while doves fly around them. Of course the face swapping and the nature of the prison aren't that realistic but anybody who can suspend their disbelief shouldn't worry too much about that; this film is about action not realism!"

","John Travolta and Nicholas Cage star in this action-filled drama about an obsessed government agent who needs to change his face to his greatest enemy if he is to shine like the hero he is. Sean Archer (Travolta) surgically puts his nemesis, Castor Troy (Cage)'s face on and infiltrates Troy's brother's prison to get information about a bomb that is about to blow up LA.<br/><br/>While the acting is enticing -specifically on Cage's part, surprisingly- the majority of this film is filled with shooting and quick wit one-liners. Travolta plays a bad guy for 85% of the film, even at the beginning of the film he is still a bad person. Cage switches roles from clinically insane and nefarious to a sane, caring person and above all -- a hero.<br/><br/>Special effects are great and the cinematography is superb. You get a bunch of laughs, mainly from Travolta, and there is a touch of romance. For the most part, they use up tons of bullets and create explosions as much as they can.

","When John Woo burst onto the American movie-making scene, he was marked for greatness as a ground-breaking director. But to be honest, he has been found out. There are only so much slow-mo, doves flying and sterile action sequences a man can take - and Woo has run dry.<br/><br/>Van Damme's Hard Target was an introduction to Woo - with the poetic jumping and shooting uncountable bullets with two guns whilst twirling in the air. It was good - if you were twelve. Later - MI:2 - which is most definitely the most atrocious film Cruise has ever done (and yes I am including Far and Away in that). Woo just wasn't able to sustain one ounce of dramatic license in an incomprehensible sequence of events.<br/><br/>Somewhere in between lies Face/Off.<br/><br/>The premise is ridiculous in the extreme. Just listen to Cage / Travolta explaining it in the movie and you can almost hear the laughter off screen. The action scenes were okay - but just that - okay. Not great, not thrilling - just okay. For an action film - that is not a good sign. I gotta be honest here and say that the sugary sweet nature of the film's family tie-ins were so overblown and sickly - that I almost vomited. The final scene is especially nauseating.<br/><br/>Cage is maniacal at times and Travolta reasonably straight faced - but they cannot save this film. Plot is not a major influence on Woo and the way the film moves forward is ludicrous. <br/><br/>For me 5/10 .... and Gina Gershon bagged 3 of those points on her own..."

","*** out of ****<br/><br/>Easily John Woo's most acclaimed Hollywood film to date, Face/Off is often mentioned among lists of the top action films of all-time. But I can't say I agree, I didn't even think it was the best action film of 1997; that honor belongs to Wolfgang Petersen's nail-biter, Air Force One. What Face/Off has going for it is an ingeniously silly premise and Woo's expert hand at crafting mayhem. Both aspects work well enough to make this a fitfully enjoyable thrill ride, but never quite as satisfying as it should have been.<br/><br/>John Travolta stars as Sean Archer, an FBI agent whose son was killed by a terrorist named Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage). After years of exhaustive search, Archer tracks down Troy and his brother, and captures both siblings after a violent shootout. But his brother, Pollux, reveals that a bomb is set to detonate somewhere in Los Angeles, and the FBI have little clue as to the whereabouts of the explosives and when its set to go off.<br/><br/>So one agent comes up with a wild idea, and shares it only with Archer and his partner. It appears there's a secret laboratory that has enhanced technology capable of removing a person's face and placing it on another ""patient."" The plan is to place Archer uncercover secretly in prison as Castor, but everything goes wrong when Troy awakens from his coma and takes Archer's face and identity, and even his family life, leaving the real Archer stuck in prison. Knowing this isn't a prison drama, you can guess what's going to happen from there.<br/><br/>John Woo is an adept action director and his work in Face/Off is superb. The action rolls at a breakneck pace, mostly with bloody shootouts, much of them employed in balletic slow motion, adding a graceful touch that somehow feels appropriate. There are also exciting fights and even a pulse-pounding boat chase in the finale.<br/><br/>Human drama is actually quite effective here, with Joan Allen giving us a solid and likable character who's caught in this whole mess, wondering who to trust and how to escape this nightmarish situation. Nicolas Cage is just as good in creating a likable character in Archer, which is all the more amazing when you consider that he begins the film as a psychotic villain. Even the sexy Gina Gershon brings humanity in a role as a protective, but crime-prone mother. Woo also plays on the whole good vs. evil concept, and it works just fine; there are the requisite doves and, uh, face/offs.<br/><br/>
With great action and characters, what's wrong with the movie?<br/><br/>Right off the top of my head, it's John Travolta that bugs me the most. Not only is he an overrated actor, he doesn't make a particularly convincing action star. Overweight as he was at the time, watching him perform so many flips and death-defying stunts (obviously done by stuntmen) is too difficult to believe, perhaps even moreso than the silly premise of this film itself! And when the transformation occurs, Travolta's performance doesn't match what Nicolas Cage gave us in the opening. Sure, he's equally off-the-wall and insane, but he's actually just giving us another rendition of his villain from Broken Arrow.<br/><br/>The opposite can be said for Nic Cage (for the most part, he does go too over-the-top in a few instances), who actually improves upon Travolta when he becomes Archer, displaying frantic emotions with more urgency and believability. As an action star, he's more physically cut for this kind of stuff. Watching Cage perform balletic flips and outrageous stunts provokes an adrenaline rush, rather than an unintentional laugh.<br/><br/>
The whole concept behind the movie is highly improbable, and the film manages to make it seem even more unlikely! As far as dramatic intentions go, the premise works, particularly in a scene where Cage as Archer tries to convince Allen that he's her husband and another scene where Archer's daughter holds a gun toward both men, not knowing who to shoot.<br/><br/>
But, man, this story is filled with plot holes. The most noticeable right off the bat is the FBI agent whose ear is shot off in the opening gunfight. When Travolta visits the lab, he sees the scientists and technicians rebuilding this man a new ear. As stated before, this lab is meant to be secret to even the FBI, so how the hell would this agent explain to his co-workers how he got this new ear? Castor (when played by Cage) is a fairly thin man. Archer (when played by Travolta) is a fairly chubby guy. I'd like to know how these scientists made the relatively thin Castor into a chubby guy. Whose idea was it to keep this whole undercover plan secret to the FBI? Sure, I see the need to keep it from leaking to the prisoners, but shouldn't at least the head of the FBI be aware of what's going on, so just in case the unthinkable happens, they'll know how to deal with it. For that matter, how can such a laboratory, full of the latest in high-tech equipment AND holding the world's most dangerous terrorist, be left with absolutely no guards at night? And why the heck did Nick Cassavetes kiss Gina Gershon (who plays Cassavetes' sister) full on the lips from just out of left field (okay, I realize he was a thug and was dying, but how many people do you know would give such a sleazy kiss to their sister as a farewell?).<br/><br/>
With so many infuriating plot holes, Face/Off annoys almost as often as it thrills. Admittedly, I had a higher opinion of it before repeat viewings, but the best action films still hold up in spite of implausibilities (Indiana Jones, Speed, Air Force One, The Mummy) because they possess a certain magic that keeps them above the rest of the crop. Face/Off has style to burn and action that gets more exciting as it moves along, but by the end, I just didn't feel that much-needed movie magic that would have attained this masterpiece status."

","POSSIBLE SPOILERS: DO NOT CONTINUE IF YOU WANT TO WATCH THIS FREE OF ANY DESCRIPTION OF PLOT DETAILS<br/><br/>The highlight of this movie is watching both John Travolta and Nicholas Cage playing their respective characters and then switch roles part of the way through. Travolta plays Sean Archer, a G-man hunting down a nasty terrorist named Castor Troy, played by Nicholas Cage. The beginning of the movie shows Castor Troy attempting to assassinate Archer, who is on a carousel with his young son, only to accidentally kill the little boy in the process. It is a heartbreaking scene and sets up the serious jones that Archer has for getting his hands on the guy quite well. After a watered down but still frenetic John Woo style shootout in a hangar, Archer manages to catch his man when Troy ends up in a coma from a hard hit. Problems ensue when the authorities find out that Castor and his beloved brother Pollux, who was captured during the shootout, have planted a biological thingamajig somewhere in the city that's set to blow at an unspecified time and only Pollux knows where it is and he ain't talking from the prison he's locked up in. Desperate, a couple of higher-ups devise a plan to have Archer and Troy switch places by means of a radical new surgery procedure to get Archer to divulge the specifics of the bomb's location and it's detonation time. Basically, they take one guy's face right off and slap it on the other guy's freshly skinned face, along with several other body shaping methods. This is the point where if you don't suspend your disbelief, you're going to be in for a painful sitting. I agree, the whole concept is ridiculous. I read an interview with a neurosurgeon or someone similar who was asked to give his opinions on the surgical operation in the movie. He said something along the lines of how lasering the face off of someone is likely to cause an incurable amount of trauma, something which was readily apparent to me when I initially saw the movie. The rest of the movie has Cage playing the good guy and it's pretty interesting to see how well he plays it. Travolta gets kudos as well and even manages to produce several laughs by making fun of his own physicality when playing Troy. I enjoyed the movie, though I felt it wasn't true John Woo. As far as the action goes, yeah it's fine. People don't run out of bullets at all. People use two handguns at the same time. People pull guns out of nowhere just when you think they had no more guns to spare. The movie is actually pretty violent but the action is nowhere near as good as Woo's original Hong Kong stuff. I felt that the movie dragged in certain places as well and the runtime is a bit long. The thing that makes the overall film work, as I said before, are the over-the-top performances of both Cage and Travolta. It's great to see them basically mimic each other down to the tee. If anything, the least you will walk away from this movie with is admiration for the two. Say what you will about either one but they managed to prove just how good they are at their craft with this film.<br/><br/>RATING: ***1/2 out of *****."

","I haven't liked Woo's Hollywood pictures. Studios wanted to test him with Van Damme and he made the somewhat watchable actionier Hard Target (still, nowhere near great). I mean, if you can make a good Van Damme movie, there has gotta be some kind of magic in you. Broken Arrow was a horrible failure and although this did make some huge bank, it still doesn't mean that it's a masterpiece. Because it's not. Travolta and Cage are not in best shape (witness the pathetic performance from Cage, as his character confronts his wife in the hospital and tells that weepy story of their first date. There's nothing wrong with a grown man crying, but these are baby tears). And, I REALLY could have done with less slo-mo.

","Since Face/Off is based on a relatively absurd premise, it's quite easy to look pass various questions concerning logic.  For example, is it really possible for the transition of the faces of people with different blood types to work (the story behind it felt contrived by the way), how can somebody still be able to smoke after they have just had their face taken off, how and why can you tell the amount the bullets you have left, etc. This is off-set by some effect camera work (e.g. up close shots of bullets leaving guns the moment that they're fired) that gives something extra to the action sequences.  For example, there's an action sequence that somehow gives off an illusion that someone is firing a gun while on top of a moving squad car.  But it seems that as the film goes on, the dialog just gets unintentionally sillier and it absolutely gets to a point were the the only thing that Face/Off can fall back on is the action (which can be over-blown and tense at the same time) in spite of the fact that it seems to try to off-set its premise by throwing in a plot about revenge.

We have Dominique Swain (insert rallying wolf whistles here) as Archer's loooovely daughter, Gina Gershon as Castor Troy's girlfriend, and Travolta and Cage switching off roles as Archer and Troy, all via the joys of plastic surgery. The action reaches a fevered pitch as the two pick up guns and start blowing up everything in sight.  John Woo's trademark, dizzying, almost lyrical gunfights, punctuate each of the struggles between the determined good and the twisted evil. If you're looking for a lot of action, as well as a great story and the grace of John Woo's directing, take Face/Off for a spin.  Afterwards (if you're impressed... if you aren't, don't read any further), rent John Woo's other good movies (The Killer, Hard Boiled, and Broken Arrow) and see what you think of them!"
