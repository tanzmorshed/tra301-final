"picaresk","4","98","132","10 March 2012"," An insult to Turks, an insult to filmmaking
","This film is an insult to Faith Sultan Mehmet, to Ottoman history, and to the intelligence of any audience. It is the very example of how western orientalizm can be internalized. The reason why the conquest of Constantinopolis was a matter of survival for the Turks -the economical, political reasons- were totally non existent. Mehmet II, a well educated man, is nothing more than a religious zealot in this film. Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos, who is well respected by the Turks, is a caricature. <br/><br/>Suicide bombings, only a phenomenon of late 20th century, is a common theme in the film: all Ottoman soldiers behave like suicide bombers! What is this? What are they trying to imply? This is a part of the recent series of superficial films and TV shows which seem to aim de-educating Turkey, constantly attack reason, and play at Turkish people's feelings of being under attack of western contempt, orientalizm and memories of WWI defeat.<br/><br/>The side themes fail as hard as the main theme: an absurd love story, a wife with no dialogue, unexplainable motives of Urban, and so on... <br/><br/>This film is harshly criticized in Turkey. I can't imagine why it is being defended so eagerly on IMDb. Because it fails in stirring any feeling of satisfaction of national pride as well. No character study, no context, no wit, not even a propaganda, just the first depiction of the conquest with a relatively big production, a way to imagine how it was, and that's why people go to see this movie in masses. One can't deny the production of war scenes is an improvement for Turkish film industry, but unfortunately, that's all."
"tripolis29","6","80","112","6 October 2012"," The Fall of Constantinople...and the ""Fall"" of Truth
","This movie tells the story of the Life of Mehmed II...the Fall of Constantinople...well, you don't have to be a historian to realize the unprecedented distortion of History. I watched this movie with the best intentions, i wanted to like it, since this was the first time that such a historical event as the Fall of Constantinople was depicted in the big screen. However, at the end of the film, the general feeling was lukewarm. I would like to judge this movie both as a piece of art, and as a piece of history telling.. Production was good. There was a good effort in depicting Constantinople with special effects, and credit should be given to the ones responsible for this. The ""bird's view"" shots of the city were impressive, Hagia Sophia, Hippodrome, Palaces, the Gates..all can be easily compared to shots of Rome in Gladiator or the shots of Babylon in Alexander. However, there were some problematic ""green background"" shots where the special effects were poor and fakeness was obvious, especially in shots were actors were implemented. The script was average, not too complicated, kept really simple..but faithful to the Ottomans' point of view..and the direction..well, it was average to bad, with awkward imbalances and gaps. This, in combination with some bad acting made things worse, especially for the first half of the movie. Another issue I would like to note is the absolute miscast for the film. The actors chosen to portray certain characters were purposely selected. Someone could easily see the good and noble Mehmed II, and the ""ruthless, almost satanic"" face of Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos. The second half of the film was more enjoyable for me. The battles were OK and, as i have already mentioned, it was nice to see at last in a movie the Siege of Constantinople, as Hollywood insists on depicting only the Crusades in Jerusalem, the Battles of Joan of Arc and the skirmishes of Robin Hood. However, I can't help it but judge the movie here as far as the history depiction is concerned...and this depiction could not be more inaccurate... Of course, from the Ottoman point of view, there were so many Turkish heroes that distinguished either with their actions of heroism, or their death. But why this story telling is kept one sided? Why is it kept secret that the city had only 7,000 soldiers defending it? Why is it kept secret that the Ottomans entered the city from a small, unguarded gate? Why is it kept secret that Giustiniani was wounded by a cannonball? Why, by the way, is he depicted as evil? And why we hear nothing about the Emperor's last stand in the battle? This is what annoyed me the most...Constantine Palaiologos was fighting alongside his troops. After realizing that the city is doomed, he tore his imperial suite and no one could distinguish him from the rest of the soldiers. He died fighting, defending his city, his people and his faith...he was depicted throughout the movie but his last stand was somehow suddenly forgot by the filmmakers...and last, but not least..without any intention to criticize the Turks but with all due respect the last scene of the film was rather funny..it is recorded in History what happened after the capture of the city, how many were enslaved and tortured..Mehmed II did indeed offer freedom to Christians, but there is no word in the film about the impaled and tortured Christians, or the fact that the Emperor's head was put in the Hippodrome.. Generally, my rating is 6/10 for the effort and some quite good fight scenes."

","Well,before reading my review, you should know something about me first. I don't like commenting on movies generally, because it's relative, you like or you hate, i have no right to comment. Another thing that needs to be considered, i'm from Turkey. Finally, i'm not racist.<br/><br/>Why i write this comment even if i say liking/disliking a movie is relative ? Because of high-rated comments. I can't believe how people voted this movie 8.9 There are lots of historical and scientific inaccuracies, acting is terrible, really terrible and visual effects are worse than acting. I can not even decide what kind of movie is this ? Romance? Drama? Sci-Fi? Action? or anime ? Yes, it is possible, there are lots of bad movies around the world. But this one is over-rated and on the other hand, lots of money has spent on it.<br/><br/>There are some scenes that i was ashamed, like those so-called romance scenes.I decided to quit watching so many times.<br/><br/>They could have made a great documentary without wasting such huge amounts of money."
"abdullahkesgin-296-834167","1","201","312","9 March 2012"," fake kingdom of heaven, lead actor fake aragorn
","17 million dollar budget may be the highest number in Turkish film making industry, but this does NOT make it sufficient or even close to sufficient for a film like Fetih. Acting is less then amateur cause they don't have enough payment to hire real actors. Ships and language do Not suit ottoman era. There are enormous historical mistakes even conflicts. Make you wonder whether the director consulted some or any historians. Sword fighting scenes are unbearable. Ulubatlı Hasan has nothing to do with being an ottoman nor a turk. Director tries to make a replica of Aragorn which he fails desperately. Because even if he did it successfully it would again has no value as Ulubatlı Hasan was an ottoman, and Aragorn a fiction hero. His way of fighting does NOT resemble Turkish techniques, he is just moving like a disgustingly cheap samurai with cheaper aragorn hair and beard cut. This director has no clue about the character even about the character's outfit. He could have at least looked into any history book and get a clue. <br/><br/>The worst scene was the illegal sex scene which has no way to happen in Hasan's life.<br/><br/>Visual effects are worse then that are in power rangers, especially the scene where the ship sinks. İt was SO bad that it was the scene i left the theatre. And ships in this movie are not the ships Sultan Mehmet had transported through land which was considered ""impossible"" at the time. This transportation of battle ships across the landscape İS one of the hardest decisions made by a leader if not the only one, in the history of mankind. And the effect of this decision on the people or on the historians of that time is totally ignored in this movie. Sultan Mehmet the Conquerer, the wise, the loyal, who has great piety is just an arrogant kid in this movie. The charismatic scholar of Islam, great hodja Akşemseddin (his name means ""the sun of religion"") is again totally ignored.<br/><br/>The scene where two kings meet on horse backs DİD NOT happen in the siege, it's from Ridley Scott's K.O.H. Enough writing about this film, it doesn't worth to write about. Director has just edited scenes from foreign films, so he is not a real director, he is a fake editor. İ gave it 1 out of 10 because there's no scoring system below zero in İMDB."
"aleladebirali","3","164","253","18 September 2012"," Exaggeration and Sublimation of Ottoman History
","Almost everything in the movie, is very blown up: Costumes, characters, places... Not everything fits to what really happened back then, nor does it have to. But that doesn't mean that the director has the right to irritatingly twist history in favor of conservatives in Turkey.<br/><br/>He falsely presents Emperor Mehmet II as a superhero that makes almost no mistakes, and as a monogamous person. Of course, the facts that he was a wine drinker, a lover of ancient Greek and Roman arts, that he let the city to be sacked for two days, he hanged one of his viziers, and killed all his brothers and made a law that allows and suggests his successors to kill their brothers ""for continuation of the state"", were all ignored! And we see ""the enemies"" always speak with a sneaky voice which shows that they're the coward and evil guys. Byzantine Emperor has a weird ""digital palace"" that has numberless columns, and lives in corruption. War scenes and military costumes are so unrealistic, as well... The list goes on.<br/><br/>Shortly, what I saw was a religious, peasant point of view and a foolish sublimation of Ottoman history. That's what happens with big budget and very limited mentality."
"sithocan","3","118","179","13 September 2012"," Historically inaccurate, but more importantly bad as a movie
","I will not go into how the movie is historically accurate (it's simply inaccurate), how it favors Turks and hides their devils (though one should think how could balkan nations manage to preserve their religion, language and culture under Ottoman ruling for 2-4 centuries while all British and French colonies lost all in a century before commenting on this topic), how Vatican was portraited as selfish (I haven't heard anything about their conditioned support until this movie).<br/><br/>My main disappointment is the movie itself. Though its budget is quite high for any Turkish movie, it's not on par with Hollywood productions. So, I didn't expect Hollywood quality special effects and I'm not disappointed in this regard. They are cheap, though not cheapest, compared to Hollywood. But I think that's all can be done within its budget. So it doesn't bother me.<br/><br/>My concerns are about things that has nothing to do with the budget. I don't know if it's due to script or directing but storytelling is awful. The story jumps from here to there and back so suddenly. It's like watching sketches joined as a movie. Also I don't understand why Arabic people talk in Arabic but Byzantians and Italians talk in Turkish.<br/><br/>And there is no character development. Why Giovanni Giustiniani is bad? He behaved kindly to Era. We haven't seen him acting badly to his men. And bam, he became evil. When I think objectively, I see a thoughtful man who is doing his job very good (just how a respected commander should be). So they should fight as respectful rivals at the end. If the director wanted us to hate him, then he should have portraited him as an evil. And why Era developed a sudden feeling of revenge? As an adopted Muslim, she spent all her life with Christians (except her childhood) and she hasn't shown any dislike to the community she's been in. She's just like an happy Christian. Also, the foreseen one, Mehmet The Conqueror is portraited as a man obsessed with taking Istanbul. He should have been a wise and intelligent commander. But when everything goes bad, he begins to shout and insult his men. This is the behaviour we see from cruel kings in Hollywood productions. It's not the behaviour the hero should have. He should not lose his temper, he should have been patient (Look at Saladdin in Kingdom of Heaven while his attacks become ineffective). And his motive should not simply be based on Hz. Mohammed's word. There should be other reasons (for example ongoing threat to Ottomans, etc) for the need to take Istanbul and the prophet's word should have been shown just before the end credits.<br/><br/>There are many illogical things (scriptwise). One of them is: Ottoman tunnel diggers has been digging tunnels for 2 days and they are still outside the citywalls. But when Byzantines become aware of them, they also dig tunnels but they reach them (which is outside the city walls) in almost ten minutes? Byzantine soldiers digging faster than digging specialists?<br/><br/>For cinematography, I won't say anything. It's just not good.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a miss. It has the potential but not because of limited budget but bad script and directing, the movie wasted his chance.<br/><br/>PS: Some will say ""Do not overcriticize your country's work"". But as I said, I have nothing to say against technical aspects, it's one of the best when considered within its budget, but scripting and directing has nothing to do with budget and these are the ones that make this movie bad. Nothing else."
"dorimi","1","189","310","22 August 2012"," Waste of time
","As someone said before ""I am sorry but 12 year old kids and illiterate people may find this movie great but in reality this actually had a great potential but is totally failed the great opportunity..."" Im great fan of history and i was waiting for opportunity to watch this perspectively awesome movie, but ... I've just wasted 2h30m of my time.<br/><br/>1. Those two Ottoman spies - really? I think director watched too much of James Bond series. They just like two superheroes who could defeat whole army. Really stupid move. 2. Much more fantasy then history. Nothing to add. 3. Absolutely Turkish -not for foreigners eyes. I guess director find out who were those lost people of Atlantis - definitely Ottoman people. 4. Why Romans (Byzantines) shown as inbred imbeciles? Sad move by director."
"steven-langer","2","59","95","17 September 2012"," A proof that not every rating on IMDb is reasonable or understandable.
","Well, after Ridley Scott's ""Kingdom of Heaven"", which was not historically accurate either, the Turks even exceed my expectations on history-falsifying. <br/><br/>Short insight about KoH. If the crusaders really killed every Muslim in Jerusalem when they reconquered - not invaded - it, why did they leave the mosque intact? Why did they allow Muslims to live there afterwards? <br/><br/>Further Saladin did not grant every Christian save contact to Christian land. Only those, who could pay for it. The rest was enslaved as it is usually done with dhimmis and kaffir. He was no benevolent soul, either.<br/><br/>Now about this movie here, it's even more amusing. In what lies the bravery of besieging a city with 130,000 Ottoman fighters....against only 7,000 Christian city guards and knights?<br/><br/>It is also very interesting that this movie does not show, what the Ottomans did to Christian settlements and villages, which they encountered on their way to Constantinople. Exaclty the same they did with those settlements in Hungary, Austria, Romania, etc...I guess. Which is plundering, enslaving of women and children, while beheading the male inhabitants. But this is what does not fit into the concept of Islam, where the Muslim is always free of guilt.<br/><br/>I guess that the majority of those who rated this movie are Turks, because the West is not really interested in this movie. And if more western people, who have an idea of what really happened back in these days would vote, this rating would immediately fall. <br/><br/>The choreography and acting is nothing to write home about, but still better than in most Turkish productions so far. This and the nice animated and filmed landscapes and OK scenery prevented me from rating this movie with 1.<br/><br/>A final word to both, Ridley Scott and especially Farun Aksoy. (Self-)Critizism and Reflection is nothing, which should only lie on one side, in this case western society. Especially the Turks could use a lot of it."
"BeholdTheRiversofBlood","4","32","50","16 September 2012"," History without depth - filmwork without honesty, but pretty nevertheless
","The movie is supposed to tell the story of how Mehmet II conquered Constantinople. So far so good, it could be a good story, given the right conditions.<br/><br/>However, it ends up being a whole lot of bad. Except for most parts of the visual aspects of the movie, which look great to the human eye.<br/><br/>Now, from the start we are introduced to Mehmet and how it's his destiny to conquer Constantinople. Good, but why is he portrayed as a man with no flaws? Clearly, he was a great and inspiring man when he lived, but he was just as human as all others of the species who have lived. Bring some depth to the characters when writing your script, please. I shed a tear when I saw the death scene with his father almost at the start of the movie, but no other psychological elements where ever expanded upon.<br/><br/>The worst part of the movie is not the portrayal of the conquest itself, no, it's the build-up to that. There's just too many inaccuracies. Sure, if you watch this movie purely from a pro-Turkish point of view, those ""details"" might not matter, but no matter how you put it you are being deceitful to your viewers about the other ""sides"".<br/><br/>1) There exists two languages in this movie: Turkish and Arabic.<br/><br/>2) There exists a standardized uniform for European Crusaders (11th century mail tabards), Latin Auxiliaries (Clunky over-sized immobilizing chainmail or cloth-like leather) Byzantine Soldiers (Grey scale armour), and the Turkish army (Red vests with all with the same fluted Ottoman helmet). Of course, these things are historically based and fit in some kind of time period, but variation is important too. To add to this, the two lieutenants of the movie are again wearing some sort of fantasy leather armour no one with money at the time would have worn. Where's the plate armour for the Genoese? 3) There exists three ways of melee-combat: 1: Slowly move around and wait to die (All others but the Turks). 2: Thrust and slash hard with your weapon to kill your opponent or die trying (the Turks). 3: One-hit kill people with agile and fast movement (supporting characters/heroes).<br/><br/>4): Apparently, no sack had ever happened in 1204 and Constantinople still stood as the towering beacon of Antiquity and Medievality combined, looking better than ever imagined. I know this is computer graphics, but again this is dishonesty.<br/><br/>5): The Greeks (who thought it wise to speak Turkish, of course) are naive gluttons who think they can puppeteer with the superpower of their time. In fact, at this point, they were nothing more than a vassal state who where sitting and hoping for a rescue or having already given up hope (most people having already emigrated to start the renaissance). This political reality could of course be less melodramatic to portray, but again, why not give the characters some depths? This brings me to my next point.<br/><br/>6) Constantine XI is portrayed as a raving madman who is spoiled and possesses no diplomatic skills whatsoever. It's bad enough that his beard is so clearly fake and that he speaks in Turkish and seems oblivious to the events around him: He also has to be the ""evil"" guy who hates the Turks. Kudos to whoever did the costume design, but his character is nothing more than a caricature, and while that could have it's place in a comedy, it shouldn't have any place in a serious historical war movie. I won't go into detail with his courtiers as they are even bigger stereotypes and imbeciles than he is betrayed to be, but with this kind of black/white relationship it's clear just how biased this film is.<br/><br/>7) No conqueror is all kind and loving. Mehmet's outward appearance holds only the authority the script writers gave him, there's nothing natural about it. Kingdom of Heaven had a similar setup, but there was at least a few character developments between Saladin and de Ibelin. As said here this is just the case of: <br/><br/>All-loving energetic smiling conqueror who loves women and children <br/><br/>vs.<br/><br/>Megalomaniac miniature-Emperor with a Napoleon-complex who holds the world record in cynicism and failed attempts of political spin<br/><br/>Where is the Devşirme recruitment system and the Kapikulu? Where is the Jizya tax? Of course these things never happened, as we all know.<br/><br/>8) Where is the awesome Ottoman military music? Also, the lack of any Greek in this movie prevents it from having any Byzantine Chant.<br/><br/>9) The Women in this movie act just as terribly as the men (or as the script decreed, quite possibly). Also, thumbs down for no real Harem of course :-).<br/><br/>My recommendation: <br/><br/>Watch Tirante El Blanco if you want more on the demise of the defunct Byzantine Empire. As for a movie finally worthy of the great statesman Mehmet II, I guess we'll all just have to wait.<br/><br/>As for the movie: 4/10 for visual effects, the construction of Rumelihisarı, the awesome Ottoman turbans the first charge and the entrance to the city where Mehmet is truthful to the quasi-historical picture. The rest is bad."
"gok-302-598399","7","62","107","26 February 2012"," Had great potential but failed
","This movie arguably has the best cinematic concept and special effects in Turkish cinema. Because Turkish cinema has no experience in historical or action movies, it would be wrong to expect a Hollywood quality production. Still it has better combat scenes than I expected. <br/><br/>While these properties can be overlooked, I am very disappointed how the movie turned out. I will be listing these in the order of importance:<br/><br/>1.The movie doesn't reflect or promote the Ottoman Empire and culture the way it should. If I watched this movie in another language I would have thought this is just another European kingdom. Only %10 percent of the movie has Ottoman Culture (praying, war camps, janissaries)<br/><br/>2.Music.. Seriously it couldn't be worse.. There are dozens of awesome Ottoman marches. ""How come they are not included?"" is not enough, ""HOW DARE THEY NOT INCLUDE THESE MARCHES???""<br/><br/>3.The scenario is really bad. Scenario is what people look at this type of movies and the execution of the events is just facepalm level bad. Even though I know the whole story I had a hard time understanding, where we are, what time is it, who are these people, what are these people doing here? They payed to much attention to the cannon but no attention to the ships being pulled to Haliç, which was clearly the main reason the siege succeeded. They should have at least made a 1 minute scene where Mehmed was offering this brilliant idea. The movie is probably really confusing to people who have no knowledge about the history of this battle. This battle changed the era of world and we should have been given more info about why Istanbul is so important why Mehmed wants it so bad. In the movie it just seems like a purposeless childish desire.<br/><br/>4.Giovanni vs Hasan. The fighting scenes are great yeah but why do they look like twins? Why do they look like some random bandits wandering around the battlefield? They are the commanders and best warriors in the battlefield! Surely they should wear an armor and a uniform instead of running around in combat with bare arms like Hercules. Mehmed should have been the main hero in the story not Hasan..<br/><br/>5.The Mehmed we should see in the movie is around 17-22 age. However the actor Devrim Evin is 30 years old and looks 35! They should have picked a charismatic and younger actor. Btw he is the Sultan he should have the best outfit in the empire but even his viziers have better outfits.<br/><br/>6.Troops are not promoted properly. Janissaries? They are not shown as much as they should. And where are their guns? Hand-held rifles probably haven't been invented yet but I am pretty sure they had rifles that had to be set to ground before firing. <br/><br/>7.Where is Deliler(Crazy) Unit? They are known for being the first troops in battle and using Ottoman slapping technique that can knock out enemy knights and horses in armor, when the enemy sees Deliler in front lines they feel depressed cause those dudes kill people by only slapping! How can this awesome stuff not be included in a movie?<br/><br/>8.The leader of 2 sides just don't meet and chat in the middle of the battlefield before war starts. They will be assassinated at first sight.<br/><br/>Yeah they did the battle effects and action parts but they messed up all the other parts big time! How can you have a budget this size and fail this much? The stuff I listed aren't that hard to include in a movie. They just had to think of it instead of making useless action scenes. We aren't here to watch the 1v1 battle of heroes or awesome arrow shower etc.. We are here for the history, for the logic, for the heroic and brilliant moments which weren't even thought of by the producers..<br/><br/>I am sorry but 12 year old kids and illiterate people may find this movie great but in reality this actually had a great potential but is totally failed the great opportunity..<br/><br/>In my opinion the TV series about Sultan Suleyman, The Magnificent Century is better in all the aspects except action and special effects. Yeah it has some lame love scenes but the overall environment is simply better."
"vakalo","5","92","168","23 August 2012"," Good film but with big historic mistakes
","It is absolutely clear that the conquest of Constantinople was a great victory for the Ottamans who finished what the crusaders started in 1204. BUT. We must respect history and the director of the film did non respect history at all. During the siege, Constantinople had nothing to do with the glorious city of the past. Only 40.000 of once 1.000.000 people lived inside the walls which were defended only by 7.000 soldiers. 2.000 of them were foreigners. The Ottomans had an army of about minimum 100.000 soldiers. Some say that the army had 200.000 or more soldiers. The Byzantine empire was found at that time at the lowest level of her past glory and in the absolute decline. It is know to everybody who knows only a few things about history that the Ottomans entered the city though an unguarded small gate known as Kerkoporta which has been left open by mistake. This gives a picture of history as it really happened and nobody can argue about that.Because it is history! The Byzantine empire had come to an end as it happens in all the empires in history. There is no place here to talk about more historic facts. I understand that the film maker wanted to give to Mohamed the part of the glory that he deserves. But the end of the film it is absolutely ridiculous and was made only for propaganda reasons. People who study history knows very well what happened at that days when a city was conquered. Massacres. That happened in Constantinople as well. The director the only thing that he does not tell us is that Mohamed gave candies to children! The conquest is without doubt a great achievement of the Ottomans. It helped them built their empire. The dominated east for about 500 years. But without of course knowing Mohamed gave west a great gift as after the fall of the city all the great men escaped to the west and they helped Renaissance to begin. The film is not bad at all and in my opinion is by far better than Hollywood films of that kind. The Turks are making a great effort to raise their country and are to be praised for this.Since i visited Constantinople a few times i can say that progress is visible in Turkey. Hope that in the future they will make again films like this and even better. But please respect history. History can not change because some people want to do propaganda thank you"
"andy-akdeniz","Null","9","12","26 May 2015"," characters all wrong
","I started watching this movie last night and only watched the first hour. As far as I've seen the actors do not fit the historical characters mostly. The main character ""Fatih Sultan Mehmet"" gives a feeling of a weak man determined to destroy the Byzantium empire. He is reflected as a sick minded, obsessive person with no human feelings. If you can recall the Turkish TV series ""Sultan Murad the 4th"" with Cihan Unal starring as the sultan , compared to him , Sultan Mehmed character is a weakling. I think that is an insult to the actual person who is considered as one of the most heroic sultans in the Ottoman lineage. Most of the other characters also seem like they can't reflect the persona of a 15th century historical figure. They play their parts as if they are in a contemporary movie. It seems to me that the producers didn't employ serious historical consultants in the making, but they just made up stuff as they wished. If you compare the characters in this movie to a real good historical movie such as ""mission"" with Robert de Niro, you can see what I mean.<br/><br/>I think the reason behind the bad casting is in the politics in Turkey. The financiers were probably from one conservative group, the production crew an the cast were from modernists, and as a result, they didn't cast some of the actors in Turkey who would fit to some of the roles perfectly because they were affiliated with other groups. It's a pity that political wars in Turkey weakens everything from economy to film industry.<br/><br/>Other than these, this movie deserves praise for some good action scenes, computer generated graphics and visual effects, costumes, and set designs."

Is this what what made this film international?<br/><br/>Update (after watching the last 20 minutes of the movie).<br/><br/>The survived civilians were very happy to meet their conqueror Mehmed II in the city. They smile and admire the great Sultan. To leverage the effect, the last minute of the film shows a beautiful little girl, playing with his fake beard in a grotesque North Korea style. This scene is supposed to make your eyes wet.<br/><br/>The Byzantine Emperor died while fighting among the soldiers, but the film tells nothing about the circumstances of his death. However, it tells that the Sultan generously allows to bury the Emperor according to local traditions. Well, this is almost true, ~93% truth. Because only the body was buried. The head of the Emperor was placed separately, in a public place, probably the local hippodrome."

Most of the movie was filmed against a chroma-key background but without great results, the master shots are OK but the layering was bad. The fighting (green) scenes are simply boring and even the use of gore didn't save them. Of course in the film only the Roman soldiers are dying while the Ottomans are undefeated ninjas.

Of course we need to criticize, but the critics should be as supportive as possible in order not to discourage people.

The film focused on the gore of war with very cheap looking fight scenes, that were intended to draw in a male audience. A cheesy forced love story was inserted in to the mix to draw in a female audience. A big problem with the fight scenes was that the two main rivals looked like clones and were always scantily clad and oiled up to reveal their six pack abs, hence it was tough to tell them apart.

","In my opinion this movie is not good to watching and totally different than any part of real ottoman history. there are a lot of worst parts that don't show reality. some of characters had certainly opposite style than real people. for example Sultan Mehmet's master Ak Semseddin was not a fat person and he was beardless and he only exist at the and of the movie. Almost half of the movie is about Ulubatli's love with Era. Muslim people never participate in illegal love and they never make illegal baby. it would be better to change movie's name with ""Ulubatli's Love with Era"" !! it s not good movie in digital effect. normally this movie's story is one of most reach and effective story but director and writer of this movie are not successful on it. i watched this movie with my nephews and cousins. We were 7 people and only my little nephew like it. so I don't suggest you to watch and waste your money and time."

","This is the best movie in Turkey ever made. Everybody should watch and see how Turkey cinemas developed. For war movies such this, the movies' budget looks ridiculous. So it is good work. While you're watching it, you do not get bored even a minute. The characters are awesome, especially Sultan Mehemd, Hasan and Giustiniani. The Musics are also fantastic. Benjamin Wallfisch has a sign on this amazing musics as well. In short, you just see it and then decide. Faith Aksoy, the director, made bad movies in past like Recep İvedik but his new movie is very different and great. You should see this great movie. It shows Ottoman Historiy and Tradition incredibly. It is really great. I did not watch a movie like Fetih 1453 in Turkey's cinema history. Faith Sultan Mehmed is great sultan in Ottoman History. He is a giant. I will continue in Turkish. Noo :( I tried but not permission. Anyway where were we? I hope this movie will come the U.S.A and Europe. The people who live in these countries have a chance to see this amazing movie. If you have a little information about the history of Ottoman, you love it so much."
"tevhidyildiz","4","30","70","18 February 2012"," It's a start
","Its $17,000,000 budget set a record in the history of Turkish cinema, and that money has gone into a scenario (Ottoman Empire) which was pretty much an untouched subject in Turkish cinema until today. I sincerely respect and congratulate Faruk Aksoy for undertaking such an important task.<br/><br/>But there are problems, big ones. Although $17M is a record-setting budget, it is just too small for a movie of this scale. They tried to do too much with too little and the result is inevitably a mediocre movie at best (and i say that with a bias). Nearly in every scene they tried to use digital sets, set extensions and digital environments which they failed miserably. After a while you get used to seeing green and/or blue outlines in every character and ignore the obviously computer-generated environment. Although some scenes looked okay (they did a good job with crowd animations, i'll give them that), visually this movie just doesn't cut it.<br/><br/>Scenario-wise it could be enjoyable if you can skip the love story and cut the screening time about 45mins. The horrible, horrible acting did not help either. Other than Devrim Evin (Sultan Mehmed II) and Recep Aktug (Constantine XI) who gave mediocre performances, most actors in the movie were amateurs.<br/><br/>All that being said, The Ottoman Empire deserves to be made into movies and hopefully good ones from now on. So i really hope Faruk Aksoy will make at least some money out of this movie, not because the movie itself deserves it but the path he opened could stay open."

","First of all, you must bare in mind that this is the Turkish point of view, do not expect for history accuracy. Historically, this is quite a disaster (to name a few things ""MISPLACED"": The Byzantine Empire was, in the 15th century, at it's lowest point, with lots of debts, it had almost nothing to do with the happy and celebrating empire that you can see in the movie. Then again, the Ottomans did plunder Constantinople for 3 days after the conquest!! So the final scene it's a big lie.)<br/><br/>For the average viewer it is more important the artistic value of the film, for ""Fetih 1453"" it's not a History/Documentary/Biography one. So, how good is it? Well, it's an average movie, with good action scenes, nice visual effects (exaggerated from time to time), a good enough script (neither excellent nor dumb) BUT, most of all, it's a strong recommendation for the fans of action movies with a distinctive fragrance of history. ""Braveheart"" and ""Gladiator"" are 2 of the masterpieces in the branch.<br/><br/>""Fetih 1453"" has some good acting, some bad acting, some good directing (but he took an overwhelming task here with this subject - he managed enough well I could say but no cinematic breakthrough at all). So, sincerely, I would have ranked it 6 (that would be a mark that I call ""only for the fans of the genre"", but the movie has one ACE - the Picture, ladies and gentlemen! A beautiful job done here. Artistic indeed! <br/><br/>At the end, you get no essential idea about life, feelings and beliefs - as what I consider to be a purpose of all arts - but an average nice to see action movie."

Pathetic Turkish propaganda!<br/><br/>Costumes, buildings, weapons, fashion... everything is messed up and wrong. Palace of the Byzantine emperor looks more like an antique Roman or Hellenic villa than a late medieval palace. There are even naked, classic Greek sculptures in the palace. Frescoes painted on the walls are also totally wrong. <br/><br/>There is a scene of a boar hunting...

The costumes were very impressive because movie team gave us the moment of 15th century. The Places were awesome they have given the moment and takes us those times.<br/><br/>On the other hand, There were some mistakes about real history: 1) Ulubatlı was -in my opinion- in the main character of the movie but it was Faith's story and he should be in the main scene.<br/><br/>2) Ulubatlı should be an ordinary soldier but he is close with era and helping artillery making, but the real mistake was he is like a friend of Faith.<br/><br/>3) Faith was a religious man and he was usually with his hodja I mean Akshemseddin. But Akshemseddin is entering into the movie last half hour.<br/><br/>4)There are a lot of sources about faith I think they should had been used.<br/><br/>Finially, It was the first epic war movie.

I wish we as Turkish cinema had some decent screenwriters..<br/><br/>Fetih has got a terrible scenario. Some say doesn't reflect history correctly (Ulubatli and many other parts of history is mainly legends by the way) but my problem is not that, my problem is, scenario is written in a way as if this is not a cinema movie but some sort of Discovery Channel history flick, it's telling everything written in school books of history (correct or not) step by step. This is not cinema, this is not story telling, this is not watchable.<br/><br/>Fetih unfortunately wasted money, hopes and time of the audience in my opinion. But for sure, some people who has never been to cinema (and not intention if it's not for Fetih) goes to cinema for these kind of movies. We saw the same thing happening in movies like Kurtlar Vadisi, Allahın Sevgili Kulu, Ny'ta Beş Minare etc. I think this is a gain for Turkish people as they meet the miraculous silver screen, but also boosts terrible movies.<br/><br/>And last but not least, if this is place for wannabe critic's arena, why should we not write our opinions about terrible movies? Isn't is just we deceive ourselves if we write ""hey perfect movie, come and watch"", I don't think rest of the world gives a s.hit about Fetih (name of the movie-Conquest) or Faith(name of the sultan)?

"sakrithart-3","5","17","40","19 February 2012"," First attempt by Turkish Cinema to produce a blockbuster
","OK, I must admit I did not have high expectations going into this movie since in general Turkish Cinema has been made cheaply with little regard to authenticity. My expectations were not totally unfounded. We are looking at a historical movie with very little congruence with factual history. ***Spoiler*** Not sure if Mohammad mentioned that Constantinopolis will be conquered some day by a ""Blessed One"". *** Why make that the opening scene, something that happened 800 or so years before the actual event. Throughout the movie seeing these religious tones make it look more like a Islamic Propaganda...Soldiers praying in the battlefield by thousands at the same time !...Yeah right ! I have to admit the director tried hard to make the battle scenes impressive albeit a bit too long and not realistic. On the acting side the actors were very amateurish, especially the one who played the Emperor Constantine. The ""required"" love story a la ""Troy"" did not look very convincing and was very badly placed. Byzantine folks speaking perfect modern Turkish really makes the whole movie looks amateurish. They could at least have them speak Greek or something with subtitles ! Most special effects looked very amateurish and obvious. Costumes were good but I question the authenticity. The fight between the hero and his nemesis just took too long and looked more like a training fight. There are other historical facts about the ""Siege"" that was just glossed over such as the chain across the Golden Horn and the moving of ships across land to reach the unprotected side of the city. In history books this is mentioned as the most important decision by Mehmet II that changed the outcome of the war. Special effects showing the ships being moved across land looked very fake. Why didn't they show those ships pounding the other side of the Constantinople which resulted in the falling of the city? I am not even going into the plot holes as there are always deviations from actual events and omissions in historical movies. As a conclusion it was a good attempt by Turkish Cinema to be in the Hollywood League. They should however try to make a film without being influenced by the political climate of the country. Who knows, it is very likely the government helped the production even though it's not mentioned in the rolling credits...."

"iremkosoglu","7","29","78","18 February 2012"," Bad Scenario - Excellent Production
","I can accept this movie has the strongest and newest production so far in Turkey, besides 'conquest' wouldn't be better theme if worldwide attention is desired by Turkish history. Before I watch the movie I was filled with an expectation of heroic, enthusiastic fiction.However I frustrated. I laughed a lot; during the movie. Cause the dialogues were just like what I've read at high school history books. I would expect new information, deeper and more creative dialogues and language. I don't have a word to say to the movie technically. Moreover, I didn't like Mehmet as his outer view. The original Mehmet was supposed to be uglier and tough; but he had a kind of baby face, and I think he had a plastic surgery on his nose. These are important details if you are shooting an history movie and want it to be talked for years, I guess. During the movie I like the scene of Mehmet and his son Bayezid, but I still think this scene would be projected more drastic and touching to awake the audience. In the beginning of the movie there were so many cuts to give every detail; they would be given in longer scenes, cause they just made me feel sick. I can understand that there must be a love theme in a movie as long as being good. But in 'Conquest' it was averaged (even bad). Throughout the movie I waited to hear a military band march. It would really make the audience's hair stood on end. Finally I watched a good old-time Byzantium and Ottoman movie (1970's). The Conquest of Istanbul must have been made with a much more better scenario."

"umutayk","8","7","14","6 October 2012"," Courageous
","Although the film was in theaters months ago, i watched it yesterday. I read nearly all the reviews about it and saw some comments that the words of Hz Muhammed were evaluated as ""prophecy"" by a lot of users in fact the words ""what a good commander who conquers Istanbul"" are told to Ebu-Eyyub El Ensari who sieges the city in 668 A.D. when they met at Ebu-Eyyub El Ensari's house. That is not a prophecy that may be a praise or a wish.<br/><br/>Here are some historical notes<br/><br/>The siege took 52 days. The Ottoman side was over 50.000 soldiers, the Byzantine was near 30.000 ( The number of Ottoman soldiers varies from 50.000 to even 300.000 according to historians but for the Byzantine army the interval is narrow 10.000 to 30.000 ) The milestone of the siege was to roll the ships on the planks from the Bosporus to Golden Horn (but it was dealt less in the film than it must have been.) Ulubatlı Hasan is a heroic character, no one knows if it was him who raised the flag on the walls. The name was first spelled on a historical literature of Melissinos. The cannon named Sahi can be seen in Fort Nelson Museum, Portsmouth, England.<br/><br/>And the film, to me it is a precursor to high budget epic Turkish movies. High income in Turkey and some other theaters across the world (esp the cities has Turkish population) must encourage all Turkish producers because the film sector and sub-sectors are not well developed in Turkey, they do not have a choice to fail in a film with a high budget like that.<br/><br/>The director and the scenarists must be influenced by the film Troy; a hero and his private life, a girl and war but we all have high expectations and so a little bit disillusion if we consider it with Hollywood movies. The acting and the scenario; one may save the other but both of them are average. Scenario sometimes hesitates about what to focus on, an epic hero, a love story, Soultan Faith Mehmet himself, the war? If it is not a documentary movie, there must be a focus, like the life of Achillies in Troy. Visual effects can sometimes bother you. Ottoman war chant ""Mehter March"" is missing. Language is disappointing, Ottoman language must be used instead of some modern Turkish language (Ottoman language is the Turkish language that is inspired of Arabian and Persian language in the time of Ottoman's)<br/><br/>On the other hand, costumes are perfect, fight scenes are perfect I gave 8 to not acting or the scenario but to have the courage to try a high budget film, to show the historical meaning of the city i live in.<br/><br/>I think it is not a propaganda of Islam. In fact Ottoman Empire was the one and the only empire that was a combination of such different cultures, races and religions, is there any chance to rule on 3 different continents for about 800 years?<br/><br/>To me 6th of October, the liberation day of Istanbul has at least the meaning of 29th of May, now that is called propaganda. <br/><br/>There are a lot of wars in our history and we are looking forward to watching the films about them."

But I don't see ( and I'm sure you won't see if you watch it yourself ) too much difference compared to the ones produced over USD 100M. That means this is really a very good, effective and intelligent production, thanks to the production team. It is almost impossible to make a historic film with a totally objective view, depending who's eye you see through, but some movies almost succeed to do it ( or at least make you believe it tells the truth ). This one's near to that, and I hope everyone will be satisfied with the result. Faith Sultan Mehmet, the Conquerer was one of the youngest and well educated sultans of the Ottoman State, a brave one as well as an intelligent and ambitious sultan that made the impossible, possible. The movie takes it from the very beginning and ends with the conquer. Yet it also tells the true structure of the Ottoman Empire, giving freedom of religion & belief to all people it covers under its wings. He is the sultan who even gave his consent for an Italian painter to make his own portrait which seems pretty surprising considering the rules of Islam. The Ottoman Empire is not a Turkish Empire, but an Empire that embraced all nations & blood inside its borders. You can say it was the USA of their era. The movie doesn't reflect that as it must, but you know it is a Turkish movie. The content of the film is what all you expect from a historic movie, majestic & violent war scenes as well as plots & some love. But the transitions are just right and the tempo never makes you loose your concentration. As a result, this is a beautiful movie which will both entertain & inform you on an advanced level.

","A lot of reviewers have mentioned that this movie is historically inaccurate and that is correct. However, for the entertainment of the viewers this is acceptable. Primary intention of a movie with the exception of documentary's is not to inform viewers of the facts but entertain. Movies such as Braveheart and Gladiator are both historically inaccurate but are both one of the greatest films to date. <br/><br/>In my opinion this is an entertaining movie but it is flawed. The story moves along extremely slowly. There are unnecessary monologues and scenes that do not affect the story which makes the movie longer than necessary. <br/><br/>Directing of the movie is exceptional in some scenes but very dull in others; lacks consistency. <br/><br/>In terms of acting performances are really good. Devrim Evin, the actor who brings to life Sultan Mehmet II does a really good job to show the confidence and determination of the character. <br/><br/>The reason I believe this will revolutionise Turkish cinema is mainly because there has not been a drama that has excelled as much as Fetih 1453. The fact that it has reached an international scale is a huge step forward for Turkish cinema. This is not an all time great but is certainly worth watching."

","It is far beyond the current Turkish movie standards and encourages further productions. The staff seems do their best. I congratulate the director, players and all other teams.<br/><br/>It is unfair to compare it with Hollywood history-war-action productions. Hollywood is a gigantic movie industry, dominant in the world and does not know any rival. But the topic, conquering the Istanbul, is one of the most important historical, cultural, religious and political event in the Turkish and world history. Consequently the expectations are very high and the movie is unable to meet those who anticipate to satisfy their national and religious feelings.<br/><br/>The movie may arise ordinary Turks', still have average adherence towards their soil, roots and ancestors, national and religious emotions. They may even give a cry in some scenes. I myself observed it in theater.<br/><br/>Certainly for the role of Sultan Mehmed Han, the director must have picked up someone else. Devrim Evin can't reflect the Great Conquerer's magnificence and his acting is poor. Ibrahim Celikkol is better than him both in shape and acting.<br/><br/>I think they cannot give up using women the way modern west mentality use it. Their approach on this matter is a little trendy. But, I give them right because they have to consider current audience demand for sake of commercial profit. The movie which deprived of love, attractive women and love scene has no much chance in box-office, especially in Turkey. Even so, I cannot help myself wishing their attachment to historical realities as Cary Fukunaga did in his Jane Eyre.<br/><br/>One of the absurd scene that draw my attention was Ulubatli Hasan's suppress rebellion attempt. He says to some of rebels: ""Dogs! You have been eating our Sultan's bread"" and other was in the Ak Shemseddin's advise. He says to the Mehmed II: ""Strong winds blow in highs"". These two scene were very funny. There is so much to review but i don't have too much time to write.<br/><br/>Finally, as a Turkish production, the movie is fine. I think it is one of the initials which hearten its predecessor. I believe Turkish movie industry will succeed more quality productions in a few decades. Turks have just begun which Hollywood and others did many years ago."

","I was incredibly eager to see the film, but finding an official release date for the DVD or a place where I could buy it in Egypt seemed impossible. Alas, I managed to get a copy.<br/><br/>Let's preface this by saying I love Turkish culture. A picture of Abdul Hamid II hangs on my wall. I even enjoy the 70s and 80s exploitation flicks, and definitely 70s Anatolian rock. Fetih is a bittersweet affair for me. On one hand it represents the country's ascent over the past decade; on the other it unfortunately falls victim to imitating a western style medieval epic -- a played out genre that ordinarily bores me to no end.<br/><br/>The introduction of an obligatory love triangle between a good and evil suitor signaled that some disappointment was in store early on. The five-second closing shot was like dumping a bottle of ketchup onto an overcooked steak: it took an already mediocre meal and made it even less appetizing. <br/><br/>I don't really care for CGI in general, but each time the director used it there was no mistaking it. That might be forgivable in a fantasy film, but not a historical one. <br/><br/>Some of you may claim that historical inaccuracies for the sake of entertainment are just the nature of the medium; the problem is this that these men were so pivotal in history that spreading a distorted image (even if done graciously) is disrespectful. When twenty-year old viewers become seventy, this film's portrayals will be stuck in many of their minds -- accurate or not.<br/><br/>This will not be the last Turkish blockbuster. It needs critiqued honestly to push Turkish cinema forward, though. I wanted to give this a 10/10, but in the end it's so dumbed down that it's merely a slightly above average movie. There's some great Turkish films out there: Jan Jan and Propaganda are two I've watched recently -- two pics that are uniquely Turkish; Fetih feels more like a generic American war epic but with Turkish characters. <br/><br/>If Adam Sandler films are 0/10, and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest a 10/10, Fetih is a 6/10. Its importance lies more in what it signifies in relation to Turkey's modern resurgence as a great nation and the Islamic renaissance occurring in places like Egypt, not so much its content."

There was a surprising amount of military-related action, and while there were a few slower moments involving politics and character relationships, overall I was entertained and didn't really find the film boring at all despite the 2 hour 40 minute run time.<br/><br/>I see a lot of criticism on this forum regarding the historical inaccuracies and the possible vote-manipulation but I really can't understand why. The film doesn't market itself as a documentary, it's as historically accurate as 300 or Gladiator. The film stands on it's own if you go into it with an open mind without any expectations other than being entertained. As for the vote-manipulation by Turkish people, I myself am not Turkish, I'm Canadian (english/german ancestry) and in fact don't even know a single Turkish person. I easily rate this film 7/10 based on the quality and entertainment value and have already recommended it to several friends who all enjoyed it as much or more than I have.<br/><br/>Ignore the naysayers!

"the_answer-03","9","15","42","25 February 2012"," Nicely executed film considering it's budget.
","First of all, thanks for making such efforts and producing a film like this. Considering and comparing with some other historical war movies such as Troy, Braveheart etc. this movie has been nicely executed taking into account it's budget. And I barely can understand how some people commented ""I'm ashamed of being Turk, etc.."" Sometimes people get lost by the fame of a few things like there are no famous actors, there is not a 150 mil. budget, this is not a Hollywood production. If people don't support these kind of productions, then unfortunately we will never see 150 mil. budget films either. Please make your critics in a constructive way. However, film was missing a few small details which would make it prettier and higher quality in my opinion such as: - Italians and Greeks should have spoken their native languages with Turkish subtitles. You don't need actors to be able to speak if you don't have such budget but you could have a translator in both languages and write the script that way. - Film is about the conquest, key part of this was walking ships from land and bringing them to the weakest point of Constantine. It should have been given more detailed way how Faith came to this solution and instead of just showing middle part of walking ships, they should have made a speech that Faith brings out his thoughts of doing it. In addition to that, the inscription(tablet) which was written by Hz.Eyup should have been shown with it's glyphs on it. For an ordinary person, it only looked like a stone that they dug out. - Finally, Faith was pretty obvious in his pictures that he had a ""big"" nose, main actor was OK as acting but in my opinion he should have been a more suitable look to the real one. Moreover, in history Faith was also at war fighting with his soldiers but in movie he was only at background watching and thinking.<br/><br/>All in all, once again I hope that we will have more and better films like this one. War scenes were very real, at least production did a good job on that action scenes."

"mardilouise","10","8","20","24 February 2013"," Good entertainment with a splash of history thrown in
","To put my review in perspective: I am not a movie buff - just someone who loves stories, loves big productions and love being wowed. I have never been to Turkey or Greece and don't know any Greeks or Turks personally. I have a vague knowledge of ancient history.<br/><br/>Most of all - I never go to watch a movie with a notebook or history tome by my side. Why would you?! Wouldn't it be BORING if every single time we make a historical film, it has to be 100% accurately depicted - if that's what you want, just go and read a history book, or watch a documentary! (And we would have to find many UGLY actors to play the parts - have you seen what Queen Elizabeth actually looked like??) I loved the movie because it was visually sumptuous. Who cares if the costumes were the correct shade of scarlet according to the history books? The production brought home the splendour and mystique of that ancient time and place. It brought to life the giant, fierce armies of fearless and loyal fighters - on both sides.<br/><br/>It was fascinating to learn about the role of sappers - the heroes under ground! The special effects were for the most part impressive- once or twice they felt slightly obvious - but those moments did not detract from the epic ambiance. Believe me - I have endured much worse from recent big Hollywood productions.<br/><br/>The film brought home the horror of ancient methods of combat that was used in that era. And above all it prompted me to go and read up on Byzantine and Ottoman history and find out more about Sultan Mehmed II. The role that Orban played was extremely well depicted and for most of us, he is an unknown, unsung historical figure which was rightly celebrated in the film.<br/><br/>I didn't find the acting in any way distracting, which in my book means it was fine. It didn't make me quiver with emotional intensity, it was a tad on the dramatic side, but it felt appropriate because of the period setting. Of course, I must add that reading subtitles removes one a little from the dialogue.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend the movie - but not to anyone who is doing their PhD in ""Killing the enjoyment of stories with intellectual pretensions""."

","This movie is about one of the greatest events in history. With incredibly high voting numbers. That is getting attention, but is the movie worth it? <br/><br/>Firstly the movie complete fails to make a substantial underline of the importance and greatness of Constantinople. The animations where nice, but a total FAIL compared with 'Agora' or 'Lord of the rings'. More over the movie doesn't really show the Byzantine struggle en effort to get Latin help and still doesn't get a real help a the end. It would have be nice to see the might Emperor of Byzantium head to Italy en totally impress everybody. However the don't. For the feeling is also doesn't help that Byzantines, Italians en the church all speak Turkish.<br/><br/>The Ottomans (somehow called the Turks in the movie) where depicted in accurate historical setting and outfit. Expect of course the army didn't all wear the same.... Oddly they didn't do the same for the Byzantine army, people and even the buildings....<br/><br/>Regarding the plot, I never heard of a call of Mohammed to conquer Istanbul. So it is an outrage, considering the political contact, that such a claim comes in this movie. Even the siege it self contains major errors which I will not discuss because of danger of a spoiler. However, it is unbelievable that two major commanders of the Turks and the Byzantines look like twin brothers in almost no armor and end up in a matrix like sword fighting. The final ending is also so a-historical. I can sum up more major errors, but that would be a waste of time. It is so bad that we can come to a conclusion: this movie is pure propaganda, centuries late. But even as propaganda it is extremely poor executed and totally unbelievable. 1/10"

The movie had plenty of cool elements and decent acting. My only other complaint besides cheap CG is the soundtrack. It's slightly cliché. They should've incorporated eastern, Turkish motives to the soundtracks to make it more authentic. Of course, certain groups of people will dislike this movie and rate it poorly. The movie somewhat sticks to historical facts, but this can never truly accurate as history is written by winners and it's subjective in its nature."

Sadly you are gravely mistaken. The movie felt like a superposition of one movie over another. there are few scenes in which the Turkish king is preparing his troops and making all the right moves to capture the enemy territory. however, this is not the central theme which surprisingly is the romance between the king's best friend and the daughter of the chief cannon designer. the romantic track is completely unnecessary and bogs down the already sluggish pace of the movie. what further kills the movie is the amateurish editing. some people ar just walking to nowhere throughout the movie which is plain funny. the initial special effects are cartoonish. the battle scenes are good. the turks are shown to be noble which is to be expected considering that this is a Turkish movie. but still the clichéd portrayal of the enemy doesn't sit well with a movie which has such grand intentions. the acting is laughable. the Sultan keeps on glaring at the camera to convey his ""intensity"", i believe. his friend who at least gets to kiss the girl is one step ahead in woodenness. rest of the characters are so easily erasable that it is only 5 minutes since i stopped watching the movie (30 minutes were still left but i had had enough) i have forgotten all of them. this is as pathetic as they come. 1.5 out of 5 for this. these 125 minutes of my life i can never get back and for that i will never forgive Faruk Aksoy, the director of this disaster."

It lacks acting, it lacks realism -it doesn't reflect the true nature of war, either a war from the 15th century or earlier- it lacks simple directing 101, it even lacks basic war scene techniques...<br/><br/>It certainly doesn't lack anachronism or a nationalist propaganda in a very retrospective way though. Since a very few directors who have been able to redeem themselves from the chauvinist nature of the art about Turkey's political and social history, do not show any interest of adapting the country's, -Ottoman era in particular- history into a movie; we're dealing with the likes of Faruk Aksoy whose only contribution to the Turkish cinema is shooting some cheap comedy series called Recep Ivedik and suchlike.<br/><br/>And for our pathetic youth generation whose desperation for their nationalist masturbation to get recognized by the foreign audience and be applauded somehow never seem to come to an end anytime soon; this movie, or a piece of garbage as how you like to call it, is a national treasure. The overall rating of 8.1 from a roughly 35 thousand people proves that, if you like to make money through cinema in Turkey, you just need to have a nationalistic point of view in which you crave for the 'mighty' days of Turks to come back and be terrible at directing. The rest will follow and your movie will be a hit on IMDb thanks to Turkish internet solidarity!<br/><br/>Shameful, really. Fetih 1453 consists of Faruk Aksoy's hopeless attempt to bring the Fall of Constantinople -or the Conquest of Istanbul, as Turks call it- into screen and his, inevitable failure. The topic should indeed needs to be put into screen, but not by an incompetent director.<br/><br/>Final piece of advice for the people from all around the world except Turkey: If you have a soft spot for eastern culture and want to explore Turkish or Arabic history; have a second thought before watching any product on screen who are made by the people of the related country itself. Go for a reading instead."

","Spoiler Alert- Turks take Constantinople.<br/><br/>Beard vs. Beard; many steely glances; the movie-phone guy doing the voice-over narration; and the most over the top heroic death scene this side of Tae Guk Gi, yes this movie has a lot of flaws. But surprise surprise, this movie is rather enjoyable. A good amount of the flaws could be solved by better narration and subtitles, so I decided not to gig it for that. The overly heroic style actually has a kind of charm to it. They swung for the fences on the action, and mostly succeeded, better than a great many over-bloated Hollywood movies. Most of all I liked the characters, Hollywood should recruit some of these actors.<br/><br/>Some of the reviews complain about the Turks being the heroes, which I scratch my head at, seeing that it is a Turkish movie about the defining moment of the Ottoman Empire, of course they are the heroes. Indeed there is a whole lot of whining about historical accuracy, from people who don't seem to realize that this is a movie and judging from their comments, could use a great deal of historical lessons themselves. Other than it being the kindest, most fuzziest sacking of a city in all of history, the rest of the historical account was not that far off. Of course the Ottomans could be extremely cruel, so could the Byzantines, and definitely the Crusaders also. If the movie was merely a history lesson, it could have also shown the Cruaders sacking Constantinople, instead of merely a few villages, and ultimately being responsible for the fall of the Byzantine Empire. But it's a movie, and one that they tried to ratchet up the dramatic tension, at expense to a few facts such as the size of the Byzantine army. As the actual taking of the city was rather difficult I can forgive the dramatic license. You just have to take the movie for what it is. A movie about the dawn of a new and bright civilization, and which for good or bad, glosses over many of the injustices committed by both sides. <br/><br/>Mehmed the Great was the quintessential Ottoman, not somebody to defy, but he was also tolerant and a great believer in law, and established a pattern of affording more religious freedoms to conquered peoples than any other empire in history. Istanbul flourished for centuries after the capture and remains one the greatest cities in the world. It wouldn't hurt if a few more Westerner's learned even a glossed over history of him.<br/><br/>It's not a great movie, but it could have been, and I liked it and if you like historical actioners, you should check it out too."

On the other hand you may feel how hard the conquest is and as a conqueror how hard it is to stand still, being strong and decided to go on. I think Devrim (Mehmet II) is really makes you feel all the hardship as you were him and even when you are watching the film you go through desperate and hopeful times and you can be sure that you won't see arrogance and insolence in the film as some Greek reviewer said through their hatred. I highly recommend it to cinema lovers.<br/><br/>Also I will highlight a sentence that is written about the conquest: There is no doubt that this defeat after 1000 years of successful defense was a tragic time but this fading star of the Christian world rises to become the center of the Muslim world, maintaining its glory for centuries more.

The turks/muslims are good, the rest are evil, deceitfull, selfish, backstabbing SOBs. The sultan kisses a little girl in St. Sophia Cathedral... probably after his soldiers just hacked her father. And the little girl and his mother are smiling, grateful. So there is not too much historical accuracy there. Also, the film is speeding, as it tries to cover too much time frame in too little space. Characters are caricatured, the love story is caricatured, the father-son relation is caricatured. The actual story-arc would be better developed into a miniseries, not a 2 hours movie. Swordfight is good, stunts overall are not that good. Also some special effects are poorly executed, it;s a wonder how they did it into the final cut of the movie."

","Is this movie very interesting ? Can't say. To like or hate a movie is a subjective appreciation. At first place, you could expect this movie to give an idea of one of the most important historical event (causing the end of the middle-age in Europe). However, don't expect too much. It has no historical / political quality at all. Furthermore, the movie's quality is quite low (for a 17M budget). According to me, it corresponds more to a TV movie. Still, it is a movie you can see on a rainy Sunday on Internet (don't worth 10 for a ticket though).<br/><br/>Keep looking until the end (or fast-forward), the scene where the hero swaps the flags (the ottoman one with the two-heads eagle of Constantinople) worths a lot - it has Mel Brooks touch !<br/><br/>The last but not the least, don't judge the movie on its IMDb quotation.

"wittmann_todd","9","3","7","12 January 2018"," For once we see the manipulative underhandness of the Greeks
","I absolutely loved this movie. My mother is Greek and I was raised more Greek than my German father's heritage. I know the Greek mindset and the subtle and not so subtle ways of manipulation and political intrigue. This movie in the first hour exactly portrays the clever manipulation of all parties concerned to achieve their respective goals. I am also an independent scholar of everything Byzantine. Too often a battle movie only centers on the war strategy, the action scenes and the political statement the writers which to convey. The Eastern Roman empire after their defeat at Manzikert in 1071 was in severe decline thereafter. The only manner, therefore, in which the ""Byzantine"" empire was able to continue for so long afterwards was by political manipulation and payoffs. The ending obviously shows the writers' intent on being a pro-Turkish movie at the expense of some minor points in its historical portrayal. But, there is nothing of historical discrepancy I found that was fatal to the story. In fact, the story does not go far enough in showing how Mehmet II rebuilt the city by rebuilding the population with Christians and even Jews. He showed religious tolerance and even re-established the Greek Orthodox Patriarchy. I could go on and on about the wonderful manner in which Mehmet governed Constantinople after the conquest, and it shows his unique genius. Therefore, I understand why the Turks emulate him so much. Regarding some of the historical discrepancies some viewers point out in their reviews, there is much about the battle we simply do not have a definitive account: Was a gate left open on purpose or by mistake? And was this gate the reason why the city fell? Did Constantine XI die in battle or did he commit suicide? How many men did Mehmet actually have? How many men did Constantine XI have? One thing is sure, many of us have been wrongfully assuming Constantinople was a weak city which was easy to conquer. There is no evidence of this. The empire was non-existent. Yet, in fact the walls of the city were in good repair having been strengthened before the siege. Therefore, I believe the director took what pieces of discrepant history he thought important to adapt to his theme of the movie. I have no historical problem with the director's approach. The set pieces and art direction were superb. The battle scenes wonderfully done. The acting breathless."

","I watched the first and the last 45 minutes of the movie and frankly I was so bored of the acting and the historical inaccuracies. Ulubatlı Hasan never existed, it was invented by Turkish nationalist and this is a well known fact but we see him in the movie as a hero. After conquering Constantinople, Mehmed II. let his janissary's plunder the city for two days. Because of having lost a lot of soldiers and as a custom, he condone the violations. I know that there is no point in mentioning the real historical facts but I was expecting something better. So much money spent on a lousy movie as this one. A real genius like Sultan Mehmed II., should have been reflected in a better way considering the historical facts."

","As a Turk, i admit that, this movie doesn't deserve more than 6 stars. But it doesn't deserve 1 either.Acting, plot, effects are not at their best. Casting is awful. There are more talented Turkish actors for these roles.Scene editing is not good at all. Giovanni Giustiniani and Ulubatlı Hasan are both jokes. They are like they run out of the gym to fight in the battle. I think director choice is the starter of the disaster. Faruk Aksoy wasn't capable to direct this kind of movie. If you look his directing carrier there are only low quality comedy and horror movies. *But if you consider that, this is the first trying to do a historical - action movie with this scale in Turkish movie industry, slamming it to the ground is a bit merciless*. <br/><br/>I read plenty of reviews. Everybody complains about the nationalist propaganda of turks. I admit that movie doesn't give history as it really was. Of course, citizens of the conquered city wouldn't see the conqueror as a savior. Of course Turks were not that almighty and Christians were evil( Opposite of this is not real either.) But take a second and think.. In Hollywood movies don't we see people with American eyes. Were Persians monsters as seen in 300? Or are Russians, Chinese evil as seen in plenty action movies? Were Indians beasts as seen in western movies? This is not the first time that one nation sublimated and their enemies identified as cowards, heartless puppets."

","To all, It is quite interesting to me that the word ""conquer"" itself is used to take control of a country or city. At the first glance, the conquer of Istanbul (called Constantinople in the past) was such a thing. However, the Conquer 1453 does not only simulate the conquer of Istanbul 1453 but also it brings an innovation to the Turkish cinema. I think that Faruk Aksoy (the director of the movie) has also conquered the cinema industry in Turkey in addition to the hearts of the Turkish people with this wonderful work.<br/><br/>I believe that everyone should watch this movie to find out about the conquer of the Istanbul from the perspective of Turks. Moreover, I should add that something makes this movie different from others in terms of one point. You will see it during the movie. This movie is for people, who desire to see something different. <br/><br/>Have fun.<br/><br/>Dursun Akaslan"

As this movie is the most expensive production for the Turkish movie, it drew interest. <br/><br/>To criticize I just can say that the attitude of Sultan Mehmet the Conquerer is not like I waited. The real Faith was a modest and religious person as far as I know. Some scenes show him as an immodest Sultan. Also after the conquest Sultan Mehmet the Conquerer enters the Hagia Sophia and prays there. This scene is not filmed."

They played their roles very good. I only expected a little more from the Faith Sultan character. It was more like Ulubatli Hasan did more of the work then he did.

","Neither i am a Christian, nor i am a Muslim. For me the movie was good. Though i can watch the whole movie objectively, it is clear that the Sultan's side is very well represented while the side on Constatine is not much revealed. The movie has shown sultan as a hero, but has not clearly reflected his ideology behind invasion. It is represented more as a religious revenge movie with Turkish sultan having excellent administration qualities. Side-effects in movie are good and yes fights are wonderful. It was my first Turkish movie. Christian side of the story is not shown much. Actors except the protagonist cannot hide the modern style and are unable to blend to medieval personalities. Over all a good entertainment. Though speed of story is slow. Try not to fall for any side. Just enjoy the story from history, which is showing the story of one side."

The ottoman empire is very well loved in the Muslim world, so much so that even their gold dinar based monetary system is being replicated as far away as in Malaysia. So it is understandable that a movie on the ottoman empire's highest watermark will definitely evoke a lot of emotional response in its watchers. This movie is a treat!"

","Looking through other reviews of this film, I see that FETIH 1453 has been regularly criticized for its so-called 'inaccurate' representation of medieval history. In truth, questions of 'inaccuracy' or 'accuracy' are difficult to measure; our knowledge of the life and times of the late fifteenth century is sketchy, to say the least. FETIH 1453 works as a contemporary piece, using history to promote the idea of Turkish patriotism at a time when the integrity of nation-states is perpetually threatened by globalization, as well as huge behemoths like the European Union. On these terms, the film is actually pretty good: its moral scheme is easy to identify. All Christians are inevitably bad, while the Ottomans, on the other hand, need a strong, committed yet fair leader to ensure their success both on the battlefield and off. The fight scenes are well handled, combining CGI effects with plenty of vivid color and incident. Sometimes the structure is a little predictable, with too many sequences showing representatives of both sides (Christians and Ottomans) deciding how to plan their next campaigns; but this is offset by a sensitive handling of the domestic scenes, in which the two major central characters (Devrim Evin, Ibrahim Celikkol) are shown having to make unenviable choices between their families and their countries. FETIH 1453 is the Republic of Turkey's most expensive film in terms of budget, and its most successful at the box-office. It's not hard to see why."

The try was good but maybe help should have been sought from Hollywood or British film makers to set it on the right track in terms of cinematography, animation, sound, dubbing, and choice of actors as the character of Mehmet was not well portrayed and the character lacked the charisma to have audiences to glued to his roles. The actress on the other hand with her gray eyes made her look blind and she was much more mature in her looks making her not very appealing.<br/><br/>There were many instances when I lost track of the film and it was not clear what was going on. No doubt being a historical movies all details should have been taken into consideration and more than once we only saw the same soldiers over and over again.

It's a lengthy but rather poorly-told kind of movie that just doesn't have the finesse or money behind it that similarly-styled and themed rivals from both Hollywood and China do. The Turks are of course displayed as the impeccable heroes, battling evil and tyranny all around, but the massed battle sequences are animated by below-par CGI which makes this look like one of those cheesy documentary re-stagings you see on television now and then. I can't comment on the acting, because I unfortunately watched a dubbed version which took away any of that interest."

"kendoka-kendo","5","1","3","21 January 2015"," Good movie, biased history
","Where should we begin? The movie itself is not bad: decent acting, lots of action, exciting battle scenes. However, one should just watch it just as an action/war flick, because from a historical point of view, this is nothing but a pathetic, biased, and intellectually dishonest attempt to distort the FACTS. The Turkish director and producers tripped over themselves to portray Sultan Mehemet II as an archetypal hero, ferocious in battle and magnanimous in victory. I will just limit myself to point out the following gross omissions and distortions: 1) In the movie we see the sinking of some Venetian ships that tried to force their way past the Turkish blockade. However, nothing is said about the fate of the captain of one of these ships, Antonio Rizzo (look it up, folks!), who along his captured crew was impaled for daring such a feat. 2) The Turkish admiral Balthogu (look it up, folks!) in the movie, was slapped by Mehemet for failing to sink the Venetian fleet, which sailed safely into Constantinople's harbor. In reality Balthogu was almost put to death, had not some of his soldiers defended him to the Sultan: he was beaten to a pulp, stripped of his titles and property and sent into exile. Magnanimous Mehemet, eh? 3) At some point we see the ""evil"" defenders of Constantinople hanging some brave Turkish prisoners on the walls of the city, in full view of the besieging Turkish army. No mention is made of the FACT that this was IN RESPONSE to the Turks first beheading 125 Christian prisoners before the city walls. One more: my favorite distortion: 4) Mehemet walks into the main church of Consatntinople Haghia Sophia, promising peace and protection to the terrified civilians who found refuge there. Ehem, small detail: Constantinople was sacked for THREE full days: rape, pillage, murder, robbery galore!!! Look it up folks! Conclusion: shame on the director and producers of this movie for their corrupted, stupid, insulting portrayal of history. This is ONE MORE reason for distancing ourselves from anything that has a ""made in Islam"" tag attached to it......"

","I watched this movie without reading any reference (except the trailer), so I think I can write my honest opinion. <br/><br/>If you want to watch it, please bear it in your mind that this movie is the historical basis event that is fictionalize as for entertainment, then you won't get any disappointment. However, if you want to see this movie and expecting the historical summary to be well-presented in there, please consider not to expect too much and be ready for some contradictions to what we learned in the historical lessons in school.<br/><br/>I didn't watch any Turkish movie before this. But I think they spend good effort and a relevant budget for its making, and for the result it is a presentable entertainment, meaning: you can enjoy this movie with relax with the pop-corn in your hands and enjoy some heroic actions.<br/><br/>For the historical point of view itself, it is a bit too one-sided story although some dialogue of Constantinople and Rome was presented, it missed or maybe made up some important details, and I will not say much of those. It seems the director wanted to build the modern historical image of the Ottoman empire from their point of view, and they made it. <br/><br/>As entertainment I score it as 8, and as historical background is 4, the producers, directors & actors did their best in overall which deserve a 7. So the average score I can give is 6.3, rounded up to 6."

"k_genghis","4","1","3","19 March 2013"," almost totally wasted amount of budget, shame for Turkish film industry
","The first thing to say is this is the first Turkish film (to my information) with this amount of budget. And guest what, they screwed a topic of high potential in this very first high-budget film. They should have screwed a trivial piece of historical event instead, or rather a simple romantic film. Hopefully, much experience is gained, which could result in a far better high-budget movie next time. Though, this most significant point in medieval Turkish (and the world, as well) history is all screwed already. I have to mention that Turkish film industry is highly Hollywood-dominated in recent decades. To the extent unfortunately,that in cinemas, it is quite rare when a non-Hollywood foreign movie appears, except for some very special endangered theaters. Consequently, the producers of this movie insisted on creating something that feels Hollywood intensely. Following points are remarkable aspects giving this Hollywood flavor: * Everybody speaks English (Turkish, in this case), despite the existence of plenty of people who can profess on old Greek and Latin, no big deal to hire them to produce relevant texts. Fortunately, there were no aliens running wild around this movie, I hate them speaking English. * There is always (no exception at all!) at least one love affair (preferably between the main characters, heroes etc.) in American movies. They did not forget to include one in this very American-influenced movie * The Emperor and his soldiers are evils that must be eliminated, as it was with Japanese or German in American WII movies, Persians in 300Spartans, etc. * The computer-aided scenes are exaggerated generously (as it was in Troya, 300spartan, etc.) such that millions of soldiers can pray before attacking the city walls. Indeed, there must be no more than 100 millions of people back then in the whole world<br/><br/>Last, but not the least, history is seriously twisted. Sultan Mehmet II is not a religious freak leading thousands into war for no reason but eliminate ""infidels"". There were tens of political, economical, safety etc. reasons for the Turks to take Constantinople. In fact, Ottoman ruling only cared much about religion -as a last resort to save the descending empire- towards the fall in 19th-20th century with the intent of keeping millions of people of various origins under unity, which failed apparently. In conclusion, the producers created what they thought that would be ""favoured"" by the audience. Instead, they should have created something more original, ie. what they would find more reasonable. Simply, the resulting movie is nothing better than a screwed-up all-the-same American movie."
"rgnztrk","3","1","3","3 March 2013"," Not bad scenes but not objective too
","While I was watching the movie one of the worst thinks were no Turkish soldiers didn't die. That just made me laugh. Lots of people talked about fanaticism and propaganda and ... That is so normal for Turkish movies. It's so weird but directors always make enemies as bad people. And Turks were born to rescue. I think Turkish historical-comedy movies are more objective than the others. And this is something funny that there are usually a superhero can even kill more than 2 people with just an arrow :P . But in this movie at least they really fought to kill. Don't make so much pessimistic comments. Turkish cinema is going better step by step. In this step at least they made nice battle scenes. <br/><br/>Don't think like Ulubatlı Hasan is a fantasy character.Lots of people tells that he was exist and it's true that he died with lots of arrows while he was at the tower with flag."
"tom-durham","1","1","4","25 March 2017"," drawn out and historically inaccurate. Nice CGI
","The pacing on this movie is terrible. There is maybe 1.5 hours of actual content plus 1 hour of fluff. <br/><br/>In addition there is a lack of interest in history when making this movie. You'd think for 2.5 hours there is plenty of opportunity to cover the many interesting historical points of the battle for example. In reality they picked maybe 5 main points and these get a minute of screen time each. It's quite bad.<br/><br/>Watching this movie gives you more of an insight into the Turkish culture and religion than the actual conquest of Constantinople. For example they can't show Mohamed on screen so they cleverly use the camera itself, so you the audience become Mohamed. Except it then becomes confusing as you don't realise when this transition occurs back. Also there are many prayers involved. There is even a 'suicide bomb' scene where they all yell Allah Akbar before blowing themselves up.<br/><br/>This movie is almost least twice as long as it should be, given it's content. The script really lets it down, there is little dialogue in parts, and much attention is given to drawn out camera movements or people being idle. The first half of the movie, the lead up to the battle is not too bad. However the second half, the actual battle, is ruined by the drawn out scenes. If the director's effort was to make us feel frustrated with the time required to conquer the city, he succeeded, for the wrong reasons. To add insult to injury, the English subs clearly skip a fair amount of dialogue.<br/><br/>If you want to watch history reviewed with rose tinted glasses by the victor, plus an hour of fluff this is it."
"anegella","1","1","4","3 August 2016"," Very bad... :(
","First I saw the title I was excited since I have not see any movie about fall of Constantinople and I thought it would be interesting to to see it from other side (from Turkish perspective), but I was very disappointed.<br/><br/>The story-line was built so badly and so boring. Things too fast and you could not get positive or negative feelings to characters. I'm not going in to historical context cause it will take us too fare, but I must say that it was fare from historical facts. But that's usual for movies, right? I felt smell of propaganda. Byzantines were so evil, standing on the Turks way and Turks choir Boys Choir on Sunday Mass... At battle scenes only Byzantines were dying and only Byzantines could kill were innocent, unarmed farmers. Acting was terrible. Even I could understand the original language acting was so bad. It was some kind of Turkish Soap Opera level. Costumes and props simply bad. CGI was awful, reminded me 90's. It's understandable that Turkey doesn't have experience on visual FX and it would be OK if the rest was good, but no..."
"Deniz72","9","1","4","28 November 2013"," Good film, but would have preferred a less religious aspect!
","This is truly a remarkable bit of film making, particularly the special effects, acting and panoramic scenery. The screenplay too was outstanding, Hollywood should seriously take into consideration the new up and coming Turkish directors and their big ideas in both its major films and Soups in today's Turkey – much has changed since those years in the 1970s. In saying all that and getting them off my chest, now for the real review. Everyone knows how powerful the Ottoman Empire was and that it conquered Istanbul, which is why I didn't really enjoy the parts with the reference to religion in battle, particularly on the battlefield itself – why was that included more than once? The film could have been better laid out in terms of explaining the military techniques the Ottomans used on the battlefield itself, Mehmet's passion for the Arts of the Western world and how he thought hard to preserve the new conquered city's heritage by naming it ""Istanbul"" which means ""The City"" in Byzantium language – which many people do not know. Mehmet also had more than a few wives and not just only one, and from various backgrounds including a Greek wife. Mehmet was definitely a very interesting person in real life and had more to him apart form only wanting to conquer Constantinople."
"joshua-303-92778","5","1","5","26 February 2013"," A mediocre film featuring medieval warfare
","I wasn't expecting much from this movie. 80% of the film is boring dialogue, much of it irrelevant from the historical events in question. So I found myself fast forwarding through most of the talking, to get the to the Medieval siege warfare which is the only reason I watched the film.<br/><br/>Honestly, the battle scenes are pretty good. The visual effects are pretty convincing, and dramatic. I would have liked to see more of them.<br/><br/>Where this movie falls flat is the ridiculous portrayal of the Turks as humanitarian heroes, and the Christians as arrogant tyrants. When the city is finally conquered, the Turk commander announces that everyone will be spared. The sun rises and everyone lives happily ever after. It's just blatant propaganda, and impossible to take seriously.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, this appears to be a production from a film making culture which hasn't quite come of age yet. But I'm happy they made the effort, because I love history, and this is a most important event which more people should know about."

"kalerma96","Null","1","5","11 November 2012"," A good movie to see when you don't know what it happens in reality
","I heard about this movie last year when I was searching about the Fall of Constantinople.I watched this movie and I like very much the effects that were used,the battle scenes,the costumes and the actors.But,I know exactly what it happens in reality and I have discovered that there was some things that shouldn't appear in this movie,or just things that should appear.<br/><br/>1)Well,i have watched this movie twice because i doesn't understand first time who are the antagonists and who are the protagonists.At the second watch,finally,i realized that the turks were the good one and the Byzantines were the bad,even if in the history it was the opposite. 2)Hassan really exists for the people who said he doesn't.He was the first ottoman who puts the flag on the Constantinople's walls.But he wasn't sultan's best friend.First time Mehmed II saw him was when Hassan died so... 3)The cannon was built by Orban(he built this cannon not Era!!)(Urban) who was from Transilvania,Romania.(not vampires world)The legend says that when the Emperor hasn't enough money to pay him,the engineer offers his services to the sultan.No one wanted to arrest him.<br/><br/>4)I think that the love story between Hassan and Era was useless because there was another couple which could be insisted:Gulbahar and Mehmed.In movie,i saw that the relationship between the sultan and his wife was so cold,like an iceberg;i hoped that they were talking more but it hasn't happen.I realized that they were 2 shy teenagers(in reality they were,she was 17,he 19 but however!!) at first meeting:))I hoped that they will kiss,something but it doesn't happen nothing,nothing on the screen...(the sultan was bisexual but it does't matter)<br/><br/>5)Another thing that it was wrong interpreted is the mother of prince Bayezid.Some historians says that Gulbahar was his mother,another says that his mother was Sitti-Mukhrime(or something like that).Anyway,in movie Gulbahar is his mother,a very lovely mother,unlike Mehmed... I realized that he does't like his son,because he needed 70 minutes to realize that he does' show affection to Bayezid.At the end of the movie he kisses the little girl,even if he doesn't know her.Poor Bayezid...(i hope Yigitcan Elmali will play the same role on Faith Series:)))<br/><br/>6)The emperor Constantine wasn't a bad,harlot,drunk and superficial person.It was a very unlucky emperor and I was so sad when he dies,even if the movie does't show the moment when his head flews 5 inch to west.<br/><br/>7)It was very funny when I watched the battle between Hassan and Giustiniani.They were identical,like the twins,and until the end I haven't make the difference between them.But I was sure from the beginning that Hassan will die on the walls hit by 20 arrows.(from the countering) 8)This movie doesn't show when Suleyman Baltoghlu was beaten by the Byzantins.Shame!!I was very curious to see this battle and the director cut this scene.<br/><br/>9)In the reality,sultan hates Halil because he dethroned him when he was 14 and reput Murad II.And after the siege,he beheaded Halil.The grand vizier wanted to control Mehmed so,their discussions were very interesting,in movie they're not.And the grand vizier was with the Byzantines.<br/><br/>10)In the movie,Zaganos is portrayed like a cloth doll,and he does't argue very much with the grand vizier.In reality it was like Hurrem,but a masculine version.<br/><br/>In any case,this movie is very interesting and it respect most of events that were took place:the depression of sultan(note:Zaganos encourages the sultan not Aksemsettin),the presence of Orhan,the battle,the intrigues(some of them).The actors convinced me that they were the characters,even if the scenery was dull.I hope the TV series will be more good.For one thing i'm sure:the series will not show the sexuality of the sultan...or it will do...the heterosexual side...<br/><br/>PS:sorry for the fans..."
"jack-weston","1","1","6","22 March 2013"," A work of propaganda and nothing more.
","This movie is terrible to watch at for several reasons, but one of the main reasons is that this movie is not an artistic work, but instead a propaganda production, pro-Turkey and pro-Allah.<br/><br/>Everything in this movie just screams at you for being exaggerated. For one, every time a Turkish land is presented, it is sunny and nice music is playing, people are dressed nicely and they are smiling.<br/><br/>On the other hand, when the Vatican is shown, dark clouds loom above it, the streets are empty and everyone is frowning. When other western lands are shown, they are shown as chaotic and in decadence.<br/><br/>When the emperor Constantine makes his speech in the arena, the people are shown with blisters on their faces and with dirty cheeks.<br/><br/>Mehmet II is shown as this superhero know-it all. He is a great hunter, a scene just put there for no reason, to show us how great of a hunter he is. A good lover. A great father. A scholar, he is shown studying, analyzing and everything.<br/><br/>The people of Constantinople are shown as shouting ""Death to the Turks"" and then at the end, Mehmet II walks in a church and tells the people how they won't be persecuted for their religion. Very convenient, when in fact, history - and present day shows us that the Turks were always the ones shouting death to the unfaithful, and not the other way around.<br/><br/>The duke of Genoa is shown as this fat, greedy man - when it couldn't be further from the truth.<br/><br/>Emperor Constantine and his advisers are shown as this evil creatures, always plotting, always speaking in a sneaky and evil voice.<br/><br/>Even for the untrained eye, even for those not involved in any way (emotionally or otherwise) this movie is pure propaganda seen from a mile away. This is not a work of art, this is not a work of movie production. This is no more than the equivalent of what Hitler did in demonizing the Allies and praising the Aryan race. This is the same thing, in modern times, subtlety done, but nonetheless the same thing.<br/><br/>And for any Turks or Muslim brothers who are reading this - you should feel insulted too, as insulted as I am, for this movie betrays the Ottoman history and our values. Mehmet II wasn't this superhero and he did a lot of bad things - and that's OK.<br/><br/>The fall of Constantinople may be a ""victory"" for that time, but in the long run, it was one of the poorest decisions ever made, because by gaining Constantinople, Mehmet II lost Rumelia (the current whole Balkan peninsula, including Albania, Serbia, Bulgaria, etc.).<br/><br/>But that's history.<br/><br/>You should be insulted because this movie shows suicide bombings not once, but twice. Both Turkish, both in the name of Allah - shouting Allahu Akbar. <br/><br/>This is not a good thing for any Muslim, and certainly not for Islam. This is poor movie, showing poor values, false history, unfair to both sides in different ways. You should definitely watch it nonetheless, so you understand in the future how someone is trying to change your views and mess with your perception on reality.<br/><br/>This movie was endorsed and supported by the Turkish government and the Muslim ministry of culture. Go figure."

He likes to pray a lot, very kind with his people, like to read koran a lot, but they never show this in the movie. Hadith of the Prophet said,""Verily you shall conquer Constantinople. What a wonderful leader will her leader be, and what a wonderful army will that army be!"". And they totally don't describe about how Sultan Mehmet work so hard in his life to produce exactly what prophet have said in order to fit his kingdom with the hadith rather than always yelling at his minister. Actually I've read the biography about the detailed conquest of the Constantinople so I can say that I quite know everything and this movie fail to do so.It looks like they just take some inspiration from ""Kingdom of Heaven"",""Troy"",""300"",""King Arthur"" and maybe ""Alexander"" to make this movie.
