","Thor is a film that takes risks - and they pay off wonderfully. The movie grounds itself in reality while keeping a mythological and fantasy-esqe tone, and it never loses sight of the humanity within the characters, with elevates this above standard superhero fare."
"rparham","8","98","146","3 June 2011"," Thor proves a strong contender
","In the pantheon of Marvel Superheroes, from my vantage point, Thor is a second-tier player. Even amongst non-obsessive comic aficionados, such as myself, Thor doesn't quite have the readership draw or the common familiarity in the public that heroes such as Spider-Man, Batman, Superman, etc., have. However, that doesn't mean that Marvel Studios, the filmmaking wing of the company, feel inclined to give the filmic adaptation of Thor short shrift. The cinematic entry for this character, titled simply Thor, is among the better of the Marvel adaptations of recent years, mixing a good sense of fun, strong acting, and some Shakespearian level drama that makes for an especially entertaining time at the movies.<br/><br/>Liberally adapting portions of Thor comic book lore to fit in a more modern comic book film reality, Thor introduces us to a centuries old war between the Asgardians, beings that live for long periods of time and can travel through space from their home realm of Asgard to various other worlds, such as Earth, via the Bi-Frost bridge, and the conflict centric Frost Giants, whom the Asgardians conquered some time back. Odin (Anthony Hopkins), ruler of the Asgardians, is preparing to abdicate his throne to his son, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), but on the eve of Thor's inauguration, agents of the Frost Giants infiltrate Asgard and attempt to steal back a device that is the key to their power, which had been taken by Odin at the end of their long struggle. When Thor disagrees with his father's desire to not to retaliate in order to not disturb the peace that currently exists between the Asgardians and the Frost Giants, he takes matters into his own hands, traveling to the Frost Giant's realm with his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), and compatriots Sif (Jaimie Alexander), Volstagg (Ray Stevenson), Hogun (Tadanobu Asano) and Fandral (Josh Dallas) in tow. When the encounter with the Frost Giants ends with tensions re-ignited between the two factions, Odin decides that his son is not prepared to lead his people, and exiles Thor, sans his powers, to Earth.<br/><br/>When he arrives on Earth, he is discovered by astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her associates Professor Selvig (Stellan Skarsgaard) and Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings), who are convinced that he isn't a random homeless vagabond that they found in the middle of the desert. Thor must attempt to locate his power hammer, Mjolnir, from the government agents that have captured it, and attempt to reclaim his place in Asgard. However, he finds that, without his super-human abilities, and surrounded by humans, perhaps some of his previous attitudes were incorrect, especially when he connects romantically with Jane. Meanwhile, Loki, who turns out to have some ulterior motives, seizes control of Asgard following the collapse of Odin from strain, and begins to hatch a grand scheme involving the Frost Giants.<br/><br/>Thor, much like Iron Man before it, proves that, in the right hands, a comic tale that appears silly on the surface can have hidden depths when properly plumbed. Sure, Thor has elements that, on the face of it, may lead a bit to some audience snickers (Thor's ability to pick himself up and fly and defeat attackers with little effort are a bit cheesy at times), but the creatives behind Thor, including director Kenneth Branagh, manage to develop a story for Thor that deals with elements of tragedy, pathos, selflessness and, perhaps even more surprisingly, involving character development. Thor is more about the lead characters at its core, again akin to Iron Man, than some other comic book films and this draws the audience into its tale.<br/><br/>When it was first announced that Kenneth Branagh would be taking the reins of Thor as a director, it seemed something of an unusual fit for someone best known for his cinematic adaptations of the works of Shakespeare, but the final results of Thor bare out that Branagh was just the right man for the job. Considering the larger-than-life origins of the Thor comic, involving beings with the power and appearance of Gods and the various machinations of their story, the material fits fairly well with Branagh's body of work to a great extent. Especially strong is the development of Loki, who proves to be less of a traditional mustache twirling villain, and more of a misguided soul, trapped between revelations he makes about himself and his past and his respect in his father, making him more of a tragic figure than a black and white comic book antagonist.<br/><br/>Thor benefits from strong acting from its leads, Hemsworth and Hiddleston. Hemsworth embodies Thor, first as the brash, acting-before- thinking hero, and later as a man faced with the reality that some of his choices and attitudes were not becoming of a king. Hemsworth really makes you empathize with Thor, and gives you a reason to root for the character throughout the film. Hiddleston, working with the somewhat subdued (at first) Loki eventually transforms him from a seeming weak, malleable person into one who's penchant for vengeance and control is revealed in layers, peeling back one by one through the development of the narrative.<br/><br/>Thor isn't without its weak points, however. The romance between Thor and Jane Foster is practically and afterthought, rushed into the narrative at light speed and then not given any room to breathe or develop, it plays more as a requirement of adapting the comic story than something that works organically in the film. Portman is fine in the role, but the screenplay doesn't give enough to this relationship for it to be more than a bump in the road of the film's story.<br/><br/>Once again, Marvel has managed to take one of their lesser known heroes and make them the subject of an entertaining film version, with energy and depth that is a bit unexpected. May they keep on making comic book films of this caliber."

","Thor was much much better than I expected. I didn't know if they could pull of the balance between the Norse mythology stuff and the real world Marvel Universe. I should've known better because Marvel knows their characters and knows what we want to see. Spider-Man set a new standard for the superhero film genre back in the day. Iron Man upped the ante. Thor takes the ball and runs with it and places that bar even higher. I look forward to seeing it again and know it will do well enough to be worthy of a sequel because word of mouth is going to be great. Trust me when I say Thor REALLY IS as good as Iron Man and is most worthy to be called one of the greatest adaptations ever.<br/><br/>Chris Hemsworth as the Norse god Thor, and Tom Hiddleston as his villainous brother Loki show they have the acting ability and star quality to become mega-marquee names in the future. Marvel found two absolute diamonds in the rough. Both actors make a HUGE impression and are wonderful on screen. You knew Acedemy Award winners Anthony Hopkins and Natalie Portman would bring it but these relative unkowns more than hold their own on screen. I know the script is written mostly for them but they carry it in a big way. From what I've read, Hemsworth and Hiddleston were cast almost a year in advance of filming the story so, they had time to get into shape and do character research. They certain did these long-time Marvel greats proud. Intelligent comic-book popcorn epics are rare and this one is definitely a cut above the usual fare."
"BiiivAL","8","120","195","8 June 2018"," Thor: The Mighty Avenger
","It remains only to marvel at the company Marvel, which gives an impressive amount of money for the implementation of films on their comic books under the guidance of ""newcomers"" in the genre of ""summer blockbuster."" Four years ago they did this with John Favreau, who previously filmed family comedies and yet surprised many with his ""Iron Man"". Now, the honored actor and director of the dramatic cinema and theater Kenneth Brana demonstrated miracles by taking off a large-scale fantasy comics epic.<br/><br/>Actors<br/><br/>Chris Hamsworth<br/><br/>Taking advantage of the tested scheme (to take on the role of the protagonist of a little-known actor and surround him with ""loud names""), Brana did not lose. Chris Hamsworth is the perfect Thor! Possessing not only impressive physical training and memorable appearance, Hamsworth was able to convey the power and emotions of this character. In some places it is threatening, in places it's funny when it's necessary to be gallant. Yes, and in general, throughout the whole movie you penetrate to the Torah sympathy and you empathize with it.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman<br/><br/>As always, she is charming and charming. The first falls on the Torah and runs after him all the remaining time :)<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins<br/><br/>Worthy performance of a worthy role. The first experience of Hopkins in the film kinomics was a success.<br/><br/>Tom Hiddleston<br/><br/>Sly, a jealous manipulator. Another one hundred percent hit in the role!<br/><br/>Jamie Alexander, Ray Stevenson, Joshua Dallos, Tadanobu Asana and Idris Elba<br/><br/>Well-written characters, which should still be given a little more time, because each is interesting in its own way.
Action<br/><br/>It is many, it is diverse, large-scale, beautiful, impressive and fascinating. The best episode is the battle of the top five warriors with the Ice Giants and a huge monster.<br/><br/>Special Effects<br/><br/>Looking at the trailers it seemed that the ""Thor"" would not be particularly pleased with the special effects, for both the monster's drawing and the Torah's hammer in action were not so impressive. But fortunately, the effects brought to shine and you can with full confidence to say that the ""Torah"" is the most grandiose special effects from all the films Marvel.<br/><br/>Locations<br/><br/>Ah, this Asgard! He is beautiful! Incredibly beautiful and the viewer is not satisfied with the monotonous views of the city. In each of Asgard's places shown, there is something unusual and unique. And the more interesting are the transitions from the deserted quiet town of New Mexico to the majestic palaces and structures of Asgard throughout the film.<br/><br/>Music<br/><br/>Patrick Doyle has proved since the time of ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" that he is an excellent composer, skillfully combining different musical styles. The ""Torah"" is mostly dominated by pathos and heroic music, but in times of dramatic moments, sad compositions play.<br/><br/>Humor<br/><br/>Humor in the film is not as much as we would like. But he is funny and in no way slips into jokes below the belt. True, it would have been more ridiculous to beat the scenes of ""God Tor in the modern world among ordinary people.""<br/><br/>Plot<br/><br/>Enough fun and interesting without obvious stupidities and sagging. Although Torah's ""rebirth"" was worth paying more attention.<br/><br/>Surprises<br/><br/>In the film, a lot of Easter eggs for fans and attentive viewers. Starting from the most obvious (mentioning the Hulk and the Iron Man), ending with the hidden ones (Falcon eye). And at the end of the final credits, the audience expects another bridge to the upcoming ""Avengers"".<br/><br/>Undoubtedly, the most beautiful and grandiose film Marvel. Excellent entertaining summer movie. Satisfied should remain both the audience and the fans. I want to wish the studio to continue making films about my superheroes with the same love and warmth."
"theycallmemrglass","8","223","381","20 April 2011"," An immensely enjoyable Marvel entry that complements the tone of Iron Man films
","I watched this last night at a preview screening in London.<br/><br/>I prayed that Kenneth Branagh would learn from his mistakes with handling a big budget movie, namely his Frankeinstein. Thankfully, I am glad to say he learnt a great deal from those mistakes. Of course, this is no Henry V, this is just pure popcorn entertainment but a thoroughly enjoyable introduction to Thor for the big screen. Chris Hemsworth played the part with a lot of energy, charisma and I have to admit from a bloke's point of view, annoying good looks. Anthony Hopkins added much needed heavyweight presence as Odin but its a role he has quite frankly played a gazillion times but I never tire of it, so I'm not complaining. In a year long span of brilliantly playing vastly different roles from psychotic to swashbuckling heroine, Natalie Portman this time plays the sweet determined scientist girl who falls for the strangely mannered good looking guy. Nothing too taxing for any of them but they do give a re-assuring aura about them.<br/><br/>The visuals were quite spectacular, mainly, the sweeping canvas of Asgard. The action scenes were also good though I thought could have been executed better with lesser use of the fast cut edit style that is too often the norm in action film these days.<br/><br/>There is plenty of humour when Thor is on Earth but not in a put-off way as there is a suitable contrast of a serious tone with everything set in Asgard. Even though the storyline was somewhat predictable, it was still a riveting one.<br/><br/>For those like me, who were concerned about how Thor fits into the established Marvel connected universe set by the Iron Man films need not worry. That is just another thing that Branagh and crew pulls off very well. We can now fully embrace the forthcoming Avengers where a God, a man who transforms into a giant green beast, and a man who flies in a hi tech amour suit can share the same screen. So its all coming together nicely.<br/><br/>And make sure you stay for the end credit scenes. In case you did not know of this before, I urge you to go back to the previous films (Iron Man 1 & 2, Incredible Hulk) and watch the end of credit sequences if you haven't already. They tell a separate story strand that will culminate to a certain upcoming Marvel movie. The end credit sequence of Thor is the most fascinating yet as it actually takes a major plot development in the story strand ;) And it was the longest bloody end of credit sequence I've ever seen in any movie! One last thing, the film I saw was in 3d and once again, it practically nearly ruined all the action scenes for me. In the non action scenes, it was pretty useless and just simply made the film much darker."
"featheredsun","Null","30","44","8 September 2011"," Powerful Family Dynamic and Beautiful Landscape
","This is a throw-off piece of Marvel fiction that is packed full of cliché and predictability...to a point.<br/><br/>I found myself cringing at a lot of the scenes of heroism and there's a definite stink of pure cheetos-stained fanboyism in many of the scenes in general, with the usual over-the-top ""glory"" of this old four-color trope.<br/><br/>But certain things caught my attention as well-done.<br/><br/>First, Asgard is absolutely beautiful. They went all out in making a realm of metallic and elemental grandeur. I had no trouble in buying this as the realm of Asgard, the ultimate land of beautiful heroism. In particular, the rainbow bridge, the weaponry, and the interior scenes were very fitting in general style and specific detail. Very impressive visually and even thematically.<br/><br/>Second, Branagh's touch can be seen with Shakespearean flair in the family of Odin the AllFather. Odin himself is brimmed with both the rime of age and the wisdom that comes with it and yet his voice can instantly summon fearful authority. Hopkins does well with that balance, even through some cheesy scripting.<br/><br/>And the brothers... the sibling rivalry here is very very potent in that it is nuanced and fully realized by both actors. There is love there, but also a lack of understanding, envy, and hate. Loki is far from a cardboard villain, in that we see, all in one package - a fighter who protects his allies, an honest counselor, a liar, a cautious thinker, a smooth tongue, and an awkward one. He loves and reveres his father, but comes to almost fatally doubt him and even hate him...but it's all very real and very stirring. And even when it's clear that he's done very grim deeds, you can actually understand and accept his motives...and his last scene in the film brings all three of the family men together in a very poignant moment of utter loss.<br/><br/>I was pretty surprised how moving this all was, especially when put in the middle of some otherwise-uninspiring hero pablem.<br/><br/>So in summary, this movie both met my negative expectation of disappointment and surprised me with some purely moving content. See it to see if it surprises you at all as well, and forget the whole comic-book hero thing, since that's been done far better.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading."
"feelinesound","1","353","677","28 April 2011"," An insult to Marvel fans, movie goers, and human intelligence in general
","Honestly, seeing that Branagh directed and J. Michael Straczynski wrote the script is a large part of why I went to see the movie. Plus I'm generally a big fan of Marvel and their movies.<br/><br/>Unfortunately it's one of the dumbest things I've seen in years, and is completely full of moronic clichés and the most superficial faux morals. Please do yourself a favour and spend your money on things that are more deserving of it, especially if you've worked hard to earn it.<br/><br/>Just in case you want to know what you'll be missing ---<br/><br/>* spoiler alert * (though really I'm giving this film a massive compliment by suggesting you could 'spoil' anything in it)<br/><br/>Thor's father takes his hammer away and sends him to earth for punishment. While there Thor literally changes overnight from being an arrogant, rash and violent idiot to a wise, humble and pacifist purveyor of all things noble, and the only possible reason for this that's presented in the movie is that he met Natalie Portman and was then told that his father died while he was gone. Once Thor the god of thunder completes this astonishing and instant transformation and sacrifices his life for others, his hammer flies back to him, revives him and he beats the bad guys with it.<br/><br/>If you really, really love Marvel movies and viking folklore (to the point where you don't mind these things being made a joke out of) and have 2.5 hours in which you'd otherwise be causing harm to humanity or this planet, go see it. Otherwise you might as well spare yourself from this glorious waste of time and brain cells."
"ocacia","1","222","423","7 May 2011"," Utter garbage written around SFX
","Did professionals write this film? Did Antony really read the script or did he just see the figures in the contract? I think Nat and Tony need new agents, because you do not go from Silence of lamb and Black Swan *respectively* to this utter junk.<br/><br/>I do not know what other people saw but there is nothing good or unique in this film. The special effects actually made me tired. And lets talk about the story? My Lord, where was it and when did it begin. I got the feeling that the script was written after the action sequences were planned. They therefore said we want this effect and this effect now lets write a film around that. We need to use up Nat so lets force a romance into the script. We want jokes, so lets force a few of those in there. So much dead space in the film that doesn't arch into anything.scenes seem random and disconnected, like writing in junk to get it to a feature length time. drifting focus, drifting priorities. And no great moments that saved the film.<br/><br/>Also it is an overnight transformation from utter arrgoance to humility. Does anyone identify with any characters here? Did you understand the brothers motives? Makes no real sense in the real world. Did the film introduce anything for anyone to attach themselves to emotionally? No. Characters appear in odd order without any development. Actually while I am here typing I just realized something : This film is below the dignity of critique. It is so poor, so badly directed and written that to even point out the weak character development or random script turns give too much credit to it. I will therefore cease to add speak about it for fear of giving someone the illusion that there is anything to actually speak about in terms of artistic critique."

","Okay, so Thor is pretty darn decent. Phew. Without revealing anything regarding the plot, I'll just say that I enjoyed this film quite a lot, and would rate it above both Iron Man films, but not by too much. (If you hated them maybe just stay away from Marvel movies in general?) Very good in all areas, without achieving greatness in any sums up this movie nicely I think. Beautiful costumes and set design, solid acting all around, and much better action than recent movies have offered up. The world of Asgard has been handled wonderfully, looking absolutely gorgeous, and with all of its denizens very well spoken without their dialogue ever being as obtuse or clunky as Thor's 'Ye Olde' English has been known to be in the past. Special mention to Idris Elba for being friggin' awesome. I'm a pretty big Marvel fan, but not knowing what Mjolnir is won't harm your enjoyment of Thor to any great degree I don't think. Also, side note, I personally dislike 3D with a great, burning passion (thank you Clash of the Titans), but it is relatively well done here, never distracting from the film. I would still recommend seeing it in 2D if you can though, as it is quite dark in parts. Several parts. Bring on the Avengers!"
"aernest","3","82","152","16 May 2011"," OK, but not as good as it should have been
","Though I'm old and did read some comics in my time, Thor was never one of them. I do teach some Norse mythology, though, so that aspect interested me. There was an odd steampunk approach to the mythology, which was OK, I suppose. I really didn't expect this movie to be War and Peace, and I was certainly right on the money with that. It went for the snarky Iron Man approach more than I thought it would. It's hard to pull off without veteran snarkmeister Robert Downey, Jr., though. Chris Hemsworth is impossibly charming and good- looking in the title role, and does pretty well, considering some of the lines he had to say. Anthony Hopkins is a safe choice for his patented Older Mentor/Authority Figure performance (enjoy that check, Anthony), and Tom Hiddleston is somewhat intriguing as Loki. Stellan Skarsgard is completely wasted in a role that could have been phoned in. But you know who really stinks up the joint? Natalie Portman. It was DAMN hard to believe she was an astrophysicist, but it was even harder to believe that THOR (god of thunder, possessor of unspeakable power) would find her even remotely interesting. All she does is whine. The alleged falling in love is quite unbelievable, BTW. Yeesh. I hope the inevitable sequel loses her character."

I'm considering asking for a refund.<br/><br/>What was the point of Natalie Portman or the other mortals presence and the 5 minutes we spent in their company?<br/><br/>This movie is nothing but a 2 and bit hour long trailer for the undoubted THOR 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 which will have all the drama and normally good content that Marvel based movies have (I can only hope).<br/><br/>More time is spent (nearly half) developing characters and giving us background information on how we've got to where we've got...rather than telling the story that we paid to see....<br/><br/>There's no depth of character, (Anthony Hopkins was the best actor in it and he spent most of his time in a coma, I'm guessing after he read the script !), there's no plot other than arrogant son, exiled to earth. He spends 5 minutes (yes 5 !) not understanding anything that's going on or how society works (despite him and his people being deified for at least 2,000 years) and then gets sucked back to his own ""realm"", there's little in the way of good dialogue, the special effects are Dr Who'esq and the 3D is forgettable.<br/><br/>There's no menace from any of the baddies, his ""bad"" half / non brother seems so nice that you think ""ah it's all an act and something terrible is going to happen""... but no, he is quite a nice guy only really dabbles with naughtiness.....<br/><br/>This film was supposed to be in 3D yet I completely forgot that it was after the first 5 minutes and only at the end when I realised that I was wearing the stupid glasses did I remember!!<br/><br/>In a time where we have transformers, X-Men and the like, the special effects were weak and pretty poor. There's no humour no camping it up to rescue it either.<br/><br/>My worry is that if this is the best movie of the undoubted quadruology that we're about to be subjected to, then God help us. <br/><br/>I warn you we may have another Iron Man 2 (a movie I still haven't been able to stay awake all the way through yet!!) or Spiderman (anything other than 1) on our hands and can I bring myself to part with another £10 on the strength of that?... almost certainly not.<br/><br/>This could and should have been great, it wasn't and I'm left feeling cheated ! <br/><br/>Cre8."

There's no doubt that Hemsworth is a star in the making and a rather astounding leading man. Thor is a dazzling example of the superhero movie done right. There were some parts in the movie where I was just blown away. This film has a depth that no one could have expected and is very impressive in scale and design.<br/><br/>I love how the movie played out and it exceeded all my expectations.

Very good choice in the cast, could not have picked a better actor for Thor or Loki. Natalie Portman's part isn't the best.

Thor is a good movie, plenty of action, a lovely heroine (Natalie Portman) and some interesting sidekicks.

"big_ryan15","8","33","60","27 April 2011"," Thor-oughly entertained by this one
","I have to admit, i had low expectations for this adaptation. Hulk yeah sure, Iron man, why not, Captain America, its set in the real word of course it'll work. But THOR? A wildly fantastical tale of Norse Gods and Rainbow bridges and nicknamed hammers ?? Surely not! Ill stop with the bashing; this film is astonishing. The oddest thing has happened here. Coupling notoriously artsy director Kenneth Branagh with one of Marvels most theatrical characters was a stroke of genius. At the beginning of the film, we are quickly introduced to Jane Foster, her whimsical offsider and an older gentleman. Storm chasers aren't normally this clever you might think to yourself during this opening scene, but alas, they are revealed to actually be physicists after a few minutes. An incredible storm arrives and THOR HAS LANDED: or so you would think. Mere moments after being introduced to our title character we are thrust on an astrological journey to Asgard, land of gods. Here we are introduced to Odin, the all father and his 2 young boys; Loki and Thor. Odin recites stories of an ancient war in which a planet load of frost giants planned to destroy the realm of Midgard (earth) before Odin and his merry men stepped in to save humanity. It is during this scene we are first shown Thor's arrogance and thirst for war. Skip ahead a few years and THOR has become Asgard's mightiest warrior, just as Odin had foretold. A celebration is occurring, Thor is about to be crowned as king of Asgard, but alas... this glorious day is interrupted by none other than said FrostGiants attempting to steal a stolen heirloom from Asgard's weapons locker.. The story rapidly gains traction from here. Thor marches into the Frost Giants planet (against his fathers will) in all his Aussie glory, kicking ass and taking names. He and his friends become swiftly over powered and Odin is left no choice but to step in. An argument erupts in which Odin tells Thor of his assholness and douchebaggery and that he is no longer worthy of his giant hammer Mjolnir or his god of Thunder status. Cast down to Earth the audience is reunited with the opening scene and we are officially filled in. A bevy of comedic scenes follow in which Chris hemsworth's THOR is tranquillised and run over multiple times. The film transitions backwards and forwards between our world and that of Asgard so as to keep us informed on going ons. Odin goes into a coma and Thor's mischievous bro Loki starts to come into his own. A marvellous story unfolds filled with action, humour, heartache and a whole heap of awesome!! Branagh's eye for curious shots is on full show here and works fabulously in creating a beautifully surreal Asgard. The films close is a little rushed but is also very heartfelt and strong. Leaving plenty of room for more character development, THOR is as good as if not better than every comic film to date, the characters were superbly cast and played and the story follows as close as it can to the source material as it can without being too over the top. Spectacularly fun movie, worthy of the Marvel name tag and certainly a sequel. 10 out of 10 for performance and entertainment....<br/><br/>Make sure to stay after the credits for the Captain America nod."

It's the Journey of Thor, the powerful, arrogant yet heroic character, that is the latest addition to the host of Superheroes.<br/><br/>The Writing is Spot-On from start to end. In fact, Thor and his entire motivations, powers & ark, come out wonderfully. The Action Sequences are bombastic, while the Special Effects, as mentioned before, are stunning and come as a pleasure to your eyes. The 3D impact is definitely not missing here, as there are truly clap-worthy moments that look even more bigger due to the glasses on.<br/><br/>Kenneth Branagh's directs this Heroic tale, efficiently. And He is blessed with a catchy storyline & rich special effects. Cinematography is picture-perfect. Editing is good.<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Chris Hemsworth as Thor, is awesome and carries the film on his shoulders from start to end. He is indeed a mega-star in the coming time. Natalie Portman is very sincere. Sir Anthony Hopkins is okay, while Tom Hiddleston is every effective as the bad guy. Stellan Skarsgård & Kat Dennings are passable. Ray Stevenson, Idris Elba, Colm Feore & Joshua Dallas leave a mark. Rene Russo gets limited scope.<br/><br/>On the whole, Don't give 'Thor' a miss. This one's a winner all the way!"
"jprslattery","1","120","249","21 May 2011"," I really don't understand all the positive feedback for this film
","This film was one of the most tedious experiences of my life. I enjoy a good cheesy action film like the next guy and was genuinely looking forward to a mindless 90 minutes of fun. What I actually experienced was self important, overly buff, lord of the rings reject extras spouting some of the worst lines in film history. How Natalie Portman, let alone Stellen Skarsgard, got roped into this I will never know. Repetitive actions scenes, awful editing that cut the middle of conversations and light humour from Thors friends (puke) and the terrible Kat Dennings made for a challenging viewing experience all round. Where Iron Man went so right with its self depricating humour and quick wit Thor has languid scenes, flacid romance and wooden character interaction.<br/><br/>The picture lacks a decent development of storyline and character which is always difficult when introducing a character with a deep backstory but it has been done so well recently with Batman Begins et al. There is a definite smell of studio meddling in the final cut with some scenes jumping all over the place. Loki (Tom Hiddleson) changes from loyal brother/Son to evil traitor with no story or character development. Anthony Hopkins spends most of the film in a coma. Chris Hemsworth can't be to blame for a film which seems over produced, over edited and that was marketed as Return of the King but was more Masters of the Universe. The decision to assign 'Ice Giants' (yes Ice Giants) as 'baddies' falls flat as they are about as scary and menacing as frosty the snowman.<br/><br/>The whole project felt a thin and is so poorly put together you could see it unravel before your eyes. Fingers crossed for a better Summer Blockbuster in the near future..."

","This film was an amalgamation of every ""superhero"" cliché from start to finish. It did absolutely nothing for me or my girlfriend. Seems like a script by committee situation. An artless product by all accounts.<br/><br/>The only redeeming quality was the lead actor. Despite having a strong cast and a respected director, the film delivered Hollywood triteness at its worst.<br/><br/>I'm not sure why Hollywood penguins insist on making products terrible. No matter how many trend data sheets they sift through, a good story is not a sum of popular topics or a mix-and-match of proved techniques. A good story has a voice of its own and this had none. Branagh obviously didn't fight hard enough to get anything valuable here. It shows no effort. As I said, artless.<br/><br/>I only speak so harshly here because in 2011 there's no excuse to spend 150mill and this is your end product."

","Hmmm, Thor where do I begin? I have long since given up the erroneous notion that superhero movies should be true to its comic book counterparts. I also have lived long enough to see superhero titles rebooted so often that they bear no r...resemblance to their origins as told in my youth (Jane Foster is an astrophysicist stormchaser?) So, I entered Thor with absolutely no expectations. Good thing, too, because if I had any, they wouldn't have been met. First, I must agree with Sir Anthony Hopkins and state that there is far to much CGI in this film and not enough character development. There were opportunities to delve into characters and their back stories that were simply ignored.<br/><br/>Other problems include: Fight scenes that played out like video game ads, with actors trying to strike the right ""badass"" pose for the cool action shots. Annoyingly silly humor that wore thin quickly. Conflicts that were one-dimensional and built no real suspense. A forced love story. And I understand that even a god of thunder must have a character arc, and Thor's was a common one that I could have overlooked had it been better acted, and yes, better directed.<br/><br/>The whole movie lacked gravitas. Plain and simple.<br/><br/>There are some that have said it's nothing more than a two-hour preview for the upcoming Avengers movie and I can't totally disagree with that. But it is not the worst superhero movie ever made (far from it), it is simply the weakest Avengers prequel movie made to date (and yes, I'm including Iron Man 2 in that category).<br/><br/>Who knows? Check your brain at the door and you might just enjoy this special episode of ""Donald's Creek."""
"bob the moo","Null","33","61","21 September 2011"," Distracting spectacle but disappointingly empty of ideas and full of franchise ""stuff"" (mild SPOILERS)
","I had heard a lot of good things about this film before I eventually saw it. I had decided that I wasn't going to go and pay loads of money to sit in noisy cinemas and be bombarded with disappointing blockbusters this summer, but I figured that this had enough good word of mouth to be worth seeing. After watching it I browsed through the user comments here of writers I generally trust and found that most of them had loved it too; so why did I find it to be all a lot of fuss and nonsense that ultimately amounts to very little?<br/><br/>I came to Thor with some worries despite the good word of mouth, I never cared for the character generally and he always seemed a little silly to me, with the Nordic god dialogue just making it worse. As a result I guess the script could have been worse because it would have been bogged down in this stuff but it never was, however this is not to say that it worked well. What it does is take us from point A to point B without ever really doing a huge amount of interest. It has enough humour in to stop it being too serious, but not enough to actually be light and fun. It has enough character in it to avoid it feeling wooden, but not enough to make one care. It has enough drama in it to set up the action, but not enough to provide actual tension or a sense of danger. To me it didn't seem to do anything in particular. I was looking for more sport to be made of this silly God once he was on earth but it didn't happen. In particular I was looking for Loki to be a more interesting ""baddie"" since he could have been a tragic, haunted character – but we don't see this outside of his actions.<br/><br/>This all came together for me to limit my interest in what was going on. The stuff in the heavens was all too full of mock Shakespearean shouting but without dramatic substance, while the stuff on Earth was too fleeting and lacking fun and entertainment value. For sure the film provides spectacle but again I just found it to be rather hollow as I watched it, enjoying it for the noise but not much else. The cast are varied. Although limited, Hemsworth is well-cast because he has the body and big voice to fill the character. He needed a good opposite number though and in Hiddleston he doesn't have it – he doesn't have the presence needed or the depth of character. Portman has almost nothing to do and it shows in her performance, she is here for the sake of it and you could have digitally removed her from this film and made no difference to it. Ditto Skarsgård– at least Dennings provided some light relief. Hopkins adds a bit of gravitas to proceedings, while Elba has the frame and voice for his character. Like everyone else it surprises me still to think this was directed by Kenneth Branagh, but it is a smart career move for him to show he can do big budget effects movies – if it does nothing else, it shows that.<br/><br/>Thor feels like a film that had to be made rather than one that was created on its own merits. Of course, as part of The Avengers, this is true but it is irritating that you feel that way while watching it. It has noise and spectacle for those looking for that, but it lacks too much in the way of character, danger, humour and good old fashioned entertainment. You know when you buy a new product and the first few days it is shiny and great but then, in using it you spot lots of gaps and think ""why didn't they do this?"" and ""why did they not expand this function?"" – well Thor is that product, shiny and noisy but ultimately one is left wondering why the makers didn't do a lot more in some regards and a lot less in others. Not an awful film – but just a bog-standard one with a massive effects budget."
"pobigs","1","78","158","7 May 2011"," If you've read the comics or at least have a brain, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE
","First of all, after seeing both, I'd recommend you watch this movie in 2D. It is one of the worst comic book adaptations I've ever seen. All the fight scenes happened to fast and you could barely see it if you watch it in 3D, all the female characters are portrayed as useless idiots and if you haven't read the comic book this movie will not make any sense. Just don't waste your money. It has ruined my childhood. The plot was strung together very loosely as well. Don't get me wrong, some of the acting was very good. For example, Anthony Hopkins and Tom Hiddlestone really brought this screen to life when they were given time behind Chris Hemsworth and his horribly cheesy acting. The directors could have done so much better. I guess that's what happens when you sell your soul to Disney (Marvel was sold to Disney). What a shame"
"John_T_Chance","Null","66","132","26 April 2011"," Incredible Action and Fantasy but with a Superb Story! Best in Years!
","Another outstanding effort, Marvel does it again! It's hard to believe that a movie with this subject matter can make you think and challenge all your movie viewing skills but it does so and more. It's very artistic and you would expect no less from Kenneth Branagh. He presents the entire film in a way that can be savored. Many aspects are classical drama and yet other aspects are just plain old fun kick-butt action scenes. It's a perfect blend and this movie is far deeper then I would've thought. The pacing was perfect as is the link to the Marvel movie Universe... I can't wait to see what Captain America brings us. Overall, a summer movie that's superior to everything else that I've seen in years.<br/><br/>The director's background in Shakespearian themes comes in to play right from the beginning of the film and run throughout. Thor is a super-strong ""god"" and can travel through space with supernatural powers yet the story is paradoxical and contrary about those elements instead choosing to focus on the human elements. THAT elevates this film far beyond anything I was expecting but I should have known better considering the source material and the director.<br/><br/>The genuine and relatable qualities of these characters are what make it a great film. Sure, the action and fantasy are incredible but the story works so well. The family dynamics between fathers & sons along with sibling rivalry and the price of vanity and lack of humility all resonate. The choices made and the relationships on display are as wonderful as the brawling and action... which are as good as any summer movie that I've seen in years."

I admit I went to the movie thinking ""Why did they not cast that viking from 13th Warrior?"", ""Why are they going for the cute guy instead of making Thor really scary and north like?!"". The reason: Hollywood is getting stupider with every film. No more suspense, no more nothing. Money, money, money.... See this movie once and then never again. The acting is awful, Natalie Portman is done making good movies and I feel so bad that Anthony Hopkins really involved his name in this movie.

The acting was good, Hemsworth was perfect for the role, just as I have pictured Thor to be. And the movie had a lot of humor as well as action. I liked the switch between Asgaard and our world, it gave the portrait of the gods a twist and some humor. And I loved Thor with the hammer in the action scenes - that is some power to have.<br/><br/>This might not be a movie that will haunt your mind, but for the purpose I went to watch it - pure entertainment - it was perfect.

","When I heard they were making a movie of the character Thor I had serious trepidations. When I heard that Kenneth Branagh was directing it I had even more trepidation not due to the fact that it was Branagh but the fact that all he's ever directed was drama's.<br/><br/>Going into the theater I very low expectations from this film and man was I blown away. I like the fact that Branagh didn't approach the story as a super-hero film but more of a Shakespearing epic. The fantasy elements alone were marvelous.<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins IS Odin...I cannot imaging another actor portraying him. His performance as Odin captures the essence of the character and the delicate balance of ruler verses father. He exudes power with subtle touches of vulnerability.<br/><br/>Chris Hemsworth is outstanding as Thor. He's got such a likability about him that even at Thor's most arrogant point in the story you can see how his friends stand by him. His performance is rock solid and extremely enjoyable. <br/><br/>Tom Hiddleston is THE perfect Loki. He's captured the sleazy, slimy, be nice to your face but looking for a place to drive the knife in your back nature of the character.<br/><br/>As I had stated earlier the story plays out as more of a fantasy epic than a dyed in the wool super-hero story. The journey into Jotenheim was stunning and Asgard itself was just beautiful to behold. The set designs were excellent. The humor in the film was very organic and never seemed forced. The story itself was very well balanced and didn't leave you wondering what the heck was going on. I almost wish they'd have kept it separate from the upcoming Marvel films. It works very well as a stand alone epic.<br/><br/>The effect's that I was expecting to be sub-standard were in fact top notch and even Thors trademark spinning hammer from the comics didn't look as cheesy as it could have. <br/><br/>This movie is a gem. All parties involved should be proud of themselves for bringing such a great piece of work to the screen. I for one cannot wait to see a sequel to this film. With any luck we'll see some of the other nine realms such as Muspelheim, Alfheim or even Vanaheim.<br/><br/>This is definitely a MUST SEE film"

","Alright, back when this was into preproduction, I (and so many comic book fans) were surprised when Branagh was slated to direct. Here we have Thor the god of lightning and his mighty hammer, directed by a man who works mostly around William Shakespeare plays.<br/><br/>Thankfully, this helps. A lot.<br/><br/>Almost every superhero movie (Marvel, lately) focuses on more action instead of character development. Sure, they may look awesome, but you get used to it. Branagh bravely steers away from this predicament and directs the actors with such skill and flair you may mistake this film for yet another Branagh/Shakespeare costume epic.<br/><br/>Make no mistake this is still a superhero film, with some nice special effects and a stylish production design for Asgard, but there's a nice human twist to the story - that of dueling brothers, or gods, or god- brothers... you get the idea. Chris Hemsworth looks just about right for the part and shows some charisma as well as the hero. Branagh has assembled an interesting mix of actors - we have the great Anthony Hopkins, the cute Natalie Portman, Stellan Skarsgard, Kat Dennings, Idris Elba and even Rene Russo. Tom Hiddleston however steals the scene as the mischievous brother Loki.<br/><br/>Here's another good thing about the movie - the story and acting outweigh the special effects and action sequences. For a superhero film, this is extremely rare. Branagh deserves kudos for the effort, however some parts do not gel in nicely and there's some action bits that are not too well-filmed.<br/><br/>All is forgiven though - ""Thor"" is an above-average superhero movie, not extremely exciting, but definitely intriguing. Fans of both comic book films and costume dramas will certainly enjoy this.<br/><br/>Two words of caution - one, keep an eye out for some cameos, both during and after the film. Two, for goodness sake do not watch it in 3D. I saw it in normal 2D and that's fine enough by me. I didn't see anything worth watching in 3D in it.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 68/100"

They take their source of power and bring it to Asgard and they start an armistice with Jotunheim. <br/><br/>When three Frost Giants break in Asgard trying to retrieve their source of power, they are destroyed by the Destroyer. The arrogant Thor (Chris Hemsworth) decides to attack Jotunheim with his stepbrother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and four Asgardian warriors and disobeys the order of his father Odin. In order to avoid war against Jotunheim, Odin removes the powers of Thor and exiles him on Earth to live among the humans. Odin also throws his hammer Mjölnir to New Mexico and orders that only the one that is worth will get the powerful hammer and achieve Thor's powers. <br/><br/>In Puente Antigo, New Mexico, the physician Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) is researching a phenomenon in the desert with her professor Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård) and her mate Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings). Out of the blue, Thor is hit by Jane's truck and she takes him to the hospital. Thor unsuccessfully tries to retrieve Mjölnir that is protected by agents of the government SHIELD. When the Machiavellian Loki sends the Destroyer to Earth to kill Thor, he needs to retrieve his hammer to save not only the humans, but also his Allfather Odin and Asgard from the evil Loki.<br/><br/>""Thor"" is an entertaining adventure based on the character of the comic book published by Marvel Comics. Natalie Portman is usually the synonym of a good movie and she is delightful in the role of a scientist. The plot is funny and the scenes with the human Thor; the Nordic black gatekeeper Heimdall (Idris Elba); and the Vikings and Gods speaking in English are hilarious.

"TheUnseenMovieLover","9","22","39","26 April 2011"," A movie worthy of Thor!
","Wow. That was the first thing I thought after seeing Thor. I'd read the strong reviews, I loved the choice of Kenneth Branagh as director and the trailers looked great. But I still wasn't prepared for how satisfying this movie would be. This is the very definition of epic, and I LOVED it.<br/><br/>Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is a God of Norse mythology, son of Odin (Anthony Hopkins) and brother of Loki (Tom Hiddleston). When Thor disobeys his father and sparks an ancient war with the Frost Giants, Odin banishes him from the realm of Asgard and casts him down to Earth. With the help of a trio of humans (including Natalie Portman's Jane), Thor struggles to fit in on Earth whilst looking for a way to return to Asgard. Meanwhile, the devious Loki plots for his father's throne<br/><br/>Simply put, Thor is the best superhero movie since The Dark Knight. The idea of Norse gods and warriors who dress, sound and look like pompous Vikings (some of whom interact with modern humans), multiple universes, rainbow bridges and Frost Giants must have seemed pretty hard to pull off without being silly, especially when this hero eventually has to meet with more ""realistic"" superheroes such as Iron Man, Hulk and Captain America in next year's The Avengers movie. But Branagh has taken something potentially camp and cheesy and turned it into a powerful, strangely relatable story; there are quite a few Shakespearian elements in Thor's story, something which Branagh is an undeniable master at adapting to the screen. Plus, Branagh and the screenwriters also inject a much-needed humour into the proceedings without unbalancing the emotion and surprising seriousness of the story. The most impressive thing about Thor is the way it treads a pitch-perfect line between respecting the material and winking at its audience knowingly (most notably with a certain cameo). In that way, it's reminiscent of The Mask of Zorro, never taking itself too seriously whilst never allowing itself to slip into parody. <br/><br/>Branagh also proves to be a master at creating an epic summer blockbuster. Apart from a few dodgy moments, the visual effects are stunning; in fact, this is probably the most visually impressive film I have seen from Marvel thus far. The production design is also beautiful; Asgard is one of the most incredible movie landscapes I have ever seen. My eyes were stretched to breaking point, trying to drink in all the details of this new, exciting and opulent world. There are some moments which look a bit fake (which is annoying when the filmmakers had about $150 million to work with), but it's almost forgivable based on how spectacular the majority of the visual FX shots are. Credit must go to the FX and art direction departments. <br/><br/>But a summer blockbuster wouldn't be a summer blockbuster without action, and Thor delivers some great sequences. The early encounters with the Frost Giants (genuinely frightening creatures) are superb, with Thor and his friends using some pretty bad-ass moves. A later scene where Thor fights to retrieve his mystical hammer, Mjolnir, is gritty and intense, whilst another great set-piece sees the metallic being known as The Destroyer hunting Thor and destroying most of a desert town in the process. I have heard that many people consider the final confrontation to be anti-climactic, but I have to say that it isn't as much about seeing epic action is it is about seeing how the main characters have grown and changed throughout the course of the film. In a way, I think that displays the film's greatest strength. It isn't all about the action and the visual effects; it's more about the characters and the emotional response.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, the cast is exceptional. No pay cheque grabbing here; every cast member dives into their role headfirst. Let's start with the big guy himself, Thor. Hemsworth is best known for his brilliant, five- minute appearance as Kirk Sr. in 2009's Star Trek; to go from that to the lead in arguably one of Marvel's most risky undertakings could be seen as a huge step. You wouldn't know it from watching Hemsworth's performance, though. He is absolutely perfect in the role, charting Thor's journey from an impetuous fighter to a more understanding, wiser man with ease. Comedy, action, drama, romance; all encompassed perfectly in Hemsworth's performance. He deserves to achieve stardom after this, and I'm really looking forward to seeing how he fits into The Avengers. Natalie Portman is charming and charismatic as Jane; the scenes between her and Hemsworth ooze chemistry, whilst her scenes with Stellan Skarsgard and Kat Dennings, terrific as Jane's mentor and intern respectively, shine with a wonderful camaraderie. Hiddleston steals the movie whenever he appears as the slithering, manipulative yet oddly sympathetic Loki; this is a wonderfully complex role, and Hiddleston never strikes a wrong note. Hopkins, instead of hamming it up, brings powerful gravitas to Odin; he is intimidating, yet wise and weary from his many years of experience. The scenes between him, Hemsworth and Hiddleston are tremendous, each actor bringing all of their talent to bear and succeeding beyond all expectations. There are too many other names to mention, but rest assured everyone's sublime.<br/><br/>Apart from some minor quibbles, I absolutely loved this movie. Branagh, the cast and crew have succeeded beyond my wildest dreams. This encompasses everything I want from an epic adventure; action, wonder, romance, comedy and a surprising amount of character and intelligence. In my opinion, this is one of Marvel's best, taking something which could have sunk to the lows of Ghost Rider or Elektra and propelling it to the same heights as Spider-Man 1 & 2, X2 and Iron Man. Add a great pre-credits teaser for The Avengers (plus one exciting appearance from a minor member), and I couldn't be more hyped. You're up next, Captain America; don't you dare let the team down."

Never made sense since I was a little kid.<br/><br/>Perhaps I don't like it, because of the effect of deep and well executed stories of movies like Drive and Europa Report, everything on THOR felt like shallow, superficial and boring...<br/><br/>There are 3 worlds in total, one little town in earth, one world of the ice dudes and Asgard (or whatever) - Most of the movie took place in a little (I mean really little) town in USA (perhaps nothing but a movie set). You can see it's ending on high altitude shots and population was perhaps 100 people? Dialogs are meaningless, character interactions are superficial (an ordinary girl of earth fell in love with a handsome ""god"" wow!) story is extremely simple. I'm taking that much simple stories as an insult to my intellect. I think the people hated from Prometheus are probably people who loved THOR, since there's nothing deep and complicated going on, to think about after movie.<br/><br/>These line of characters and stories were good on earlier movies. Iron Man 1 and 2 was good, The Incredible Hulk was really good. But with Thor and Avengers they started to ruin it. Iron Man 3 wasn't different also. Pointless, repetitive, superficial, shallow...<br/><br/>I still didn't see Captain America which has connection to these series of movies because of the Avengers.

","In ""Thor"", I don't think the action is the big deal here while it's a movie from Marvel. Kenneth Branagh is more fond to tell the story, which is a better thing. The changes of the story of ""Thor"" is very fascinating. It's not a generic superhero movie that has a weak man becoming a superhuman then ends with a lot of action mess. It's more of a compelling drama fantasy with a little action and a lot more sense. ""Thor"" has some problems with the action but who cares, it's definitely great & entertaining.<br/><br/>First goes to the performances. Chris Hemsworth hams it up (no pun intended. he really did) although he is quite entertaining. Anthony Hopkins, he made Odin more than what we expect him to do. Tom Hiddleston's portrayal made Loki the best villain in the universe of the Avengers so far.<br/><br/>The action of the first act was pretty good. Plodding at times but when it comes to earth scenes, it's becoming somewhat unexpectedly boring. Kenneth Branagh has problems in making some of the action scenes but he has the heart to tell the story. It's amazing how the changed story and the performance are more mind-blowing than the action since this is a superhero movie. As you expected in a Marvel movie, ""Thor"" is hilarious at times.<br/><br/>While some of the action scenes weren't mind-blowing, The visuals were good. Asgard is beautifully made by the effects and the solid production design. Some of the effects are like video game graphics though. The cinematography has a tilted camera style to make it a better experience to the movie. The score is your standard fantasy music.<br/><br/>""Thor"" is a little disappointing but it's still good because it's compelling. It's not an ordinary superhero movie. It's a drama fantasy movie with true depth. The storytelling made it more interesting. ""Thor"" has more magic than superhero action. It can be one of the best superhero movies although it isn't really loyal to its superhero movie elements. ""Thor"" is pretty unique to its genre and it's a good Kenneth Branagh film."

","The graphics and visuals of the movie were impressive. However as a movie it was no better than a B-movie. Storyline is dull, and something we have seen a million times before.<br/><br/>An untried youth (Thor) who wants to prove his worth, but manages only to invoke the wrath of his elders (odin), he is then cast into banishment where he must prove his worth and make wise decisions in order to prove himself and return to his home.<br/><br/>While this concept may still work, I think the characters are extremely superficial and boring. And furthermore, as a Scandinavian I'm pretty disgusted by the rendition of Asgard and its inhibitors. They have only scratched the surface of the characters (how they originally were described) should behave, and they are in no way as barbaric as they should be.<br/><br/>Also, what the hell is up with the casting?

","WOW! No wonder all the big time critics love this movie (Ebert, Roeper, Joyce Kulhawik. etc) It's amazing! I can't wait to see it again! Two thumbs up from me too! Thor is a magnificent thrill ride that even the most cynical viewer or critic will find something to enjoy. That's why even the jaded or cynical critics wanting to hate on yet ""another comic book film"" can't bring themselves to hate it. Those watching with an open mind will absolutely adore this film. Once seen, it's easy to see why critics are basically in agreement regardless of their previous dispossession.<br/><br/>If you're going to turn a comic book into a movie, do it with utter belief in your story and do it with the best talent and FX possible. That's why Marvel rules the cinema and why they need to get ALL their properties back under their roof. Come on Disney, spend that cash and reunite the Marvel Universe! Avengers will be great but imagine if Spider-Man and Wolverine pop in to join Thor and company in Avengers 4!!!!!! <br/><br/>Yet, Even in an era when an explosion of comic-book properties are hitting the big screen, Thor stands alone. This has little to do with an individual who utilizes special powers and everything to do with your typical Marvel hero. It's the classic Marvel style with a great twist, a hero with flaws and awesome spectacles everywhere you look. You must see this flick!"
"velvoofell","10","28","52","28 April 2011"," A Wagnerian Action Comedy Masterpiece of the genre.
","There is a poignant scene in cult 1980s BBC sitcom 'Red Dwarf' where the super-organised hologram Rimmer talks about why he actually likes his polar opposite Rastafarian, slob, scouse room-mate Lister. He compares him to a hangover-cure ""fried egg and chilli sauce ciabatta sandwich"" Lister has offered. ""All your ingredients are wrong - but somehow it works, somehow you're right!""<br/><br/>The same has to be said for 'Thor'. A giant WWE escapee taking down scientists and CIA men in New Mexico just after having been banished from his monster-infested, operatically armoured home-universe sounds like the worst straight to video Triple-H starrer ever made - but it all somehow, not only comes together, succeeds in throwing more at the screen than many superhero movies could lay claim to.<br/><br/>Marvel's vision and slight tinkering of the Norse Edda, the mythological testament of the vikings, remains. Loki is Thor, not Odin's, half-brother, while Heimdall, usually the janitor of the Gods in mythology books, becomes a noble and stoic guardian of the godly kingdom of Asgard.<br/><br/>Kenneth Branagh resurrects the one thing that was good about his 'Frankenstein' - sweeping camera shots, heated melodrama that evokes the excitement of a children's story as well as the drama of Shakespeare. In fact, Branagh's grounding in the bard means that the plot's interweaving of 'King Lear' in Odin, 'Macbeth' and 'Iago' in Loki's character, of 'Hamlet'-llite in some of Thor's darker ruminations and not a little of 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' s immortal/mortal interpersonal dynamics is deft.<br/><br/>Thrilling and refreshing too is the involvement of monsters, giants and archaic robot menaces as well as real-world threat and suspense in a superhero movie for almost the first time in the cycle of superhero movies since 'X-Men's' rekindling of the genre. Bryan Singer might want to take notes if he ever revisited 'the Man of Steel', while Zach Snyder might do well to notice that human drama need not be sacrificed in the face of a slew of special effects.<br/><br/>There are only a few negatives. Once Thor lands in the desolate New Mexican town and finds friends he just kind of hangs with them there. Moving from place to place may have heightened the thrills in the earthbound sequences. The prosthetics of the Frost giants look off-the-peg creations compared to their giant CGI hell-hound-troll and this may come from two different effects houses handling these respectively.<br/><br/>These are minor quibbles in a movie that blends humour, whimsy and outrageous action with genuine urgency, real world dilemmas and not a little goose-pimpling Shakespearean cinema. Oh, and the brief glimpse of Odin's steed Sleipnir shall have comic-book and mythology fans in a state of complete awe.<br/><br/>This will satisfy everyone who attends it and all that remains to be said is this to the developers of the new 'He-Man' movie: Look at 'Thor' - it can be done."

","Thor has always been one of my personal favorite among mythology. A warrior with a heart of gold, forever tormented by Loki the trickster and magician.

"moviexclusive","9","38","74","29 April 2011"," A thrilling blend of action and drama- with some comedy thrown in for good measure- Marvel's latest superhero addition is perfect summer entertainment
","The Norse god Thor is admittedly one of Marvel's second-league  superheroes, but just like Iron Man, both are inevitable steps in  Marvel's continuing march towards arguably the most highly anticipated  comic book adaptation in movie history next year- ""The Avengers"". Yet,  if there's anything to learn from the ""Iron Man"" experience, it's that  it's entirely possible to turn a B-league superhero into an A-grade  feature film with just the right star and the right director.   And kudos to the Marvel team for doing it once again with ""Thor"", a  thoroughly entertaining blockbuster of a film that succeeds thanks to  the unlikely choices of Kenneth Branagh as director and Chris Hemsworth  as the star of the titular character. Kenneth is the English director  best known as cinema's foremost exponent of the Bard, while Chris is  the Australian actor probably only known as the father to James T. Kirk  in last year's ""Star Trek"". Both are equally unlikely choices to  headline this US$150mil tentpole, though Marvel's gamble has paid off  handsomely.   Unlike Iron Man, Incredible Hulk, or for that matter the upcoming  Captain America who were products of science, Thor was the hammer-  wielding alien-god who was always going to be a tricky proposition  adapting for the big screen. After all, the combination of Norse  mythology and science fiction could easily have degenerated into  kitschy camp, so it's a good thing that Kenneth knows when to get  serious and when to have fun. He films the scenes of Thor in his  homeland Asgard with the utmost gravitas, while leaving the humour for  his brief fish- out-of-water stint on Earth.  Indeed, Kenneth handles the power feuds and sibling rivalry with the  same intensity as he would a Shakespearian production, and brings a  deeply human perspective to his godly characters. In particular, the  tussle between father and sons is emotionally charged- whether Odin's  heartbreak at banishing his son Thor, whom he was about to coronate as  king, out of the kingdom for arrogantly and impetuously reigniting a  war with an ancient enemy; or Loki's confrontation with Odin about his  true origins- and therefore electrifying to watch.   To add weight to the proceedings at Asgard, Kenneth brings in two  excellent character actors alongside Chris- Anthony Hopkins and Tom  Hiddleston. Anthony's patriarchal role isn't new for the actor, but he  delivers a restrained yet powerful and dignified performance as Thor's  father Odin. Tom, on the other hand, is deliciously snarky playing the  sibling jealous of Thor's impending ascension to the throne, and the  British actor gives a surprisingly intimate and affecting villainous  turn that brings unexpected depth to his character.   In contrast to the godly solemnity, Kenneth brings some welcome Earthly  humour to Thor's subsequent banishment. The trio of scriptwriters  Ashley Edward Miller, Zack Stentz and Don Payne (working from an  effective origin story by J. Michael Straczynski and Mark Protosevich)  reserve the movie's wittiest lines for Thor's interplay with three  mortal beings- astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), her  gal-pal/assistant Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings) and Jane's mentor, Dr.  Erik Sevig (Stellan Skarsgard), while Kenneth directs Thor's awkward  adjustment to life on Earth (an absolutely hilarious scene has Thor  storming into a pet store and asking for a horse to go about his  mission to find his mysterious magical hammer Mjolnir) with just the  right amount of infectious fun.  There's also an intercelestial romance thrown in for good measure, as  Thor and Jane develop a growing attraction for each other. But more  than just obligatory, the love between god and human becomes a lesson  in humility and self-sacrifice for the fallen Thor to pave his  restoration back to glory. Though thinly written, Portman makes the  best out of her role, and it is to her credit that Jane becomes an  engaging and believable character that the audience roots for. Portman  also shares a warm chemistry with Chris, which brings poignancy to  their relationship as well as Thor's subsequent transformation.  Thor's time on Earth is also used to forge the necessary narrative  links with ""The Avengers"", in the form of Clark Gregg's S.H.I.E.L.D.  agent Coulson, an unbilled cameo by Jeremy Renner as the archer  Hawkeye, and Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury appearance right at the end  of the credits. Fans of the Thor universe from the comic books will  also delight in the awe-inspiring presence of Heimdall (Idris Elba), as  well as Thor's entourage of Asgard warrior pals Sif (Jaimie Alexander),  Volstagg (Ray Stevenson), Fandral (Josh Dallas), and Hogun (Tadanobu  Asano).   These pals also add colour to the action sequences, which Kenneth  choreographs with surprising aplomb. He stages a thunderous battle very  early on as Thor leads an attack against the Frost Giants on the planet  of Jotunheim with every bit of might and muscle one would expect from a  clash of godly beings. There are at least two other money sequences-  Thor's duel with a hulking piece of metal known as the Destroyer (which  Coulson first tongue-in-cheek mistakes to be one of Stark's equipment)  in a small New Mexico town; and the thrilling climactic battle between  Thor and Loki back on Asgard.   But the star that holds it all together is really Chris Hemsworth, his  performance a well-calibrated blend of brawn and heart that will put  sceptics to rest. His physicality is apparent right from the start, but  Chris gradually reveals a winning charm and a heartfelt sincerity that  enables his audience to relate with his character's inner struggles. It  is a breakout star-making turn, which shows Chris adept at action,  comedy and even romance.   And certainly, it is to Kenneth Branagh's credit that these disparate  elements can belong so comfortably in a movie that also combines  mythology and science fiction. True to its origins, ""Thor"" is nothing  less than superhero entertainment, and a definitive A-list one -despite  the initial regard of its source character- that kicks off this summer  with a bang, boom and rumble."
"k_wallander","10","24","45","30 April 2011"," Oh my god!! Everything I expected, and much more...
","My title really sums up how I perceived this great movie. I just returned home from watching this tonight. And holy cow, Mr. Brannagh really delivered!! When Kenneth Brannagh was announced as Thor's director, I was really expecting something great from the one who directed various Shakespeare adaptations. I've only saw his remake of ""Sleuth"", and despite weak ratings from the critics I really liked that crime flick. I really loved how he handled the characters. Brannagh really knows how to set the stage for clever and suspenseful drama. Furthermore I adore him as an actor (my IMDb nickname says you that).<br/><br/>So as a longtime comic-book fan I was really excited getting to see a visually spectacular and dramatic comic-book adaptation by a skillful director. And boy my expectations were fulfilled. F...... hell, this rocked!! The (first two) X-men and Iron Man movies were always said to be the Marvel Masterpieces when it comes to movie adaptations. Personally I always thought these movies to be entertaining, but not much more. They didn't really deliver an epic feeling. They didn't introduce you to a fantastic world in all it's glorious beauty that wants you to explore it. ""Thor"" just delivers all that. To me ""Thor"" stands as the best Marvel comic-book-movie till now, by far...<br/><br/>First of all, the characters are really likable and portrayed in a realistic way. All character developments don't seem to be forced. The most interesting character is Loki. At the beginning I really felt sympathy for him. It is until a tragic revelation, where his character undergoes a change to a more evil side, but even then some of his behaviors seem to be understandable. The father-son conflict is portrayed brilliantly. Kenneth Brannagh at his best!!<br/><br/>This movie is visually outstanding and some scenes, like for example the prologue, deliver this ""LotR"" feeling that gives you the goosebumps. There are many memorable shots that are purely majestic. When Thor, Sif and the Warriors Three ride on the Bifröst it just shouts ""pure awesomeness"" into your face. Many scenes on Asgard are just spot on. The buildings on Asgard seem to be based on a hybrid of krypton and middle-earthen architecture. The visuals on this world show the advanced, noble and god-like status of the Asgardians. Asgard is depicted as a heavenly and unbelievably beautiful realm in the never-ending depths of the cold space. It provides a subject for speculations, if the Asgardians are indeed gods with magical powers, or if they are extraterrestrial beings with technology far beyond our understandings, but the movie doesn't really discusses this issue and leaves it to the audience to give an opinion in this matter. <br/><br/>What else can be said? The action was exciting. While the frost-giant-battle on Jotunheim was a bit visual overkill and at some parts almost cartoony, the fights on earth were harsh, gritty and bloody. Brannagh really handled the different worlds very well. On earth, humor was predominant, the scenes on Asgard stood out for Shakespearian drama, while Jotunheim delivered a creepy and threatening atmosphere. The CGI-Environments were all breathtaking. There were sequences (Bifröst, Asgard mainly) that really were out of this world. All in all, the visual effects were amazing and god-worthy. The score was magnificent, it perfectly captured the proudness and courage of the Asgardians.<br/><br/>I gave ""Thor"" a 10 out of 10. It surely is on of the best movies of it's kind. I stands up there with ""The Dark Knight"", ""Star Trek"", ""Avatar"" and ""Inception"". It's the perfect Blockbuster."

","in one word Awesome!<br/><br/>I was really curious and excited to see Thor as I love big budget movies and also it's the first time I see Kenneth Branagh directing a movie like this. Normally it's not his style. So I went in and just loved it!. It's so beautiful to look at, at how beautiful they've made Asgaard look. It's not so much a comic book movie but the Thor myth come to life! It's funny, witty, moving ( a few scenes I admit I was crying like when Thor was so happy to have found his hammer but could not lift it and the scene at the end between him and Odin, played by an astounding Anthony Hopkins who IS Odin, and does even a better job than Bob Hoskins. And yes it did remind me of The Mask with Loki etc. This is in my opinion the BEST movie that SIR Kenneth Branagh has ever made and I hope they call on him if ever there's a Thor 2!"
"Enchorde","8","24","47","1 May 2011"," Superhero movie that sets the standard for the genre.
","Being a comic book based movie, Thor comes with a special set of expectations. Good action, a myth based story of heroes, high level of special effects, and some quick one-liners. Thor meets and in my opinion surpasses all these expectations.<br/><br/>Actually, Thor, is a really good, entertaining movie. It is two hour pure entertainment, handled skillfully by Kenneth Branagh. That gives the best of two worlds, the supernatural story combined with the touch by acclaimed director and actor Branagh.<br/><br/>But Branagh has had good help on this one. Especially the effect makers has had great success. I loved how they portrayed Asgard, and they handled all the effects very well. Apart from being entertaining, Thor is also impressive and surprisingly rather beautiful. The casting department also has made a great job. Combining solid veteran actors as Hopkins, Portman and Skarsgård with virtual newcomers as Hemsworth and Dallas. Hemsworth is well casted as Thor, having both the right physique, looks and talent to deliver such a role. Hiddleston as Loki was a good choice as well. But the gem among the characters, and a personal favorite must be Idris Elba as Heimdall.<br/><br/>Well, the main thing anyhow is that Thor is an action filled movie spiced up with some good humor. It had both thrilling fights and good laughs. And it stood upon a good story as framework. As I said above, it was entertaining all the way.<br/><br/>I like the tie-ins with the other superhero movies released and look forward to seeing the Avengers, but I also hope that Thor itself might get a sequel. They certainly laid the ground work for one.<br/><br/>8/10"
"davish_wulf-1","8","25","50","2 May 2011"," wonderful surprise
","I must be honest, my hopes for this movie were very low. The trailer wasn't very appealing and to capture Thor's comic magic was quite a challenge. Gladly i was mistaken, the movie is a great introduction to the asgardian hero and i was kept entertained from beginning to the end.<br/><br/>Balanced action that moves back and forward between Asgard and Midgard. Sadly 3D doesn't make the movie better, on the contrary. I sincerely hope 3D is reserved for pure animation movies... that's right... leave ""pure"" cinema alone.<br/><br/>Chris Hemsworth played the perfect Thor (after being bitten by zillions of steroid ""bees"" to bulk up for the part)<br/><br/>Hopkins plays Odin very well, wise, mysterious and powerful like the god of gods should be.<br/><br/>Was impressed with Tom Hiddleston has Loki, moving from a friendly innocent role to a mischievous, dark character (just like it was in the norse Myths).<br/><br/>Portman did her part, strangely looking very young compared to some other roles, but Chris/Tom lead the play here.<br/><br/>Using a color actor for Heimdall (Idris Elba) was a very odd move, considering we're talking about norse gods. Surprisingly it worked very well, since Heimdall is the guardian of Bitfrost and he messes up with magic portals, the dark skin gives him that arcane-wise looks.<br/><br/>Can't say the same about the Asian actor (Asano) who is COMPLETELY out of place here, with his strange accent and looks... one of the reasons i don't give 10 out of 10. Actually, i find Thor's friends (apart from Loki) a bit of the ""weird bunch"", lacking charisma and presence in the movie (and with the Asian guy, lacking on the norse department).<br/><br/>Asgard was well portrayed, CGI all the way... but comparing with the comics, Asgard is a very stylish version of a norse ""olympium"".<br/><br/>Action sequences were great and so was the humor. Many times i found myself laughing my behind off to some viking style behavior.<br/><br/>Don't want to spoil it for you, but if you know the comics style, you will actually feel like inside them sometimes, with all that cosmic atmosphere around the fight sequences - colorful, mysterious, out of this world.<br/><br/>The only last fault i can mention was me wanting for more... and isn't that a good thing for a first movie?<br/><br/>Bring on Thor 2!!!

"estebangonzalez10","8","16","30","2 May 2011"," Thor Continues to Build Up the Momentum for The Avengers
","¨Whoever wields this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.¨ With Thor, summer movies have officially started in Hollywood. It's not one of my favorite seasons of the year for films, but if the rest of the movies can live up to what Kenneth Branagh has accomplished with Thor it will be an exciting and entertaining season at the movies. I wasn't a huge fan of Thor before this movie came out, I wasn't even expecting too much out of it, but I decided to go see it because he's still one of The Avengers and I couldn't miss out on all the propaganda that began with Iron Man. With each one of these films my expectations for The Avengers is rapidly building, and even Thor managed to win me over to his side. The first thing I can say about the movie is that it was entertaining enough for me to want to go see it twice in two days. The story, the visuals, the strong performance from two relatively unknown actors like Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston are all factors that contribute to making this movie successful. Include Natalie Portman and Anthony Hopkins into the mix and you have an even better film. The directing had a lot to do with it as well because Kenneth Branagh is a serious and dedicated director; he has proved it time after time with his adaptations of Shakespearean plays. He was dedicated with this project as well; adapted this Marvel comic superhero and prepared him for the big screen. Like most every Marvel character, they are very well developed and the film is no exception remaining true to the comic.<br/><br/>Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is the son of Odin (Anthony Hopkins) the god of Asgard. He is a great warrior and his father has been preparing him to be the future King of Asgard. It is no easy task because Asgardians are the keepers of the peace in all nine realms (Earth being one of those realms). They can travel from one realm to another through the Forest which is guarded by Heimdall (Idris Elba). Odin saved Earth from extinction many centuries ago when the Frost Giants tried to destroy the planet. Odin defeated them and took away their power so they could no longer leave their planet, Jotunheimr. Odin has kept the peace during all these years but now it's time to proclaim Thor as his heir to the throne. On the day of his proclamation something unexpected occurs and three Frost Giants manage to enter Asgard and almost steal the cube which holds their power. However The Destroyer does his job and kills the invaders before they can do any harm. Thor is furious and wants to give the Giants a lesson, but Odin wants to maintain peace and orders Thor to remain in Asgard. Against his father's command Thor travels to Jotunheimr with his younger brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the 3 warriors: Volstagg, Hogun, and Fandral, and Sif (Jaime Alexander). Together they face the Giants who tell them there is a traitor in Asgard. Odin discovers that Thor disobeyed his command, rescues the warriors from the Frost Giants but vanishes Thor to Earth without his supernatural powers. In Earth Thor meets a group of scientists: Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard), Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), and Darcy (Kat Dennings) who help him rediscover his path.<br/><br/>I can imagine how difficult it was to try to make a serious movie out of all this Norse mythology about the nine realms and so on, but Branagh pulls it off by combining humor with the story. For instance when the three warriors come to Earth to find Thor, the unbelievable situation is toned down with a lot of humor. The same can be said with the Destroyer when he arrives at Earth to try to destroy Thor. When the SHIELD agents first see this metal giant they believe it could be one of Stark's creations. So whenever the plot seems to be getting ridiculous, the tone of the film is cooled down with a lot of humor. The funniest character is Darcy who with clever one-liners manages to steal most laughs. I liked Kat Dennings in Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist, but here once more she proves she is a talented actress. The true stars of the film however are Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston. Hemsworth plays Thor to perfection, and Hiddleston is excellent as Loki. The scene where he realizes his true identity is perhaps one of the most dramatic and best acted sequences in the movie. I know we are being bombarded with a lot of superhero movies, but as long as they keep on making them this entertaining I have no problem with that. Thor is no Dark Knight, or even Iron Man for that matter, but it still is a very good film. I will end my review by quoting my six year old brother's words after the movie ended: ¨I don't want to have an Iron Man party for my birthday anymore. I want it to be Thor!¨ http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
"Chalice_Of_Evil","9","23","46","21 April 2011"," This movie - I like it! Another! *smashes movie to the ground*...
","I've never read a Thor comic book, nor was I really following this movie's progression until a trailer came out. The first trailer wasn't great, but the second looked promising. I'm happy to report this film sets the bar fairly high for the rest of the comic book movies due out later in the year.<br/><br/>The story is interesting without being overly convoluted. It starts in an unlikely spot, where we meet Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), who - along with Darcy and Erik - hits Thor (Chris Hemsworth) with her car (and more than once, as the film goes on). He's been cast out of Asgard for going against the wishes of his father, Odin (Anthony Hopkins), and picking fights with the Frost Giants. Meanwhile, his devious brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is plotting against him - Odin really should have seen this coming, as having two sons and telling them that only *one* can be King never ends well in these sorts of situations, does it? <br/><br/>Aussie actor Chris Hemsworth embodies the character of Thor exceptionally. Not only does he more than meet the physical requirements, he also displays a comedic side whilst also being able to sell the more serious/dramatic moments. He's very likable in the role. Natalie Portman's Jane Foster actually isn't as dull as one might expect (given the typical 'love interest' roles that have come before in other comic book movies). Jane has a sense of humour/lighter side than most, thankfully not being dead serious all the time. She's ably supported by Stellan Skårsgard (this is the first time I've liked him in a role) and Kat Dennings (who steals every scene she's in as Darcy). While it would have been easy for the scenes set on Earth to feel slower and more boring than those set in Asgard, it's these three human characters and their interaction with Thor that keeps their scenes entertaining/interesting. There is much humour to be found in the fish-out-of-water situation that Thor finds himself in. The relationship that develops between him and Jane isn't over-done, thankfully, and where we leave the two of them at the end of the film might not be quite where you expect.<br/><br/>Thor's allies back on Asgard prove interesting as well. His friends - referred to at one point as ""Xena, Jackie Chan and Robin Hood"" (not to mention a guy who looks like a taller version of Gimli from LOTR) aren't just one-dimensional characters. They're actually developed well and you grow to like them (I especially liked the scene where they found Thor on Earth and reunited with him) - so much so that you actually care if they're killed by a big metal energy beam-shooting Destroyer (the noisiest damn thing I've heard at the cinema in a while). Anthony Hopkins commands attention every time he's on screen as Odin. Although he spends most of the movie out of action. Loki, meanwhile, is an okay villain, but apart from the occasional shout-y mouth movements, I didn't find Tom Hiddleston to be that memorable. I think his helmet left a bigger impression than he did.<br/><br/>What the film excels at is the visuals. Asgard is truly a wonder to behold - there's a rainbow bridge, the city looks like a big golden pipe organ, and the way they travel to Earth is really something. Then there's the fights Thor gets into. Everything from fearsome battles with Frost Giants on Asgard, to rough and tumble fights in the mud with humans on Earth, to taking on that Destroyer, and finally his inevitable fight against Loki at the end. The film certainly has no shortage of fight scenes, each one different from the last and well-done. And when Thor uses his mighty hammer, Mjolnir (best. weapon. EVER.), it's quite a sight to behold.<br/><br/>Kenneth Branagh's direction is a large part of what makes this film so good (even if he tends to be a bit too fond of tilted angle shots). The costumes look great, and the movie manages to make them - as well as the Frost Giants - not be laughable in appearance. Apart from the look of the film, what also helps make it feel epic is the score. The music adds SO much and is very memorable (along with a rockin' end credits song). Speaking of the end credits, as with previous comic book movies, make sure you stay until the very end, as there's an extra scene.<br/><br/>For a film I hadn't given much thought to, I was very surprised to find myself thoroughly enjoying Thor. It's a comic book movie that stands out from a lot that have come before, and is a genuinely entertaining movie on all accounts. Green Lantern and Captain America have their work cut out for them, matching Thor for sheer entertainment value when they are released later this year. As you might expect, the film leaves room open for a sequel, as well as promising that Thor will return in The Avengers, and I for one can't wait to see more of ol' Blondebeard."

","This movie pretty much sums up everything I hate about Hollywood movies. After 30 minutes of watching I still have almost no feel for the characters but rather have sat through tons of boring over the top CGI action scenes that are devoid of any tension because I don't give a damn about the characters. This is one of the most cliché ""someone from a different time/world/realm comes to modern day earth"" movies I have seen and to make matters worse they (the film-makers) insist that it's funny! What a great use of 150 million dollars! Fu@k the poor starving nations, we gotta have more and more expensive movies! Censor the net, do whatever you want Hollywood just keep us entertained with more of your pornography!"
"szigetimg","1","13","24","17 September 2011"," fell into coma during this movie
","Similarly to Sir Anthony Hopkins, I spent almost all the 120 minutes in coma. Digital editing is so cheap, I have no idea how they managed to attract actual actors to a movie that may scare the hell out of children below the age of 4, but would clearly be a laughing stock to anyone above that age. The actor who makes a poor attempt to 'play' his role must be attractive to people with a room temperature IQ. Really funny stuff include his huge shiny hammer of a dumb name and all his friends of no character. There is no story development of any kind. Believe it or not, this is not the worst movie of the year, but the worst I have ever seen."
"therockdemon","9","19","38","25 April 2011"," a great film that sets the bar for the summer season very high
","i went in to this film very excited not just about what it setting up (the avengers) but because it is the start of the summer action season that has two other big comic book based movies (captain America and green lantern) and i am very happy to say that it did not disappoint, it felt very close to iron man in tone and pacing but lacked iron mans humour but that is a good thing because if it was trying to make you laugh at every line then you wouldn't believe the beautiful scenery in Asgard could mix in with the plain desert town that the rest of the film is set in, a special mention has to go to Kenneth Branagh and the writers for making the female characters so realistic and strong people not just the normal stereotypical female roles. PS stay after the credits it is worth it just me."

"adrianaling","10","2","2","6 March 2018"," Loved This Movie
","Thor is one of my favorite Marvel movies. The characters were fun and the world building was fantastic. I was so excited to see the visual effects that brought Asgard to life. Chris Hemsworth really is the perfect Thor and Tom Hiddleston is perfect for Loki. The only actor that fell short was Natalie Portman. Her acting was very bland and for a top-billed actress she should have put more effort into the character of Jane Foster. It seems that she had become so unlikable that she was written off during Thor: Ragnarok. <br/><br/>Thor is the best character in the whole Avengers roster and seeing him on the big screen was a real treat. The plot was a simple hero's journey but the growth and action has made this film even more enjoyable with each viewing. My favorite scene was the battle on Jotunheim because of how great the effects were and the choreography of the fight scenes. It did not feel like they were just actors playing near a green screen. Thor was the first Marvel film to succeed in creating dynamic new worlds that felt as real as the action scenes in New Mexico.<br/><br/>Kenneth Branagh and Kevin Fiege brought a lot of comedic and memorable moments that are still referenced in other movies and shows. Truly this has become one of the most iconic films in the past decade and has ushered in the impressive Marvel Cinematic Universe."
"mitchell5954","8","2","2","11 November 2017"," Very Underrated MCU Film.
","Thor is the fourth superhero film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. People are somewhat mixed on the film. Some love it, while others do not care for it. I personally really enjoyed this film. I thought Chris Hemsworth was the perfect choice to play for like Robert Downey Jr. was the perfect choice for Iron Man. Anthony Hopkins is brilliant like always. Natalie Portman also gives a great performance. The villain is a very cunning and very sympathetic villain. The effects are amazing and the action scenes are awesome.<br/><br/>The story is quite simple. Long ago Asghard, led by Odin (Anthony Hopkins) fought an enemy known as the Frost Giants. Asghard won the war. Years later Frost Giants invade Asghard but are thwarted by Odin. Our hero Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and his friends including his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) invade the Frost Giant homeland and pretty much start another war. For his actions Odin banishes Thor to Earth in order to become a more mature person. There he meets a girl named Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her family and because of them gradually grows as a person. Then the main villain Loki sends forces to Earth to kill Thor he needs to regain his powers and defeat him.<br/><br/>The story is basically a coming of age story. The story is generic, but sometimes generic works. I for one got invested into the Thor character and enjoyed following him on his journey. The character of Thor is very arrogant and quick to anger in the beginning but not to the point where you do not like him. As the film goes on he becomes more mature and humble and you really believe it.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman does a good job here as well. Natalie Portman, in the last five years has truly proved herself as a great actress. She was given a bad name for the longest thanks to the Star Wars prequels. She was pretty bad in those movies, but that was more George Lucas's direction than anything. People say that the stuff on Earth was fairly boring, but it was necessary. The stuff on Earth is there to make Thor grow as a character. Natalie's character was definitely necessary in that. I do agree, however, that the scenes on Earth could have been a bit shorter.<br/><br/>The villain Loki is also great. Of all the villains in these Marvel movies in this universe, I think that Loki is the best one, at least in this movie. He is made into more of a generic bad guy in the Avengers, but here you really buy his motivations. You find out that he is actually the son of Asghard's enemy. Plus, Odin always held Thor in higher regard than him and he wanted to prove himself. You do not condone what he does but you see where he is coming from.<br/><br/>The effects of this film are great. Though I don't mind the Earth scenes for the most part, I just love when they are in Asghard or in the Frost Giant realm. The CGI is simple beautiful. The action scenes are also great particularly the one where Thor and his friends fight the Frost Giants in their realm in the beginning of the film. I did not see the film in 3D so I cannot comment on that.<br/><br/>Overall, Thor is a good coming of age story. Before this movie came out I would have never thought that Thor could work in live action. However, this film and the Avengers definitely proved me wrong. If you are a fan of the Thor comics or are just a fan of the MCU them definitely check this out."
"Screen_Blitz","8","2","2","2 November 2017"," For what Kenneth Branaugh accomplishes, Thor is a satisfying Marvel superhero tale of epic proportions
","Thor is an excitement-filled action adventure that competently puts the God of Thunder on the pedestal with flashy visual scope serving a warm welcome for another Marvel comics entry. Taking the director's chair is Kenneth Branaugh who takes the spirit of the titular hero and slaps it on screen with endearing charisma, and the results shine, though not in a way that breaths game-changer. As opposed to many heroes of the Avengers team, Thor is not your typical modern day hero. This hammer-wielding god combines average superhero elements and clashes them with the fantasy-esque world that bears reminiscence to Greek mythology. He is an inhabitant of a mystical world of unnatural wonders outside of Earth, and serves as the center of the story that draws small parallels to William Shakespeare's 'Hamlet'. In some context, it is an superhero origin story that almost falls in the category of an epic, though perhaps that classification would be rooting too deep. This film is takes us in the distant world of Asgard, ruled by the mighty king Odin (played by Anthony Hopkins). Under his wing are his two sons Thor (played by Chris Hemsworth) and Loki (played by Tom Hiddleston). As Odin prepares to crown the former as king, the realm becomes threatened by evil Frost Giants. Determined to protect his home, Thor goes against his father's orders and sets out to find against the evildoers. When his actions heightens a war between Asgard and the giants, Odin strips Thor of his powers and exiles him to Earth where he is forced to enlist the help of scientists Eric Slevig (played by Stellan Skarsgard) and Jane Foster (played by Natalie Portman) and their intern Darcy Lewis (played by Kat Denning) to help regain his powers. Meanwhile, back on Asgard, Loki, jealous by his father's initial plans to choose Thor over him as the new ruler, hatches an evil plan of his own. <br/><br/>Kenneth Branaugh crafts a refreshing picture of the titular Marvel comics star with solid precision, and from start to finish, never takes telling a compelling story for granted. The premise introduces the world of Asgard, warmed with dazzling CGI, and the characters very effectively, and once everyone steps into the action, the results pay off. The first special effects-laden sequence featuring Thor, Loki, and their fellow warriors battling against the Frost Giants not only satisfy with their effects glaze, but energetically set the story in motion following Thor's banishment from the home realm. His quest to regain his strength to fight against the evil that has threatened his home holds the most meant, but also lies a few of the narrative flaws. The story feels a bit rushed at times to the point where you hold the feeling that a half-hour of more runtime could have been more necessary to add more gravity to the plot. Nonetheless, the best thing to say that is that with the script, written by a team of three writers, keeps things rolling without spending too much time sketching out connections with the Marvel Cinematic Universe beyond SHIELD Agent Coulson, played by Clark Gregg, making a sweet appearance as a supporting figure. Chris Hemsworth proves to be the satisfying choice for the titular role, playing his character of humanity and clever sense of humor. His romantic chemistry with Natalie Portman is a bit weak, but perhaps less important to her characterization. English actor Tom Hiddleston on the other hand, submits arguably one of the most appealing villainous performances ever brought to the superhero realm, operating his role with both menace and darkly rooted charisma. <br/><br/>Thor is a fun picture for both fans and a little bit of non-fans of Marvel Comics. Kenneth Branaugh crafts a warmly entertaining thrill ride that nicely meets the bar of summer superhero movies. For the filmmaker accomplishes, there is plenty to be offered in this solid rendition of its titular hero, though nothing destined to blow many other superhero entries out of the water. In conclusion, it fits the bill."
"jhudson-11704","8","2","2","27 July 2017"," Whosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.
","Marvel's leap into the cosmos started off with a good movie, not great, but still a good movie. The look of Asgard and it's citizens was incredible as it looks well designed, mystic and huge. This movie brought us a great hero that must prove himself to be worthy of his name and a villain that proves to be one of the best in superhero movie history.<br/><br/>Chris Hemsworth's Thor is strong, brave, naive and yet still able to change into a better person. I must give credit to Hemsworth for getting into such shape that he totally looks like a Norse warrior god but he wasn't the star of this film. That honor goes to Tom Hiddleston's Loki. Hiddleston shows so much emotion in his acting and I actually was rooting for him for most in this movie because all he wanted was for his ""father"", Odin, to look at him as an equal to Thor. Once he discovers the true lineage of himself, Loki becomes even greater as someone who just wants to know where he fits into the world. In the end, he is such a great villain that it is clear that he is going to be around forever because of his instant appeal and success.<br/><br/>The appearance of Asgard and it's citizens were incredible and medieval in some way, however, it is a shame that a lot of the movie takes place on Earth, thankfully though, not in a big city. That might of just been for budget constraints but it was possibly just help fortify Thor's journey to humility. <br/><br/>The side characters were split for me though. The Asgardians, specifically Volstagg, Odin and Sif, interested me enough, however, the others didn't leave a lasting impression. The Earth characters though were definitely worse. While I did like Coulson and Selvig, Jane and Darcy weren't interesting at all. Jane was just a typical romantic lead where I couldn't see much chemistry between Thor and Jane. Jane's giggling over Thor was pretty infuriating. That and I don't really buy Natalie Portman as a physicist. She's a good actress, but she couldn't persuade me that she was a scientist. And Darcy was nothing but the annoying ""comic relief"".<br/><br/>Also, hi Hawkeye, nice to see you there for the 2ish minutes you were on screen.<br/><br/>+ Hiddleston and Hemsworth + Asgardian aesthetic + Some of the characters (Coulson, Selvig, Sif, Odin, Volstagg) - Others really didn't match up so well - Would have preferred more time off Earth as it is Marvel's first step into the cosmos<br/><br/>Final Score: 8.1/10"
"hottchillipeppers","10","2","2","30 April 2017"," The best MARVEL ever created!
","This movie is amazing! The perfect mix between hilariousness and seriousness, this is a MUST watch! I love the way MARVEL incorporated Mythology with modern times. Chris Hemsworth's outstanding performance will catch the eyes of every audience. Alongside with Tom Hiddleston, who's skill in planning Loki could not be outmatched by any other actor. What I love about this film is that it is not the usual American superhero movie, it has a relaxing feel to it, a sense of an English production, something that you cannot find in many movies these days. The story is put together in a lovely way, and Natalie Portman's Jane is played with significance. Darcy is always there to brighten the day, and the link with avengers is intriguing beyond doubt. I often wonder–with the new Thor Ragnarok looking bad, will MARVEL ever be able to capture the quality of this movie ever again."
"NORTHPOINTMJM","Null","11","20","14 June 2011"," Agree With the Critics... GREAT Film!
","Now everyone can see why they cast Hemsworth. He's perfect because he certainly fits the part physically but, more importantly, he's able to play Thor both as a mighty pompous loose canon as well as being a big lovable ""god out of water"" unable to adjust to human ways. Both are absolutely crucial to the character winning audiences over, especially those who may not be familiar with the character from comics. Hemsworth and the script does this with style. I also love the texture of this film. Example: The power struggle within Asgard between Thor and his brother and Thor and his father, Odin. It feels very relatable and very passionate. Their passion and rivalry was something anyone can absolutely relate to in their own lives.<br/><br/>No wonder all the big time critics love this movie (Travers, Roeper, Joyce, Maltese, etc) It's amazing! I can't wait to see it again! Thor is a magnificent thrill ride that even the most cynical viewer or critic will realize delivers a fantastic and fantastical reason to make the trip to the cinema. That's why even the jaded or cynical critics wanting to hate on yet ""another comic book film"" can't bring themselves to hate it. Those watching with an open mind will absolutely adore this film. Once seen, it's easy to see why critics are basically in agreement regardless of their previous dispossession. As good of a summer movie that's been released in years."
"lekgolah","8","17","34","2 May 2011"," This film, I like it. Another!
","With The Avengers in the horizon, there is reason to doubt whether this will be Iron Man or Iron Man 2 where its development was rushed so that Stark would be ready to team up with the likes of Hawkeye and Hulk. However through Kenneth Branagh's directing he is successful in making an enjoyable action film about the God of thunder.<br/><br/>In an interview Kenneth Branagh said that Thor is similar to Shakespeare because of the family conflicts. The script itself may not be Shakespeare but you can draw some similarities. It is in these moments of conflict between father (Antony Hopkins) and son (Chris Hemsworth) where the film shines. While the filmmakers did their best to make the Earth scenes interesting, they do not hold up well to the scenes on Thor's home planet.<br/><br/>Thor is a visually spectacular film with amazing CGI. Some say that it is becoming over used in films today but this film uses it with care. There are no moments where the CGI would drop below par. Like the film it remains consistent throughout.<br/><br/>The acting that includes many recognisable faces, is very good. Chris Hemsworth as Thor handles the character well as does his brother in the film played by Tom Hiddleston. Anthony Hopkins and Idris Elba are also really good. Natalie Portman, while also good, is never given any dialogue to help project herself above romantic interest sadly.<br/><br/>While you might not really care for the romantic sub-plot until the end, the film packs a punch, delivering solid action sequences. Unlike Iron Man 2, this left me interested in seeing what happens next in The Avengers."

"Eternality","9","14","27","29 April 2011"," Thor, under the hands of Branagh, is an excellent example of how to do a superhero movie right.
","Where Michel Gondry, the acclaimed director of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) and Be Kind Rewind (2008), had comically failed with The Green Hornet (2011), Kenneth Branagh, the respected director of Henry V (1989) and Hamlet (1996) succeeded with Thor. An extremely promising setup to Joss Whedon's The Avengers, which is slated for release in the summer of 2012, Thor is without any doubt the best film Marvel Studios has produced in recent years, even better than the Iron Man (2008, 2010) series, I'd reckon. In fact, one has to go back to Sam Raimi's Spiderman (2002) for any decent comparison with the quality of Branagh's work here.<br/><br/>Any dissonance felt since Branagh was picked to helm Thor would have slowly evaporated in the first thirty minutes of the film. After all, it is a bold and risky move for someone who is known for brilliantly translating the theatrics and subtleties of Shakespeare's words into film form to challenge himself with a big-budget superhero movie meant for a popcorn-munching audience. Speaking of which, Thor is imbued with Shakespearean undertones of betrayal, sacrifice, and tensions among the hierarchical ruling family. Branagh brings a touch of humanistic, real- world sensibility to the fantastical setting, enlivening the film when it could have been dulled with flat visual effects.<br/><br/>The story takes time to build up, and that effort is worth it, as it immerses viewers into three realms, that of Earth, Asgard (where Thor and his father, Odin, live), and Jotunheim (where the villains, the Frost Giants, live). The settings in each of these three realms play an important role as they give viewers the chance to visualize and juxtapose the worlds of these ""mythical"" characters. Action sequences fought in Asgard and especially Jotunheim, are well-directed with visual and sound effects becoming the main draw, appeasing Marvel fans who will get numerous opportunities to see Thor (and his oh-my-gosh-I-so-want- that-hammer) in action.<br/><br/>In contrast, what happens on Earth is ordinary. But it remains to be the realm that provides the film with its most hilarious situations, and a romantic subplot involving the newly-crowned swan queen Natalie Portman, who plays Jane Foster. Thor is played by Chris Hemsworth, who as a new face to Hollywood, is surprisingly charismatic as an actor. Perhaps his charm plays out from his character, who from a brave but arrogant royal prince of Asgard becomes a lost soul on Earth, where he is banished to by his father (Anthony Hopkins) for inciting war with the Frost Giants.<br/><br/>For a film that sees itself as a serious take on the Marvel universe, it is quite funny. The most laugh-out-loud moment occurs during a brief conversation between Thor and a pet store owner. Another milks humor from an Iron Man reference. Other moments take advantage of the ""earthly"" situations Thor find himself unable to adapt to. On a random note, I would advise Marvel fans to stay all the way till the end of the end credits for a snippet of what is to come in The Avengers.<br/><br/>Thor, under the hands of Branagh, is an excellent example of how to do a superhero movie right. It has all the necessary elements that make a successful Hollywood blockbuster. By no means a great film, but it certainly aspires to be so. And for that and other reasons mentioned above, I shall lavish praise and give a recommendation.<br/><br/>GRADE: A- (8.5/10 or 4 stars)<br/><br/>(www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com)<br/><br/>All rights reserved."

","The Marvel Comic hero Thor of course based on the ancient Norse God of Thunder comes to the big screen in a fine version with very nice computer graphic special effects. And it has the added attraction of a classical actor like Kenneth Branagh directing and having the lines of the Norse immortals spoken as if the Bard had written them. <br/><br/>As played by Chris Hemsworth, Thor's been exiled to Earth, the last time he visited there was when the ancient Norse were worshiping him and other such beings who visited from Asgaard. Thor's a warrior, but it takes more than being mighty in battle to rule as his father Odin keeps patiently trying to tell him.<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins another actor with classical acting chops plays Odin and I wonder if Hopkins might have envied Laurence Olivier for getting the plum role of Zeus in a film. He's now equaled him in playing another immortal deity.<br/><br/>Thor lands on Earth, New Mexico to be specific and runs into scientific researcher Jane and she tickles his fancy the same way that other Jane rang Tarzan's bell. Natalie Portman is the object of Hemsworth's affections. <br/><br/>But back on Asgaard Thor's brother Loki as played by Tom Higglesworth is plotting a palace coup of his own. That leads to a really spectacular fight to the finish as Thor's mighty hammer gives a few folks an attitude adjustment.<br/><br/>Branagh served up a fine tasty dish for those who like their comic book heroes. Hopefully we'll see these folks again in some further adventures."
"heyimjason","1","9","16","1 February 2012"," AWFUL! I registered just to review this garbage!
","Let me start off by saying that I normally use IMDb to look up actors, see ratings, decide which movies to check out, and so on. I usually agree with general ratings. But this - this horrible film compelled me to actually log in to write my first review.<br/><br/>Within the first 15 minutes, I knew something was terribly wrong. But IMDb had this listed as 7/10, so I kept watching. Mistake.<br/><br/>First of all, everything about the Norse mythology here was way off. OK, it's an adaptation from a Marvel comic book. I can get over that and just focus on entertainment value.<br/><br/>Nevermind, I was wrong. From the cheesy, sci-fi convention costumes to the overblown special effects, there was not one, single good part of this movie. Seriously. The only halfway decent part was when Thor first tried to take back his hammer, and that little infiltration scene would have been better off in some sort of spy thriller action movie (of course, of dozens of soldiers, one would think at least one bullet would have been fired).<br/><br/>The plot was sickeningly predictable. I could predict half the lines and paths of this movie 10 minutes ahead. Well, other than the awful one-liners that the writers must have thought that most people would be incredibly stupid enough to get a laugh out of.<br/><br/>Thor starts some static with the frost giants. He gets banished. He finds himself mortal. He finds his hammer, after everyone has a Sword-In-The-Stone-esque go at it. He predictably can't pull it out, as the movie wasn't nearly over.<br/><br/>He's predictably captured. He's predictably rescued at the behest of the gal that he predictably falls for. She's predictably put into danger. He predictably learns a lesson about being so cocky, and ends up getting his hammer back, and saving the day.<br/><br/>This is EXACTLY why I download my movies first. So I don't waste money taking friends out to see awful films, and so that the DVDs I do buy aren't piles of $10-20 regrets.<br/><br/>I'm once again bitter at Hollywood, Marvel, and Paramount for releasing this awful piece of garbage. I hope the writers and producers have short-lived careers. Mostly, however, I'm shocked at the general IMDb audience for rating this travesty any higher than a 3. Shame on you.<br/><br/>The next time a friend of mine tells me they want to watch this, I will vomit to emphasize how horrible this movie is."
"jornevdk","8","15","30","2 May 2011"," Marvel has surpassed them selves
","I just got back form seeing ""Thor"" in my local cinema. First off, big negative to them for ruining the after credits by just stopping it after 10 seconds. So yes, we again have scene after the credits, and yes, I can confirm it's epic (after googeling it), and no, I am (of course) not going to tell you what it is.<br/><br/>One small side note for those who read this, I am a huge Marvel fan-boy. I'll try to conceal that and try to be a bit objective. That is even harder for me considering I am of Frisian lineage, meaning, well, lets just say I have a Mjölnir tattoo and tend to hail to Odin and Thor while raising my drinking horn. <br/><br/>Onward to the movie!<br/><br/>I expected a fun movie. It's Marvel after all. Lots of special effects, good, decent acting, not to deep of a story. Did I come unprepared. It simply blew me away. Marvel picked up the pace after ""Iron Man"". I liked that one a lot. Then came the new ""Hulk"" which, in my opinion, was also time well spent watching it. ""X-men: Origins Wolverine"" was awesome, be it a bit simple. ""Iron Man 2"" topped all 3 of them. But until now, the ""X-men"" movies have always been my favorite. As said, until now.<br/><br/>""Thor"" is everything you would expect from a Marvel movie, and so, so much more. The visuals are stunning. They are by far the best I personally have ever seen in a Marvel movie. They can compete for the first prise with ""Avatar"", and probably win that contest. Everything about it breaths ""epic"". This also goes for the music. Sound and visual blend in perfectly to create an overwhelming experience.<br/><br/>But acting is important as well. And it's spot on. It is here that my knowledge of the Northern mythology and stories kicks in. I caught myself comparing the facts I knew with that in the movie. I went in, thinking there might be some references to the Edda, but it was as if Marvel actually took the time to read the book! Yes there are some minor flaws, but nothing that really bothered me (like in other movies, big example being ""Clash of the Titans"", fun action, but just threw entire Greek mythology aside). Odin is spot on. Anthony Hopkins did it 100% perfect. Thor is as he should be; a good hearted, arrogant, slightly dumb, but enjoyable character who loves to drink, fight, drink and fight some more. His one-liners are really worth repeating when drinking with friends(I already warned my mother that she should start buying new coffee cups). The, for me, relatively new actor Chris Hemsworth just made it in to my ""I want to see more of him""-list. Same goes for Loki. He might not have noticed it, but I think the Trickster took over a part of Hiddleston's body during the shooting of this movie. And last but definitely not least, a special notice for Idris Elba. Heimdall is simply awesome. Only a view lines for him, but he makes them count, for two! It's to bad that the other actors fade away in the background next to the 3 leading actors. Their performance is solid, they do what they have to do, but nothing more. This is also caused by the fact that their characters only reach a moderate amount of debt. <br/><br/>That is about the only remark I have on the movie. The debt of the supporting role's. The effects are breath taking and the references to the North religion is kept spared, even honored from my personal point of view. The action and special effect that come with them are, as said, epic. You all know the feeling when you watch a terrific movie scene, or listen to an awesome song. The goose bumps, the water in your eyes, the smile on your face. I've had it a view times during different movies, I always get it when listening to a new ""Amon Amarth"" CD or track, but I never experienced it multiple times as I did during this movie. I ask you to stay a while and watch the beautifully animated ""Yggdrasil"" during the end credits. I thought it was breath taking.<br/><br/>-Marvel fan boy (like me)? MUST SEE! -Viking/Norse saga/mythology fan/believer (like me)? Set aside the fact that it is Marvel, and you'll see an homage to our Gods yet unseen.<br/><br/>I'm rating it with 8 stars, because 9 and 10 is the region where, i.m.o, the movies with the deep stories and characters belong. That's the only reason. I think it is the best Marvel movie existing at this moment, and if they keep it up at this level, I can't wait to see what the future movies (""First Class"", ""Capt America"", ""The Avengers"") have in store for us."
"ThomasMagnumPI","Null","15","30","29 April 2011"," Amazing Film On Every Level!
","It's been said that good comic books can often times outshine the best book, song, film, or television program. The in-depth story details, accompanied by amazing illustrations give comics their own identity. Well, then there's the rare case where film captures that and brings it to life. Such is the case with Thor.<br/><br/>This Thor movie is amazing. You have the color & fun of Spider-Man, the darkness & mystery of Batman or X-Men and the grounded cool reality of Iron Man. Thor is massive but they played it just right.<br/><br/>It's easy to see why Kenneth Branagh is considered a film making master. He delivered a film that looks and feels exactly like a live action Thor comic. (The good ones anyway) His detailed yet not too busy screen is filled with tender as well as cerebral moments but when it's Hammer time... run for cover!! This quote sums it up best for me...<br/><br/>""Thor has a real emotional depth - it's unusually soulful for a superhero film. Yes, Christopher Nolan's Batman efforts had a similar sensitivity, though it came from a darker and, thus, ultimately less interesting place; Thor is more bittersweet. There's a hopefulness to the film, particularly its ending, that verges on elegiac. A winning blend of thrill and feeling, respect and irreverence, Thor lifts Marvel's movie stocks considerably"" <br/><br/>I can't believe how much I enjoyed this film."

","Thor truly defines the word ""Blockbuster"". It has an abundance of testosterone fueled action, a plethora of mind-blowing special effects, a hint of well-timed humor sprinkled throughout it's 111 minutes running time, and a powerful yet fragile protagonist that you actually care about by the time the credits roll.<br/><br/>Hardcore Thor enthusiasts will be fully satisfied with this amazing adaptation of the Asgardian hero, and for the rest of us who have no knowledge or background on the Marvel character, it will still be an enjoyable and unforgettable ride.<br/><br/>They cast the role of Thor perfectly, nobody else could have filled his shoes, Chris looks fit and healthy, and exudes the cocky arrogance that is associated with Thor during the first act. The pace doesn't slow down through the second and third acts also, and I was extremely impressed by this. <br/><br/>The acting, in my opinion, was top-notch for a comic book adaptation, the only downfall for me was, surprisingly, Natalie Portman as Jane. I didn't really feel the chemistry between her and Chris was electric, and her part almost felt redundant and forced. But that is only a small imperfection in an otherwise perfect film. <br/><br/>I highly recommend seeing this film, it lives up to the hype, which is rare for most summer blockbusters, but in the case of The Mighty Thor, thankfully it's true.<br/><br/>9/10."
"xxdoubleOxx","2","12","23","17 May 2011"," Disappointed...
","I really don't know what these people are thinking when they say this was a great adaptation. OBVIOUSLY, they don't know enough about the character Thor. This was a horrible adaptation. But lets start with what was good I suppose.<br/><br/>Costumes and graphics were on point. But with technology today it was absolutely nothing special. The imagination of the director was really impressive though (at least with look of Asgard). Other than that, everything was pretty... ehhhh....<br/><br/>One thing that really got on my nerves was the downplay on Thor's intelligence. They made him seem dumb. He was pretty much the Incredible Hulk that could speak perfectly. But it was really inconsistent with the story. He understands the concepts of magic and science on earth AND makes it obvious that where he comes from they are one and the same. YET, it seemed more like he came from a time preceding that of present day earth. He reminded me of those role playing ""Renaissance people"" who take the job TOO seriously.<br/><br/>Then you have Loki, who walks in and manipulates everything and knows everything it seems. He's many steps ahead of humans and even those in Asgard. I understand its his role to be mischievous BUT his intelligence is MUCH MUCH higher than Thor, who as I said seemed like he was dumber than the humans around him.<br/><br/>I can go on, but the other thing that disappointed me the most about Thor was the DOWNPLAY of his powers! He's the GOD OF THUNDER and in terms of strength, arguably the MOST POWERFUL of all Avengers/Marvel characters. After watching the movie, if I had to make a comparison, SUPERMAN would PWN the S&%* out of him. Though I didn't exactly LOVE the last superman movie, the capabilities of Superman seemed endless! That's probably what disappointed me the most about the movie. Thor is capable of MUCH more and as my favorite character of Marvel, this was nothing as I expected!"

","Let me start off by thanking Marvel Studios, cast and crew. They made a wonderful adaptation of Thor. When I first read that they were making Thor, I never expected to see such an amazing comic based adaptation. The movie is mostly based in Asgard which they obviously worked very hard on the design and their hard work payed off. Thor might be bigger than most superhero movies.<br/><br/>The movie is very funny, I loved the humor in it. It's not very much dramatic and doesn't include much action which to me wasn't a disappointment because the writer obviously wanted to introduce Thor to watchers. They portrayed the origin in a very good way and the movie started with in an excellent way. The acting was spectacular, Tom Hiddleston just wowed me throughout the movie, Idriss Elba was perfect as Heimdall and the rest of the cast was excellent. Wardrobe was amazing, they didn't change much and didn't ruin anything for comic book fans.<br/><br/>I never expected to see such a movie that can actually take you to another ""realm"" and makes you believe its real. I suggest you see Thor, thank god Egypt had a early release date.<br/><br/>Thor is truly Mighty"

"Donatien3","9","14","28","25 April 2011"," The God of Thunder leads the charge!
","With an 'Avengers' movie approaching, Thor is the latest Marvel hero to get the big screen treatment. While he lacks the profile of Spider-Man or Iron Man, 'Thor' – The God of Thunder - is easily the best superhero movie since 'The Dark Knight'. Thor has plenty of pedigree: it's directed by Kenneth Branagh (whose Shakesperean background suits Thor's Nordic mythology) and stars Sir Anthony Hopkins and Oscar-winner Natalie Portman. Aussie Chris Hemsworth is fantastic as The Mighty Thor; he certainly looks the part with his strapping frame and blond hair.<br/><br/>Thor is the son of Odin, King of Asgard (Hopkins) and heir to the throne. An arrogant Thor incites war against the Frost Giants, is stripped of his powers and banished to Earth, allowing his brother Loki to become next in line to the throne. On Earth, Thor befriends scientists Jane Foster (Portman), Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings) and Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard). The scenes with a now mortal Thor adjust to his new environment that provides most of the humour. While the mythological elements are understandably kept to a minimum, there's still plenty of action, which – for once – is enhanced in 3D, though there are a few minor leaps in logic which don't affect the movie's enjoyment. The only complaint is there's not enough of The God of Thunder in action, but considering this is an origin movie, there is sure to be a lot more in sequel."
"tedg","Null","8","14","22 June 2011"," Shakespeare, Shouted
","I continue to maintain that the least imaginative and cinematically effective production group is not Michael Bay's, Jerry Bruckheimer's, or that gleeful combination of Ron Howard and Brian Grazer. It is Marvel, who time after time think a hard punch is an effective punch, color is the same as effect and shout equals passion. Their use of the visual art of cinema is roundly uncinematic, just as Shanghai is profoundly dumb architecturally and for the same reason.<br/><br/>They know this, and also know that their films may not be remembered kindly - affecting aftermarket sales. Of all the entertainment businesses, Marvel knows that markets change and the real moneymakers are those that can be sold into new media pockets.<br/><br/>So what do they do? Well, I have seen two Marvels this summer. With the latest X, they decided to add some story for a change.<br/><br/>But here they tried another tack, and it is worth noting. The dramatic world of Marvel is Greek with teen angst added in and everything taken to excess. There clearly was a market for that. But since the production of the films is so tightly controlled and homogeneous, to sell more tickets, you need a differentiator. The angst and volume is already stretched as far as they know how, so why not stretch the dramatic center from Sophoclesto Shakespeare. So bring in Branagh and allow him to populate the thing with actors who can appear 'Shakespearean.'<br/><br/>It is less important that we actually witness Shakspeare, the folds, introspections and narrative loops, than we think we do, we get stentorian presence. No one is going to deride Anthony Hopkins for this, because he is a lost cause among serious actors. But the real tragedy is Ms Portman, who with Skarsgård can really act and who knows how to support a vision like Kenneth would have for his 'Hamlet.' But that is not his job here. His job is to take loud things and give them the smell of Shakespeare.<br/><br/>Natalie, like her character, can only watch in horror as this is visited on her, and disaster is grown.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."
"artistofthemind","5","8","14","11 May 2011"," Thor - 5/10 Hollywood. Still waiting to be impressed.
","As the first installment of the upcoming Avengers movie, Thor was said to be one of the first great hits of the summer. The trailer is edited with just the right amount of action, humor, and dramatic moments. I try to give Hollywood the benefit of the doubt when it comes to showing all the best parts in the trailer, but recently they have been letting me down. The 3D was incredible, even though it was post-converted, but it was easy enough due to the fact that all the shots of Asgard (Thor's home world) were CG, and fifty percent of the movie was that. Still, props to this one - it's one of the first live-action movies to *almost* pull off the 3D.<br/><br/>But still, this movie lacked. There were three holes in it that, from an artist's point of view, cannot be overlooked. A relationship that motivates a character, that is his driving force, and creates the ending as a byproduct, needs to be developed. Not thrown together, not seen as ""He's Thor! And that's Natalie Portman, of course it would happen!"" Terrible excuse, Hollywood. A romance that permeates a story like that cannot be put on a back-burner. Secondly, in a movie that is supposed to be epic enough to draw the audience back for Captain America and all these other Avengers movies, well, rule number one; your biggest battle cannot be in the first fifteen minutes. And last of all, if you're going to make these basic formulaic mistakes in making a movie...at least have the heart to make your music halfway decent.<br/><br/>I have been jumped all over by the people I work with at the theater for not liking this movie. Granted, these are the people that loved Green Hornet, but that is for another day. Still, they believe Thor to be an excellent movie (even watching it in 2D...they don't like 3D) to such an extent that I am seen as insane not to like this. Strange, I think I heard that after Green Hornet as well. The truth is, I view movies as an art form, not just entertainment. I have the respect for my fellow artists not to expect anything but the best of them. So far, Hollywood is proving me wrong."

Everything is third rate until the guardian comes to earth, when finally we see some descent pyrotechnics. The fights lack choreography, the explosions lack oomph, there's neither character development nor dialogue.<br/><br/>Listless, wantonly commercial sequels like Spiderman 3, Star Wars 4,5,6, Blade 3, etc beat this overly expensive monstrosity of failure hands down. <br/><br/>I've said it before about ""love and other drugs"" and I'll say it again about ""Thor"": I go to the cinema for free, and I still wanted my money back.

"gigan-92","5","11","21","11 May 2011"," A Let Down of A Marvel Flick
","D+ I'm not much of a Thor fan to begin with, but I was not against the project and was rather intrigued by it. The casting choices seemed very spot on, myself being particularly excited by the presence of Anthony Hopkins and Natalie Portman. Kudos to Idris Elba as well. However, the film opens with the annoying character played by Kat Dennings. Not only that but Portman's character was one I was completely unable to connect with. Then we go to Asgard and the visuals as expected are stunning. The lighting and wide range of colors was well done and all around beautiful. The mythology was very engaging and the choice of Tom Hiddleston as Loki was a damn good one. The elite ""Warriors Three"" look great from a distance but do little to nothing in the movie. There is not a single reason for me to go into them what so ever due to their lack of screen time and the fact that the majority of the time they were on screen the director treated them as over-redundant comic relief. The Ice Giants were very imposing and served well as antagonists. The battle with them was one of the film's few saving graces.<br/><br/>Then Thor is banished to our realm, Earth, and so begins the painful midsection of the film. And this I mind you is the longest section of the movie. The dialogue is corny and the script struggles to find any bit of memorable dialogue and character development. For the longest time I forgot I was watching a superhero flick and instead a badly staged comedy/sitcom. The director refused to take the material seriously at all, even as far as having S.H.I.E.L.D. agents poke fun at the Asgardian warriors as they stroll down the street and then smother the window of a restaurant like lost dogs. And the vast majority of the humor wasn't funny sadly. This wasn't ""Iron Man"" with its smart and quippy dialogue, this was so cliché it hurt to watch. Denning's character comment s on how hot Thor is, a predictable and very corny romance starts that just grated on my nerves throughout. None of the protagonists seem to take their roles seriously, which would be okay if this were a straight comedy. The villains are menacing enough but don't get enough screen time. I know I keep comparing it to the Iron Man films, but the way the comedy and action are spliced together only shows how badly director Kenneth Branagh tried to make a sh*t-stained copy of those films. I found myself yawning more than anything.<br/><br/>Destroyer was awesome in my opinion, making even further jokes out of the ""Warriors three"" without a fight at all. By the time Thor gets his hammer back I was beyond bored, and in usual Marvel fashion the writers try to throw a curve ball concerning the main villain and it's a decent one I'll admit but the end battle is too short to be breath-taking. In short there are a few colorful shots and nice monsters, but this is outweighed by corny dialogue, cheesy humor and story development that redefine boredom. I cannot recommend this my fellow fans."

","To paraphrase wisdom from Talmud: 'Without the ability to forget, man would live in a permanent, paralyzing fear of death.'<br/><br/>I am grateful human being can forget. If not, I would have paralyzing fear of watching another movie, ever again, scared that it might be as bad as this one. Which is probably impossible, but anyway...I am an optimist here...or pessimist, not sure...<br/><br/>If I wasn't clear enough: the movie is bad. If you want to watch super hero movie with (as Thor now has) 7.3 stars, go watch Bolt. Bolt will make you smile, at least.<br/><br/>IMDb wants the reviews to be 10 lines at least, so I must write some more. Here it comes:<br/><br/>Actors: 1) Thor guy was actually pretty good. I was surprised to see him decently convincing in different moods, but the script didn't give him a chance. 2) Natalie Portman - I mean, I love her, really I do, but this was ridiculous. 3) Stellan Skarsgård – I liked him. Not sure anymore. 4) Sir Anthony – he is a great guy, really. In this movie? Well<br/><br/>To be fair to the actors, screenplay was catastrophic. I guess no one could survive this one. <br/><br/>Kenneth Branagh was the director. I stopped liking that guy after he broke up with Emma Thompson. This movie was just a confirmation that I wasn't wrong.<br/><br/>Good luck and don't watch this. Go ride a bicycle. Or rent some good movie."
"jedi10-682-101769","9","13","26","11 May 2011"," Great. Could have easily been screwed, but exceeded expectations.
","Thor is a weird character even in the Marvel comic universe, he feels a little out of place compared to the super science of the X-Men, FF, Spiderman and others. Yet, comic fans been attracted to this weird tale of Gods and Monsters since the 1960s. Marvel made great decisions with the director, cast and production. Kenneth Baranaugh creates Asgard as though it was ripped from Hamlet or King Henry V with a sense of wonderment of olden times. Chris Hemmolth is awesome as Thor. As dead on RDJ was Tony Stark, Chris nails Thor which is a much harder role then being a drunk jackass in a metal suit. Hopkins as Odin is a real treat as well.<br/><br/>The story does a great job of laying the foundation of the Norse myth with Frost Giants, Loki, the Casket of Winter and the rest of the gods. I loved how they made Thor, the cocky warrior and didn't hold back on how much of spoiled brat he was. Kenneth did a smart move of giving Loki a decent story as well. Instead of being evil upfront, Loki just wanted to ruin Thor's day and through that action realizes he is a monster. All the stuff in Asgard with the Three Warriors and Sif give the movie a good scope.<br/><br/>I have heard people complain about the Earth scenes. I disagree to a point, the love story is a bit weak, but they usually are in these movies. Superman, Spiderman and to some extent Iron Man series are really the only ones to nail the love story. It does as Kevin Smith point out that Jane is just lusting for Thor and his hammer. Thor fighting Shield was great as was the Hawkeye cameo. The humans interacting with Thor was fun which the movie needed to be. I also disagree with the assessment Thor's redemption was quick. Thor's redemption starts with Loki lying about Odin's death that breaks him. Its a subtle bit which most audience would miss. Plus, he was willing sacrifice his life when he had no way of knowing he would be brought to life. So, I am OK with the redemption story.<br/><br/>The end was a nice touch of destroying the Rainbow bridge. I did not see that coming at all consideirng how important it is in the comics. As good as the end was, the after credit scene was balls. Fury with the briefcase was a nice nod to Pulp Fiction as well as nice Usual Suspects ending of Loki maybe being the human doctor all along. This was a great start for the summer and what I thought would be the giant speed bump for Avengers has turned out to be more gas on the pedal. Bring on Cap and GL."

","I've known of the super hero Thor for a long time, I didn't gel with the character as a comic book reader in the 80's though The Ultimates version of Thor got me hooked. <br/><br/>Again when I heard Kenneth Brannagh was directing I rolled my pretty nerd eyes, again I was to be surprised. <br/><br/>I just saw Thor, in 3D, this afternoon, I'm still on a movie high from it and that's why I'm writing this review. I can't remember the last time I left the cinema all buzzed and excited by a movie, actually yes I can it was Avatar, the 1st time I saw a 3D film.<br/><br/>Thor is classic story telling done 21 century style, no shame over the Gods and magic, merely they are presented as fact and we accept them as there in the film. The story is exciting, again a simple tale but as Avatar proved tell a simple tale well and you will entertain, no clever story tricks or sneaky twists, merely an entertaining story, which can, in the right directors hands be elevated above what it is.<br/><br/>The graphics whilst not perfect look good, some beautiful Asgardian shots and some amazing 3D moments, I love 3D, it's exciting and Thor is the kind of film it would seem made for, sumptuous, beautiful sets, dripping in colour and scope.<br/><br/>Helmsworth and Portman share a good chemistry, I could have used some more of them together but that's all to come, the secondary characters are all fine in they serve the story though there are some moments of over acting that seem excess to the scenes, again though it's a new franchise and a first film so all is forgive. Hopkins is understated but obviously great and Hiddleston who plays Loki is excellent, sneaky, relate-able too and not outright evil, more a maker of mischief, as Loki is.<br/><br/>I have to stop now as new Doctor Who is about to start, go see Thor you will enjoy it as a fan of the character or as someone adverse or unaware of his greatness.<br/><br/>I don't believe in God but I do believe in Thor."

","Although an avid Marvel comics reader I never once read Thor comic book. I was hooked on X-Men, Avengers, Spider-Man, Alpha Flight and others, but for some reason Thor never interested me much. So when this movie was announced I wasn't all too interested. The trailers weren't much help, though they perked my interest. A few good television spots and the final trailer convinced me to give it a try. So yesterday I took my 3 teenage kids to see it on opening night here in Oslo, Norway at (allegedly) the biggest screen in Europe.<br/><br/>I was effing blown away! Maybe because I wasn't expecting much. Or maybe because it was a great film. I like to think it was great.<br/><br/>Remove your biases and (even if you didn't like the trailers) if you loved the first Iron Man movie you will LOVE this!<br/><br/>Personally, I didn't much like Iron Man 2, didn't like either of the Fantastic Four movies but loved Iron Man 1 and all the X-Men, Spider-Man and (Nolan) Batman movies. (Just for your comparison with taste.)<br/><br/>Only word of caution/advice is to see it in 2D if possible. We watched it in 3D and though the 3D was pretty good (comparable with Green Hornet if you've seen that) it made several of the scenes blurry. Our projectionist said it was because the theater is so big and the screen is too far from the projector for this particular movie to work in 3D, but that others (Avatar, any animated movie, etc) work just fine in that theater. So either watch it in 2D or on a medium or small screen in 3D."
"Sergeant_Tibbs","3","12","24","10 July 2013"," While ""The Avengers"" was a winner, ""Thor"" really doesn't work.
","The only reason I watched this film is because I'm going to see The Avengers soon and I've seen all the others, although they range from decent to average. I was already not a fan of anything about this film so I had low expectations and it pretty much met them. I'm not a fan of Kenneth Branagh in whatever he does so Thor was pretty typical of him. The emotional cores of the film are intended to be the father/son, brother/brother and Thor/Natalie Portman relationships, but none of them were convincing as they weren't set up properly, nor did they have any genuine chemistry, as a poor attempt to base them on Shakespearean foundations.<br/><br/>Loki is a ridiculous villain, he wasn't evil nor threatening, and I immediately hated the character of Thor. Every character is paper-thin and charmless, I had lots of eye-rolling moments. Especially as they set up the realm of Asgard to be a sincere and the Earth scenes to have lighter comedy, the contrast only seeming sloppy and cheap, as they repeat the same jokes four times in a row hoping to get one laugh. There's no tension or excitement, as the unlikeable Thor battles faceless obstacles, it's no better than a Steven Seagal movie but made PG-13. The other Avenger films had something redeeming about them, but I'll see how the big film is on the big screen. I don't expect something spectacular, but at least worthwhile.<br/><br/>3/10<br/><br/>Update: I saw The Avengers and it was spectacular. I am pleased."

Like i've said before, the performances by the actors has been good with the exception of Natalie Portman. I wouldn't say that her performance in the movie is bad but it's just lukewarm.

"The_big_mick","8","12","24","6 May 2011"," The God of Thunder is Simply Electrifying
","As a big comic fan, I understand that movies cannot be based exactly on events in the comics-its not very practical. Some say that this takes away from the story, and the movie is never as good as the comic itself. That being said, I really enjoyed Thor and it was a lot of fun. Being a comic reader, I like the little things the writers threw in as a little nod to the fans, like Thor inquiring about the name tag on the shirt Jane Foster gave him, and how it said Donald Blake, and she claimed it was her ex. Really liked the inclusion of the Warriors Three as well. But what impressed me the most was that everyone was really good in their roles! Chris Hemsworth was quite good as the cocky, yet brash God of Thunder. Tom Hiddleston portrayed the deceitful God of Mischief Loki very well, too. Anthony Hopkins was great as the wise and proud Warrior King Odin. Very good character choices, I thought.<br/><br/>I was also quite pleased that the feelings Jane Foster and Thor had for each other was kept as a small plot point instead of taking a much larger role. They kept things focused on Thor and trying to return to Asgard, as they should have. Well done.<br/><br/>Problems? Well, only a couple of minor things, really. They really should have explained what the Odinsleep was, because without knowing about it from reading the comics, a normal movie goer would have just seen Odin collapse, and then be told he couldn't continue on as the King of Asgard because he was ""in the Odinsleep"". Considering that being in the Odinsleep was the whole basis for Loki becoming King and thus causing a lot of the plot to commence, it really did bear some explanation. Also, I found that some of the fights were rather short. They were good, but when you see Thor, Loki, Sif and the Warriors Three take on a ton of Frost Giants and beat them pretty easily, and those are supposed to be some of the big villains in the movie, it kinda makes you take them less serious. Same with Destroyer. I was so stoked that he was in this movie: in fact, it was probably what I was most excited for. He decimated Sif and the Warriors Three, and then gives Thor a good smack, and then suddenly Mjolnir returns to Thor and Thor beats Destroyer in about 2 minutes. And the same happened to Loki. Loki manipulated everyone, masterminded the whole plan about getting the Frost Giants into Asgard through a secret passage and was playing both sides against the middle. He starts taunting Thor, and then when Thor finally fights him, the fight lasts about 5 minutes. A couple of blows back and forth, Loki makes some mirror images of himself and then its pretty much over. Had they made at least some of the fights go on a bit longer, particularly Loki, it would have gone a long way towards cementing the villains as really worthy opponents. At least Destroyer annihilated the Warriors Three and Sif, which made him seem pretty damn worthy, but Thor turning around and beating him pretty easily took away from that, I found.<br/><br/>Aside from that, it was an entertaining film. There are lots of laughs to be had, (particularly the fish out of water type, as Thor has no clue how to properly act on Earth), the acting is very solid and the story is pretty good."

The new Marvel movie about the Norse God of Thunder has the potential to become a top 3 best of all time superhero movies. While standing in the theatre and watching it for 2 hours made me feel like only 10 minutes had past since i've sat down, the story sums up pretty much all the essentials of the Mighty Avengers STORY, Hemsworth does a great job as the thunderer , great acting, a lot of charisma, he was cast perfectly,good accent too, excellent performance by Hopkins and an ever more impressive one by Hiddlestone as Loki. Special effects were superb, (Asgard looks amazing)but not forced over the edge, the movie has it's parts that make you laugh and also the fighting scenes are superb and sufficient, I couldn't have wanted more or less! Idris Elba does an excellent Heimdall and personally I loved Jaimie Alexander as Sif. The story really sticks together, Brannagh did a wonderful job from top to finish. Having already seen Iron man 1 and 2 and the Incredible Hulk, and now Thor, the big picture is starting to be clear: can't wait for Captain America! I just want to say AVENGERS! ASSEMBLE! This is my very first review, and I did it because I loved ""Thor""so much and I hope you will too and that this will be helpful!"
"blacklist-1","2","21","47","27 April 2011"," Thor = a poor film, which became an agonising chore to watch and ends being a complete bore.
","WARNING: VOAF (Very Overrated Audience Film) has struck cinema in the form of Thor with a over-bloated 7.9 IMDb rating in what has been described as an ""epic"" superhero film. The only epic thing about Thor is what a bore it was and where I felt myself drifting towards sleep halfway through. Seriously looking on here I shook my head with disbelief at the statistical ratings of nearly 40 per cent of ten out of ten and written reviews of a no less given rating of four (apart from one reviewer). The thing is I have to be honest with how I felt about this movie. I won't go into the plot really because other people on here have already given a synopsis and I can't be asked to waste my time writing one. Sufficed to say the story is very simplistic with no real twists and has all the usual clichés of the ""bad brother"" and the ""damsel in distress"" falling for the ""hero."" But hey this is not really much of a criticism as there are plenty of films out there that follow the same formula, but at least they were enjoyable like Spiderman or the Batman films, the old or new ones.<br/><br/>What I will say that I did enjoy with this film, which stopped me giving this a turkey and ultimately becoming as worse as the truly dreadful I Am Number Four is the special effects, which I have to say were quite impressive. Some of the scenery was breathtaking, the 3D in certain scenes was well implemented and Anthony Hopkins gave a great performance. However these small positives are drowned into oblivion by the scale of terrible things about Thor. <br/><br/>First off the rest of the performances are terrible across the board. Chris Hemsworth as Thor was ridiculously bad and just sounded like he wanted to be elsewhere. He might look the part in costume but he cannot act and didn't convince me for a second as the hero. This wasn't helped by the script, which made his character stupid (at first) but then he supposedly redeems himself. But for me he was just annoying as you don't come to care about him or any of the other characters. Tom Hiddleston as Thor's brother Loki carried no weight as the villain as he just sounded so dull and my Natalie Portman! She seems to have lost her brain since her extraordinary performance in Black Swan. She gives the most cringe-worthy and wooden performance out of the whole cast. She laughs like a hyena and smiles like a retarded idiot and I just wanted to slap her as she goes all luvy dubby eyed over Thor (what does she see in him!? There is no romantic chemistry between her and him whatsoever). All the other cast are just as bad in under-performing and again wishing like they were somewhere else and who could blame them with such a bad script. <br/><br/>It carried no emotional weight or substance and was just dry and repetitive. All the characters are essentially cardboard cut outs with no depth (though some of the reviewers say there is!) so I didn't care about them. When Thor in one scene is supposedly killed, I kept wishing it would come true but it dosen't. There is very little action and even when there is the Michael Bay trait appears with you hardly being able to see what is happening because the camera is so close up with lack of continuity editing. Furthermore the 3D itself though impressively implemented in a few scenes was mostly bad. I could actually at certain points take off my 3D glasses and see where it was in 2D as there was no distorted image. It's as though Kenneth Branagh the director decided after a while he couldn't be asked to properly implement the entire film in 3D and thought ""well the audience won't notice."" Well he hasn't fooled me. If he thinks audiences are that gullible in that respect when it comes to poor 3D he's wrong. What makes me laugh though is that he in an interview said he added the comedy moments to make sure audiences didn't take the film seriously, but the comedy wasn't funny and the whole film literally had the tone of trying to be serious, which I think is part of it's big downfall for me. The scene where you think Thor dies and there is sad music is just for me sickeningly insincere. (A similar scene to one in I Am Number Four).<br/><br/>When it comes down to it is that Thor is just another Hollywood glossy movie that pitches itself as delivering everything (but for most audience viewers it has) but really delivers nothing. Hollywood has duped us all and they should be ashamed of themselves. If you want to waste £7.80 or more if you see it in the evening or weekend on this travesty of a film, don't say I didn't warn you. You watch it as your own peril. The only saving grace surely for how awful this film is will be bought to light by the film critics when reviewed this Friday, which will hopefully help counterbalance the very overrated opinions of Thor from audience reviewers on here."

","Don't be mistaken, this is not the story of a fallen god, this is, rather, the story of a fallen movie director.<br/><br/>How could the director of Dead Again and of several rather watchable Shakespeare adaptations have fallen so low? This movie is so broken beyond repair that it is hard to believe it was not designed to be that way.<br/><br/>The characters are ridiculous and uninteresting, the psychology and the science, an insult to the viewer's intelligence, the dialogs could have been written by a 4 year old, the storyline could have been written by a 3 year old, the special effects are ugly and pointless; last but not least: the acting is so plain bad, that you believe that the director selected the worst shots on purpose. <br/><br/>Is the lost hammer the symbol of Brannagh's lost inspiration? Is Thor's success in attaining ""worthiness"" by getting drunk in a bar a suggestion to the disparaged moviegoer?<br/><br/>Without any hesitation, this is by far the lowest point in Marvel's movie series. (Until the foreshadowed release of the Avenger sequel....)"

","After seeing it in a Special Screening I only have to say it. Wow, I wasn't expecting that, I knew that Kenneth Branagh is a great Director but the way that he translate the story and the comic into life was marvelous.<br/><br/>The acting is good, the actors bring the characters to life, Hemsworth brings an excellent Thor (maybe the wrestler fighter Triple H was a better choice because has more the look of Nordic),with an splendid Odin(Hopkins) and a great Loki(Hiddleston).<br/><br/>The only failure that I can find is the size of the hammer, if you have seen the trailer you will know what I am saying, I think was too small for the size of Thor but besides that the movie is great.<br/><br/>The 3D in this movie was good but sometimes is a bit unnecessary.<br/><br/>8/10 for some dialogs and some excessive use of Special Effects."
"WeathermanTom","2","11","22","16 November 2013"," Thor? Thorough crap more like it
","The only reason why I would give this the extra point is the effort that went into making the effects for this movie. In my view this is one of the worst marvel films; no, one of the worst super-hero films ever made. The plot is so shallow - I know it is based on the comic, I know... - the hairdos are awful, the roles are as cliché-ed as it gets, I could go on. And I will. On what basis does Portman fall for Thor? And on what basis does Thor fall for Portman? Also, the only reason that Thor and Loki engage in battle is that the latter threatened to kill the mortal woman that Thor is so in love with for no apparent reason? Don't people usually hold screenings for movies? How did this one make it to the theaters? Did anyone actually went and saw it? This is an insult to Scandinavian mythology; so much so that I believe it should be banned from theaters worldwide. I mean, come on... really? Really?!"
"franhevi","8","11","22","30 April 2011"," A surprisingly great film
","I thought the character of Thor would make a ridiculous lousy film but, surprisingly for good, Branagh applies his shakespearean expertise to deliver a great story beautifully told.<br/><br/>There's a couple of cheesy lines but I guess they're needed to appeal to a younger audience. Action sequences are just great, seeing Thor fight is a thrill.<br/><br/>If you're a Marvel fan, keep your eyes open for tons of easter eggs. Nerdgasm.<br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend watching it in 3D, by the way. Not worth it.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>---SPOILER ALERT---<br/><br/>There's a reference to Bruce Banner in the film.

Still looking forward to The Avengers, though."
"IgiS","7","11","22","30 April 2011"," One of Marvel's best adaptations, pure fun at the movies
","I highly recommend ""Thor"" to anyone willing to go on this type of escapist journey, which was prepared clearly as a fun inducing devise. It has all of those elements of good Marvel film. It is colorful, full of great CGI(3D really gets it job done well this time), deprived of unnecessary weight on plot(it is rather simple, yet not stupid), and it doesn't overstay its welcome, running just below 2hrs mark(but stay for an extra scene after the credits). Also it features very good performances all around. I was really impressed by newcomer Chris Hemsworth, who played lead role. It was spot on choice to go with him, instead of some more famous face, since he's done his job almost impeccably in a clearly star making role. Other players were very solid also, with beautiful Natalie Portman as main female character, Sir Hopkins in surprisingly long supporting role, and other fine actors(like Ray Stevenson, who was so disguised I only recognized him after the movie). I must say that it is best movie of it's kind since first Iron Man, and definitely in top group of comic book adaptations. Great way to start off summer time in cinemas, and let's just hope that what will follow this season(Transformers 3, Green Lantern, Captain America etc.), will be at least around that good."

I expected so much more, especially out of some of those characters/actors, but was bummed they didn't deliver. I feel that they should've casted more interesting actors, and they should've spent more time learning their characters. The actual comics were much more interesting, and I felt that this film didn't capture any of that.<br/><br/>As far as the special effects/sets go, they weren't impressive at all. I've seen other films, such as X Men, and Spider Man, which were more thought out and creative. The costumes the actors wore weren't believable, they looked like something out of some sort of fashion magazine. Everyone looked so clean, and far from being tough super heroes. None of them looked like they were busy fighting, or training, or anything. <br/><br/>Half the time, Thor was crying, complaining, and whining about everything. Unfortunately that's what his character's attitude called for, but I believe they could've handled it much better. He was such a wimp in this film, so what if he was muscular - big deal, he still wasn't tough enough. None of the relationships were believable either. <br/><br/>Anyway, was a very boring and dull film."
"carlkevad","6","8","15","29 April 2011"," 'Thor' is indeed almighty!
","Kenneth Branagh, the man who brought us Shakespearean masterpieces such as 'Hamlet' and 'Henry V', directs 'Thor', a marvelous summer-starter (even though there's still one month till summer begins).<br/><br/>'Thor' stars Chris Hemsworth, a relatively unknown actor, as, you guessed it, Thor. Now from the trailers, it seemed to me that this was going to be yet another wannabe superhero flick with kick ass special effects and fight scenes, lacking any depth, and starring a talentless six-pack. Well I was wrong. 'Thor' is probably Marvel's best film, and I'd even go as far as saying that it is the third best superhero film of all time (right behind Christopher Nolan's masterpieces).<br/><br/>The plot is as follows... Thor, the bloodthirsty warrior and heir, is banished from the eternal kingdom of Asgard by his father, Odin (Anthony Hopkins), after disobeying his command, to a distant realm... called Earth! Now he needs to get back, but his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), who was previously living in Thor's shadow, is proclaimed temporary king after his father collapses on a staircase, or something, and he doesn't want to let his cool brother back home, so Thor has to stay on Earth, with all the puny beings. He then falls in love with Jane (Natalie Portman), who is somewhat of a scientist, and changes his mind from ""kill everybody who threatens my well-being"" to ""now wait a second, let's reason a bit here"".<br/><br/>The movie's directed by Kenneth Branagh, the director of masterpieces such as 'Henry V', in which his also starred in, and received two Oscar nominations for both directing and acting. He may also be known to some as the goof-ball professor Gilderoy Lockhart from 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'. Here, he takes a break from acting, or producing, or writing, and just directs this masterpiece. Hollywood is really heading in the right direction with hiring artsy directors to direct explosion-explosion films. Another great example would be the upcoming 'Captain America: The First Avenger', directed by Joe Johnston, who brought us the very good coming-of-age story, 'October Sky'. I hope 'Captain America' is gonna be as good as 'Thor'. A part inside me somehow doesn't want it to be better, I don't why though.<br/><br/>Alongside Hemsworth, star Jane's friends Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård), and Darcy... something (Kat Dennings); Thor's friends Volstagg (Ray Stevenson), Sif (Jaimie Alexander), and Fandral (Josh Dallas/Cary Elwes-lookalike); and the nosy SHIELD agent, Coulson (Clark Gregg). The ensemble cast all give great performances, which aren't meant for you to remember, aside from Ray Stevenson, who is always awesome.<br/><br/>The movie references a few other superhero films/comics, which is quite appropriate given the fact that 'The Avengers' movie is getting closer and closer. We can also see Jeremy Renner in a cameo probably as Hawkeye, he's also gonna play Hawkeye in 'The Avengers'. And, I didn't stay in the theater until the credits were over, but IMDb tells me that Samuel L. Jackson has a cameo after the credits as Nick Fury. - How exciting! I'm thinking of seeing it again just for that.<br/><br/>'Thor' is the second superhero film out this year so far. The previous one was 'The Green Hornet', which was just a horrible attempt at mixing comedy with action. 'The Green Hornet' was however the first 3-D superhero flick. 'Thor' is in 3-D too, but I'd rather go with 2-D on this one, since there are too many shiny lights in the Asgard scenes, which would make my brain explode with 3-D glasses on.<br/><br/>There are five superhero films in 2011, three of them are still unreleased. They are: the crappy '...Green Hornet'; the amazing 'Thor'; the comes-out-on-my-birthday 'X-Men: First Class'; the gonna-be-awesome 'Green Lantern; and my most anticipated film of the year, 'Captain America: The First Avenger'. I sincerely hope that they are all on the level of 'Thor'. I don't like repeating myself here, but something inside me forbids me from wanting the other films be better than 'Thor'. Maybe I'm crazy, I don't know.<br/><br/>'Thor's special effects are spectacular, and deserving a Best Visual Effects Oscar nomination. From the epic battle scenes between the almighty gods, to the amazing scenes in Asgard, 'Thor's special effects are probably the greatest ones I've seen since 'Avatar', yeah! Plus, 'Avatar' kinda sucked from the story perspective, and 'Thor' is good on every level, so 'Thor' > 'Avatar', that's probably gonna set a certain individual off, I hope.<br/><br/>Anyway... Under Branagh's gentle direction, 'Thor' is by far one of the best films of 2011, and right behind Nolan's Batmans as one of the greatest superhero films of all time, featuring a star-making turn by Chris Hemsworth - a Hollywood newcomer with a six-pack, and brains!<br/><br/>Rating: ★★★★<br/><br/>Comment on review here and sign up on my site: http://carlkevad.webs.com/apps/blog/show/6882606-the-god-of-thunder-"
"manusby","8","3","4","9 June 2018"," The best Marvel Film
","I am not a fan of Marvel Films, I believe that they are overrated and fail to tell the story of very interesting charities. But I believe that Thor is a great film and the best that Marvel has produced. In a story about god and other world never has a Marvel film felt so human. One of my biggest criticisms with Marvel films is the characters. Marvel has a wide range of brilliant characters but yet they ruin them all by give them very little character development. And that's the key word character development one of the most important parts of any story is something that is almost non-existent. But Thor has the best example of character development. At the beginning Thor is an egotistical flow and is unfit to rule a kingdom. But in his time in Earth he becomes wise and stops being egotistical.
 Thor brother (Loki) is the main villain of the film and is the best villain of all the Marvel films. He tries to take over and kills the Frost Giant's king. The reason why this is such good character development is that Thor would have done the exact same thing. And you can't argue with that, Thor goes to the Frost Giants world and tries to kill them. This shows the character development that Thor just went throw. When Thor fights Loki at the end of the film it feels like Thor is fighting himself.
 The reason why Loki is the best Marvel villain is because of his motivation. One of the most important if not the most important things about a villain is his or hers motivation. The motivation of most Marvel villains is they want to take over the world or destroy the world or have more power and that is why Marvel villains are so bad. But Loki's motivation is not to take over the world nor is it to have power, all Loki whats is the love and appreciation of his family. In one scene Loki lies to Thor saying that his father is dead. But you can easily see from Loki's face that he is disgusted for lying to his brother. And in the every end of the film Loki is hanging from a brig and he sees his father and sees that he is disappointed and ashamed of Loki. And Loki commit suicide by letting go of the bridge. This is why Thor is the best examples of character development and is made better by the brilliant acting.
That is why I give Thor a 8 at of 10."

I've seen it twice and would advise all to go watch it even if your not into such fairy tales but you never know!<br/><br/>Tom Hiddleston as Loki and Anthony Hopkins as Odin were terrific.

"GusF","Null","3","4","19 September 2015"," An excellent and thrilling superhero film wonderfully directed by Kenneth Branagh
","Although I had never even heard of the comic version of Thor before the film was released, I was looking forward to this more than any other film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as it was directed by my favourite living director Kenneth Branagh. He may not be the first name that springs to mind to direct a comic book special effects extravaganza but he was the perfect choice given the film's Shakespearean themes. It may be an atypical Branagh film as it was really his first truly mainstream one since ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"" in 1994 but his direction is typically brilliant in both the quieter character moments and the hugely impressive action sequences, which were a bit of a departure for him. The film has an extremely strong script which is full of wit and great dialogue. This is certainly my favourite MCU film so far.<br/><br/>In his first leading role, Chris Hemsworth gives an excellent performance as the title character. At the beginning of the film, Thor is an arrogant, short-tempered, impulsive crown prince who fails to appreciate or even consider the consequences of his actions, a character trait which leads him to disobey his father Odin and attack the Frost Giants at Jotunheim. A furious Odin strips Thor of his powers and banishes him to Earth as a mortal as punishment. During his exile on Earth, he becomes a better man as he learns humility and sees the folly of his ways. He has a great character arc as we are able to see him grow and change over the course of the film. Tom Hiddleston is wonderful as his adoptive and treacherous brother Loki, who is extremely jealous of Thor and has a major chip on his shoulder as a result. He presents himself as the honest, responsible, dutiful son but, in reality, he is far from it. Speaking of Shakespeare, Loki bears many similarities to Edmund from ""King Lear"" and Iago from ""Othello"", both of whom manipulate those around them with ease. The climactic battle between Thor and Loki reminded me of Edmund's duel with Edgar. They also reminded me of the depiction of Moses and Rameses in ""The Ten Commandments"" as they are likewise a pair of princes, one of whom is adopted, who are in conflict over which of them will succeed their royal father.<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins may have relatively little screen time as Odin but he brings his considerable talent to bear as the All-Father of Asgard. He loves his two sons but has a difficult relationship with both of them. While I thankfully have a very close relationship with my dad, I have always been fascinated by this sort of father-son relationship and Hopkins, Hemsworth and Hiddleston are all very effective in portraying it. Natalie Portman is very good as Jane Foster and has great chemistry with Hemsworth. In contrast to Pepper Potts in the ""Iron Man"" films, Jane is a very strong character. She is extremely intelligent, capable, resourceful, brave, imaginative and is not afraid to stand up for herself. She is a great source of love and support to Thor but she is also a character in her own right and contributes a great deal to the plot. To a large extent, Jane's good influence is what allows Thor to become a better man, something which I did not think was true of Pepper as regards Tony Stark even if that was what they were going for. Stellan Skarsgård gives a great performance as Jane's initially sceptical colleague Erik Selvig, who loves Jane like a father and does not want to see her get hurt by Thor. Kat Dennings is a laugh riot as Jane's assistant Darcy Lewis and has many of the funniest lines in the film. Clark Gregg has a bigger role as Agent Coulson (""Son of Coul"") on this occasion but the character is still pretty much devoid of a personality. The film also features great appearances in smaller roles from Colm Feore as Laufey, Idris Elba as Heimdall, Ray Stevenson as Volstagg, Jaimie Alexander as Sif and Rene Russo as Frigga. Oh, and I adored J. Michael Straczynski's cameo! <br/><br/>The action scenes are very exciting, particularly the battles with the Frost Giants at Jotunheim and with the Destroyer in New Mexico. Visually speaking, it is an extraordinarily well designed film. I loved the sets and the costumes. Asgard seems as if it could be a real place, which I think is very important in a film like this. The Destroyer is fantastic. The film has the best special effects that I have seen in a Marvel Cinematic Universe film so far. It also has a great score by Branagh's regular composer Patrick Doyle, who unusually does not have a role in the film. In fact, none of Branagh's regular stock company such as Richard Briers, Brian Blessed and Richard Clifford appear in the film, though Feore and Skarsgård later appeared in ""Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit"" and ""Cinderella"" respectively.<br/><br/>Overall, this is an excellent film which I am glad to say that I enjoyed even more than I anticipated. Except for ""Peter's Friends"", I have to yet to see a Branagh film that I did not love. However, even that film was very well written, acted and directed. Its very depressing storyline was just not to my tastes. It is a shame that Branagh did not return to direct ""Thor: The Dark World""."
"Vartiainen","Null","3","4","25 August 2013"," Feels a bit rushed, but otherwise a fine movie
","Thor was always the hardest to introduce into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. While the rest of the Avengers are all human, albeit some with superpowers, Thor, the mythological god of thunder, is anything but. Keeping that in mind, I think this was an excellent adaptation of the comic book superhero that we know and love. It has its flaws, and if you were to write the whole Avengers storyline from a scratch, you'd probably give a character like Thor a miss, but the film makers managed to make it work.<br/><br/>What I like the most about this film is its charm. This stems from the great actor choices, as well as the writing and the dialogues. Chris Hemsworth was a new face for me personally, but I don't think that they could have picked a better Thor. The man has it all, the looks, the attitude, the physical prowess, the charisma. Natalia Portman and Tom Hiddleston are equally great in their roles of Jane Foster and Loki, respectively. The writing, on the other hand, shines through in the dialogues, which are fun to follow and feel real. Hemsworth has some really great lines throughout the entire film, which cause me to laugh out loud no matter how many times I see this film.<br/><br/>In addition, the rest of the cast do excellent job as well, the visuals (especially the design of Asgard) are topnotch and the action scenes are creative and fun to follow.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the movie falters a bit when it comes to the pacing. Most of the first half of the film is spent in Asgard, introducing the world and building up the characters. And while this is all needed and I enjoyed all of it, it causes the time spent on Earth to feel just a little bit rushed, especially the budding romance between Thor and Foster. So perhaps a little more time should have been focused on Earth rather than the various alien worlds, but even as it it, it doesn't ruin the film. There are some things that could have benefited from extra attention (Odin sleep, anyone?), but only the romance really feels like it should have had more time to develop. Otherwise you can buy the fact that the film can only be so long.<br/><br/>Aside from that one flaw, I really think that this is a great film. The characters, the visuals, the plot, they all work and they work well. Marvel can proudly call this one its own and it's a worthy introductory film for the character of Thor."

","I have seen Thor two times already and I freaking love it. It was one of the top five films of summer 2011 and one of the best films the entire year.

It is a s good as my other favorite superhero flicks such as X-MEN, The Dark Knight, Spider-man, Superman 2, X-MEN First Class, Watchmen, and Spider-man 2, plus Captain America. People who did not like Thor did not give it a chance. I already am dying to see The Avengers and I need to read some Thor comics as well. I loved the great cast. The best performances were by Chris Hemsworth, Anthony Hopkins, Natalie Portman, Tom Hiddleston, Ray Stevenson, Kat Dennings, and Stellan Skarsgard. This is the second Hemsworth film I've seen and he's become one of my favorite actors. He was awesome, funny, and gave a kick-ass performance. Thor was a bratty jerk at first defying his Father and boasting about his powers but he became a man on Earth. I liked his romance with Natalie Portman. One of the funniest scenes was when Thor asked for a horse at the pet store. I thought Anthony Hopkins was intimidating but noble and real intense as Odin. I liked when he stripped Thor of his power and banished him. Tom Hiddleston gave a wickedly funny performance as Thor's jealous step sibling Loki. He was evil but had reasons to hate Thor. He was weaker and not super-handsome like Thor. He was a great villain, I liked his armor and his horned-helmet was creepy as hell. I liked it when Loki went to earth and he was dressed like a businessman. I loved the battle at the end between Thor and Loki. Stellan Skarsgard was great in his brief role. Kat Dennings was hot and sexy. Natalie Portman was great too, this is one of her finest roles. The destroyer was a cool villain, I liked it when the shield agents thought it belonged to Tony Stark. Thor was awesome again and everyone should see it."

While studying anomalous events in the atmosphere under the guidance of her mentor Erik Selwig (Stellan Skarsgard) and with the not- so-able assistance of Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings), she bears witness to Thor's banishment or rather the tornado-like occurrence that made it possible. This intrigues Foster and after a brief period of reticence she hopes to offer help to Thor and, at the same time, elicit any information he might have that could help her in her work. All the while, turmoil in Thor's realm could potentially destroy both it and Earth. <br/><br/>I'd not seen Hemsworth before and while the part requires very little beyond physicality, he is adequate at least. The ""earthlings"", are good enough as are those from Thor's home planet and the story is about what I expect. It's not amazing, it's not awful. Basically, it's just a good time at the movies."

","The Asgardian God finally hits the big screen with the movie adaptation of Stan Lee's comic book series ""THOR."" Directed by Kenneth Branagh and starring Chris Hemsworth as the mighty Thor, does this movie strike gold with the powerful Mjolnir or does it fail to live up to the Marvel's iconic name and fan expectations. <br/><br/>I was very excited when I heard that Thor was coming out with a movie adaptation, since Thor has been my favourite superhero for many years. I was expecting a decent superhero along with those of 2008's Incredible Hulk, but what I did not expect was this movie to easily become my superhero movie to date. All elements of this film are well-balance, nothing seems to overwhelming. There's just the right amount of action, comedy, and a romance story between Thor and Jane Foster wasn't to over the top but was still very effective in the end. <br/><br/>The acting in this film is no less then top notch, every actor was able to bring there characters to life no matter how much or little screen time they got.. Chris Hemsworth as the hammer-wielding Thor was remarkable. Not having seen \Chris in any other film then Star Trek I was amazed at how he was able to carry the film on his shoulders as the main character. Natalie Portman's supporting role as physicist and Thor's love interest Jane Foster truly brings the human-world connection to this fantasy setting. Anthony Hopkins brings another legendary performance as Odin, showing great emotions through every line he had. The highlight of this film would have to be Tom Hiddleston performance as the God of Mischief and Thor adoptive brother Loki. He is able to make you feel sorry for Loki through his performance even though he is this evil, maniacal, villain. <br/><br/>""Spoilers!""<br/><br/>A great scenes of his is a conversation turned argument over Loki's truly being a frost giant offspring and realizing that he was adopted by Odin after the war against the Frost Giants. END SPOILERS<br/><br/>And of course Stan Lee has to make a cameo appearance, and he probably makes his best one yet. <br/><br/>THOR demonstrates exactly what a superhero adaptation needs to be. It's not hard to recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of superhero films and anyone who wants to see a very fun adventure. This film is making me very excited for the Avengers film. I hope the Avengers is this well made when it comes out."
"tomgillespie2002","7","10","20","7 May 2011"," Marvel does it again
","As Marvel's mega-budget Avengers film draws ever closer, the stand-alone origin films are slowly coming to an end. Only Captain America, starring Chris Evans, remains to be released. So Thor arrives, amidst a worry that a portrait of the God of Thunder arriving on Earth after being banished from his kingdom in the sky may look a bit silly, especially when played by actors rather than drawings in a comic-book. But Marvel's track record has been good so far, and even very good, in the case of the first Iron Man film. Their left-wing choices for both actors and directors, and bold decisions have made for interesting viewing, and it's no different here.<br/><br/>King of Asgard, Odin (Anthony Hopkins), sits proud on his throne after defeating the Frost Giants of Jotumheim and bringing peace to the Nine Realms. He has two strong warrior sons, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Loki (Tom Hiddleston), one of which will eventually succeed him. But when Asgard is breached by Frost Giants trying to take back their precious Casket of Ancient Winters, seized by Odin, Thor invades Jotumheim with a small band of warriors including Loki, and starts a new war. Odin, livid with Thor's defiance, banishes him to Earth and takes away his all- powerful hammer Mjolnir, deeming him unworthy. When he arrives on Earth, confused and powerless, he is taken in by a scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), while Mjolnir sits in the desert, moulded to a rock, awaiting the touch of someone worthy of it. Meanwhile, back on Asgard, war is afoot and Odin lies near-death, while Loki starts to act suspiciously.<br/><br/>This may all seem ridiculous and silly, and it is. The opening ten minutes, which condenses the history of Asgard and its war with the Frost Giants, is a confusing and silly blur of CGI and narration. My hopes of another Marvel triumph were somewhat dashed, but thankfully, with the arrival of Chris Hemsworth as Thor, and a bit of character development, the film started to become the enjoyable romp that it is.<br/><br/>Marvel's choice for Thor, Chris Hemsworth, whose CV consisted of a main character in Australian soap Home And Away, and a cameo as Captain Kirk's dad in the Star Trek reboot, is a stroke of genius. He has the charm, acting chops, comic timing, the physical presence to actually convince as a God. He was born to play this role, it seems. He juggles between irresponsible, immature and arrogant in the first half, to show off his skills as an action hero you can truly root for in the second. And when the film calls for him to play the fool, he pulls that off too.<br/><br/>The choice for Kenneth Branagh to take the directing reigns was a strange one. A director who is most at home directing literature, namely Shakespeare, would not have been my first choice to direct a blockbuster that could easily go tits-up if mishandled. Yet Branagh handles the duties with a natural flair and confidence. The film goes back and forth from Thor's growing humanity on Earth and his relationship with Portman, to Loki's evil plotting on Asgard without ever losing focus of the story at hand or the large collection of characters.<br/><br/>Overall, this is just a fun film, never taking itself too seriously, yet always maintaining a respect for the source material. The undoubted star to emerge from the film is Hemsworth, who I'm sure will go on to have a successful career. I'll be looking forward to see his character again in the Avengers film, which arrives sometime in 2012. Special mention should also go to Tom Hiddleston, who arrives from the London stage after winning several awards to play a menacing and pleasingly complex villain.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
"EmBlack23","10","10","20","1 May 2011"," Great movie
","I watched Thor over the Easter Holidays and found it amusing instantly. In the trailer Chris Hemsworth didn't seem a ""Fanastic"" actor as he did in Home & Away but when I actually watched the movie I soon found out I was mistaken. He is an amazing actor in Thor and he takes on a whole new role that he has acted out well. Natalie Portman also had a great role in Thor and played it well. The quality of the graphics and effects was outstanding. One bit that I thought had very good effects was near the end when he was fighting he giant metal monster and when he broke the path to other worlds. The story line was good with lots of humorous parts. Some people may assume this is not a family movie, but it has no sexual content and has lots of humor for all ages. I rate this 8/10 and it is now one of my many favorite movies :)"
"trippy90","Null","10","20","30 April 2011"," Excellent Marvel Film.
","I went to see Thor on 28th april and i was very impressed with it. The effects were great and the actors/actresses did a good job. The romance was not to cheesy either.<br/><br/>Thor is a good film to watch if your looking for something that will entertain you. I think it was just as good as Iron Man. I haven't read the comic so i cant say whether it was like it but i enjoyed it personally. Some of the scenes were visually amazing. The fight scenes were very good as well.<br/><br/>I am a fan of most marvel films so this one did not disappoint. I felt the film told you enough of the story as well. I will definitely be buying this on DVD when it comes out. Stay for after the credits as well.<br/><br/>Id give Thor 8.5 or 9/10."
"jan_kalina","10","10","20","29 April 2011"," ""Your ancestors called it magic but you call it science. I come from a land where they are one and the same. ""
","Surprisingly Thor has got the magic of an amazing, popcorn overflowing, comic-book movie. I have to say I was quite sceptical about this movie, the footage in the trailers looked pretty lame and stupid, but the great reviews I kept reading about this movie made me change my mind to go and see the movie.<br/><br/>When I read that Kenneth Brannagh is directing Thor I had no idea what to think about it, I mean a renowned Shakespearean director and actor at the helm of a high-budget comic book movie? It just didn't seem like a good idea, but I didn't believe that Jon Favreau could pull off a good movie with Iron Man and he proved us wrong and so does Brannagh. It seems that Marvel has got good hand on picking the directors. <br/><br/>The character of Thor is a tricky one to translate to screen. Firstly Thor isn't like other superheroes, he isn't human, he is a God, one who was worshiped by ancient Norsemen. The story might be simple but that doesn't matter if it's well told. Thor is cast down to Earth by his father Odin for his reckless actions that reignite an ancient war and is forced to live among humans. Thor is one of the most charismatic, arrogant, noble, physically imposing, powerful and romantic characters that have come on screen recently. Chris Hemsworth brings all that into the character so he proves himself as a great actor. Brannagh handles the action scenes very well. A guy huge like a mountain fighting his enemies with a hammer sounds silly but it looks great on screen. Hell, it actually kicks ass. The action is exactly how I expect it from a comic book movie: it's cheesy, little bit over the top, fun and kick ass. <br/><br/>Brannagh was chosen for this movie for another reason, he knows that in a summer movie the action can't be simply there just for the sake of having action scenes in a movie. You need emotions and he delivers that through almost Shakespearean family tragedy. Anthony Hopkins as Odin is amazing, when he shouts ""Silence"" nobody ,even in the cinema, says a word. Tom Hiddleston gives here an incredible performance as Thor's devious brother Loki, who is scheming against everyone, hidden under this facade of a meek. Natalie Portman as a beautiful young scientist hasn't got much to do in this movie just to be amazed by Thor and you can see that she really is. When he kisses her hand as a noble man you can see how she is falling for him in love. I love how the writers incorporated S.H.I.E.L.D. into the story in such a casual way. Once again we get the marvelous Agent Coulson. His interactions with Thor are the funniest and also the most tense one. Idris Elba as Heimdall the guard is a perfect casting choice. He is calm, great in action scenes. He is just perfect. There is also Rene Russo as Thor's mother Frigga but unfortunately she doesn't get a lot of screen time.<br/><br/>In the end this is exactly what you pay for and even more. Thor is one of the greatest comic book adaptations, it's funny, has great characters and actors,great score/soundtrack by Patrick Doyle, amazing visual effects, great action scenes. In my opinion it's a comic book movie the way they are supposed to be made.<br/><br/>Watch out for a great Stan Lee's cameo and as usual with Marvel movies stay till the end of the credits for a genius post-credits scene.<br/><br/>Thor will return in The Avengers."
"Forcerlo","10","10","20","21 April 2011"," Iron Man's equal in every way.
","Going to see this film i had very mixed expectations. I liked the costumes and look when viewing the trailer however i thought the acting looked forced and i thought the trailer gave too much of the plot away. However most of my fears were put to rest when the movie started. The tone of the film was excellent and pulled off the mythological themes well. Odin looked great and Anthony Hopkins gave a good performance, as did Natalie Portman who gave her usual high standard. Tom Hiddlestone did excellent as Loki, it was amazing to see him come alive from the comic book. The star of this film though is Hemsworth I was so ambivalent regarding his performance coming into the film. But he exceeded my expectations and lived up to how I envisioned Thor would look, act, talk and fight. All the while I was thinking how awesome he would be clashing so glaringly alongside Tony Stark, Bruce Banner, and Steve Rogers. I am pumped for the Avengers! The bad though is the plot is a little unambitious and his time on Earth needed more time to develop. All in all the tone of the film was excellent and gave us a Superhero film that did not cause any huge revelation in the way Superhero films should be done, it did give us another fresh revised feel to the genre much like Iron Man did back in 2008."
"leplatypus","1","7","13","23 June 2013"," This Thor won't go into Valhalla (tv)
","As soon as the movie starts, I could feel this adaptation was another Marvel failure (following the Spidey reboot, Daredevil, Hulk, the Xmen or Iron man sequels). <br/><br/>It's a pity because they had everything needed for a great movie (an original character, a solid cast). They just couldn't grasp the vision of Nordic mythology and Stan Lee's genius. <br/><br/>Here, the CGI production is disastrous as they stupidly enhance the Asgard sets with highly golden colorization to pass for gold! Next, as the heroes goes into the frozen realm, the effects are rather bad. Then, as Thor arrives to earth, his landing isn't NYC but American southwest, thus that is to say nothing except rock and desert landscapes. His Midgard adventure has no deepness except a good fight against his nemesis, the Destructor. This disappointment is also felt with Natalie's performance (who was my main motivation to watch this flick) as she just brought her friendly smile to an empty character. <br/><br/>I don't know what other Marvel fans think about it but we are very far away here from Simonson's, Claremont or Romita's territories. In conclusion, Marvel has always the nose to get the real man or woman for the role but they never understand that a comic adaptation needs more. Instead of having Stan the man doing funny cameos in each movie, they should give him the script as well as his ideas totally revolution the medium!"
"jpm4444","5","7","13","11 May 2011"," Seemed very shallow and sophomoric at times; not bad but more for teens.
","I won't give out any spoilers or plots but I was semi bored at times with this movie. Natalie Portman looked and acted like she was a sophomore in college and it just didn't work for me. <br/><br/>As with most movies in this genre, the most interesting characters are the ""bad guys"". Tom Hiddleston was great as Loki and Anthony Hopkins can do no wrong in most every part he plays. <br/><br/>The acting just seemed shallow and simple and I really don't get why some like this movie so much. I think teens will enjoy this movie a lot more than adults. The movie is only 104 minutes long and it shows there could have been a lot more to the story."
"neil-476","8","7","13","30 April 2011"," Non-stop fun
","This was big daft fun. After a short sequence where Natalie Portman and her fellow scientists drive into this chap in the middle of an unexplained whirlwind, there is a lengthy sequence in Asgard. Asgard looks great (the Rainbow Bridge is phenomenal), the Norse Gods are all played well, and the action elements are beautifully done. Then Thor is cast down to Earth, powerless, to teach him a lesson, at which point a) things start to go pear-shaped in Asgard, and b) the goings-on on Earth are somewhat less engaging than those in Asgard, although there is some very well-judged comedy. But the last half hour or more is action all the way, both on Earth and in Asgard.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed Thor, as did my companions (one of whom is far from a committed comics movie fan), and took pleasure in the way further elements are included to set up the Avengers movie - again, don't leave until after the credits. There are places where what you see on the screen screams ""Kirby!"" If I was to offer any criticisms, I would say: <br/><br/>1. There is a point where the pace drops somewhat about half an hour in; <br/><br/>2. There is quite a lot of it which reminded me of other movie (the small town battle reminded me of similar sequences in both Superman II and Supergirl); <br/><br/>3. Rene Russo is wasted. I imagine she features strongly in ""Deleted Scenes."" <br/><br/>Natalie Portman never really convinced me. Kat Dennings was fun but underused. Idris Elba was a great Heimdall. Anthony Hopkins added an immeasurable amount of class as Odin - a strong ruler, absolutely assured as to his authority, but calm and compassionate when appropriate.<br/><br/>But Chris Hemsworth is the big discovery here. His Thor is as nuanced as Chris Reeves' Superman/Clark Kent. A wonderfully enjoyable performance in a film which is non-stop entertainment."

Awesome film - 'nuf said true believer!<br/><br/>Thor has set the pace and raised the bar to how superhero movies should be. Captain America and The Avengers have a lot to live up to now. Like the reviewer below has already said I was bit sceptical about Chris Hemsworth being cast against Anthony Hopkins and Natalie Portman, need not have worried as held his own against the heavy weights!<br/><br/>Kenneth Branagh's directing was a beauty to behold, you could tell he knew his subject, especially how he manage to depict the beautiful looking Asgard.

","after weeks of seeing trailers for this on TV, I finally got to see this last night at my local cinema. I love superhero movies, and this movie didn't let me down at all. I was Thor-oughly entertained from start to finish. this was different to other movies in the genre, it had a bit of everything,sci-fi, fantasy, action, comedy, drama. The acting was great, Chis hemsworth as Thor was perfect. he has a certain prescence on screen and oozes charisma.looked the part too, beefing up well for the role.For an Australian, he really nailed the medieval English accent required. he definitely has a future in film, i can see him playing a jason bourne type character in the future. Other top actors in the film played their parts well too. most notable Anthony Hopkins as Thors father Odin and Tom Hiddleston as Thors brother Loki. Natalie Portman was fine as scientist love interest Jane Foster, but all she had to do really was say her lines and look good, which she did great. the 3d effects in this movie also added to the entertainment. I thaught the effects were as good as avatar in places. certainly better than any other 3d film other than avatar. didn't take away from the action at all like in films such as Clash of the Titans, where the effects became blurry at times. the scenes in thors home realm Asdgard were especially good in 3d. I would definitely recommend seeing this in 3d if you have a choice.To sum up, fantastic summer superhero blockbuster that doesn't fail to entertain, had the potential to be really bad but wasn't at all. has all the elements that make a great summer blockbuster, superhero movie, go see it !!"

","This is a fun movie with a lot of nice humorous touches. It is as much fun as Iron Man with perhaps just a little more depth to the back story.<br/><br/>OK the whole thing is a crock from a scientific or mythological point of view... but who cares? If you are the sort of person who complains because James Bond can't really have an invisible car then maybe you should get a life.<br/><br/>If you want to spend a couple of hours being entertained by an action movie that is also complex enough to argue about in the bar later, then this absolutely hits the spot. Portman and Skarsgaard are almost only cameos and Hemsworth practically carries the film, but the cast all deliver well. <br/><br/>This is entertainment that sits fairly and squarely in the 'let's pretend a little bit' camp and rewards the viewer with some good action scenes, a plot that has some substance, and a few good gags along the way. Go see it if you want a couple of hours fun. NickB"
"garyvanhorn","8","9","18","17 May 2011"," I'm now even more excited for Captain America and The Avengers!
","Thor is a bit of a harder sell as far as comic book characters go. I mean, how do you transform an ancient Norse god and 60's comic book character into something a modern movie going audience is going to like? Start with great casting (Chris Hemsworth is a dead ringer for Thor), add a brilliant screenplay by J. Michael Strazynski, and mix it with top notch special effects and you end up with a movie that is halfway believable (in a comic book way) and very entertaining.<br/><br/>Thor is an arrogant, perhaps spoiled, young warrior that seeks glory for himself and Asgard but nearly reignites an ancient war with the Frost Giants in the process. For his arrogance and poor judgement, Thor is stripped of his power and banished to Earth by Odin (Anthony Hopkins), and his hammer lands in New Mexico and becomes something akin to the sword in the stone of Arthurian legend, ""Whoever holds this hammer, should they be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor"". All of this is a result of the subtle manipulations of Thor's evil brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) who seeks power only for himself. Throughout most of the film Loki works from the shadows to manipulate people and events towards an end of his design, as only the trickster god can do. Thor must then work to reclaim his power and stop his brother's machinations, gaining some wisdom and humility along the way.<br/><br/>There is really very little to dislike about the film, other than a couple of minor casting decisions, Hogun, one of the famed warriors three, is apparently Asian for some reason, and Heimdall is black. Both choices seem odd for Norse gods but it doesn't really harm the movie, they just seem out of place. I would have liked to see Thor get beat up a bit more in the final two fight scenes with The Destroyer and Loki as both were relatively short and could have benefited from a couple of extra minutes. Overall Thor is a very fun, very entertaining comic book movie that only heightens my anticipation for the upcoming Captain America and Avengers movies."
"monitorwipes80","1","9","18","16 May 2011"," Just plain bad
","This movie is just plain bad. Yes, I know people say it's ironic and fun and just a dumb summer movie -- but compared to Iron Man or X-men or the Batman movies this is pure junk. The 3-d was horrible too. On the plus side,Thor has an interesting mythology, and it's nice to escape the trap of the wealthy bachelor/superhero protagonists we've seen so much of lately. Also, it's filled with good British actors (the Americans didn't do so well). But to be honest this movie had no soul. It was flat, boring, and not nearly as well executed as others in the genre. This is the kind of movie they release early because they know that if they put it out in the summer it would be crushed."
"thekyles99","8","9","18","10 May 2011"," I didn't think he could do it but Chris Hemsworth nailed the role!!
","Although having originally balked at director Kenneth Branagh for casting Chris Hemsworth in the lead of this film, i have to say i was presently pleased with the job he did in this. Now as you will see in this version Chris Hemsworth is ribbed and cut however I was hoping he would've used a wrestler such as the likes of Paul (Triple H) Levesque he's way more massive in the body building sense then Hemsworth is. Im sure however that Hemsworth is a better actor. Needless to say the film rocked and turned out to be one of the better comic book adaptations i have seen to date. Branagh carefully handpicked his cast in this with the end product proving this immensely. After being cast out of his mystical city of Asgard by his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) Thor is sent to earth with his famed hammer. He is befriended by scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and with her team they follow Thor as he treks to find his hammer. Upon finding the mystical and powerful weapon he cannot seem to pull it from its place embedded in earth. This leads him and his friendly band of scientists to find out as to why he has come to earth and deemed powerless. It takes a powerful Asgardian foe that comes down to earth to destroy Thor and with malicious intent to do more harm then good to earth's mortal citizens, to give Thor what he needs to conquer and rejoin his father as a King in Asgard! Kenneth Branagh in his first comic book super hero genre type film did a superb job in retelling what is one of my favourite heroes that the great Stan Lee crafted in his comic book series. Seeing Thor only left me craving to see 2012's The Avengers that will be directed by Joss Whedon."

I saw this yesterday and let me say it was amazing, the whole movie was put together very well and the story line left you interested and even emotional at times. I looked up the rating while i was waiting for it to start and after I left the theater I could not stop talking about how good it was and how impressed I was (as well as having to rate it at at least a 9/10 when I get home).

","Thor never seemed like the type of super-hero that could charm the screen. It was, the now infamous scene that takes place after the credits in Iron Man 2, that got me excited. As time went on, hearing Kenneth Branagh had directed the film and seeing some pretty exciting trailers, I thought Thor was going to be the hit of the summer, worthy of kicking ass over Micheal Bay's Transformers, but no.<br/><br/>Thor is unbelievably mediocre. Between the story of Thor, which if you're going to see the movie you most likely already know, and what is shown in the trailer, anyone could close their eyes and imagine exactly what you're going to see, almost shot for shot. Some people would call this a good movie, I can it horribly unimaginative.<br/><br/>The film, even when lacking in action, never lacks in trying to squeeze every possible laugh of it's audience, as guilty as a television sitcom. Branagh also heavily relies on the pretty boy looks of his leading man, hoping to distract us with Thor's contagious smile so we not take notice at how badly written the dialogue is.<br/><br/>Even in 3D, there is nothing that comes through the screen and is common feel through-out the audience. The kids wowed at the special effects, the girls giggled and smiled and the rest of us, hoping it's going to get better."
"cadillac20","8","9","18","6 May 2011"," Entertaining Fantasy That Rarely Slows Down
","When I first started seeing trailers for Thor, I was fairly unimpressed. I worried that the fantasy elements would be treated poorly and that this was really just a cash in to set things up for The Avengers. However, good buzz about the film prompted me to see it, and sure enough, the buzz is right. This is an entertaining summer blockbuster that continues the trend of early summer films from Fast Five.<br/><br/>A bit different from the other Marvel films, this one concerns a different take on the Norse myth where Thor is the brash, blood lusting, and proud son of Odin. He is soon sent to Earth and relinquished of his godly powers in order to be taught a lesson. However, forces conspire against him and his home, Asgard. Certainly, there is heavy tie in here with the rest of the Marvel universe of films, but the film establishes itself as something different. Where as most other Marvel films have been grounded in reality with all the flashiness and powers mixing with everyday life, Thor generally keeps the film's fantasy and reality separate. In fact, for once in a Marvel movie, people question how these things are happening. It is in this fantasy element that Thor separates itself. It's story is heavily invested in it's mythology, and that is a welcome change of pace. This is, for the most part, a fantasy film, with magic and powers and even the silly costumes.<br/><br/>The film is led by some strong performances, most notably in the three main actors of Hemsworth, Hiddleston, and veteran thespian Hopkins. Each delivers strong, with Hemsworth and Hiddleston stealing the show and providing some very good drama and character growth. Natalie Portman and the rest of the supporting cast to a great job as well, with Portman acting her usual adorable self while appearing to have a lot of fun in the role, which helps make her performance that much more enjoyable. Branagh does an admirable job as a director here, showing a flair for the dramatic and making good use of the source material in it's scale and scope.<br/><br/>There is surprisingly not as much action as I expected, but there is also a lot more humor than I anticipated, especially when Thor first comes to earth. My only major complaints against the film are it's seeming lack of focus and the romance angle. There doesn't seem to really be a straight focus here as the film shifts between several different groups doing things all at once. There is an overall quest of Thor to learn from his predicament, however, it really lacks a lead up to a climax. Even when Thor does head into the finale, it's underwhelming and it sort of just happens. The human drama and characterizations make up for some of this, but, none the less, it comes off as a bit of just passing through the motions. The second is the supposed romance between Thor and Natalie Portman's character. It's simply not believable that Thor would just fall for the first beautiful woman he see when he gets to Earth. Her attraction to him is more understandable, but any actual love is hardly believable.<br/><br/>These two things, however, as minor in the face of the grand spectacle. With great fx, great performances from the cast, and a snappy pace, this is a great way to start the summer blockbuster season and brings hope that rest of the Marvel films coming will follow suit and be just as good. Here's looking at you First Class and Cap. Am."

"DonFishies","6","15","34","30 April 2011"," Has the potential to be great, but never really gets the chance to achieve
","When Marvel announced its intentions to create a film based on The Avengers, most fanboys cheered with delight. I remain to be incredibly interested in what the company and Joss Whedon have in store for us next summer, but in the interim we have Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger to look forward to. While every new image and trailer has kept me excited for Cap's entrance, I have always remained skeptical on Thor. The trailers did nothing to help my hesitation going into the film, and after watching it, I am even more apprehensive Marvel's future plans.<br/><br/>Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is a ridiculously powerful god living in the ""realm"" of Asgard. He is due to be crowned king by his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins), but during his commencement, Asgard is briefly invaded by rogue members of the Frost Giants, a group who hold a long standing truce with Asgard. After acting out recklessly and endangering the lives of his warrior companions, Odin strips Thor of his godly powers and his hammer Mjolnir and exiles him to Earth. As he searches for hammer, Thor ends up in the care of Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), a scientist studying wormholes, constellations and the causes for certain spatial phenomena.<br/><br/>I find it incredibly difficult to go even further trying to describe Thor. The ending is ridiculously obvious moments after the film begins, and the proceeding moments make no attempt at trying to do something outside of playing by-the-numbers. Origins are vaguely discussed, and there is such little emphasis on character development and explanation that you wonder why Marvel even bothered giving the character his own film in the first place. The best part of the film is the initial introduction to Thor, Asgard and the powers possessed by these godly warriors. Everything past his exile feels secondary and almost useless.<br/><br/>One of these reasons is the simple fact that Thor's journey on Earth is not interesting in the slightest. It is the battles, the characters, the settings on Asgard that offer the most fascinating, engaging and enjoyable scenes in the entire film. The film has a habit of jumping back and forth between what is occurring on Asgard as Thor treks on Earth. Almost every time, I found myself more focused watching those scenes that keep jumping in, and was ridiculously bored by everything else. I figured these scenes would be the most satisfying parts of the film, but never figured they would make me totally oblivious of everything else that was happening.<br/><br/>But I digress, because it seems like the plotting and story existed only because Marvel needed some time to show Thor off to anyone who does read comics on a regular basis. He is the character with the most ""development"" in the film and his role in the film is defined merely to tease how he comes on S.H.E.I.L.D.'s radar and becomes a part of The Avengers. Hell, they even go so far to only give us small dialogue exchanges, a few nods and two awesome cameos as they build towards that film (unlike Iron Man 2, whose second half revolves almost entirely around increasing audience awareness), and spend the rest of the time trying to tell us who Thor is. I appreciated less emphasis on Avenger lore, but considering Thor is not an incredibly exciting character, that appreciation can only go so far. <br/><br/>Special effects wise, the film is a mixed bag. Many of the scenes on Asgard are simply astounding to watch. They are truly breathtaking, and provide one of the only reasons anyone should bother watching the film. But a lot of the fight scenes are the exact opposite. They move too fast, are hard to see, and are almost cartoonish in nature. I know Thor and his warrior compatriots exist in a place of pure fantasy, but that does not mean everything has to look so preposterous. The 3D adds to a few of these scenes and makes them infinitely more impressive. But at the same time, it also helps mask how terribly composed a lot of them are as well. <br/><br/>Hemsworth as Thor is one of the other small amount of reasons to see the film. He is built like a tank, and has a powerful aura about himself. He easily embodies the character's superhuman abilities with ease, and makes something as silly as waving a hammer look ridiculously bad-ass. He transcends the role, and stays strong throughout, whether playing the character as an arrogant and pompous warrior, or a meek and mostly powerless stranger. He has a lot of fun with the role, but he never forsakes or even attempts to not take the role deadly serious. <br/><br/>Sadly, much like the interchangeable story, the majority of the supporting cast simply does not match up to the power of Hemsworth's performance. Portman, fresh off her Oscar win, is supposed to be a brilliant scientist. But one look at Thor, and she is thrown into a giggling schoolgirl like trance that she is unable to shake for the entire film. Stellan Skarsgård is decent, but he does nothing outside of answer a few questions and hint at future developments. Kat Dennings exists solely for comedic purposes. Hopkins and Idris Elba are two stand outs, but they are so horrendously underplayed that it is practically criminal. I was actually really impressed by Tom Hiddleston's performance as Thor's brother Loki and Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson of S.H.E.I.L.D. But sadly, they can only do so much in light of being overshadowed. <br/><br/>While there is quite a bit to enjoy about Thor, there is way too much to dislike. It had potential to be something great even with what it has working against it, but it sadly just never makes anything for itself. It exists merely to help Marvel fit an agenda. And Kenneth Branagh seriously directed this? You could have fooled me.<br/><br/>6/10."
"blw-37-39855","2","25","63","25 April 2011"," Terrible! Stay Away!
","Absolutely horrible<br/><br/>This movie had to be the most predictable thing I've ever watched. Do not waste your time! Sounded like it was going to be fantastic, however prepare to be bitterly disappointed. <br/><br/>The plot: so predictable, boring, lame and it had product placement in it. Copy of transformers, Star Wars, Spider Man, etc. Nothing original here. Characters: Chris Hemsworth, I know his Aussie so I should support him, but he sucked badly. His acting was terrible!! He was attempting to put on a British accent and he sounded like somebody selling steak knives on late night infomercials. Completely Pompous and fake. It was cringe worthy. The only good thing was that he was hot.<br/><br/>Never thought one man could destroy a movie, however Chris managed to. He spent all his time working out, and no time acting learning how to act.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman: almost saved the movie due her brilliant acting. She will regret taking this role however. <br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins: Seems to be desperate for roles at the moment, he was okay, but his role was so cliché. The costumes were so lame they looked like something recycled from a Star Trek set. I mean did no one think when making this movie? It was just atrocious. <br/><br/>PLOT OUTLINE: - Thor is banished from his realm to earth by his father. -He meets Natalie Portman, love interest there- SO predictable. - Thor spends all his time trying to get back to his 'realm' - his evil brother (non-hot) wont let him back into the realm - Thor hooks up with Nat Portman, (no surprises there) <br/><br/>OVERALL: JUST appalling, Its just criminal that such terrible movies can be made and the general public mislead and deceived into paying to see them. The 3D effects were average, so really another attempt to squeeze money out of the public."

","This is one of those movies that could've been great, but falls victim to formulaic Hollywood thinking.<br/><br/>Drop the unneeded quasi-romance and Natalie Portman, and you'd have a better movie.<br/><br/>I'm also not sure about the casting choice for Thor. I get it, and I get why a lot of people are probably ga-ga about the choice, but Thor would be better off if he came across as more intelligent (and higher emotional IQ). Thor is supposed to be incredibly strong but not a derpy brute.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm being too harsh. The fact of the matter is that the way the movie was done, you find yourself rooting way more for Loki, who is absolutely terrific.<br/><br/>Have a spin-off with just Loki, and it'd prob be a ten."

","The powerful but arrogant warrior Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is cast out of the fantastic realm of Asgard and sent to live amongst humans on Earth, where he soon becomes one of their finest defenders.<br/><br/>I have enjoyed Thor as a supporting and humorous character in the past -- both in ""Adventures in Babysitting"" and one of the early Hulk movies. But I was never convinced he could be the leading character... his story is a strange one outside of Norse mythology.<br/><br/>But here, I think it worked. For me, the biggest concern is how do you reconcile Thor being a god with the other gods of the world? For Christians, there is only one god, so calling Thor a god calls everything into question (in the Marvel Universe). But they made it work here by strongly suggesting he is not, in fact, a god, but was merely seen as one by the old Norse people because his strength was so superior to theirs. Nice save."

The conversion of A Nightmare Before Christmas was worth more than this movie. Don't waste your money on this movie. And by the way don't steal my money by cheaply converting a movie. There are to many other movies that could benefit from this and I'm talking older movies. As for the movie itself was OK. I don't like watching something that could have and should have been better.

","Other than the Dark Knight best superhero movie to date. I don't know what else a COMIC book fan could want out of this film. I liked this take on Thor, one of my all time favorites. Sometimes critics forget some movies are supposed to be FUN!... THOR is great FUN! Chris was great as Thor and so was the rest of the cast. Loki was better than I could have hoped for. Go see it and let's hope the rest of the super hero films coming out this year are just as great. CAPTAIN America!!!!!!!! can't wait!!!! Then the Avengers Next! Man I feel like a kid again. All these action comic films bring back the memories of reading comics and wishing there were good films to match. If anyone remembers the 70's attempts at these characters you know how great it is to finally have good versions of some of these HEROES! Keep it up. Don't listen to the people that didn't like this movie, they obviously don't know what comics really represent to kids and adults alike."
"RCWjr","7","8","16","7 May 2011"," Enough gravitas to make it a good film
","Thor was a risk to bring to the summer multiplexes. Lets face it, there is a lot to cram into a 2hr film, especially one that is built for the summer crowd. But Branagh is able to mix equal parts Asgard gravitas and earth levity to make a film that is thoroughly enjoyable.<br/><br/>Most of the praise should go to Chris Hemsworth who wields the hammer with all the confidence in the world. He was one of the few actors that was in both ""rhelms"" and he was able to give Thor the right amount gravitas and levity when it was required. Sir Anthony Hopkins is the perfect Oden. Tom Hiddleston has garnered considerable attention for Loki, and I agree he is good. But the supporting actor/character I was most surprised by was Natalie Portman's Jan Foster. This is probably the first role I have seen her in where I got the sense she was totally at ease and having a blast. I expected her to just kind of walk through this film, but she brought as much to this as she did in Black Swan. Totally different role and character and totally different chops needed, but none the less she takes a possible throw away character and gave her some life.<br/><br/>The film does a lot of jumping from earth, back to Asgard, back to earth, back to Asgard, etc. So the pacing is an important thing. For the most part I thought the pacing was handled well, though I thought the final act did feel a bit rushed. The 2nd act suffers from the origin dead zone that is inherent with these films. But again, Branagh shows why he was the perfect director for this film.<br/><br/>I did not see this in 3D. Mainly because it is a post-production 3D converted film. So I can't attest to how good the 3D is. The effects are good, the sound design is perfect, with the sound of the hammer being a major highlight. When Thor wields it with all his might, you feel it.<br/><br/>Very good performances and capable directing make this a fun movie to watch. Be sure to stay around until the very end of the credits as we are given a peek at what looks like the villain in The Avengers."
"Silberfalke","10","8","16","1 May 2011"," What a great, co(s)mic adventure...
","Okay: ""Thor"" was not flawless, but I still loved the movie. First of all: despite my doubts, Chris Hemsworth was perfect in his role as the god of thunder. He delivered and so did the rest of the cast. Then there was the great merging of myth and SciFi in the way Asgard was shown. I expected the worst (as I love the Norse mythology and spirituality) and was stunned by the cosmic beauty the makers presented. The visual interpretation of Bifrost and the rainbow bridge was just great. And so was the whole movie, kind of ""old fashioned"" but nevertheless funny, entertaining and with way more soul than a lot of other hero-flicks and recent blockbusters.<br/><br/>The special effects were okay and so was the 3-D, even if they added it afterward (like in ""Clash of the Titans"" and ""The Last Airbender""). My favorite 2011 film so far and I really consider, watching it again in the movie theatre , which does not happen that often as I usually wait for a BluRay release..."
"xosweetox","4","11","24","9 May 2011"," Thor: Movie Review
","I Found Thor easily one of the poorer Marvel Films out of the many that has been created. I think the only ones that are worse are Fantastic 4 and Ghost Rider. Simply because the story is so basic, and you have seen it million times before. The Villain Loki just has no personality and is a very weak character, i think the most interesting thing is in the short clip after the credits.<br/><br/>I felt that the start of Thor started well, and the action sequence was good, but from then on, its just abit of a drain. although their are funny references throughout which so make you laugh, but you cant help but notice the poor costumes and CGI when they are on earth.<br/><br/>See for yourself because some people obviously like it, as its got a 7 on here, but personally i would say X-Men and Iron Man are far better. if Story and shoddy Costumes don't bother you, then you may be able to enjoy this film."
"wootje","4","13","30","25 April 2011"," Disappointed
","Firstly the trailers showed a lot of promise to be an amazing film, but after watching the whole movie... the trailer(s) summed up the whole movie in 4mins. Storyline was OK but was pumped with cliché characters which are almost as bad as spider-man's.<br/><br/>The start was great and really set a great tone for the movie, but after 20mins it went completely flat and only slightly rises at the end! Natalie Portman's (Jane Foster) character was just irritating and couldn't care less about her. Thor went from an amazing character to a tabby pussy cat and incredibly boring and loses interest.<br/><br/>The worst of it is the romance, it's incredible how these writers decided to be so unoriginal and put a sloppy and unconvincing love story which takes over the whole purpose of Thor the God of Thunder.. it's like Troy all over again with Brad Pitt.<br/><br/>The plus sides of the movie is probably the acting and visual effects, Anthony Hopkins (Odin) as always acts brilliantly, Tom Hiddleston (Loki) also acts well and I guess for the first part of the movie Chris Hemsworth (Thor) acted brilliantly as the ignorant Thor but the storyline had ruined his part later on.<br/><br/>If you got nothing to do then watch it or wait for it to be shown on TV.<br/><br/>These others who put 8/9 stars are clearly paid to do so! Because any unbiased person would notice the flaws in this movie! <br/><br/>Character Development is almost zero! You won't care or really understand the character's or other 'Groups' purpose or background! Action fighting is rare and you have to watch a lot of drivel before you see any! Thor's sidekicks are pretty much nobodies I don't even remember their names or why they are such good friends. The Writers dire input to the storyline killed Thor's Character! If it wasn't for the beginning of this movie, it would have got a 1 Star."

It's Norse mythology not Asian or African, not being racist or anything but the Norse gods really aren't meant to be black or yellow.<br/><br/>But then again if you've never bothered reading anything about the Norse mythology and don't really care and just want to see a action movie go ahead and watch this Hollywood version of Norse mythology.<br/><br/>I do realize it's based on Marvel's comics about Thor but it still doesn't make up for how wrong everything in Asgard or Jotunheim looks, not that I've been there, but it just doesn't look right to me."

However I went to see it as I am really looking forward to The Avengers movie and wanted to go in after seeing the films leading up to it.<br/><br/>I am glad to say not only did I enjoy Thor, I enjoyed it a lot. The film is great. It is well acted, well directed and goes along at a brisk pace. The first part of the film filling in the back story was done with a lot of pace but didn't feel rushed.

"screenwriterchick","10","7","14","28 May 2011"," Best movie ever!
","Thor, a movie about a superhero who faces many of the challenges of Earth, is the best movie ever, in my opinion. Thor has all of the great elements of a superhero movie: evil villains, betrayal, romance, and the occasional splash of comedy, making it definitely the best movie that I have ever had the pleasure of watching.<br/><br/>This movie's special effects were absolutely outstanding. The quality of the picture, as well, was certainly outstanding. The portrayals of the characters were all spot-on. Hemsworth's Thor, Portman's Jane and Hiddleston's Loki were all amazing portrayals, and I felt as if I could really connect to all of the characters on screen.<br/><br/>I have now seen this movie four times, and every time I manage to find something different; a different shot of a character, a different joke that I didn't hear, a different look that one character gives another. I believe that every time that I see this movie, it gets better and better.<br/><br/>Thor, by far, soared above my expectations. I was expecting a good movie, but not one this great. I can easily say that Thor is my favorite movie of all time, and I am so glad that this movie was so well-made, and so inspiring and fantastic."
"Meven_Stoffat","8","7","14","26 May 2011"," A Thunderously fun movie!!! Reminds us THOR-oughly of why we go to the movies!!!
","Honestly... just WOW. I saw this a few weeks ago and I'm still shaking from what an incredible movie it was. I tried many times to review it but I gave up each time because I was afraid words wouldn't do the film justice... and now that I've had a bit of time to digest the movie, I guess I can write a review now. <br/><br/>I was stoked about this movie right from the get go. I am a fan of The Avengers, and have seen pretty much every movie that has led up to the upcoming Avengers movie. OK, The Incredible Hulk was tedious and forgettable, but looking past that, I enjoyed Iron man I and II, and when I heard Thor was being made, my excitement level was turned up to 11. Not to mention Captain America is coming this summer, and I am extremely stoked for that movie. <br/><br/>Thor is more of an origin movie than anything else, really- we learn of Thor's past on Asgard, and how he was cast out for disrespecting Odin's Honour, and relieved of his powers with the Hammer. We then go to earth, where a group of scientists have found him, study him, and in a way, try to protect him from a rival research group, who have set up an expedition centre surrounding the hammer. Furthermore, Odin is dying, and in this respect, Thor's brother Loki has been handed the throne, thus creating a potential conflict between Earth and Asgard. <br/><br/>Not many people knew of Thor- Thor was a b-list hero in his day, as was Iron Man. But I feel that thanks to this movie, Thor will become the new Iron Man, and it will develop a cult following of its own someday. Kenneth Branagh takes the director's chair here, and manages to produce a very theatrical, Shakespearian production. There's even tilted camera shots in this, which gives it a cool 90s Flash vibe. Chris Hemsworth is brilliant as Thor, and has adapted his humorous and quirky mannerisms well. Anthony Hopkins is brilliant as Odin as well, and Natalie Portman hams it up- in a good way of course, Portman is an incredible actress and really knows how to carry a film. <br/><br/>If I had one complaint, it's the 3D. I would strongly advise against seeing it in 3D- it wasn't filmed in 3D to begin with, it was converted in post. There are a few pretty Asgard shots worthy of the 3D treatment but just a handful of shots isn't enough. It looked flat, and darkened the look of the film. <br/><br/>That being said, this movie is a clear reminder of why we go to the cinema. Branagh has given us a fantastic adaptation of Thor, and has gotten me excited for Captain America and The Avengers. Oh, there's a Jeremy Renner cameo as Hawkeye, and stay through the credits for a great teaser for The Avengers!!! <br/><br/>OVERALL: 10/10 <br/><br/>PROS: -Great acting -One of the best scripts of 2011 -Awesome cinematography -Thrilling Action -Movie is appropriately paced, allowing equal amounts of action and character development <br/><br/>CONS: -See it in 2D. 98% of the film's shots are unworthy of 3D. There is no depth in the 3D and it looks terribly dull."

"harry_tk_yung","Null","7","14","29 April 2011"," Exceptionally coherent story and extraordinarily versatile cast
","There's no stopping – the Marvel family is coming. You probably recall seeing a glimpse of Thor's hammer a couple of years ago in the closing credit of ""Iron Man 2"", with Agent Coulson from Iron Man puzzling over it. Many realized immediately that it was Marvel family advertising. This time, there is more promised, a lot more, as we get glimpses of Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) in upcoming ""The Avengers"" which brings back the old, Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), as well as more of the new – Captain America (Chris Evans). What a party for 2012! <br/><br/>But let's not stray too far from the present, Thor. As stated in the summary line, this movie offers an exceptionally coherent story. It's something like this, very roughly. Between the two most mighty of the nine ""realms"", Asgard and Jotunheim, a truce is about to be broken as a result of conspiracy and treachery. At the same time, in Asgard, with King Odin's two sons Thor and Loki just about ready to succeed him, a Boromir-Faramir syndrome (refer: Lord of the Rings) intensifies (but with a twist later). When against Odin's order Thor leads his favourite gang of warriors, Sif the Amazon and the ""Warriors Three"" (Volstagg, Hogun, Fandral) to attack Jotunheim (and what an action sequence!) he is banished to Earth (one of the nine ""realms"") where he encounters lovely scientific researcher Jane Foster and her fatherly mentor Erik Selvug. His banishment comes with the creator a huge crater in New Mexico and an Excalibur-like phenomenon that is his hammer (the aforementioned sneak preview). Agent Coulson is of course sent out to investigate. Meanwhile things are happening in both Asgard and Jotunheim. Revealing more specific details will be a disservice to the enjoyment of the movie, even with spoiler warnings. In general terms, I would say that on Earth, the stranger-in-a-strange-land development is somewhat predictable yet enjoyable to follow. In the mythical realms, the plot of double-double-double-crossing is surprisingly believable.<br/><br/>My summary line has also made reference to the extraordinary cast. For the titular role, little know Chris Hemsworth is well cast, so there's no need to clamour for Brad Pitt. After ""Black Swan"", it's simple pleasure to see Natalie Portman in a more normal role of Jane Foster (actually a good role also for a young Jodi Foster). Anthony Hopkins as King Odin is natural, and the same can almost be said for Stellan Skarsgard as Erik Selvig. A majority of IMDb users in the IMDb discussion boards pick Tom Hiddleston's Loki as their favourite character and I can understand why. My own favourite actor (all-time) Canada's own Colm Feore nails King Laufey of Jotunheim, even behind the hideous mask of a makeup. Jaimie Alexander's cool beauty as Sif leave an impression even though this character is not depicted as Thor's love interest as in some of the published material. Tadanobu Asano, sometime referred to as ""Japan's Johnny Depp"", adds an exotic touch to the film as Hogun. Even though it's almost a cameo appearance, it's good to see as Frigga (Odin's queen) Rene Russo who have not had any major appearance for over a decade, since the remake of ""The Thomas Crown affair"". Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson you'll see a lot more of in future Marvel family releases. <br/><br/>There is one question that everybody has been asking: why Kenneth Branagh? What made him interested in directing a 3D comic book adapted action flick? But does it really matter. What we have is a product that in among the best lately in this genre."
"emily-k","5","11","25","25 April 2011"," Hardly a Superhero Movie
","Thor had a lot of potential and I was really looking forward to it, but it turned out it was hardly a superhero movie - which I love. It didn't have much of a plot either, or have good characters. The effects were pretty good though, but that's not really saying much.<br/><br/>I did however enjoy it a little, it did have a few laughs. There are three bad guys in this, one for each world: Loki, Thor's brother who had motives that didn't match his actions which made it all a bit confusing, The SHIELD dude that stole all of the Jane Foster's (Natalie Portman) research (which seemed to include almost everything she owned even though only a fraction was to do with Thor and his hammer), and the entire race of Frost Giants which end up not really doing much except for being stupid and dying. <br/><br/>So with the whole non-superhero movie thing, Thor gets sent to earth and meets Jane Foster and also acting like a crazy lunatic. Besides this Jane pretty much falls in love with him. Thor is suddenly good and wise. Some stuff happens for a while then Loki sends this ultimate killing machine thing that obliterated the Frost Giants, to 'destroy everything', not really sure why. *SPOILER* Thor gets battered around, finally gets his hammer back and kills the dude in one blow and goes back to his home planet. Flies around a bit, trying to kill his brother. When they are both about to fall off a cliff (even though he can fly) Thor's dad comes out of nowhere and saves him, and Loki falls. For some reason Thor sees this as completely terrible even though they were trying to kill each other just minutes before. Oh yeah, Loki is actually a small frost giant, taken by the King at birth.

","When I was reading reports that Kenneth Branagh was going to direct the upcoming adaptation of the Marvel Comics character Thor,my very first feeling was one of mostly excitement,and some nervousness.The nervousness was due to me being a bit worried that Branagh may not treat the material with the same level of focus that he gives to his stunning Shakespeare adaptations,and the he would instead turn the movie into being similar to the terrible 80s Conan movies.Although from the first five minutes of the film,I could tell that all my fears for the film being a disappointment had faded away,and that I can now buckle myself in for a non-stop thrill-ride.<br/><br/>The plot:<br/><br/>In 965 AD,a king (Odin) decides that it is time to call a truce on the war that has been taking place on his planet (Asgard) and the planet of Jotunheim.Just before the truce is declared Odin steals the main power source for the people of Jotunheim,after finding out that the power source was going to be used to destroy a small planet called Earth.With having the upper hand,Odin spends the next years of his life looking over his kingdom,and seeing both of his young sons Thor and Loki grow up<br/><br/>Over the years,Odin started to feel that he was getting close to the end of his life,and that it was now time to appoint Thor as the new king of Asgard.During the inauguration,three people of the Jotunheim planet,break into the palace to try and steal their power source back.Whilst they are easily defeated,Thor and Odin have a huge disagreement about showing the Jotunheim people ""whoses really in charge"".With his father not wanting to risk the destruction of the truce,Thor gets hold of his brother and friends,and tell them that he is going to disobey his fathers orders,to show the Jotunheim people what they are messing with.When they arrive at the planet,Thor starts beating up any of the warriors that he can get his hands on.Sadly for Thor,his brother and friends they are easily out numbered by the warriors of the planet.Just as the warriors are about to finish them off,Odin arrives to try and stop all of this fighting,to regain the truce,he is told that it is ""too little,too late"",and that they all should prepare for war.Returning to the palace Odin has a huge argument with Thor over the action he has taken.When Thor says he did it because his father is now seen as ""weak and old"".Hearing this,Odins temper explodes,which leads him to disrobing Thor of all his titles (as well as his main choice of weapon:an extremely powerful hammer.) For the final blow to Thor,Odin vanishes Thor to stay on the planet earth.After vanishing Thor to earth,a grave feeling starts to sink into Odin,when he begins to wonder if his other son Loki (who would never have become king,due to Thor being first in line) has been hiding in the shadows,secretly playing a game against both of them,so that their falling out would lead to him taking the throne (and there powers) right behind their backs... <br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>The first thing which I feel should be praised about this film is the performance of Chris Hemsworth in the title role.Along with Hugh Jackman and Robert Downey Jr,Hemsworth shows that he is a perfect fit for this role,with Chris being able to do the amazing fight scenes, (which help to show the intense level of training that Hemsworth put himself through for the role) and the more dramatic/light-hearted scenes where Hemsworth shows Thor slowly transform,from a self-centre,blood thirsty warrior,into a warrior that is (beginning) to understand the art of war.After losing her mind for her Oscar winning performance for Black Swan,Natalie Portman really lets her hair down for this role,with a light breezy performance.Although she sadly does not get the chance to participate in the stunning fight scenes,Portman still does a very entertaining performance,with the many scenes she shares with Chris Hemsworth brilliantly showing the natural chemistry that both actors have with each other,which also helps to side a very different side to Thor.Whilst the story,which is co-written by J. Michael Stracznski (who has a very funny cameo) is not as complex as his astonishing screenplay to the 2008 film Changeling,Kenneth Branagh is able to show a side which I never would have expected.For the action scenes Branagh executes them brilliantly,with the first battle on the planet of Jotunheim being a true thrill-ride,with the mix of hand (or hammer) to hand combat,blending in seamlessly with the CGI created warriors and monsters. During the opening of the film,my first thoughts were that Branagh would have his well-known Shakespeare influence be the main centre of the films direction.Instead,Branagh shows a very unexpected J.R.R Tolkien side for this film,with the world of Thor being given a stunningly beautiful,epic scope.For the sections of the film which take place on Asgard,Kenneth Branagh stunningly shows the world he is creating,with fantastic sweeping shots,that help to turn this film into a very epic adventure.<br/><br/>Final view on the film:<br/><br/>A gripping,action/adventure comic-book film,with a fantastic performance from Hemsworth,and unexpectedly stunning action scenes from Branagh."

"maddog-50","1","8","17","5 May 2012"," Thor's roid rage
","It seems to me that the studio tested who would be the right team for the upcoming future superhero movies with the Thor in it. Result so far: except Hemsworth, Hiddleston and Hopkins nobody who's work had to do something with this movie should work at another one.<br/><br/>The casting was terrible, the Asgard-fellows ???, Portman as a scientist is so wrong as casting Schwarzenegger as Miss Marple, the rest of her film family-fellows ?, Kat Dennings, is she an actress? (she can't act, that's for sure).<br/><br/>The CGI, O MG, colorful - more colorful - Asgard. Asgard looked like a LSD-trip of Henri Matisse, a convoluted mess of styles, with ornamented overloaded pseudo technology. The design was awful, ALL the action scene CGI's looked very unrealistic due to the obviously very untalented transformation of motion captures. The storm scenes where very poorly executed. Thankfully most of the Frost Giant stuff was kept in a dark blue, so one cannot see the bad CGI so clearly, and, it's cheaper to produce too.<br/><br/>The plot?! Why Frost Giants? Why the epic war nonsense with the Frost Giants? The Result is a plain simple and stupid palace intrigue, one brother against the other, one (the good one) banned by the father whilst the other (the evil one) obtains by fraud the goodwill.<br/><br/>How does Thor get his powers back? Because the hammer decided to fly back to him after he's proofed himself worthy? What did he do, he just got punched in the face by a robot. I do not get it.<br/><br/>Conveniently, in Asgard they speak 21 century English, so there is no language barrier for Thor. He knows what jeans, cars and cell phones are but he's no glue that in a breakfast restaurant there are no body servants at your command. Well you can script a ""funny"" scene around that BS, but every 8 year old could do that, and better! Everything was very predictable, i mean, how would such a intrigue end in every child's mind? The good one wins, the bad get's punished or dies. So here we only have one white hat and one black hat, nothing in between, very simple, very very stupid.<br/><br/>Because of that, the movie quickly becomes very boring. It ends nowhere, who cares about the characters love interests, because there was no character development at all. The sound fx are mediocre, the score is terrible, badly timed and completely overblown.<br/><br/>As the Selvig character said in one scene, Thor had just a roid rage. And now it's over and he's back home again, thank the goods."

","Plot as advertised seems interesting but is a pure bore as nothing as expected happens and I just kept waiting throughout the movie that something good is about to happen. Thor was expected to be a hero on earth but he hardly did anything heroic. Don't know what the actress was doing in it. And the other punks with him also looked awful and not able to fight at all. Plot was as such taken from the marvel comic character but it hardly did anything new. So it seems you wanna hear some more. Okay a few good things were included the graphics and the boring movie ended a few minutes before the time as shown in VLC. Thanks to long cast intro in the end LOL. I hope this rating brings its overall rating to the place it deserves."
"Payrune","5","10","23","4 May 2011"," Predictable, cliché, poorly executed and poorly acted - don't believe the exaggerated hype
","The announcement of a Thor live action movie was already a pretty blatantly bad idea from the beginning. The whole premise of 'a godly civilization casting down one of their own who would come to save and protect humankind' seems to have been done a hundred times in the past, taken on a variety of forms and interpretations, etc. - and as a result has become a rather stale and unoriginal plot. But even so, despite the hokey costumes and cheesy acting I witnessed in the trailers which further diminished my faith in this film's quality, I decided to give it a chance to prove me wrong, as I do with every other movie. And, hey, it's a Marvel production, and they've made some of my favorite superhero films, so why not? In short, I was sorely disappointed...more so than I have been of any other Marvel movie in the past couple of years, since I thought they were back on track. My wishes for Thor to be in the vein of previously successful Marvel flicks - such as the first two Spider-Man and X-Men films, Iron Man, and so forth, which actually had some semblance of substance to them - were crushed as I was instead treated to a soulless cash-in movie in the vein of unfortunate failures like Ghost Rider, Elektra, Fantastic Four, etc. which relied heavily on special effects or a star-studded cast alone to carry the success of the films. But anyway, enough of the comparisons and onto this movie itself...<br/><br/>From the beginning until the end, we're treated to a non-stop barrage of overdone clichés, painfully unfunny one-liners, a linear, predictable, and uninspiring story...and various plot holes and inconsistencies. The first scene opens with Natalie Portman's character and her crew seeing something falling from the sky and going to see what it is, then we're quickly thrown into the bizarre realm of Asgard where we're given a quick history on it's existence, along with the other realms, and Earth's part in it all.<br/><br/>And from then on you pretty much know what happens from the trailer - bad boy Thor pisses off his dad Odin and gets banished from Asgard to live on Earth with humans as punishment. This is about where the beginning of the movie picked up...but now, instead of falling from the sky a distance away from Natalie Portman and her crew like he supposedly did in that opening sequence, he lands RIGHT in front of their damn VEHICLE this time!! WTF? In a highly predictable series of events, Thor alienates everyone with his bizarreness, gets imprisoned by the government, gets rescued by his human friends, starts bonding with them and falling for Portman's character, she starts falling for him, blah blah blah...and in between all of this is a ton of bad acting from the ENTIRE cast, surprisingly, most of whom try to be amusing by telling jokes or acting oddly, but fail miserably. The jokes are actually horrible, especially from Thor (who surprisingly gets into more mischief than his brother Loki, who is supposedly the GOD of mischief...), and the relationships the characters attempt to establish with each other are either unbelievable and bland, or just plain cheesy...or a combination of all three.<br/><br/>We're treated to a brief over-the-top action scene in the beginning of the film, but it isn't until about halfway through that it picks up again, when Thor finally gets his powers back. I must say that the special effects during the action scenes are quite nice (as expected from any marvel film), and the expansive scenery and shots of the towering Asgard looks great, but that's about all this movie has going for it. And while I say that the SPECIAL EFFECTS during the action scenes are good, the action scenes themselves are often pretty short and boring, and of course...predictable. For example, in the final fight between Thor and his brother Loki, the all-powerful GOD OF THUNDER gets slapped around like a bitch by his wiry-framed brother before finally, as expected, fighting back in a hormonal explosion of rage after Loki threatens his 'Earth girlfriend'. Ooooh, how original and intimidating....<br/><br/>Really, it's as though everyone - the writer, the director, the actors/actresses - were all amateurs and had no idea what direction they were going for. Did they want the characters to try and be funny and heroic, yet turn out unfunny and lame like Thor? Did they want them to try and be mischievous (hardly) and intimidating, yet turn out to be a total bipolar wuss like Loki? In the end, it all seems to have fallen apart and we're left with a sloppy script, cliché, stereotypical characters, wasted renowned actors'/actresses' talents, and a poorly done and predictable storyline that probably would have been better off left in comics/cartoons.<br/><br/>Here's to hoping the next Marvel adaption is better, and they don't rely solely on the popularity of the character to overlook the film's overwhelming amount of flaws and bring in the $$$ - which this movie seems to already be doing quite well, and will undoubtedly continue to do so. But...if this is what the mindless movie-going majority wants, then so be it... I guess I'll stick to the minority who still prefers substance and sophistication in their superhero flicks."

Tom Hiddleston as Loki and Anthony Hopkins as Oudin were terrific. And the chemistry between Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman seemed genuine.

"Starlitelet","9","6","12","24 May 2011"," Xena, Jackie Chan, Robin Hood... and Zeus?
","First of all, I am superhero fan. I research on superheroes that interest me during my spare time. However, I never get a chance to read the comics or more likely, I am lazy. Nonetheless, I am quite acquainted with the mainstream heroes and their groups, such as, Batman, Spiderman, Hulk, Superman, X-Men, Justice League and etc. However, only was it until Iron Man came out that I took notice into The Avengers. Then came along Thor and and news of Chris Hemsworth playing the character.<br/><br/>I had no idea what to expect from Hemsworth, since I am not familiar with his work. In all honesty, I had no idea what to expect from this movie at all. I read some reviews and most of them were positive. And since I am a skeptical woman, I went to my Marvel encyclopedia and searched up Thor. He did not seem like an interesting character, or to be more general, none of The Avengers seemed intriguing.<br/><br/>I remember seeing Hulk, my first Avenger hero movie. I was not hugely astounded with Hulk. I am not talking about the movie because the recent Hulk movie (The Incredible Hulk) was entertaining, but it just didn't move me. Perhaps, Hulk is not my type of protagonist/hero.<br/><br/>However, the same scenario happened with Iron Man. Though, I got to say Iron Man had some witty dialogues which made it more entertaining. Nonetheless, I was unable to attach myself to Tony Stark's character for some reason.<br/><br/>Acting: These two previous superheroes link to Thor because oddly enough, I was able to relate to this lad. His transformation from being arrogant and stupid to noble and warm-hearted made him more endearing. I believe this fine performance and great character representation is thanks to Chris Hemsworth. Even though I do not know much about Thor, Hemsworth made the story and character seem realistic and smooth in a magical sense. Awesome acting from Hemsworth, by the way. Tom Hiddleston as Loki also left a positive impression. I liked the fact that he wasn't purely evil like most clichés, where the evil brother just makes you hate them for no reason. As a matter of fact, I actually felt sorry for him. I thought the other performances were average. They did not make the movie much better, but thanks to their believability and successful deliverance of the character, the storyline was able to flow properly. On a side note, I did not find Kat Dennings to be annoying. I thought she definitely added humor into the movie, which is a bonus. Oh and yes, Natalie Portman along with Jaimie Alexander are also eye candies for men.<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>Storyline: The plot was well grounded in general. The beginning really ensnared me into Asgard. The battle near the beginning against the Frostbites was thrilling and exciting. However, the story slightly went downhill after Thor was banished to Earth. After a few laughs and giggles because of Thor's naivety in the human world and the comments from Dennings, the storyline fell flat by a bit. It might ruin it for some people, but I did not mind the slow paced delivery because I thought it delved more into Thor's character. However, I must say that he transformed too quickly. Now that I have mentioned it, his relationship with Jane Foster felt rushed. Like, why were they together in the first place? I know that she was sent to him to make him become a better man, but they didn't really show how SHE made him the way he is now. Though, I must admit, I was smiling in the theater when they were exchanging conversations. Cute couple. Now, back to the storyline, it's obviously different from previous superhero films, since Thor already possess godly powers. What am I saying? He is a God. This factor made it different than most comic based movies. The way they show the Asgardians landing on Earth with their full armors on was also funny.<br/><br/>There were no subplots other than some scenes linking to the Avengers and Shields. I also thought the little scene with Hawkeye was unessential. For people that do not know Hawkeye, will be like, ""why does that guy have a bow and not a gun?"" <br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>Special Effects: Asgard looked beautiful. It reminded me of the Final Fantasy games. I thought the armors looked goofy from the trailers, but for the most part, it turned out decorous and mighty looking. There were also major details in the background. The battle between the Frost giants and Thor and his friends at the beginning looked stunning. Kenneth Branagh executed the shots very well. However, when Thor's friends came to Earth, they looked oddly misplaced. Their armors looked fake.<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>Entertainment: Bottom line, I thought Thor was massively entertaining. I am also a fan of Greek mythology and it opened me up to Norse mythology which I thought was delicately incorporated. Thor actually reminded me of Zeus. This whole incorporation of Asgard and Earth made me question about science and magic also. I am a dreamer, so the fact that they touched on this binary made it more pleasing. Moreover, it is not my favorite superhero film, but definitely one of my top few. I thought it was slightly better than Iron Man, since it was better paced. However, Thor contained cheesy elements that could have been mended. Iron Man was more intellectual thanks to the script, but not eye pleasing or heart mending enough except for Stark's highly advanced suit and weapons. I also felt like Thor had more heart and not just good special effects. Nonetheless, something was missing that Spiderman and Batman had, but Thor did not. The movie Thor and not the character was just not catchy/memorable enough, especially for those who are not into superhero movies and mythology or fantasy. It still provides a load of entertainment! <br/><br/>9.5/10"
"NZFilmGuy","Null","6","12","15 May 2011"," This One Delivers
","I'll admit I hadn't seen many comic book adaptations prior to this, but Thor may very well have hooked me on the genre. Director Kenneth Branagh places greatest emphasis on maintaining a quick pace, by stringing together a series of quality action scenes. Unlike some other action films, this one avoids such a blinding speed where all other key components (character development, plot, scripting...) are left by the wayside, gasping for air. Thor is a film that focuses on character and plot, and develops these through the action scenes.<br/><br/>The character development in Thor is fairly light, which is to be expected from an action film, but all main characters are developed through the main and sub plots. Academy award winners Anthony Hopkins and Natalie Portman have smaller roles yet provide the acting substance which nicely balances the film. Also, two lesser known actors, Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston, both easily hold their own as the protagonist and antagonist, respectively.<br/><br/>Thor was an impressive watch, the visual effects were slick, Thor's home-world of Asgard was thoroughly polished and real-looking, and the fact that it had plots occurring in completely different environments (Earth and Asgard), was just plain cool, and added to the scale. Overall, the absolute best thing about Thor is that it combines quick and intense action scenes, with both plot and character development. The team behind the screenplay deserve credit for this, because it elevates Thor easily beyond your standard actioner."

","The big bad boy of Asgard swings a mighty force of reckoning in cinema with the release of Thor, based on the Marvel comic character of the same name. With so many great performances from the Hemsworth, Portman, Hiddleston, and of course, Sir Anthony Hopkins, Thor is thundering with acting and suspense.<br/><br/>I can't tell you how much I like this film. There are so many parallels to religious and even familiar territory that's covered in another well-known Superhero flick such as Superman. The beginning of the film is somewhat similar to that of Superman. But whilst the Man of Steel is an alien, Thor, on the other hand, is the son of an Norse god. That's where the similarities end for Thor is set in a mystical and real world with it's own characters and dangers that Thor comes into conflict and contact with.<br/><br/>I can't say that I'm familiar with Norse mythology. I'm quite certain that this film takes several liberties from it's mythical background on which it's based. But that alone should not deter anyone from seeing this film and Thor is a worthy addition to an already stellar lineup of films based on Marvel's comic properties; namely that of Spider-Man, X-Men, and Iron Man on which Thor is rightly on par with.<br/><br/>Speaking of Norse mythology, I can't quite understand why some are in uproar of the casting of Idris Elba as Heimdall. Even though I'm not familiar with the comic, or Norse mythology, I do know that Heimdall is a Norse god who is white. In my mind, Idris Elba does a wonderful job in his portrayal of one of Thor's most trusted allies. Similarly, this dates back to Daredevil(another film based on the Marvel character) when Michael Clark Duncan was chosen to play the Kingpin, whose background was that of Anglo-European descent. I have no qualms over who portrays these characters as long as they deliver the goods, but overall, Elba did a great job and in that regard, Heimdall is a force to be reckoned with.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman has been quite busy this year; what with her recent outstanding performance in Black Swan, she adds another dimension of charm and love as Thor's love interest. Essentially the ""Lois Lane"" of Thor, she is the only human companion our fabled hero has. As hard as it was for Thor to adjust to the daily conumdrums of our world, she's there to help him alleviate some of the muck he has to wade through. I couldn't think of anyone else for the role other than Portman. She's simply great. But it is Tom Hiddleston who really steals the show as Loki, the bad boy of Asgard. Like Heath Ledger's Joker, Hiddleston will no doubt be talked about among comic fans and moviegoers alike with his sinister personality and brash arrogance towards Thor and their conflicts with each other are just....thundering.<br/><br/>With all this added up, Thor is simply one of the best comic-book movies of this year. They(Marvel) took another obscure superhero and turned him into a force to be reckoned with at the box-office. See it on Imax to get the full effect of this smash hit. No doubt you will leave the theater with a thunderous smile on your face."
"cchip96","10","6","12","7 May 2011"," My heart was racing from start to finish
","I was excited to see Thor since the first trailer had come out. During that time, I kind of prepare myself for failure if I have been anticipating for a movie once I see trailers that look suspenseful. Take the movie Buried for example. I couldn't wait for that movie, but I was more than disappointed with it. The worst movie I had ever seen. With Thor, though, I was in suspense from start to finish. My eyes were wide open the entire time. I love how they tie some of the plot in with stuff from other movies, such as in Iron Man 2. If you sat through the credits, you saw the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent with the hammer. I recognized that in this movie. Also, if you listen, there is a slight mention of the Hulk. This is one of my favorite movies. I rate this movie up there with Inception and Black Swan."

","The epic adventure THOR spans the Marvel Universe from present day Earth to the mystical realm of Asgard. At the center of the story is The Mighty Thor, a powerful but arrogant warrior whose reckless actions reignite an ancient war. As a result, Thor is banished to Earth where he is forced to live among humans. When the most dangerous villain of his world sends its darkest forces to invade Earth, Thor learns what it takes to be a true hero. (C) Paramount Pictures<br/><br/>THOR is a mediocre superhero flick. It opens with a shaky 10 minute beginning that introduces the mythology of THOR in a fast pace with exposition-esque dialogue. Here, you can see one of the main problems of the film: The scenes in Asgard are waaay too serious. So serious, in fact, that you might find yourself laughing unintentionally at the damn cheesy lines that are being said by the actors with a straight face. Fortunately, most of the film takes place on Earth, where it DOESN'T take itself too seriously. This is good because the film is actually really funny when it needs to be. This is mostly due to the whole ""fish out of water"" aspect of the film with Thor being banished on Earth. He acts the same way as he does on Asgard, and that is what makes it funny.<br/><br/>Saying that, you might feel that there were two directors working on this film because of the completely different tones between the settings on Asgard and Earth. Since THOR jumps between the two settings now and again, you feel like it's doing a juggling act to try to balance the serious and laid back parts of the film. I can't say the film maintained it too well since I just couldn't take the Asgard scenes seriously. And those partly to blame is on the actors themselves.<br/><br/>For starters, I didn't think Chris Hemsworth had enough in him to play the serious side of his character. Every time he tried, I had to hold the laugh waiting to burst out within me. As an actor in general, I think Hemsworth is great. He CAN do serious, as seen in A PERFECT GETAWAY and the opening of STAR TREK (2009). It's just that he couldn't do it here. Tom Hiddleston is a bit better, but I felt that he sometimes played his character more over-the-top than it needed to be. I can't say many good things about Anthony Hopkins either. I felt like he just wanted a paycheck. However, I did like Idris Elba. He played his serious character without being too laughable.<br/><br/>The ""human"" actors, on the other hand, are better. As much as I love Natalie Portman, I didn't think she did much here. She seemed to just go through the motions with nothing spectacular to do in particular. Even her chemistry with Hemsworth didn't seem convincing enough. Kat Dennings' character, on the other hand, might be my favorite. She provides some of the films biggest laughs, and it's obvious her character is in the film to only provide comedic relief. Stellan Skarsgård was pretty good too, but he doesn't get to show much range.<br/><br/>As for the action in THOR, I must say that I was pretty disappointed. Apart from the opening action sequence in Jotunheim, the majority of the action scenes were pretty middling and incomprehensible. Even the scene with the Destroyer seems to be a rip-off of Klaatu from THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL (2008). I just felt the film had too much CGI and not enough practical effects to make the action scenes memorable or exciting enough. I guess I was spoiled with the fresh and exciting action scenes in FAST FIVE the week before. Overall, I found THOR to be mildly enjoyable mostly because of the scenes on Earth. It's not the worst superhero flick, but it's not THE DARK KNIGHT either. It's just ""there."" Once the credits roll, you'll forget mostly everything about it. 5.5/10"

","Directed by the one time great hope of British film and theatre and involving a pretty high-end cast of talent this film was visually pleasant enough. The lead was certainly easy on the eye to watch as the humbled warrior learning diplomacy, love, discretion, and all the other touchy-feely nonsense essential to the 21st century metro-sexual male-cum-mature Norse god.<br/><br/>The scale of the CGI environments and settings was truly Wagnerian in nature and the film had a couple of reasonably funny slap-stick moments of comedy for light relief.<br/><br/>The film is however pedestrian and plodding for the most part - my children (11 and 13) were both squirming in their seats for considerable portions of the movie. The main battle on a New Mexico (?) street seemed to be what the movie was leading up to - it was over in a trice, though the big tin man was impressive in a Gort-kind of way.<br/><br/>A pleasant enough way to spend a rainy afternoon, but definitely not worth the money to see on the big screen."
"xamsx","7","8","18","21 April 2011"," Thor - A comic book movie worthy of the Gods
","Given his Godly nature, Thor could have easily been the most difficult member of The Avengers to translate to screen. Any fears have soundly been laid to rest though, as Kenneth Branagh and his team have pulled together several interpretations of the character, to create perhaps the most definitive version of Thor yet. <br/><br/>Despite a somewhat information laden opening, the backstory of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and the family dynamic between his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) and jealous brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is fantastically realised, in a beautifully architected Asgard. Simultaneously seeming archaic and futuristic, Asgard perfectly fits the film's ideology that magic and science are one in the same, something that I think will translate perfectly as the Marvel films start to more deeply explore the other worldly nature of the Marvel Universe. The marketing boys did a grand job of not letting on just how much of the film is set there and the production team created a breathtaking realm through a combination of CGI, outlandish sets and costumes.<br/><br/>The film is at it's best when the father-son triangle relationship is being explored, with Hemsworth, Hiddleston and Hopkins all giving very different but equally as impressive performances. Hemsworth's physical, fun loving, but fiery tempered Thor gives the film its heart, particularly during his tenure on Earth, whilst his jealous and manipulative brother Loki, is given layers of depth by Hiddleston, who has created perhaps the most memorable on- screen Marvel villain yet. However, it's Anthony Hopkins' Odin, who steals every scene he is in. Despite his lack of knowledge of the source material, he applies himself to the role using every ounce of his shakespearean nature and overpowers louder performances with a whisper. Much of the supporting cast is never given much time to shine, with Natalie Portman's role being particularly under developed, whilst Sif and the Warrior's Three are entertaining if not particularly memorable. <br/><br/>Amongst all of this heartfelt drama, is also a brilliant action blockbuster. You will believe that Gods can fly and the climactic battle between Thor and Loki is better than anything the Iron Man movies produced. And whilst there is the cross-over element as with the other Marvel films so far (including a scene involving a certain archer and the almost obligatory post credits moment), it's nowhere near as jarring and enables Thor to stand on its own two feet. It's just made me that much more excited to see the God of Thunder alongside the rest of Earth's heroes. I only hope that Captain America: The First Avenger is this good."

Written to appeal to the lowest common denominator of humor and action.<br/><br/>Throughout the film you are treated to incredibly dry action sequences of ""punch this"" ""block this"" ""hammer that"", and duologue that begs oneself to roll your eyes at the punch lines and scoff at the mechanical delivery of conversation. You can literally watch Natalie Portman die on the inside as she realizes what a mistake she made to accept the role...<br/><br/>THOUGH there was one funny line which SHONE above the rest of the movie: ""This mortal form grows weak.

So how it got there and Thor wasn't with it. This film will give you the answer.<br/><br/>In ""Thor"" we get to find out about his life in Asgard being one of the two sons of King Odin. Loki was his brother. Thor's arrogant nature gets him in trouble and Odin banishes him to Earth to get him to clean up his act. While gone from Asgard, Loki takes over as King while Odin is in the Odin Sleep, then plans to destroy Earth. So can Thor get his act together and save Earth and Asgard from his brother's evil?<br/><br/>I felt Kenneth Branagh did a fantastic job directing by using a great mixture of comedy and action to keep the story going. You also had a great cast including Chris Hemsworth, Sir Anthony Hopkins, Tom Hiddleston, Clark Gregg, Natalie Portman, Stellan Skarsgard, Kat Denning, Rene Russo, Ray Stevenson, Tadanobu Asano, Josh Dallas, Jaimie Alexander, and Idris Elba.<br/><br/>So with ""Thor"" out now and ""Captain America"" coming in July 2011, the stage will be set for ""The Avengers"" being released in May 2012.

"Aaron1375","8","5","10","9 May 2011"," Thor was more electrifying than I thought it would be.
","I saw this film when it first came out in 2011 at the theater. Back then I thought it was a rather good origin story and I still believe that. This film is another in a string of films that led to the Avengers that would come out the following year. This one would introduce us to Marvel's Thor, the Asgardian who is the god of thunder and wielder of the mighty hammer. It would also introduce us to the villain Loki, the master of deceit and trickster. Like Iron Man 2, we would also get another hero in Hawkeye; however, unlike the Black Widow's rather substantial role in Iron Man 2 where she even got a battle scene, Hawkeye is in the film only momentarily and we never get to see him do his thing. The film is an origin story which pretty much has to clue us in to the background, but it does deliver a good action scene fairly soon, though the middle of the film really does not have much in the way of Thor action going on. At this point Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk and Iron Man 2 had been released and I have to say I enjoyed all three a bit more than this one. Granted, The Incredible Hulk just about does not even fit in anymore thanks to Norton declining the role further.<br/><br/>The story has a group of scientist led by Jane played by Natalie Portman trying to determine what is exactly going on with the sky. There is an event and they end up hitting a man in the midst of it. Then the film flashes back as Odin (Anthony Hopkins) tells his two sons Thor and Loki of the realms and how the Asgardians came to the aide of Earth as they battled the Frost Giants. Years later, Thor is about to become king; however, the celebration is ruined when some Frost Giants enter the castle. Enraged, Thor goes behind his father back to the realm of the Frost Giants and picks a fight. Odin finds out and banishes his son to Earth, stripped of his powers and this is where he is hit by Jane and her crew. The hammer also is sent to Earth and a lot of people try to move it and make a game of it before S.H.I.E.L.D shows up and sets a perimeter. Thor tries to reclaim his hammer, but finds out he is now unable to lift it. Loki, meanwhile learns of his origin and assumes the throne when Odin falls into Odinsleep. He then devises a plan to take out his brother so that he may never return to Asgard.<br/><br/>The cast is rather good as Chris Hemsworth does a great job as Thor and Tom Hiddleston is even better as Loki. His character is good too, as you just never know what he is thinking as his motivations are not cut and dry. Natalie Portman just seems a bit out of place in this world of superheros though. She does alright, but I thought the girl who played Darcy was a lot cuter and had more spunk. Anthony Hopkins is good, but he generally is even when he is in a really bad movie.<br/><br/>So, this film was good and a good introduction to the character of Thor and his realm. Could have used a bit more action, but they always seem to cap the action a bit too much in comic book movies always relying on a romantic subplot to pad the film a bit. Mad Max: Fury Road is an excellent example of a film that did not slow the film down to have a bunch of scenes of looking into each others eyes and such. I would have also liked to have seen Hawkeye do something other than draw his bow back, he has not really shined as much as others in this series seeming to be just a good archer. He has a few more skills than just that. Granted, the only real target here was Thor so I guess they could not have him put an arrow through the hero of the film's head. Overall, it was good, but I thought the sequel was better."

","I'll admit when when I went into this I wasn't really interested but by the end I was soooo into it and wanted more. The acting was great especially by Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and the guy who played Loki. The frost people scarred the crap out of me. The acting really owes itself to the great writing. The writing was great and it didn't trail off just to give us a battle that was unnecessary. The comedic moments in the film weren't forced and were hella funny. Thor was a great movie and I'm excited for the Avengers film. The effects were pretty awesome. i saw it in 3D but i didn't think it was worth it but there were parts that looked great. The only thing that kinda bothered me was that the battles were a little underdone but they were great nonetheless. The Movie was awesome and if you haven't seen it. You need to."
"jozga","8","5","10","27 April 2011"," Thor - a successful adaptation of the comics and a reminder of the golden age of action films
","The trouble with making a film about Thor is that you are making an adaptation of a comic book that has run for 50 years which is itself based on ancient myths and legends. The comics have been written by numerous talented writers taking in many different variations on the character and include stories that adhere rigidly to the myths and are set in Asgard, or that are modern superhero stories with Thor in contemporary earth (Midgard) as well as cosmic comic book stories where Thor fights aliens in outer space. With the comics this all adds up to a rich, though often confusing, depth to the character and his history – something that tends to be true for most comic book characters that have lasted for a long time: there are debates about what is canon and what never really happened; things get re-imagined or revised – over 50 years these characters can develop and change tremendous amounts. When someone new takes over the Thor comic it is up to them to decide what aspects of the character they like and what they will focus on, and the success of the writer is usually dependent on how well they 'get' the character.<br/><br/>I think it is fair to say that Kenneth Branagh gets Thor. Sure, his interpretation of the character varies from the comic book versions (and from the myths) in some ways – for example this Thor does not have a body swapping scheme going on with Dr. Donald Blake – but he has the main points down pretty well. Its like how Christopher Nolan gets Batman – though Batman is a undoubtedly a more complicated character. The Thor film is both cosmic and mythical, incorporating a version of Asgard that is decidedly more sci-fi than the version seen in comics recently – it's a shiny golden space fortress with a Bifröst bridge that looks like it is crafted from crystals and LEDs rather than rainbows. These Asgardians are spacemen, travelling to alien worlds with technology as well as gods with their magics, but then 'any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic' as Arthur C. Clarke said.<br/><br/>I like the style of Asgard, it looks like Flash Gordon or Masters of the Universe, all glitter and glam – it's very theatrical with the rooms looking like elaborate stage sets rather than complicated but forgettable cgi nonsense. Asgard seems like a real place where real alien gods live – and sure it's all hideously tacky and you keep expecting Queen to start playing or Brian Blessed to pop up, but that's quite refreshing when most fantasy these days is so bland and unimaginative. Compared to the dreadful Clash of the Titans for example, Thor undoubtedly has a lot more style.<br/><br/>So Thor is quite a simple character but portraying that simplicity without it turning into a farce or camp is always going to be hard – see the appearances of Thor in the 1988 Incredible Hulk Returns TV movie. I think they handle it pretty well here. The costume especially is fantastic though possibly a little plastic-y in places and I wish he would wear his helmet more often. I was very glad to see Loki in his helmet, it's something that a more conservative director might have cut out as it does look quite outlandish. Thor's interactions in Midgard are funny without being stupid and are kept to a minimum – such as him walking in front of traffic. This could easily have been overdone but instead the film concentrates on action. Everyone accepts Thor quite quickly and gets on with things.<br/><br/>The action is well done, the Destroyer fight being a highlight I think even if it is a bit brief. I preferred the action set on Midgard to the cgi heavy fighting on Jotenheim, home of the Frost Giants. I watched the film in 3D and frankly it's a tiresome technology that adds nothing to a film like this. Occasionally the tricks with forcing focus just meant that the little people looked like toy railway models – sometimes this just looked ludicrous like tilt-shifted photography. I would suggest seeing it in 2D if you have the option, but then the people I was with liked the 3D so perhaps that is just me.<br/><br/>The acting is all very good. The Warriors Three and Sif were quite forgettable but Heimdall – played by Idris Elba – was a fantastic presence and perfect for the role despite what some racists might say. It's strange to see Tadanobu Asano, one of the best actors in the world in my opinion, in such a minor part as Hogun and forced to speak English, the guy is a legend in Japanese cinema. Natalie Portman, Chris Hemsworth and Anthony Hopkins were all solid. I'm a big fan of Kat Denning even if she didn't have much of a role – she made Natalie Portman a bit redundant here, and Tom Hiddleston was excellent as Loki.<br/><br/>Overall Thor is a very enjoyable blockbuster – it could so easily have been another travesty like Clash of the Titans but instead is more like a happy throwback to the golden age of action movies. The plot is lighthearted and the action is exciting but it never feels too shallow – a similar accomplishment to the best parts of the Iron Man films. It's fun rather than important or ground breaking, but sometimes that is all you can ask from a film. If only more blockbusters were like this – hopefully Captain America: The First Avenger and the subsequent Avengers film will add to Marvel's successes."

","""Thor"" strikes into theaters and starts off the summer blockbuster season.<br/><br/>Kenneth Branagh (""Henry V,"" ""Hamlet"") may seem to be an odd choice to direct a big-budget superhero movie. Some superhero movies translate well from comics onto the screen, but ""Thor,"" the story of a golden-manned, hammer-hurling God could be campy or amateurish in the hands of the wrong director. Branagh has proved otherwise.<br/><br/>Thor (Chris Hemmsworth) is one hot-headed Norse God. The apparent heir to the throne of the realm of Asgard, he's brash and reckless. After a break-in incident by a few creatures of Frost Giants, Asgard's old nemesis, he defies the order of his father, the wise King Odin (Anthony Hopkins).<br/><br/>Thor pushes his way through the galactic portal, watched over by its long-time guardian (Idris Elba), and ventures out to the frozen land of Jotunheim, along with quartet of his loyal fighters (Ray Stevenson, Tadanabou Asano, Josh Dallas, Jamie Alexander). By provoking and starting a fight, he breaks a truce that could lead to a war.<br/><br/>Furious and disappointed in his son, King Odin strips off Thor of his supremacy and banishes him to Earth to learn a lesson about humility. In darkness through the storm of clouds, Thor lands in the desert of New Mexico, where he's accidentally hit by the vehicle occupied by Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), an astrophysicist, her quirky assistant Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings), and mentor Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard).<br/><br/>There are developments in both worlds. In New Mexico, the S.H.I.E.L.D. government agents, led by Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg), are tracking down the unusual atmospheric phenomenon and taking over Jane's research. In Asgard, King Odin falls into a slumber state and Loki (Tom Hiddleston), Thor's iniquitous younger brother, proclaims himself as the ruler of the realm. Loki's dark backstory and motivation is revealingly more complex than a sibling jealousy and deeper than greed. He's a multi-dimensional character and not your typical villain.<br/><br/>But no one steals Hemmsworth's thunder here; a star is born. Any doubt about him is erased; as a newcomer, he will make a fine addition to the cast of the all-star ""The Avengers"" (premiering next summer).<br/><br/>With his Shakespearean language and old-world manner, Thor is a fish out-of-water and hilarity follows. He gradually transforms from anger and confusion to comprehension and resignation as a mere mortal. For the first time in his life, he doesn't know what he's supposed to be or do. Even with his Godlike, muscular stature, there's a childlike innocence and gentleness about him, wondering around and interacting with humans in his exile.<br/><br/>There's a poignancy when Thor finds his hammer, Mjolnir, stuck in a rock, and realizes he could not pick it up even with all his might. Mjolnir is a war hammer forged out of a dying star and could only be held by a worthy warrior. Now this incredible brute strength looks more like a lost little boy. He softens considerably and understands his reprimand.<br/><br/>When Thor faces off with the Destroyer, a giant robot sent down by Loki, and selflessly offers himself to end the destruction on Earth, it's a turning point in his character. And when his almighty power is restored in its regal glory, Thor displays it wisely. The God of Thunder is now a dignified warrior.<br/><br/>""Thor"" is an epic blend of mythology, action, adventure and fantasy. But underneath all the flash, it has a layered story, well-developed characters and human dynamics. Beyond royal rivalry, it's a story about familial betrayal and tragedy, self-discovery and growth. Yet it's lighthearted enough as a pure enjoyment. The only flaw here, surprisingly, is Natalie Portman, fresh off her Oscar win in ""Black Swan."" Supposedly an accomplished scientist, somehow her portrayal as a love interest comes off as a giddy school girl.<br/><br/>Last but not least, what a visual marvel! Asgard is celestially fantastic, fits for Gods - glittering gold spheres, lustrous palace and crystal bridge shimmering in a spectrum of colors. It shines even more luminously, in stark contrast with the dusty, humble Earth.<br/><br/>""Thor"" was my most anticipated superhero movie in 2011 since I attended the Comic-Con panel and previewed the extended trailer last year. As an original adaptation, ""Thor"" has set the bar high for ""Green Lantern"" and ""Captain America."" Like ""Spider Man"" and ""Iron Man"" before it, Marvel has another star in its universe, primed for a sequel.

","You might think that Viking Gods, hammers of mass destruction, 'Frost Giants', and rainbow bridges to outer space would make for a pretty awesome movie. I thought that too. Damn. Thor, directed by Kenneth Branagh, seemed ready to blow my mind with awesomeness. It didn't. Based on the Marvel comic of the same name, the film focuses on Thor, one of the Gods of Asgard (an intergalactic paradise), and the son of Odin, King of Asgard. (Played by Chris Hemsworth and Anthony Hopkins, respectively) After being enraged by Thor's continual arrogance, Odin decides Thor is not ready to be King yet and exiles him to Earth, where -stripped of his power- he must learn to live as a mortal. Thor's scheming brother Loki attempts to take the throne in his absence and Thor must fight battles on both worlds in order to reclaim his rightful place in Asgard.<br/><br/>I found Thor extremely shallow, and without a sense of depth. The film is never placed in the context of reality; half of it takes place on a different world, the rest takes place in a tiny fictional town in New Mexico. Thor lacks a sense of scale, its events are too isolated. I found it hard to relate to, as the film never truly enters 'the real world'. On top of this, Branagh asks the audience to suspend their belief much more than they should have to, and to believe the ridiculous proposition that all of the events in the film happen over the course of one day on Earth. The film takes itself seriously, yet the events contained therein are so far fetched that it is hard for the audience to do the same. The character of Thor is ridiculous enough without Hemsworth making him even more contrived, and poor scripting does nothing to save the characterisation. The supporting characters are just as shallow as the film itself, and Branagh uses them as pawns to drive the plot forward, rather than actually developing them. Thor does at least have some awesome visuals, and special effects to boot, but it is ruined by the unbelievable and far-fetched story, poor scripting, horrible characterisation, and a terribly unsatisfying ending. Lacking both substance and depth, the film left me feeling thor."

","If you are looking for a wall to wall action film, you will be disappointed with Thor. Not that there were not action scenes, but, they are few and do not take up much film time.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a Spiderman-like romance angle for the main character, you have also come to the wrong place. The reason for this, and much of the reason why the film didn't work for me, can be summed up in two words: Natalie Portman. My guess is she took the film for money. She seemed like an actress who showed up on set simply to recite her lines. You can get better acting from a tree stump. Thus, it is difficult to believe that the super hero, no matter how great a nature worshiper he may be, could fall in love with a tree stump. I would have been much happier to see Thor's love interest played by a complete unknown. This would have worked.<br/><br/>The story is slow to develop as much time is taken to set the scene. Eventually, the action moves to earth and it is here that the film livens up. Personally, I wish the entire movie took place on earth. I dreaded returning to the dull life on Asgard. On the other hand, the special effects for this realm are really quite good.<br/><br/>Certainly, the highlight of the film was the acting by Chris Hemsworth.

It is not, also, film that will stick into cinemas for a half a year or something, but it is definitely film that will provide great time watching it with friends.

If you read the studio's description of what the movie is about, you can almost figure out the entire main story line beforehand - it really is that unimaginative.<br/><br/>The 3D use is on the level of ""oh, look, that postbox is closer to me than the supporting cast in the background, but everything else is flat"", which really isn't impressive - or even worth the money to see the movie at a 3D cinema. Even the computer animated stuff looks flat - like it was projected on a surface at a particular depth.<br/><br/>There's a reason this movie premiered in Australia, Sweden and a select other European countries before the US - the studio hopes to at least be able to call it a ""success in Europe"" or post some favorable review from one of the perhaps more easily impressed countries.<br/><br/>If you have nothing else to do, this might be a DVD to buy in a year, but unless you are easily impressed by anything that says ""3D"", or have a serious crush on Natalie Portman or Anthony Hopkins, see something else."

","I absolutely loved this movie. Watched it in 3d and it was amazing. I've never reviewed a movie before so this is my first because I loved it so much.

I was completely sucked into the story, to the point I wanted more when it finished....My 12 year old son also joined me in the enjoyment. Don't forget to wait until the credits are over for that final scene, it takes a while but it answered some unanswered questions for me. Im banking on a 2nd/sequel and the sooner the better!!!!

Anthony Hopkins is an amazing man to watch because he can act and he commands the screen- even he couldn't save this 150 million dollar scam film.<br/><br/>The Hemsworth guy is just your typical ""get your shirt off for no reason other than to show off the abs and fake tan"" male lead (done to death since Sylvester Stallone in the 1980's).

","I know that Kenneth Branagh is one of the greatest Shakespearean actors of our time. For this reason, I imagine that this film was an experiment on his part. The experiment was to have everybody act as if they were 12 year olds doing their first Junior High Shakespeare play with a gym teacher doing the direction. In others words, have the acting be so awful that there is not one believable line delivered or one scene that is not aimed at the twentieth row in the balcony. Make it so broad that even six years old could not miss every nuance. Since his movies with brilliant acting, like ""Othello"" did terrible at the box office, his theory was that if he had his actors did the worst possible acting, the movie would be a success. He was right. <br/><br/>Besides the bottom of the barrel acting, there should be a warning label about the writing. Lines like ""Magic is just science and science is just magic"" are guaranteed to subtract I.Q. points as fast as watching Fox News.<br/><br/>The movie is such a mishmash of clichés from science fiction, comic books superheroes, and Norse mythology, that one is hardly surprised to see a Transformers Robot in the middle of an homage/rip-off of a Scene from Superman II. <br/><br/>The special effects are about on a par with the 1980's children's television series, ""The Power Rangers."""

Thor has to make do with the Earth ""realm"" while his friends try to reach out to him; in the meantime, Thor's sinister brother is plotting in order to become the next king.<br/><br/>It was strange to see Natalie Portman in a supporting role in a ""popcorn"" flick - same goes for Skellan Skarsgard, but they both are perfect fits. The muscled guy who plays Thor is fine and Anthony Hopkins is as good as ever. Loki - Thor's brother and arch nemesis, too - is not the usual type you would pick for a bad guy - does not really come out in the open till the very end, until then it's all about mischief and cunning.<br/><br/>Of all the comic book adaptations this year Thor has been the best - it was exactly what I expected to see and again the post-credits scene hinted a bit of a story of the upcoming ""The Avengers"". Thor - I beg your pardon, dear journalist - is far from being an ersatz: it is - at times - dull, and focuses only on the action, but it is an enjoyable ride until the next classic comes out.<br/><br/>It deserves a solid 8 out of 10."

","Thor is one of the best films of the summer, and its mainly because there has never been a comic book movie like it before. Thor has a lot of fantasy and magic, and part of its magic is newcomer Chris Hemsworth who plays his role so well you long for a sequel.<br/><br/>Thor is an arrogant God who is cast out of his realm by his father, Odin(Anthony Hopkins). Thor is sent to earth, where he meets Jane(Natalie Portman) a scientist, and her friends(Kat Dennings and Stellan Skarsgaard) who try to find out who and what he is. Meanwhile back on his planet, Thor's brother Loki(Tom Hiddleston) finds about about his past, and tries to take over the realm.<br/><br/>Thor is a lot of fun. There are a lot of laughs, and a lot of thrills. I like the relationship between Thor and Jane. Normally, the love interest is always playing hard to get, but you know right off the bat that Jane likes him, and I like that.<br/><br/>Thor isn't like your normal comic book movie. Its fresh, there is no training sessions or girlfriends who are hard to get. Its a fantasy, and there's more of a story here. Director Kenneth Branaugh(?) was a surprising choice, and a very good one to say the least.<br/><br/>I think Thor is one of the Summer's best films, and I really hope to see more of Thor and Jane in the future.

","This film was quite surprising, i wanted to see the film but the trailers did not make is seem anything spectacular but after seeing this film i can safely say it was Spectacular!. Another great adaption of a marvel comic hero. The film starts of interesting and delivers right through, the actors who played there roles did a superb job esp Chris Hemsworth as Thor & Natalie Portman's role.. We follow Thor's journey to return to his kingdom and prove he is worthy after his selfish ways that left him on earth, he finds a different world he did not know and this develops him into a loyal hero. The action throughout the film was great with some great effects and CGI, it delivered some great comedy (notably the coffe scene). It was left open ended and left audiences wanting more to see what happens next.. there is also a after credit scene that again leaves unanswered questions which should be answered in the next film. Overall a excellent movie and a great addition to the marvel superhero franchise. 8/10"
"mormonhippie","9","4","8","28 May 2011"," It's Got Momentum: Leaves You Wanting More
","Overview: The action is successfully balanced with comedy in the form of Thor's fish-out-of-water experience on earth. The romance is sweet and sincere, but not overwhelming. Female characters are given full character (as opposed to eye candy) status.<br/><br/>The story: It's basically cut in two equally engaging sections surrounding the two brothers: Thor and Loki. <br/><br/>Thor's story arc follows his journey from a selfish, arrogant brat into kingly material through his sojourn on earth. <br/><br/>Injected with humor and bravado, Thor's story arc works well because it doesn't take it's self too seriously. Yes, the ""learning from your experiences"" story line has been done before but ultimately Thor is such a likable guy that you can't help but root for him. <br/><br/>(Note to fellow ladies: Thor is what I would call ""woman's eye candy"". He's attractive and muscular with deep royal blue eyes. Beating people up in one scene and being a complete gentleman by helping serve breakfast the next. Not bad at all.) <br/><br/>Loki is portrayed with passion and sincerity. While being the polar opposite in appearance and personality, he is equally likable. His mannerisms, expression and demeanor demand your attention before he even speaks. He also has an awesome story arc that could have made it's own movie. <br/><br/>Only two things I can say against this movie: <br/><br/>Some of the secondary characters were not developed very well. Odin, Jane, Darcy and Erik Selviq are successful characterizations. However, Thor's BFF's ""Lady Sif and the Warriors Three"" get minimal introduction and development. <br/><br/>Also, I would have liked to have more info on the Frost Giants. Despite the fact that they are, as Loki says, ""the monsters that parents tell their children about at night"" the story leads us to believe in their value as sentient beings without allowing us to see them as anything but a brooding, demonic army.<br/><br/>This this kind of a movie to lead up to it, ""The Avengers"" better be pretty darn good. It doesn't have the same director and that makes me concerned because this guy did such a good job. I am looking forward to seeing where this adaption takes the characters though."
"rmillerlaw","4","4","8","23 May 2011"," Inconsistent
","On the one hand, I generally support super hero movies. But how, in the early 1960s, a Nordic God became a modern super hero, baffles me. How Natalie Portman and Stellan Skarsgard got to be in a movie that seems above their level is beyond me also. <br/><br/>And yet, this film wasn't without entertainment. The plot twist, if you will, involving the dynamics of Thor's family, was well done without being over dramatic. The explanation for how Thor gets to Earth is not something you'll want to think about too much, but it works. The helmets, which look like they were designed for the Royal Wedding by Lady Gaga, were something to look at. <br/><br/>What worked best, for me, was the dynamic between Natalie Portman's character, Jane Foster, and her assistant, Darcy Lewis, who says at one point ""I'm not dying for six college credits."" Great and witty repartee between these two apparent friends. Whether intentional or not, the actions of Thor once on Earth were laughter inducing as well.<br/><br/>The special effects were solid, although I'm not sure that 3D really brings anything to the table here. Some of the acting, or at least the dialog, is horribly bad here. I didn't leave the theater waiting and wishing for a ""Thor 2""."
"Krutoon","9","4","8","21 May 2011"," ""Thor"" hits the nail on the head, if the nail were Jotuns and the hammer was Mjolnir
","I came into the theater with more of a knowledge of Norse mythology than of Thor's Marvel lore, which gave me the pleasant surprise of recognizing some of the names from mythology. However, this also made me cock my head at some of the inconsistencies with legend- like how in mythology, Sif is Thor's wife and is noted for her golden flowing hair, but in ""Thor,"" she was a fiery brunette warrior woman who runs around with the Warriors Three, who I guess are a group of Asgardians from the comic who aren't gods but kinda run with them.<br/><br/>Anyway, Norse knowledge aside, the casting, especially of all the Asgardians, was incredibly well done. Anthony Hopkins, known mostly for his role as Hannibal Lecter, plays a wise and diplomatic Odin, who casts his son Thor down from Asgard. My favorite actor from the film was Tom Hiddleston as Loki, who really embodied the role he was given.<br/><br/>As far as the movie itself, I was always really excited about the scenes that took place in Asgard, but not so much so the ones on Earth. When Thor touches down, he spends a solid day and a half on Earth, and doesn't cause nearly as much chaos as I would have liked. <br/><br/>I saw ""Thor"" in 3D, and the effects were great- Asgard was a fantastic golden wonderland, like one would expect it to be, and you could almost feel the chill of Jotunheim's icy wastes. And it wasn't gimmicky- the movie definitely could've stood on its own without the 3D. All in all, ""Thor"" was a great movie-going experience for Marvel geeks and even Norse geeks, too, if they can ignore some inconsistencies and remember that it's a comic book movie, not a mythology movie. This is definitely a film to see this summer. My only advice- girls, try and contain yourselves when Thor is on screen if you go with your boyfriend. It'll be difficult- trust me."

","Well, you don't need me to tell you Marvel movies have been on pretty good form lately. The Iron Man Movies were successful, and the new X-Men looks promising.As for Thor? Hammer Throwing goodness! Now, this movie is just pure entertainment. From an ancient battle on earth, to the towering city of Asguard, Thor has some very impressive background settings.The film is strongly inspired by a mixture of Roman and Viking civilisations, creating Asguard and Thor's species the Asguardian's. It is an interesting mix of alien and historic cultures, and compare's our culture to one of strict rules and responsibilities.<br/><br/>The storyline is simple, but will keep you entertained. It is understandable if fans will see the ending as a bit of an anti-climax,but the main bulk of the film is a good mix of comedy and action, although it does have a few flaws when it comes to a slightly cheesy and unrealistic romance between Thor and Natalie Portman's character Jane. Speaking of which, I felt Natalie Portman had a slight absence of dialogue and her character seemed more like a background character rather than a secondary protagonist.<br/><br/>Chris Hemsworth and Antony Hopkins both had outstanding performances (Hopkins goes without saying) and if the story fails, the relationship between Thor and Odin will surely keep you watching.<br/><br/>With some nice references linking the film within the same world of Iron Man, and an ending that begins to set up Thor's relationship with Shield, I look forward to his return in the Avengers.<br/><br/>Fan of Marvel or not, this is good old fashioned summer blockbusting."

Given that some of the reviews had described the film as average I think they have done Branagh a great disservice as I thought the film was very well directed.

"jeremyfredrikson","6","4","8","11 May 2011"," Pretty average at best.
","Boy, was THOR average. Absolutely nothing on screen surprised me (other than a scene I apparently missed which I guess appears after the entire end credits). Basically, Thor is a hotheaded warrior who just smacks ice monster men with his hammer and/or tackles them and later humans who are guarding his hammer on Earth where it lands in a desert and becomes like Excalibur's sword where no one can pull it out. The actor who plays Thor looks great and is very likable, but the rest of the cast just walks through the paces. Natalie Portman's character could have been played by anyone, Anthony Hopkins seems bored and tired, and the cute Amanda Sefreid is completely wasted and adds absolutely nothing to the proceedings as Portman's pal. The story is: Thor's about to become King but the ceremony is interrupted by a few ice monster creatures who are Thor's people's sworn enemies. Thor and a few of his buddies attack that race's world without a plan which causes the King to banish Thor to Earth without powers as his hammer is stuck in a desert a la Excalibur. Meantime, Thor's brother takes over as King and (no) surprise turns out to be kind of a traitor. Boring. A giant Iron Man looking thing is sent to Earth by Thor's brother, Thor asks it to spare the Earthlings and kill him, which it apparently does with one smack to the face. Then Anthony Hopkins' sleeping king sheds a tear as he telepathically hears how kind Thor is now (he has transformed from hotheaded to understanding in no time) and frees Thor's hammer which flies into Thor's hand, waking him up and allowing him to beat the tar of of the Iron Man robot thing in seconds flat. His buddies came to visit him for a few seconds before this, couldn't fight the monster for squat, and then they all return home so Thor can beat up his brother. The end. Until the post credit scene nobody stayed for. Too bad. I really like the concept of Thor and Nordic legend type warriors/gods. This story was really simple and offered absolutely nothing new to filmdom. Where IRON MAN rocked in a half humorous/half serious super hero way, the Tim Burton BATMAN movies were visual masterpieces, the Toby MacGuire SPIDERMAN movies were fun and colorful comic books come to life, and the newer BATMAN movies were dark and serious, THOR doesn't really make much of its own mark (although lots of the CGI bridge scenes make the characters look like tiny sized ants instead of big warriors when they walk upon them if that's a visual distinction albeit not a very good one). Not enough humor, not enough pathos, and not enough action to make it stand out (the coolest and most memorable action moment comes when Thor uses his hammer to fly through a monster's mouth and comes out the back of its head; the other fighting is pretty uninspired and consists of a lot of punching, basic kicks, and tackling which is fine and fairly realistic but not anything that stands out as extraordinarily memorable). THOR misses the potential to cash in on both the fish out of water and the Men In Black/CIA being a hindrence story lines. Hope Thor's next movie tops this one which should be an easy task. It doesn't stink, but it's just nothing to hoot about. Oh, and see it in 2-D. The 3-D scenes are really few and far between. All they added to the experience was a foil greater than Thor's brother as they made it hard to see when walking down the stairs at the hour twenty mark on the way to the can after a 20 dollar movie drink."
"Hellrazr360","7","4","8","10 May 2011"," A Very Pleasant Surprise; Applause-Worthy
","This summer is shaping to be a big one for action blockbusters and sequels (with more expected this year than any preceding). We got Fast Five recently (with the sixth installment already underway), Pirates of the Caribbean's fourth outing is a couple weeks away, while July will be giving us more than just Deathly Hallows Part 2 and Transformers 3. Thankfully, we're getting some films that are at least trying to give us a tale not told in a while on-screen as well. And one of them just happens to be what is, in this writer's humble opinion, the biggest theatrical surprise since Iron Man in 2008. <br/><br/>Seeing the trailers for Thor, I expected it to be a mediocre at-best film not far from what G.I. Joe apparently turned out to be. But then the reviews came in and, combined with urging from personal acquaintances, I succumbed to what had long-since caught others. Being almost completely unfamiliar with the tale(s) of Thor, I wasn't sure if the film would be able to truly catch and maintain my interest. Thankfully, we're given a pleasing introduction within the first act that sets the stage well without creating overexposure. Essentially, after years of battles and quests, Oden nearly bestows one of his two sons, Thor, as his proper successor. But after a thought-past threat ultimately shows what Thor is truly like, Oden banishes him to our world without his true strength (since Earth is the ideal place for the outcast).<br/><br/>Thor (as a film) doesn't have any problem deciding what kind of film it wants to be: this is an action blockbuster with traits of an epic. The first act has some impressive visuals and an excellent action sequence that the final act actually has trouble matching. Despite the genre being clear-cut and not requiring much (if any) of an attention span, Thor thankfully manages to avoid falling into the rut that too many action releases have. By this I'm of course referring to a lack of compelling characters and, more so, an even lesser tale to tell. <br/><br/>Most of the characters we're introduced to are nicely developed and are quite likable, with one in particular being more dimensional than audiences might anticipate. The cast here is notable, with Portman, Hopkins and Skarsgård all being among my personal favorite performers. Yet it's the relatively unfamiliar lead title character who steals the show (and thankfully so). With the exception of a small role in 2009's Star Trek, Chris Hemsworth was unknown to me until now. But he fits into the role of Thor perfectly, going through his personality with almost as much strength as his build. He's sure to become one to find in future action films. <br/><br/>Thor is a very enjoyable film with just enough action and laughs to make it one that most anyone can enjoy with an open mind. While the script might show cracks here and there, namely with regards to a few lines, most of what we have here is quality material. Here's hoping that Thor proves to be a precursor to other fun summer films to take us away from our daily hardships (which is what most films should do)."

","I have really enjoyed the recent ""Avenger"" movies. I am very excited for these to come together especially sense the characters that are playing the parts of the super heroes are doing an amazing job. Chris Hemsworth does not disappoint. He plays the role of Thor, and plays it well. It is not just Chris Hemsworth though. Anthony Hopkins(Odin), Natalie Portman(Jane Foster) and the lesser known to me, Tom Hiddleston(Loki) all played their parts flawlessly. Idris Elba Plays ,Heimdal, the guardian to the gates of Asgard. I am hoping he as a role in the up coming Avengers movie because I really like the part he played. Just at looking on IMDb though does not look like he is in the filming for it.<br/><br/>There is plenty of action that is evenly spaced out so its not to the point where the action is repetitive or its not to slow. I thought going into Thor that it probably wasn't going to be an amazing movie but it was pretty darn close. I wouldn't hesitate in seeing it again.<br/><br/>Just an FYI at the end of the credits of Thor there is a scene that we will see in the up and coming ""Avenger"" movies. Enjoy!"

","I'm a bit of a sucker for super-hero movies, although I was unfamiliar with this particular character. Equally unfamiliar to me was the actor who plays this Norse god, 27 year old Australian Chris Kemsworth, and the one - British Tom Hiddleston - who portrays Thor's brother Loki. But I'm a fan of Anthony Hopkins, who here has fun as the top god Odin, and of Natalie Portman, who here is rather wasted after her terrific performance in ""Black Swan"". And then I was intrigued by the director: Kenneth Branagh who more usually directs works by Shakespeare (although let's not forget ""Frankenstein"").<br/><br/>The result is entertaining and fun, although the visuals are often stronger than the plot or the dialogue. I saw it in 3D but the extra dimension did not add as much as one would hope. While other men lose their mojo, Thor mislays something called his Mjolnir (his mighty hammer) but, once it's back in his hand, the young cosmologist (Portman) is all over him (so why does he leave her behind?).<br/><br/>Note: Like ""Ironman "" and Ironman 2"", if you sit to the end of the credits, you'll see a clip which is setting us up for another Marvel Comics movie ""The Avengers""."

","This, much like a few other comic book movies coming out this year, is one that doesn't have a massive fan base like Spiderman, Batman et al.<br/><br/>To some this is a massive gamble of a film, I mean, Kenneth Branagh directing a movie like this? But it works on so many levels. Not only is the movie split into two, but this is the first of the Avengers movies that delves deep into the world of marvel, and sets a time line for the films.<br/><br/>Iron Man 2 did well with CA's shield and Thors hammer, but this probably explains why Bruce Banner had that smirk on his face at the end of TIH, but also tells us that Thor was on earth when Stark was having is trouble with his demons, and when Stark met William Hurt ant the end of TIH.<br/><br/>And also, we get to see Jeremy Remmer as Hawkeye, in a brilliant, if totally pointless, cameo.<br/><br/>Thor could have gone either way, Branagh could have hammed it up to a Flash Gordon standard, but saves us with a dash of Theatrics whenever we are on Thors home planet. But strangely though, for me, the best scenes were the one where we see Thor as a fish out of water, when he first lands on earth.<br/><br/>There are some truly hilarious sequences, and it almost reminds one of Universal soldier, where Devereux first escapes the U-sol unit and has to adapt to present day.<br/><br/>Hemsworth, is great as the title character, doing serious, romantic, and funny with ease. Back on his home planet, we are treated to a truly non-hammy performance from Hopkins, which surprised me as i was expecting another Van Helsing turn from the great Welshman. Hiddleston also puts in a good performance as Loki, not overdoing the bad guy routine you would expect from a god of mischief.<br/><br/>Russo should sack her agent though, she does nothing and is a waste, as is Portman, who gets her pay-cheque actually given to her halfway through the film.<br/><br/>The action is minimal, but mind-blowing, and not 3D essential. The main set pieces show some good ideas and are loud and exciting enough. Whwn the destroyer lands on earth and attacks the town, it almost veers toward Masters of the universe territory, but thanks to additional characters,thoughts of He Man soon blow away.<br/><br/>So it's another solid effort from Marvel, another superhero introduced to the masses that is worthy of a sequel, and one that has obviously had a lot of love and effort put into it.<br/><br/>Of course there is the obligatory Samuel L. Jackson scene at the end which makes us salivate more for the forthcoming Avengers epic.<br/><br/>Captain America may be the first Avenger, but he has a lot of work to do to brat this god."

","This MARVEL movie was satisfactory. It had humor, action and family complications. It did seem annoying at the start though. Instantly you can see that Asguard was based off the Emerald City in the Wizard of Oz and a little later, any Star Wars geek or cinema geek who sees this movie will instantly notice a scene at the start of Thor that is a total clone of the ending scene in A New Hope.<br/><br/>Besides the clichéd start it turned out to be a good movie. It didn't feel like a MARVEL movie, but a fantasy epic that tried it's best. Me, I'm personally looking forward to Green Lantern after this one, also Captain America and Tin Tin: the Secret of the Unicorn at Christmas.<br/><br/>I recommend Thor to anybody who's a fan of fun, comics, eye candy or just MARVEL comic fans in general will love this movie. For those of you who think this will suck, watch this and see how wrong you were."

","I'll jump the plot for Thor as the short one provided by IMDb is more than sufficient to spoil half the movie.<br/><br/>Chris Hemsworth seems at home with his interpretation of the young and naive Thor, although abit ludicrous and not strong enough to carry the heavy crown of a superhero in Hollywood. That's not measured in muscles by the way. Hopkins, Portman and Skarsgård do what they can with the script they are handed. Tom Hiddleston on the other hand steals the show in my opinion and brings some character to the otherwise weak dialogues and shallow story. The mandatory romance is unexpectedly uncomfortable with Natalie's character Jane Foster playing out almost as an under aged groupie to the rock star Thor.<br/><br/>The visuals are good as you would expect, but nothing jaw dropping. The many backgrounds have great detail but I never felt any mystique or ancient power hidden in the pixels.<br/><br/>There are some goodies to extract from the movie don't get me wrong. Agent Coulson reveals his connections with Iron Man and perhaps hints about the upcoming The Avengers set to be released in 2012.<br/><br/>If you are still not sure whether or not to watch Thor, I'm sad to say if you've seen any marvel-movie from Hollywood, you've already seen Thor."

"shifeili","1","5","11","1 January 2012"," Not good
","It's a story a 14 year old would write. The involvement of ""usual earthlings"" in this movie was tried very stupidly. Seriously? Thor, the son of Odin falls in love with an (always perfect looking) meteorologist in about three days and then his evil brother makes this an issue in their final fight and all of them are a little bit naive so that it comes to all these? All the roles are a little overacted, as usual, but the bad brother is paiiiiiiiinfully overacted, but this must be a fault of the director, too, not only the actor - Thor and Odin must be total idiots if they'd not notice that the dark, silent always sarcastic and mean sounding guy will be a risk at some point? I know that it is the same in the Greek myths, but at least in the original stories the gods always act childish with a trigger - Thor is just acting like a 5 year old and grows to be a wise man on earth by finding love in a couple of days: Just beyond horrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's a soap opera with very expensive Visuals - such a waste of acting skills on some of the guys in the movie - well, this is where the money is - people like easy entertainment. I would take such a role, too, if I were a Hopkins. The love story due to bad overacting and a lack of time is very unconvincing by the way. It's alright that these movies exist in vast numbers, but I hate that people seriously try to claim that this is a good movie - it is a very nicely presented, piece of garbage - just because the picture and sound quality are very good because of a lot of money, this still is a bad movie. IMDb maybe would need some categories like the Oscars to rate the movies so that people can distinct between entertaining movies and actual pieces of the art of cinematography. This is just couch potato entertainment - hope these things get less expensive in the next years. It is a waste of money. This is just craftsmanship - and very simple. TIP: If you wanna watch a decent entertaining movie go for blockbusters around an 8,0 rating on IMDb, as these movies get rated by so many people with no clue that movies like Thor that deserve something like a 5,0 rating end up in the 7,0 area. All in all: this is not a good movie but just entertainment for lowbrow consumers - enjoy!"

","While it did sag in the middle, and could have used a tad more action, I found the movie to be enjoyable from start to finish. I especially loved seeing Thor getting his ego battered as a mortal on Earth, which is something that could have been worthy of a movie all on it's on. When I heard about the magical elements of the mythology being explained away as science fiction, I didn't like the sound of it, but I thought the movie did an excellent job of this, and I honestly loved the idea of magic as science and science as magic.<br/><br/>While the movie's time spent in the fantasy realms had an extremely stylish, polished, and cheesy quality that made it seem like a live action animated Disney epic (one of the classic and great animated Disney epics at that) , I was giddy as could be watching it play out, and loved how it contrasted with the Earthly setting. <br/><br/>And about Loki, I thought he was an awesome villain. Seriously, the guy's one slick, smooth operating fiend, one sympathetic enough to be understandable yet despicable enough to boo for. He ended up being my favorite character. <br/><br/>On a down side, I feel that the movie could have used more action, and more time in the eye-popping fantasy settings. I do like the Marvel easter eggs scattered across the movie, but it's getting to the point where these movies are being some what bogged down with attempts at interconnectedness (Iron Man 2 suffered from this problem as well). I'm hoping to see a sequel in the future, one with much more focus on Thor's mythology and maybe a more serious tone (not too serious, I still want the movie to be able to laugh at itself, but maybe not as cheesy). In the mean time though, this movie will do, despite it's flaws."

","I re-watched this film yesterday as part of my effort to refresh my memory on the MCU prior to Endgame and while this one served its purpose as the origin story for Thor, it seems dated now and not nearly as good a film as others in the MCU. Watching this again in 2019, this movie looks like it was shot in the 1990's and has almost a Michael Bay type feeling to it. All of those slanted camera angles and quick shots during the action made it look out of touch.
Also (and I've seen other comments on this) the romantic sub-plot between Thor and Jane was just out of place and unnecessary in this film. I'm not that familiar with how their relationship was in the comics, but I realize there was some love interest between the two but it just seemed like an afterthought here and not done well.
Still, it sets the stage for the first Avengers film and does a good enough job with introducing Loki, Thor and the rest of Asgard to the MCU."
"RatingGirl","8","2","3","14 April 2019"," Growth for both Thor and Loki.
","(Pre-Endgame MCU Rewatch) What's great about this movie is that we see Thor grow from an self-righteous egotistical silver platter boy to the more thoughtful and nuanced Thor we see in the later MCU. Similarly Loki goes through his own phase of self-discovery and starts making big (dumb) decisions based on emotion which is his staple. He's not at his best here yet.<br/><br/>Whats not so great about this movie is the romantic subplot which was completely unbelievable for time the short time Jane Foster and Thor had spent together. While I can see some earthling swooning over Thor, there really was no need to add this and it didn't matter for the plot in any way.<br/><br/>First appearance of Hawkeye is okay, they really don't know how to use this guy properly and I feel it could've been anyone else.

It's sometimes silly but doesn't detract too much. This film does a good job at introducing information to us about the outer realms that will be important in the MCU for years to come. The special effects lack at times and there are some lazy edit jobs during some major action sequences. The charm of Thor and his discovery of what has happened to him after he is sent to earth is really a fun part of this film and it is rather enjoyable to watch.

Anthony Hopkins was great as Odin. Natalie Portman was fine as Jane Foster. I liked Stellan Skaarsgard as Erik Selvig. Kat Dennings was over the top comic relief, but there were times when I enjoyed her. My main problem was that the story was full of clichés and was very predictable.

"caseynicholson","9","2","3","4 February 2015"," It Gets Better Every Time
","It really does get better every time. I can say that because I didn't much care for this movie when I saw it in the theater, but after having seen it for maybe the fourth time over the weekend, I'm now prepared to give this film 9/10 stars. Here's why:<br/><br/>The problem with Thor, as a movie, as a comic book, and as a character in general--is that it's Thor. He's at one and the same time a great character that does have a legendary mythical story to his name, and yet the issue is that his story is so removed from the genus of superheroes that are most common and that so many of us are most comfortable with. There's nothing wrong with that, per say, but Batman, Daredevil, Spider-man, Iron Man, Captain America, the Hulk, etc, etc, all have the advantage that their stories take place in the world we know. Even Superman is set on earth, albeit with an out-of-this-world origin, but the extra-terrestrial origin of Superman or other alien sci-fi heroes is yet a different sort of tale than Thor's.<br/><br/>Thor is, literally, a mythical god. He comes from Asgard, and his father is Odin--just like in the Norse myths. That's the first thing that makes him stand out as a character. But then he gets thrust into adventures on earth, and his destiny becomes wrapped up with the earth. Add in the fact that Marvel then constructs a unique origin story so that Thor and his ilk are actually just a race of aliens, but who happen to have magical powers and weaponry that equate to those of the Norse gods, and the final product, in my view, is a jumbled up mess of a storyline. <br/><br/>In other words, I have a pre-existing prejudice against Thor. I think he's great as a character in his own right, but when it comes to actually reading his comics, I'm not a big fan. And that distaste carried over into the movie for me the first time I saw it. It was hard for me to get into the Frost Giants storyline, and I felt like the whole Asgard thing was perhaps as well done as it could possibly be, but nevertheless couldn't escape the hokiness of the Thor franchise.<br/><br/>But, as I said above, the movie does grow on you the more you watch it, and in my particular case the repetition has warmed my heart to the Thunder God, and more precisely to this film. The truth is that once I got past my prejudices, the film itself is an outstanding addition to Marvel's MCU canon, and I can't really say too much negative about the film. The final showdown with Loki still sort of wreaks of the 1980's ""He-Man"" film a bit for me, but aside from that the movie is a well made, top notch production.<br/><br/>Of course, nothing could be as good as that 1960's animated ""Thor"" pilot. Google it. You'll thank me."
"bowmanblue","8","2","3","25 August 2014"," By the might of Asgard!
","Who'd have thought the - not particularly well-known - Marvel comic book hero, Thor, would have transferred so well to the big screen? Most people are pretty familiar with Superman, Batman etc, but it takes a little more digging to know about the 'God of Thunder.' He's the son of king Odin and, on the day he is destined to ascend to the throne himself, sets off a chain of events which sees him banished to - guess where - Earth! There, he must learn to not act like quite such an insufferable oaf and sort his head out.<br/><br/>And, watching him do so is damn good fun. The film's main brilliance is Thor (or Christ Hemsworth) himself. He plays someone who is way too big for his God-like boots. However, despite being a bit of a puffed-up idiot, he remains likable at all times. You'll root for him whether he's wiping out Frost Giants, or getting in touch with his sensitive side while wooing the unfeasibly-attractive scientist he meets on Earth (hello, Natalie Portman).<br/><br/>If you like action, if you like adventure, or if you just want a brilliantly silly film to rest your mind to, this one is it. If you have a sense of fun, whether you know about the 'Marvel Universe' or not, you really should find something you like here.<br/><br/>Also, kudos to director Kenneth Brannah for getting involved with this - he's clearly more than just a thespian actor in tights!<br/><br/>http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/"
"alindsay-al","8","2","3","11 August 2014"," A really good introduction to the god of Thunder
","next I review one of Marvel's riskiest films ever that succeeded. This sees Thor as heir to the throne of Asgard be banished by his father Odin to Earth because of his massive arrogance. As Thor attempts to recover and reclaim his powers on Earth a power struggle commences as his brother Loki attempts to take over. Now Chris Hemsworth was relatively unknown before he was cast as Thor but he was the perfect casting and he truly encapsulates the character of Thor and manages to make this god relatable to humans which is no small feat. Likewise, Anthony Hopkins was a great choice as Odin and he truly brought the fatherly figure into it and shows just how great an actor he is with the dramatic moments he expresses towards both Thor and Loki. Tom Hiddleston has become truly memorable in his role as Loki and it is truly merited as he is a great bad guy and one of the great villains there has been as he was given more to his character then other villains. A couple of the performances though weren't that great, like Natalie Portman as Jane Foster. I think she has been weakening since Star Wars and her love interest with Thor wasn't really established at all during the film and wasn't a great part of the film. Also with an actor of Skellan Skarsgarrd's ability I think his character was a bit of a joke and was slightly underutilised. When the director was brought on some people was wondering why a Shakespeare director was brought in but it is clear with the story that the links are similar with the rise back to power and brotherly narrative in there. However, I did feel that the romance was weak and I didn't buy thor's complete change in this film. The script is great and it really mixes good drama and good comedy which makes this film's dialogue great which could have been the hardest part to do for this film. The style is great and asgard looks great and the amount of cgi was necessary and I wouldn't have changed it. The fight scenes are good and work for this film also even when he isn't fully powered. Overall I think this film is great and it was a huge success for the character of Thor."
"NovaTerra","8","2","3","1 May 2014"," The Myth Lives!
","Based on Marvel comics classic Norse mythology based super hero, the mighty Thor, Marvel studios -Thor aims to bring this larger than life character to the big screen and start this year's super hero summer with a bang.<br/><br/>Marvel studio's Thor, directed Kenneth Branagh and written by Zak Penn is the first of several major big screen comic book adaptations slated for a 2011 release and is defiantly one of the most enjoyable superhero themed films currently in existence. The film covers the adapted origin story of the young but arrogant Thor Odinson, the young Asgardian prince whom is trusted with the fabled magical hammer Mjounir. Driven by the legendary stories of his father's great battles against the frost giants, Thor disobeys his father (Odin) and disrupts the peace between the realms of Asgard. Here upon Odin banishes Thor to the mortal world of man where he must redeem himself and find a way to return and save Asgard from his brother Loki's treacherous ways.<br/><br/>The film is a very enjoyable ride and is surprisingly funny for a film of the genre. The studio could not have picked a better actor to play Thor' as Chris Hemsworth is utterly convincing in the role. as is Anthony Hopkins who plays an evidently powerful Odin. Tom Hiddleston who plays Loki also delivers an excellent performance as the trickster. Lady Sif and the warriors three add to the entertainment with strong individual performances.<br/><br/>The story itself is very enjoyable and has been well adapted for the big screen, not an easy feat considering the source material. This is due in large part to the humour of the script that is woven throughout the story which fortunately makes the material amusing in a way that does not take away from the seriousness of the characters. Director Kenneth Branagh has done a good job at creating the believable family tension amongst the Odinson family and the other characters of the story. As this is a part of the marvel cinematic universe the signs of the greater marvel universe are woven throughout the narrative with S.H.I .E.L.D playing a large role in the progression of the story. As well as other cameos' and references to other Marvel universe forces.<br/><br/>As with most current Marvel films there is an additional scene at the end of the credits which hints at the upcoming Avengers film.<br/><br/>Overall this film is a very enjoyable film for both those who have read the comics and those who have not. It is a tale of mythological proportions that will hold you interest from start to finish. Its great strength is that it is suitable entertainment for more than one generation.<br/><br/>* A Four out of Five *"

While Hemsworth turns in an admirable portrayal of the demigod, the movie's Shakespearean tone, while an interesting selection, grows tired by halfway through. The special effects are, as expected, outstanding, and the acting is relatively good, but the film contains a hollow center where we don't truly care about Thor or the rest of the characters as much as we probably should. Overall, it falls into the same category of ""Captain America"" as okay but not good/great, spectacular in spurts but totally missable.

","Thor was without a doubt the Marvel hero I was most afraid to see take on his own movie. A hero who to non Marvel fans was relatively unheard and unknown of compared to the likes of Spiderman and Hulk. As a Marvel fan I feared how he could be portrayed, how he could be viewed as a believable God/Superhero. Could this be a standalone film or just a tie in needed for the Avengers film to work? When I saw this in the cinema I was blown away! On par with the standards of Iron Man and X men 2! <br/><br/>Chris Hemsworth brings us a hero we love, root for and most of all believe in. On both acting and physique he makes the perfect Thor. Hiddleston is a wise choice for Loki and taking on Anthony Hopkins as Odin was a genius move. Whilst Kenneth Brannagh seemed a dangerous choice to direct a superhero film he delivers on all aspects and his knowledge of all elements of film are taken on board and used with some scenes almost Shakespearean.<br/><br/>To this point Thor remains my favourite Marvel release yet. 10 stars from me."
"drqshadow-reviews","6","2","3","14 April 2012"," Brash, Blunt Action That's Just Skin Deep
","A solid enough popcorn muncher that never even hints at reaching a deeper level. Chris Hemsworth does what he sets out to, making waves with his appearance if not his acting, while Natalie Portman tries in vain to turn her uncertain supporting role into something more significant. It's really two films under one heading, as the developments in Thor's celestial homeworld of Asgard provide gorgeous vistas but no meat, and the fish-out-of-water character moments of the god of thunder fallen to Earth deliver good-natured, if shallow, fun. With a few listless fight scenes thrown in to stir the waters, Thor never runs the risk of growing stagnant but also doesn't give its audience much to think about. It's all spelled out with no regard for subtlety, hammered into the pre-planned groundwork for Marvel's upcoming Avengers mega- pic with the kind of blunt nuance one might expect from a character known primarily for his rash, impatient brawn. I had fun, but it didn't leave me clamoring for a follow-up."
"djmeredith","7","8","21","22 April 2011"," Marvel again shows mastery of fantasy, action & comedy
","This ambitious take on Norse mythology opens (well almost) with sweeping views of a colossal imagining of the other world inhabited by Thor, his father, and a plucky band of his axe-wielding, spear throwing war buddies. Thor is destined to become the new King of Asgard, since his dad is looking to settle down maybe on a beach house overlooking one of those awesome waterfalls.. It's pretty amazing stuff visually and the 3D really works wonders except for the perennial difficulty with darkened scenes, it's hard to make out the detail. But as far as 3D movies go, it was engrossing, not as special as Avatar but miles in front of Clash of the Titans.<br/><br/>I don't think anyone would say Chris Hemsworth did anything but impress. He completely stepped up to the plate by bringing an interpretation of a 'Norse God' as intoxicated and thrilled by his own power, and he really seems to be loving every minute of it (maybe it's just in anticipation of getting to make out with Natalie Portman). He shows plenty of energy and this is used to great comic effect in the 'earth' scenes where his unconquerable spirit having to come to terms with a conquerable body lend to some hilarious moments.<br/><br/>The writing towards the end brought down what would otherwise have been a satisfying movie with top acting and cinematography. What should have provided an emotional payoff with the most pivotal moment in the main character arc was instead the point at which the story resigned to connecting the dots. I found myself remembering instead a familiar moment in Disney's Hercules, where the same heroism was shown far more intelligently, even though viewer could see it coming. <br/><br/>Whereas the audience were thoroughly entertained by the first half of the movie the laughter became a little more obligatory as it neared the end. I thought the premise had enormous potential, especially with involvement of S.H.I.E.L.D as a new breed of government agents. The casual throwback to the Iron Man franchise was brilliantly done. <br/><br/>Can't a visually spectacular, first rate big budget movie surprise as well as entertain? But entertaining it is, just don't expect to go anywhere you haven't been before."

Thor is a good character who gets developed, but i couldn't care less about his love interest or his friends. Loki is an ok villain (here, as a whole in the MCU he's great), but the frost giants are... whatever. It's a relatively fun movie but it can be very boring at times and the dialogue and directing are unimpressive, as is the plot which is just ok.

As a fan of Thor and the Avengers comics I couldn't wait to see how Marvel would bring Thor to the big screen for the first time and I wasn't disappointed at the result.<br/><br/>Thor really helped open up the potential of the MCU by not only introducing two strong and fitting leads to play Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and his brother Loki (Tom Hiddlesten) but the movie also ventured into completely new realms outside of just earth where so far all the hero's have been and have all been humans with powers or advanced technology and uniquely honed skills such as Iron Man, Hulk and Black Widow. In this movie we get to see the god of thunder Thor and the god of mischief Loki in Asgard a new realm filled with gods, magic and the power to travel between the nine realms for Marvels first venture into more than just earth it is done very well and is visually breathtaking.<br/><br/>The movies storyline is strong and well written and gives Thor and Loki pretty much equal screen time building up their rivalry as brothers while also having their own storylines with unique ambitions and personalitys this movie set the stage for the later released Avengers Assemble movie and their rivalry and story's continue in future Thor movies which is great to see as both Thor and Loki are two of the best characters in the MCU hands down.<br/><br/>Thor also included a very brief cameo by Hawkeye not a great introduction for such a cool character but Avengers made up for that in the longrun so it's forgivable.<br/><br/>The movies special effects and CGI look amazing you can really see the difference between this movie and the Iron Man and Hulk movies that came before it more detail was added into Marvels movies after Thor giving us more colour and more detailed designs this mainly due to having a bigger budget as Marvels then new MCU idea was paying off and making box office record making more than enough profit to cover the budget costs.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to fans of Thor, The Avengers and comic books in general this big screen interpretation of the classic superhero and god of thunder smashing foes with his trusty hammer shouldn't be missed by fans."

+ Real life sets are quite well designed to be memorable and interesting and big and layered with lots of background activity.
+ Pre-sitcom Kat Dennings
+ Thor's hammer festival with everybody trying to lift it is kinda apt and funny.
+ Thor's fish out of water story is actually still quite funny. He's a sort of loveable dumb dumb.
+ Tom Hiddleston starts a tragic character arc as a distressed and around royal adoptee.
+ Thor is funny. Ragnarok made it good, but this set it up pretty well.
+ Natalie Portman is also funny and it's good to see her.
+ Cheeky Hawkeye cameo that I forgot about. Useless but I still grinned.
+ I sort of like that there's not some cave-dwelling, stick-wielding bad guy allegory for Osama Bin Laden and that Thor is basically the bad guy even if that makes the third act a little lame and stakeless.

","2011's ""Thor"" had majestic potential, but the choice to start the movie with a few scenes of stunning Asgard and the mighty Mjolnir wielding, caped and armoured Thor - that fans of the comic book character yearned for decades to see a movie of - then strip him of his powers and godly abilities and send him to the inferiorly interesting Earth, to then interact with uninteresting townsfolk for what feels like the majority of the movie's runtime (because it's a boring uneventful plod), was just a cruel tease to the audience. Sure, Thor through the span of the movie has a character arc to earn them back in the climactic action enhancing third act, but the movie's narrative until that return point doesn't make the reward quite worth the boredom.<br/><br/>Kenneth Branagh was, I assume, an assured choice for director of ""Thor"" having been an academy award nominated director recognized for adaptations of William Shakespeare plays. It seemed natural to select Branagh to inject fitting Shakespearean-esque nobility into Thor, heir to his father's divine throne. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't achieve that majestic potential I mentioned. Also, there is unreasonable frequent use of slanted camera angles which is more visually irritating than stylish.<br/><br/>Despite all that, the one merit of unmatched might of 2011's ""Thor"" is its main theme music! It's epically awe-inspiring! Especially accompanying those end credits blasting among the cosmos."

"blackwidowis7cool","10","1","1","24 July 2019"," Suprisingly enjoyable
","Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is an alien humanoid, for lack of better terminology. He is a prince on the planet Asgard, son of Odin (Anthony Hopkins), the ruler of Asgard, and brother of Loki (Tom Hiddleston - did I spell his surname correctly?).
I started watching this movie with great trepidation as I'm not big on aliens, so wasn't sure how this movie would go.
I was pleasantly surprised to find that it's an excellent movie!
There is some violence, but it's actually pretty tame compared to other films. In fact, there was hardly any violence at all.
There is plenty of humour and Thor is actually a rather light, family-friendly film. There is plenty of twists and turns and it's a mixture of science and fantasy with no clear distinction between the two. In the movie, science and ""magic"" are one and the same. And I actually enjoyed that perspective. It's not really magic as such - more odd forms of superior technology on the part of the Asgardians. There's different alien colonies - the Asgardians who resemble humans and are the good guys who help Earth out. Then there's the Forest Giants - the evil alien life forms.
There are others, but we don't see them and their names are not mentioned.
In the movie Thor, the filmmakers drew a lot from the legends from Norse mythology and made it into an enjoyable sci-fi movie.
The animation is really great! Especially with the shots we see of Asgard. This film is a visual splendor.
There is plenty of exciting action scenes that are somewhat preposterous at times, but they are a lot of fun and enjoyable.
Chris Hemsworth is a marvelous actor! He is really good at bringing his character to life. He portrays the arrogant, reckless, self-righteous guy really well. When Thor ends up on Earth, he is a real fish out of water. Hemsworth does it excellently and I was laughing so hard watching Thor trying to understand Earth and the way we do things.
Tom Hiddleston is great as Loki, Thor's adoptive brother and the villain of the movie. He is very likeable despite having evil intentions. Loki is a very complicated character and there's more to him than meets the eye. Hiddleston does his role excellently.
Natalie Portman is great as Jane, a scientist and Thor's love interest. She does the socially awkward scientist role really well. Idris Elba is awesome and can be quite comic at times and is a great actor. Ray Stevenson is good and provides lots of comic relief. I really liked how the Asgardians, while technologically superior to us humans, talk old style and dress like ancient warriors. It provided lots of laughs.
Anthony Hopkins is great as Odin, Thor and Loki's father and the old wise king. I also love the romantic subplot between Jane and Thor. It was handled very well.
You could argue that some parts are cheesy and cliched. While that might possibly be true, it's an enjoyable cheesy. It's still a lot of fun and I love the 'cheesy' parts - they are handled very well. This certainly isn't a film for everybody. Not everyone will like it and that's okay. That's them and their tastes and preferences. But this is me and my tastes and preferences. I love it. You may not and that's totally fine as well. We're all different.
It's a really great movie with a great and relevant message. Plenty of twists and turns and has great character development. Everything is handled marvellously. It is well-written and well executed. I totally enjoy this movie - it's not meant to be realistic, just a lot of fun and excitement. Great animation, great acting. An entertaining movie that I strongly recommend watching if you haven't already."
"alexglimbergwindh","6","1","1","7 April 2019"," Meh
","Just re-watched the movie. It's really neither good or bad. It's just meh. Boring fight scenes. Side characters are there for filler. Nobody to care about besides heimdal maybe. Chris Hemsworth is the perfect Thor though. Thank God he was cast. It's a good popcorn movie. Don't expect any depth from this one. Sadly... Weak 6/10"
"staticstation1","Null","1","1","5 April 2019"," THOR, THE MIGHT AVENGER!
","Thor I would say is not my personal go-to superhero. I knew of him. I'd seen the character in different forms of media and comic books, but he was never the standout for me. I was young when this film was upon release and I was very little aware of the film's existence or it's placement in the MCU. The moment I found out about the connection was in the Iron Man 2 post-credits scene. If you read my review for that, you'll see that I didn't exactly watch the film until it's home release. I wasn't aware that the post-credits were a trend at the time. After watching the first Thor trailer and then researching it, I came across the scene. Now again I didn't watch this film in cinemas. I watched it with a close friend, and we were both mildly impressed. And over the years I have seen and read many mixed reviews, but I still maintain that this is one of the better produced and made films in the MCU!
POSITIVES!
Now I understand the audience reactions that come from this film. Ones that think because the character isn't kicking ass throughout the film that it's boring. I don't think that at all. There is action. Not an insane amount, but enough to show you what the character can do. But this is a great character arc. One, I thought, so great that it made Thor my favourite Avenger for a time. This is something I love about the plot and writing. This is a character driven story with a character that rises above selfishness and arrogance. The writing overall has a very Shakespeare charm about it. A story about family, and, brotherhood. Tom Hiddleston portrays the antagonist in this film, and he is brilliant. You instantly understand his motive and the actor's approach to a ""villain"" and so well deserving of the praise the character and actor has received throughout the MCU. But this film is packed full of amazing talent. Whether they a good or not, the actors that are involved are all talented in their acting background. I must praise rich and unblemished cinematography. This is a beautiful film to look at. The visual effects are stunning as well as is the artwork behind them. It is a great blend of having these God-like characters in this comic book world. The costume and makeup departments have very immaculate work. Brilliant sound design, particularly with Thor's Might Hammer, Mjolnir. A pungent score, that I think is improved on, but it works for this film.
MIXED!
Chris Hemsworth stars in the title role. An actor that had only gotten a starring role on soap-operas in Australia. This was the big break for the actor, and he is okay. Obviously over the course of his own and The Avengers' franchises he has really delivered an entertaining character. But in this film, he is adequate. Now the director of this film Kenneth Branagh does a fine job. Some of his camerawork was a bit off, especially with the dutch-angles. But I feel as if his main intention in this film was to deliver a grand scale epic drama rather than a comic book film.<br/><br/>NEGATIVES!
Natalie Portman is a fine actress. There is no doubting that. But the chemistry she has with Hemsworth feels very much like acting than natural. Portman feels miscast. Like I said before there is a lot of talent in this film, but some of that talent feels wasted. Particularly with Idris Elba. I keep forgetting that the actor is in the MCU. And the actor never really shows off his incredible range in any of the films he is showcased in. Now my biggest complaint would be, despite the filmmaking in this project, the film isn't as enjoyable as other entries in the superhero genre. The urge to rewatch this film isn't very potent. It is a great character arc and the audiences that criticize the film for not having as many action sequences do have just opinions.
CONCLUSION!
So, Thor I enjoy for its filmmaking troupes. I enjoy the character more than the performance. The antagonist, for sure, outshines the protagonist. It is a great expansion and departure for comic book films and the MCU. Delivers a brand-new character and one of the most powerful Avengers. It is a bit hit or miss for audiences and I understand that. But there is more to enjoy than dislike for me."
"Spiderfan19","8","1","1","24 February 2019"," Spectacular
","Wow, this one absolutely blew me away. I can remember thinking that this was just an okay MCU movie, but now it's one of my favorites. This is a film that gets better as it goes on. The first half is a bit weak at some parts, such as the jarring transition to Earth. The rest, though, is great. The scene where Thor gets Mjolnir back is probably one of my favorite scenes from Phase 1."

","When I heard that there was going to be a Thor movie, it got me curious. I love Norse mythology and all the gods and demigods and other characters from those aforementioned legends and I had only heard about Thor as a comic book, but it was cool. Anthony Hopkins as the leader of Asgard; Odin himself. One of my favorite Norse gods. Some of the characters were a little hard to follow but this was the first time in a long while I had seen Rene Russo, who played Odin's wife Frigg. She did very well. Lots of action and Loki, the mischief-maker of Asgard himself, steals the show. I'd never even heard of Tom Hiddleston until this movie, but he seems very cool. If you're looking for a movie to watch before tackling the Avengers saga, start here, along with Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, and the others. Tell them I sent you."

Chris Hemsworth brings the beloved comic book character to the screen in a fun way that allows sereous moments. He truly captures the attitude of Thor perfectly. Tom Hiddleston does a fantastic job bringing Loki to us in a way that makes you feel compassion towards the character yet still want him to be taken down by the hero. He shows a truly clever yet damaged person. Just a marvelous film with actors that work perfectly for their roles."

","After getting exiled from Asgard as a result of his foolish and disrespectful actions, Thor is sent to Midgard (Earth) as an ordinary man.

Being faced with this new exiled status, Thor's character must evolve from a spoiled and self-centered boy to a prince worthy of his father's crown. And this is exactly what this movie is about, with a bit of positive and negative help from the inhabitants of earth. The movie is filled with action sequences, which, accompanied by some wonderful CGI, make it a very good watch. The plot is good for this ""introduction"", but nothing extraordinary, with a bit of drama here and there and a bit of suspense, but again, nothing that can wow the viewer in any way. The producers decided to take a quite serious approach regarding this one, with little comedy aspects silently inserted from time to time, very good for changing the mood.<br/><br/>As said before, it's an intro movie, designed to present Thor and his fantastic world, clearly leaving plenty of space for future sequels, which is to be seen for its action and CGI, aspects at which it is very good.

"RossRivero99","9","1","1","2 April 2017"," A well made superhero movie
","Kenneth Branagh's ""Thor"" is one of the best movies that MARVEL comics has ever made along with he other franchises that they have done and practically strikes the right chords every time, and is directed by a man who at the time was very inexperienced with making these types of movies. The movie stars Chris Hemsworth who is perfectly cast as Thor (who also happens to be my second favorite hero in the MARVEL universe) who is the Norse god of thunder, and lives in a realm known as Asgard. Thor is also a man who believes in doing the right thing but sometimes he also lets his morals get to his head a little too often. Thor's father is a god the vikings would pray to named Odin (Anthony Hopkins) who is married to Frigga (Rene Russo), and they only have another child who is very similar to Joaquin Phoenix's Commodus in ""Gladiator"" (2000) and is obsessed with ruling Asgard, who happens to be Thor's brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) who is the god of mischief. Later as the film progresses we see Thor get exiled from Asgard for talking disrespectfully to his father and he sees himself on earth and then goes on a rampage and is then taken in by SHIELD agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) for questioning. After the interrogation is over he meets a young woman named Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), who is with her family just so that they can get to know who Thor is, and during that time his personality changes from being less arrogant to being a lot more caring towards humans who he previously felt were inferior to him. The visual effects in this movie were breathtaking to see and not only is Hemsworth perfectly cast but Hopkins is as well and deliver fine performances, along with Portman, Russo, and Hiddleston, but as well as Idris Elba as Heimdall, and Stellan Skarsgard as a teacher. But however even though the movie is very good the only thing that prevents it from being great is a routinely frequent problem with MARVEL movies is that some times they really don't get the costumes right which is the case with Thor's costume even though they nailed most of it they just forgot his winged helmet even though this isn't really a major problem for me. Even though this isn't a perfect superhero movie it is one of the best movies that MARVEL and their creator Stan Lee have ever come up with and is one of the best superhero movies of 2011 and of this decade."
"kmtwalsh","8","1","1","22 July 2016"," Thor brought to the big screen
","Thor carries on the marvel torch that had seen the Hulk films and Iron Man come before it. <br/><br/>I will admit I do like the Marvel characters but find myself struggling with the science incorporated into the stories and find that it can go over my head, I focus more on the characters development in the films.<br/><br/>The simple plot line without the science is Thor, son of Odin is cast out of Asgard for endangering it by nearly causing a war with their enemy the Frost Giants. As a result, his father takes his power away and sends him to earth. Thor ends up in New Mexico where he crashes into Dr Jane Foster, an astrophysicist played by Natalie Portman, her mentor Erik Selvig played by Stellan skarsgard and assistant Darcy. Thor struggles to deal with his mortality but through his interactions with his new friends he becomes a better person and less arrogant. <br/><br/>Chris Hemsworth rocks as Thor, I haven't seen the comics but he just fits what you expect a son of Odin to look like. I think it is one of the harder roles to play as he does start off as a very arrogant ass and could have been dislikeable but Chris is so likable that you find yourself overlooking his negative traits and I enjoyed seeing him change into a more humble character that realises he hasn't got all the answers but still tries anyway.<br/><br/>Tom Hiddleston plays another complex character in the film that if it had been played by a different actor could have been a dislikeable character. Loki is not a one dimensional villain and although he is a villain, he can be engaging as he does have have qualities that make him not as bad as he seems at times.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman was alright as Jane Foster but I don't think the role was that interesting. Anthony Hospkins as usual commands the screen. <br/><br/>I enjoyed the film very much particularly the early scenes when he lands on Earth are very funny such as him getting tasered by Darcy and the hospital scene. Other standouts for me is the unpredictable nature of Loki when you expect him to go one way and he goes in a totally different direction and the battle between Loki and Thor at the end of the film.<br/><br/>I was surprised that Kenneth Branagh, Shakespearean actor and director directed the film but as you watch the film you can see that he enjoys the subject matter and understands the characters. He was the right person to take the story to the big screen."

","(Full disclosure - Thor was my favorite comic/hero as a kid, so this may get rated higher as a result...or maybe I just think this movie is better than everyone else.)<br/><br/>The good - Very strong (and fun) supporting cast. Kat Dennings and Stellan Skarsgård outshine Natalie Portman on Earth, and Jamie Alexander as Sif, with her warriors three, kick ass in Asgard. Throw in Clark Gregg, Jeremy Renner and Idris Elba and you have the deepest (in quality and quantity) of any cast so far in the MCU. Yet, (with the possible exception of the warriors three) I felt they were more than just one dimensional characters.<br/><br/>The great - The relationship between Loki and Thor was bang on perfect. I also bought Loki's transition from mischief maker to truly evil. I also bought Thor's transition...his moment at the hammer was powerful. Hemsworth's Thor and Hiddleston's Loki are perfect for me, Loki being the harder role to pull off.<br/><br/>The only so-so - As hot as Natalie Portman is, has she ever been able to pull off any on- screen chemistry with her co-stars (Black Swan excluded...hubba hubba)? I half wanted Thor to end up with Darcy!<br/><br/>Summary - I really like this movie. It's subject matter is a bit freaky, so it is never going to have the impact of something like Iron Man's redemption story, but it is a fun romp. The movie is very funny at times (with some wonderful physical comedy from Hemsworth) and I found parts of it moving. I haven't watched this one for a while (half fearing it wouldn't live up to my original affection), but it is a movie I could see myself returning to again."

Other than that, I thought this movie was OK with the beginning being the best part and I didn't care for the ending. The first 45 minutes was very entertaining with some good special effects. Basically the first part is about Thor's people and their conflict with the frost giants. The frost giants invade and Thor with his other brother, Loki, and friends go to the frost giant land looking to start a war. We see some of the cool powers Thor has with his hammer. But the King is furious and banishes Thor to earth minus his powers and that's when the movie starts to get duller. He meets scientist, Natalie Portman, whom of course he falls for. I thought there should have been funnier scenes between Thor and regular people. He gets in trouble with the Feds, but just gets released, then the ending is this giant robot that is some how controlled by Loki from the other planet. Then the final battle between Thor and Loki, I just thought the latter scenes were not as entertaining.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: If you like the comic book movies, then I'm sure you will want to see this."
"ThreeGuysOneMovie","7","1","1","22 September 2011"," Hemsworth brings warmth and humor to Bombastic Thor
","My expectations were set pretty low with this film. I am a bit of a comic nerd but was never really that into the Thor books. Most of my interactions with the character were from his role in the Avengers. As a kid I just never really related to his bombastic personality and was fairly ignorant of his Norse God back story.<br/><br/>This film more than enlightened me to the wonders of the Norse God of Thunder. Chris Hemsworth portrays an unbelievably ripped Thor the god of thunder in this picture. The plot centers on Thor being cast out of Asgard by his father King Odin (Anthony Hopkins). Thor is ousted for disobeying his father's commands and almost starting a war with the frost giants. He is banished to earth and stripped of his godly powers and his mighty hammer mjolnir. When he reaches earth he runs into, literally, scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman). The rest of the film centers on Thor trying to get his powers back and help his Father Odin who is gravely injured.<br/><br/>The story itself focused extensively on the Thor Norse god origin story. More than half the picture does not take place with Thor on earth. Thankfully his bombastic personality was juxtaposed with humor and a budding romance with Jane. The cast in this film was top notch and I especially enjoyed Hopkins as mighty god king Odin and Portman as the sexy scientist Jane. <br/><br/>The movie has some awesome looking special effects and CGI created monsters. The kingdom of Asgard that is depicted is truly something to behold. The action is fast and plentiful throughout the film, with just enough time to catch your breath and get your bearings. Your speakers will also be getting a workout from the sounds of mighty combat. Although the action might be a little over the top for some I found it fun escapism.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I can't really address if the film sticks to the Marvel comics canon. As stated previously I am just not that familiar with the Thor series. I did however catch a sweet Cameo by Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Stan Lee makes his usual drop in. <br/><br/>In summation this is well worth a rental for and a viewing in your lair. While not the greatest superhero movie of all time it was certainly entertaining. Without a doubt it whets my appetite even more to hear Avengers assemble!"
"gradyharp","Null","1","1","14 September 2011"," One of the Better Comic Book Transfers!
","Not being a fan of Marvel Comics or of the endless transformations into cinema that these silly stories are seeing, THOR was not high on the list to view. Seeing it without the 3D variation that accompanied the theatrical release was a further detriment in deciding to watch it, but when a director of the caliber of Kenneth Branagh and a cast of both seasoned performers and exciting new faces pass the credit notification then it is tempting to give it a try. The surprise is that this is a very entertaining movie. There is a lot of CGI business that probably in 3D was even more beautiful (the rainbow bridge, the ice realm etc), but even in regular vision the sets and designs are truly beautiful. Some viewers might expect a version of the Viking gods adventure, but this is clearly a fairy tale version - tripping between the earth realm and the home of the gods, and that in and of itself make the film more enjoyable: it doesn't seem to take itself too seriously and that is refreshing. <br/><br/>Odin (Anthony Hopkins) rules Asgard and has two sons - Thor (Chris Hemsworth, an Adonis with a very magnetic screen presence) and Loki (Tom Hiddleston) - by his devoted wife Frigga (Rene Russo). Odin is about to pass his crown to Thor when the latter makes some wrong decisions and is cast out of the kingdom and lands in New Mexico where he encounters a scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her father Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård) and weirdo friend Darcy (Kat Dennings). From Jane, Thor learns kindness, compassion and love and has become more the son that Odin desired. Meanwhile back at home Loki is taking over (being the true son of King Laufey (Colm Feore) and as Odin lies dying Thor's buddies - Volstagg (Ray Stevenson), Hogun (Tadanobu Asano), Fandral (Josh Dallas, a real find!), and Sif (Jaimie Alexander) with a bit of help from the gatekeeper Heimdall (Idris Elba) - descend to earth to aid Thor is becoming the quality of king he should be, etc etc <br/><br/>In addition to the named cast there is a very very brief appearance by Jeremy Renner that just may be a signal that the followup THE AVENGERS will be around soon. The movie has a lot going for it, especially it the audience can sit back and enjoy the comic book atmosphere of this mixture of make believe and real life people. It is surprisingly successful! <br/><br/>Grady Harp"
"DICK STEEL","9","6","15","28 April 2011"," A Nutshell Review: Thor
","One of the main issues with the ambitious Avengers film is the introduction of the less than scientific, reality based elements of the Marvel films and characters to date, where radiation is root cause for the creation of The Hulk, Fantastic Four and Spider-man, and technology behind the likes of Tony Stark's Iron Man, meaning they're not too far fetched if you're a fan of science fiction. Even gene mutation still falls within the boundaries of believability. But with Thor comes something from the magical and fantasy realm, which undoubtedly will open the door to more powerful villains not bounded by the laws of physics at least, but still with the villain possessing incredible powers, unless the story is compelling, we're going to find ourselves stuck with a massively powerful hero, what more when he's a god?<br/><br/>Which is what made Thor somewhat a refreshing change in the way comic book heroes are portrayed in recent years, whether DC (who will have its hands full with Superman, sharing the same pain points), or Marvel. Enter Kenneth Branagh to try and make Thor more palatable to the reality so far in the Marvel film base, hitting it off where Iron Man 2 had hinted at its ending, before introducing us to a brief history of Asgard and Odin (Anthony Hopkins), together with his sons Thor and Loki and that aged old feud with the Frost Giants. In fact the story by J. Michael Straczynski and Mark Protosevich is already found in the theatrical trailers, with the arrogant Thor (Chris Hemsworth) being cast from his would be throne and onto Earth, and finding himself to be quite the mortal without his mythical hammer Mjolnir which he has to find with the help of scientists Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her friends Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) and Darcy (Kate Dennings).<br/><br/>AS I mentioned earlier, the story is purely functional at this stage, going from scene to scene in quite the fish out of water fashion where the Nordic god of thunder finds himself caught up in poor slapstick comedy (how many times can he be hit by a vehicle?). Redemption doesn't come easy for the big guy even as he's made to feel guilty for his misdeeds when on Asgard that his brother never failed to remind him of, making Loki (Tom Hiddleston) chief villain just because he's looking toward being the favoured son of Odin. Yes the main villain of the story uses more of his brains than brawn, but is no pushover when the situation calls for a more physical response.<br/><br/>And the battle sequences impressed, which is kind of a surprise since I never associated Branagh as one who can film kinetically charged action for the big screen. With Thor's magical prowess brought about by Mjolnir, the CG here lives up in crafting the kind of extravaganza and incredible spectacle when Thor wields his trusty hammer into battle, twirling, throwing, flying and calling in some mean looking, bad weather associated reinforcements. A film like this couldn't possibly be done years ago, and technology coupled with an artistic team's imagination and reference from Thor's source material, made the big battle sequences interesting. But I will add that one should steer clear of 3D since it's converted in post production, with nothing that truly stood out to justify the viewing in 3D.<br/><br/>Chris Hemsworth was a relatively unknown Australian, but I guess like Hugh Jackman this could be his ticket into the big league, having to look the part of the hero and portray him to a T with that streak of arrogance that required a lesson in humility and about the sanctity of life. Yes although it doesn't call for tremendous acting chops, I suppose looking the part and playing it convincingly with those rippling muscles, is already half the battle won. Anthony Hopkins lends that bucket load of gravitas as Odin (just as how Liam Neeson's Zeus in the Clash of the Titans remake was welcomed), while Tom Hiddleston as Loki provided that conflicting villain who's an excellent liar corrupted by power.<br/><br/>While it has the benefit of Hollywood It Girl Natalie Portman counted amongst its ranks as the main squeeze that Thor falls for, the romance here is a little bit stretched as well, since the two hardly spend quality time together to develop genuine feelings, with Jane sealing the deal just because Thor looks good when he got his groove back, armour, weapon and all, together with that sparkle in those blue eyes surrounded by those golden facial locks. The characterization of Jane Foster is wafer thin, and the love story lacked any real emotional depth, relying on a mere summary of someone else's narration than to come from pure feelings, but I guess having her around lends star appeal to the film.<br/><br/>And as for cameos (look away now if you choose not to be spoilt), well, look out for Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye who saved all nuances of action for Avengers, and Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury making his much ado about nothing appearance in the coda after the film proper, although in Thor's case it turned out to be a little bit weaker since it's supposed to tease into Avengers directly, and well, expecting something really does take the fun out of anything.<br/><br/>Thor the film did what it had to, and successfully introduced the character to film audiences in anticipation of a huge ensemble in The Avengers. It's getting crowded, but here's a feather in the cap for Marvel in having to chalk up another expected blockbuster and hopefully boosting comic book sales as well. Highly recommended, and I can't wait for the rest of the slated Marvel heroes to appear on the big screen in weeks to come!"

","Thor may be the god of thunder, but the movie ""Thor"" is the god of disappointment.<br/><br/>The first volley of the summer movie season is a misfire -- a dull dud that fails as a spectacle, an adventure film or even a good movie.<br/><br/>What is most shocking is that Kenneth Branagh, a fine actor who has worked wonders with his many cinematic Shakespearean adaptations, directed ""Thor."" Here, he fails to create any sense of excitement or wonder. Nor can he inject some life into any of the characters, with the exception of the villainous Loki.<br/><br/>His Thor, portrayed by Chris Hemsworth, is an arrogant oaf who, without his hammer, looks more like a sullen Chippendale dancer or a lost member of the Bee Gees rather than the Norse god of thunder.<br/><br/>At times it seems Thor's hammer shows more personality than its owner.<br/><br/>For more, go to jconline.com and check out the complete review by Journal & Courier movie critic Bob Bloom."
"Troy_Campbell","7","5","12","24 April 2011"," A fun-filled adventure.
","Of the new Marvel movies within the Avengers universe Thor is not the best, but it's by far the funniest. The Iron Man pictures have the cocky swagger of Tony Stark which proffers a bit of humour, but director Branagh (yes, the same Kenneth Branagh who made his name directing and starring in a litany of Shakespeare adaptations) has ensured the out-of-this-world concept, and the out-of-this-world locations, both of which could've very easily come across as ridiculous and tacky, are enjoyable thanks to his tongue being firmly in his cheek. The fish-out-water comedy that opens up once the powerless Thor is in New Mexico, and still thinks of himself as a God, is priceless. Branagh knows humour is the perfect way to lighten the mood and allow audience members to just go with the flow rather than nitpicking at the numerous absurd elements of the film, and he wisely embraces it.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, Branagh demonstrates a deft touch filming the action scenes too. The set pieces, all featuring Thor, vary from a bone-crunching intergalactic battle against the ogre-ish Frost Giants, a rough and gritty rumble with the human SHIELD agents (who have a sharpshooter on their side that Marvel fans will recognise), a showdown in the streets of New Mexico against an unstoppable alien robot, and the (anti)climactic encounter on Asgard with his brother Loki. The final clash aside – which is a letdown – the action is tough, exciting and shot with flair. The CGI is mostly well done – some of the vistas created are stunning – although extreme wide shots which try to integrate people suffer from a glitchy effect which makes it look noticeably fake. Thankfully the 3D has been utilised carefully by Branagh and it never distracts, but it doesn't really add to the proceedings either and probably could've been omitted.<br/><br/>It's doubtful that the ex-'Home and Away' star Hemsworth won't be thrown every script under the sun after this. Bulking up massively for the role, the Aussie certainly looks the part and he has also nailed the semi-British-semi-American accent required, but there's more than that. He is terrific as Thor in an acting capacity, convincing both as the egotistical and immature God of the first half of the movie and the wiser, more contemplative leader of the latter half, remaining charismatic the entire way through. Elsewhere, Hopkins is an arresting force as King Odin and commands the screen whenever on, whilst Hiddleston makes for an excellently snaky and slimy Loki. On the flipside, Portman struggles as the plain Jane. Not for one second do you believe she's a risk-taking scientist, nor that she would fall for Thor like she does, however she does share a decent chemistry with Skarsgaard and Dennings, her two Earthling associates, and in the case of the latter, the frequent comic-relief. I must also mention that Rene Russo makes an appearance as Thor's mother, a welcome return for the actress who hasn't worked since 2005.<br/><br/>Branagh has proved the naysayers wrong and delivered a fun-filled adventure with roaring action and hefty laughs in equal parts.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Average, 3 - Good, 4 - Great, 5 - Brilliant)"
"thomvic","6","7","19","26 April 2011"," The God of Thunder impresses but forgets about the development along the way......
","I'll be honest – I wasn't looking forward to this movie. It's not that I thought the plot looked boring or anything but I have honestly had a bit too much of superhero Marvel films. How many more superheroes are there? I think we're gonna have a shortage soon on who can make it to the big screen eventually. So I went into this, having to pay $25 for a seat (I nearly had shock when I heard that was the amount) for 3-D plus V-max seats. And believe it or not, this is the first time I have seen something in 3-D! So I was very excited to get my first taste of it.<br/><br/>Thor (played by a very physically fit Chris Hemsworth), who was soon to be crowned King by his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) is banished to Earth, stripped of his powers and essentially become mortal after his arrogance and hasty decision making cause their enemies the Frost Giants to have bad blood against them again. While on Earth, Jane foster (Natalie Portman) runs into him, along with two of her friends, who are on a mission to explore stars and the galaxy above them.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Thor's brother and underneath the surface rivalry between them, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has some questionable motives. Does he really want to look out for his brother or is he after the throne that has been denied to him for so long? <br/><br/>Ten minutes into this film you can already see where the plot will take you and only someone with a blind eye would fail to notice it. It manages to make some believable characters out of this with a good performance from Wensworth, who has come along way from his Home and Away character back in Australia. He is right for the part both in his look and physical appearance and makes it believable. Anthony Hopkins is decent as King Odin but doesn't have as much screen time as I would have liked, considering his character does a vanishing act in the second half. Hiddleston however, felt more like he was meant to be cast in a spaceship movie and overacts in his role.<br/><br/>The contrast of the two worlds of Asgard and Earth is an interesting one, though I will be honest in saying the scenes on Earth are nowhere near as fascinating as the scenes in Asgard. With the 3D, it is simply beautiful to look at, in particular the bridge that links the two worlds together. Visually, I was blown away by how good it looked.<br/><br/>However, one of the themes of this film they explore in this is the making of a good leader. In the beginning, Thor is arrogant, self centered and proud so his lesson is to learn how to be a better person/leader. This aspect was not developed well, mainly because Thor's time on Earth is more concerned with bringing humour and establishing a very boring and highly unconvincing relationship with Jane, the physicist. Why they cast Natalie Portman into this when any other commendable actress could have done this with such a small role is pretty much for star power to attract more people to the theatre. It's funny when Thor mentions one of his lines 'I miss her' when he is back in Asgard – I was thinking to myself 'how could you miss her? You barely spent ten minutes with this woman and you miss her?' I didn't buy it for a second.<br/><br/>For a character like Thor, who is meant to be arrogant and proud, he pretty much snaps out of it quickly on Earth, and not a lot is done to really engage you or convince you that he really has changed for the better. I'm not saying you don't see his manner change, but what really triggers this? I really felt he didn't really learn many lessons with the short time he spent with these humans, and thus the character is underdeveloped when there was so much potential for him to grow.<br/><br/>The real plot driver is essentially another family feud in terms of sibling rivalry and is sort of the norm for epics like this. This is where the real story derives from. In terms of the enemies with the Frost Giants, there is a great scene in the beginning where Thor and his army like friends go head on battle with them, then after they become second nature to everything else, hence the enemy is often neglected in the story.<br/><br/>The overall wrap up of the film in its conclusion is not cliché and I am glad it avoided going down a path of sentimentality to the extreme where you feel this has been done over and over. However, the end feels a bit rushed considering you are meant to have a great high respect for Thor in what he has been through. And yes, I can see why, but I didn't feel it nor did I want to give him the respect, most likely because I think the writers don't give him as much respect he deserves for what could have turned a good film into a fantastic one."

","The folks at Marvel Studios have good business sense, and have put a lot of effort into building a Marvel movie universe populated by popular Marvel Comics characters. Iron Man 2 closed with a secret teaser ending, showing the discovery of Thor's hammer Mjolnr, and introducing an important piece of the Marvel movie universe puzzle.<br/><br/>Thor is a staggering achievement, filled with imaginative energy and crackling with excitement, but the greatest weapon this warrior wields is its strong plot. Director Branagh brings his Shakespearian senses to the fore, stirring elements such as the Cain-and-Abel tussle between Thor and Loki, the star-crossed romance between Thor and Jane and also the friction between Thor and his disapproving father Odin into the cinematic pot.<br/><br/>Branagh proves that he is no pushover when it comes to action sequences and wide panoramic vistas either. He has a keen eye for what looks good to excitement-hungry moviegoers, and this movie is packed with fantastic and beautiful visuals. From the sparkling spires of Asgard to the desolate wasteland of Jotunheim, this is a ten-course feast for the eyes – especially when given the 3D treatment.<br/><br/>Chris Hemsworth proves himself as a charming and charismatic leading man. Thor is portrayed here as a skilled but reckless and headstrong warrior prince, and Hemsworth takes the audience along as Thor learns humility and finds love on Earth, even as he experiences some hilarious moments of culture shock. He also does well in the fight sequences, having trained and gained 20 pounds of pure muscle for the role.<br/><br/>The supporting cast hits all the right notes as well, Anthony Hopkins imbuing Odin with thundering authority, Tom Hiddleston always possessing a malicious glint in his eye as Loki and Natalie Portman at her most normal and girlish as astrophysicist Jane Foster. Stellan Skarsgard grounds the film as Foster's level-headed mentor, and Kat Dennings is well-cast and very funny as the comic relief sidekick, usually a male role.<br/><br/>An all-round movie-going experience, Thor is the explosive and substantial summer movie season opener everyone has been hoping for, and is unmissable on this and any other of the eight known realms. Oh, and don't forget to stay past the credits for a mind-blowing revelation."
"JoeB131","10","4","9","8 May 2011"," Getting a difficult thing right. Awesome movie!
","As a Comic Book Geek, it has been just so disappointing to watch Hollywood butcher some of these great characters I've enjoyed since childhood. The X-Men movies still make me cringe. <br/><br/>This film was handled by some of the best. J. Michael Straczynsky (Creator of Babylon 5) wrote the script, Kenneth Branagh directed, and it had two Academy Award winning actors (Portman and Sir Anthony Hopkins). All of this meant it was going to be really good or horribly bad. There really wasn't going to be a middle ground here.<br/><br/>First, let's give credit to a smart script. First, the characters had depth, especially the character of Loki, who was not written as a one-dimensional bad guy. The actor who played Thor had a lot of charisma. <br/><br/>a bit of my problem, they actually had to write this as ""Oh, wait, Loki is a bad guy?"" kind of plot progression. Okay. I guess so, but that would require your audience to a) Not have ever read the comic or b) completely be ignorant of Norse mythology to not know the God of Mischief was going to be the bad guy here! Titanic had less plot tension. <br/><br/>JMS, while taking a few liberties with characters, is very faithful to the original comic (which has had nearly a fifty year run). <br/><br/>Usually I deplore the use of CGI, but here it worked in creating the fantastical realms of Norse Mythology.<br/><br/>Another point. All these Marvel films are all leading up to the Avengers movie. They even make references to the other films. (Hulk and Iron Man)."

","In the beginning ...ish, Odin and his people overthrew the frost giants and their attempted occupation of Earth and came to a sort of peace between the different galactic realms. As a king he overseas this peace, as a father, he attempts to instill a sense of wisdom in his two sons, Loki and Thor. However, when their realm is broken into by the Frost giants Thor's attempt at retribution is ill-thought out and Odin is forced to act, stripping Thor of his status as heir and banishing him to Earth, after which, medium-sized hell breaks loose. Can Thor regain his place as Heir of Asgard and be worthy again to wield his mighty hammer, which I have thus far forgot to mention? <br/><br/>Many of the film critics that have thus far reviewed Thor seem to regard him as an also-ran in the Marvel catalogue of heroes, not knowing perhaps that Thor was one of the company's biggest heroes, however, bringing a Norse God into a sense of modern reality was always going to be tricky, and it would have been easy to have a giant-sized ""Masters of the Universe"" style mess. However, like Iron Man (The first one, not the disastrous 2nd instalment) it makes its heroes big, larger than life figures, while making their predicaments very human ones, a search for knowledge, a desire for a parent's approval, the folly of youth and the vulnerability of age, ground the story and allow us, as viewers a way into this tale.<br/><br/>Kenneth Branagh, while not an obvious first choice for a big budget blockbuster does a decent job of tying all the different elements together, the script is decent and the cast do a good job, with particular praise to both Chris Hemsworth as the brash Thor but also Tom Hiddleston who was very good as the complex and unreadable Loki, who added real depth to what could have been just a, well, a cartoon super-villain really. <br/><br/>Enjoyable for young kids who will like the 3D stuff and all the action and okay for their parents who were raised on this stuff. The only major drawback, if you can call it that, is that unlike previous next movie tie-ins after the end credits of recent Marvel films, the one at the end of this one was a bit disappointing. But still. Enjoyable, but not as great as previous Marvel outings."

","A truly excellent film, accompanied by a powerful story. Hugely entertaining comic-book adventure that delivers pretty much everything you could want from a Thor movie, thanks to an outstanding script, note-flawless direction from Kenneth Branagh, a tremendous supporting cast and a charismatic, star-making central performance from Chris Hemsworth. The special effects are extraordinary and seemed extensively real. In addition, the fight scenes are nicely handled and the visual effects are impressive, especially in the Halls of Asgard. That said, while the post-production 3D has come out well unlike Clash of the Titans.What was even more interesting was too see how the god's transformation from being an immortal into a mortal didn't change the person who he was. The movie itself was entertaining with nice comedy and action. The actors did a good job in portraying the actors as truly as possible. Kenneth Branagh did in amazing job in directing the film's plot. The character change of Thor was interesting. All together, the film amazed me and left me breathless. In short, Thor is a huge amount of fun and is easily the best superhero movie. Worth Watching!!"

","Marvel does it again with another A-quality screen interpretation of the comic book hero The Mighty Thor. The heart-stopping action, the dark family drama and the well-placed humor were all perfectly realized on screen by Shakespearian director Kenneth Branagh. I wonder why the DC people could not do the same with their similarly iconic superheroes. (Really, Ryan Reynolds as Green Lantern,? Please! But I digress.)<br/><br/>It is amazing that the two main characters Thor and Loki were played by new actors who were unknown to me. Chris Hemsworth is perfectly cast as the cocky Nordic thunder god. Not only does he look the part physically, the way he acted out his character's arc is well-done and worthy of audience empathy. It was not forced nor corny. Tom Hiddleston also convincingly plays out his character Loki with the unpredictability this god was known for. Anthony Hopkins plays Odin by ear, as he is well-known for. Natalie Portman, fresh from her Oscar for Best Actress, looks as beautiful as her character requires. It was also exciting to see a cameo by Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton (""Hawkeye"") with his bow and arrow!<br/><br/>The story is solid. Those of us who did not know Thor now know him and care what happens to him. The fight scenes were very exciting. The special effects were very good for the most part. For negatives, I did not really like how fake Asgard looked and I did not like the metallic robot used to attack the earth. The costumes on Asgard also reminded me too much of various Bozanian bad guys from the old Voltes V cartoons. There were some inconsistencies about how Bifrost tele-porter works. Overall though, this was excellent and the first real big action blockbuster of this summer. I did not even watch the 3D version."

","1- Let me say first that consider throughly and acknowledge you are going to watch a Marvel production before you go to this movie. If you don't like the genre and you are not bored to death or want to spend some time all alone&with friends do not pay for this movie.<br/><br/>2- Now, for those who are interested in Norse mythology only but not Marvel comics, you may get disappointed because story has its inconsistencies like how Odin lose his eye not to mention Ragnaros. Hell even when Sif says ""I'd die a warrior's death"" Thor, disagrees..<br/><br/>3- Action scenes. I don't know if It was just me but 3D implementation to movie makes action scenes especially close combat scenes ""a bit!"" vague. You don't know whats going on there. I mean seriously .. Other than these close combat scenes where camera angle is terribad 3D go along with the movie well.<br/><br/>4- Humor: I think humor is well implemented in the movie. Makes you(me anyways) laugh often. Makes movie more watchable.<br/><br/>5- Romance Scenes: Didn't like it a bit. Too hasty to happen anything. You do not understand the relationship between a god and a mortal. You quite put your finger at it. It makes you think that there is something missing in it. If you think yourself as qualified to watch from previous topics go ahead and watch this movie. I don't think anyone would dislike the movie just because of this.<br/><br/>6- Overall: I myself, rate movies for a single fact. If I ever checked my watch in the cinema. Well I am glad to say I haven't. It was easy and entertaining to watch."
"xamtaro","8","4","9","29 April 2011"," Magic and Mayhem in the Mighty Marvel comics tradition
","Blockbuster season thunders in with ""THOR"", the marvel studios live action comic book adaptation based on Norse Mythology. In a sprawling tale of Gods and Monsters, Marvel studio crafts a realistically human story in the vein of the critically acclaimed ""Iron Man"".<br/><br/>Stripping away years of convoluted continuity and multiple interpretations, the creative team has combined the best of Thor's comic book incarnations to deliver a film that is both easily accessible to the casual watcher and pleasing to the hardcore comic fan. The only ones it might not please are die hard purists of Norse Mythology, for this is not their noble Viking God of thunder. Marvel's Thor is a proud pompous muscle man with a chip on his shoulder. In his eagerness to prove his might, he shattered a truce between his home realm of Asgard and the dreaded Frost Giants. For his actions, Thor is banished to earth in hopes that his exile would teach him humility and the value of life. Lo and behold, it is revealed that this turn of events was just the first step in a grand scheme by Thor's brother Loki, whose hidden agenda and ambiguous allegiance fuels much of the plot's intrigue. On earth, Thor is found and befriended by Jane Foster and her science team while his hammer, Mjolnir ends up in the possession of the government agency S.H.I.E.L.D. In order to return to Asgard, and before he can retrieve his hammer, Thor must first prove himself worthy of his power.<br/><br/>Melding magic and science fiction with comedy and drama, the movie's first strength is in its narrative. It has spectacular special effects but never relies solely on that. Behind the top notch computer graphics beats a story about pride before the fall, about themes as basic as sibling jealousy and about some very human ""Gods"". Although blessed with skill and power, Thor, Sif, Loki and The Warriors three never act like immortal deities. They are like Childhood friends, like regular people. They get angry, they laugh, they squabble and they each have their own little quirks that make them memorable. If not for the computer generated scenery and stylish costumes, one would easily forget that these are mythological gods. Though it might seem a bit rushed at points and slow at others, the many plot threads are easy to follow and tie up nicely by the end.<br/><br/>Thanks to a top notch cast, the acting is spot on though Natalie Portman and Anthony Hopkins (the two more well known stars) seem under utilized as Jane Foster and Odin respectively. The highlight is definitely Tom Hiddleston who plays Loki like an actor playing an actor. You never know if Loki's words are truth or more trickery for all the world is Loki's stage and every of his acts is a performance to advance some scheme.<br/><br/>The sharper ones in the audience would no doubt notice similarities between the Thor and Iron Man movies. Both feature a protagonist who is full of himself until he gets taught a lesson, humbles down and decides to fight for the good of humankind, both protagonists have issues with their father, both encounter a threat from within their own ranks and both face off against giant machines in a climatic final battle. Thankfully these similarities are only fleeting. Both Thor and Iron Man also benefit from a good deal of well written humor which in Thor's case involves the banished deity trying to adapt to human life. Much hilarity ensues.<br/><br/>Humour aside, the most important factor for a summer blockbuster is good action. In that regard, Thor delivers with wild abandon complemented by a remarkably glorious soundtrack by Patrick Doyle. Doyle is no stranger to modern magical mythology movies, having scored the likes of Eragon and Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.<br/><br/>Like the music, the film embraces its over-the-top comic book roots, as seen in the amazing production design and costumes. But while the action is big and poised to satisfy the adrenaline craving summer blockbuster crowd, director Kenneth Branagh seems to have become enamored with the ""Michael Bay School of Camera-work"". Tight close ups and shaky-cam neuter the otherwise epic battles. Action scenes like the flashback of Odin's war, or Thor and his friends' fighting their way through a Frost giant ambush, all lack a sense of scale and scope. Couple that with an ending that feels too abrupt and one gets the feeling that this is not the best that a ""Thor"" movie could have been, that Marvel is holding out on the audience, saving the best for later.<br/><br/>Will lightning strike the same spot twice? Will marvel pull off another blockbuster as successful as Iron Man? If the abrupt conclusion of Thor is anything to go by, Marvel seems more interested in generating publicity for their 2012 ""Avengers"" movie. And that is exactly what this movie feels like, a set up for something bigger on the way."
"FilmFanatic03","8","4","9","28 April 2011"," A good old fun Super-hero flick!
","There was something different about ""Thor"". Whilst not being the best super-hero film in the world, it was a great one and the best one since ""The Dark Knight"". However it was the first one in a while where it was a full on fantasy super-hero film where there are no possibilities and their powers are shown in a great way. There was a great balance of how much the Asgardian world was shown and how Earth was shown. Chris Hemsworth played the arrogant turned humble god Thor, however i think the star of the film was Tom Middleston for his acting had more depth expected from a super-hero film. Natalie Portman was OK, nothing amazing but nothing awful. Overall a good cast to bring to life a great film. Also the amazing thing worth noting is that there is no sexual scenes or strong language! See, you can have no swear words or rude scenes and you can still enjoy a great film!"
"soloriamagic08","6","3","6","27 August 2013"," One character sells the movie. Everyone else, including the title character, are afterthoughts.
","Thor, the movie where a god (alien? demi-god? Not completely sure) changes his century old or so personality in three days. Because of a girl. Come on director if you're going to be cliché at least try not to be so obvious about it. I'm going to review this in parts because I have so much to say about it.<br/><br/>Story- Like I hinted at above Thor is a prince that is exiled from Asgard,a fantasy like world in another dimension, to our meager little planet Earth. Here he has to learn humility if he wants to come home because he pretty much started a realm wide war by being an arrogant prick.The problem with this plot point is that for the first 25 minutes or so, when the story was based on Asgard and one other realm (not earth),the story was actually interesting. That takes a severe nosedive when Thor is thrown to a small desert in the middle of nowhere on our planet. To say this part of the movie was very boring would be like me saying rain is wet. All the interesting bits happen on Asgard with Thor's family, but unfortunately since Thor is the main character it's his sleep inducing antics on earth that we have to follow the most and not the far more captivating Asgardian plot points.<br/><br/>Characters- Overall everyone was decent in their roles. I thought Chris Hemsworth, apparently a newcomer at the time, was good as Thor. He was very arrogant (at first), but overall nice and kinda goofy like a big kid. Natalie Portman, as the earth-based scientist Jane and Thor's unfortunate love interest did what she had to do. However, this wasn't much, but that's the thing her part could have been given to anyone and worked. That's why it was obvious that Portman and Hopkins (to a lesser extent) were only really cast because they were the big name draws in a sea of relative unknowns. Speaking of Anthony Hopkins he had a commanding, but still kind, presence as Odin the King of Asgard.However, the role that shined above all was from,apparently another newcomer, Tom Hiddleston.<br/><br/>He played Thor's younger, quieter, darkly mischievous brother Loki, and my god did he blow everyone out of the water. I watched this movie for the first time on Netflix a few months ago, and not being a superhero movie fan I admit I wasn't expecting much. Especially not the Oscar caliber brilliance from Hiddleston. Loki was a scene stealer and really the sole reason I kept watching to the end.<br/><br/>Romance plot- A plot tumor that should have been regulated to C plot or even better not been in the movie at all. The biggest problem with this plot line however was not its existence, but that the two leads had NO chemistry with each other. To say Hemsworth and Portman didn't have this would actually be an understatement. This is unfortunate since they had it with everybody else. Just sadly not with each other.<br/><br/>Visuals and music-Asgard, and one other world, was beautiful but it was glossy looking and didn't look lived in. It was also very obvious they were on a set in a lot of the interior scenes. Very boxy. The earth scenes were a desert and of course very dry and boring looking. The music had a good fantasy vibe, but it wasn't memorable for me.<br/><br/>The Bad Guy-The villain's overall motivation wasn't executed well, and since this is the essence of his start of darkness a lot more effort should have been done in the writing room in this regard.<br/><br/>Battle scenes -Overall I wasn't in awe. I was barely in meh.<br/><br/>There's supposed to be a war brewing and yet we are not shown this even a little. Definitely takes a whole lot of tension out of the movie in that regard.<br/><br/>A very important character is called a master of magic, his power is this for god's sake, and yet I've seen more magic, big and small, done by the children in the Harry Potter films.<br/><br/>Costumes help you get immersed in a world. Especially in a fantasy setting, but sadly the asgardian's costumes overall looked like they came off the Halloween rack at Wal-Mart. Clearly the 150 million or so budget barely was dipped into for the costume department.<br/><br/>Deleted Scenes- This bares a special mention because after seeing them it's one of those what the hell was the director thinking face-palm worthy things. After watching some deleted scenes from other movies it's usually very obvious why they were done away with. This isn't one of those movies. Even when watching the original cut I felt something was missing. Dialogue that didn't make sense, didn't flow right, or seemed to be gone. Transitions that were off and whole plot points that seem to have more to them then what was shown. Then I watched the deleted scenes and go oh there's the rest of the movie! Why would you cut scenes that fleshed out your overall story and more importantly your characters! The deleted scenes made the movie so much more and it's a shame they were cut.<br/><br/>In summary the script, dialogue, story, and just overall execution wasn't great, but it wasn't terrible either. The acting (especially Hiddleston's Loki) is what overall helped sell it for me. However, in all honestly this is not a movie I can watch in its entirety again. Certain scenes certainly, but not the whole movie."

","Visually striking, generally well-directed, competently performed super-hero epic made with state of the art CGI effects. Norse mythology via Marvel comics and Stan Lee are brought to life here. While not your typical Marvel comic ""epic"" - Thor spends most of its time in the world of Thor, Odin, Loke, and Frost Giants - a banished race. The story was inventive and conceived imaginatively. Anthony Hopkins does a great job playing Odin and relative newcomer Chris Hemsworth makes an appealing Thor, even an affable one for guys as well as girls. The rest of the cast was judiciously cast. As Loki, the villain of the film, Tom Hiddleston stands out. Beautiful Natalie Portman plays the female love-interest. Veteran, and a good character actor, Stellan Skarsgard plays a pivotal role as well. i liked really most of what I saw. Director Kenneth Branagh does a serviceable job with the material - and adds some class to this Marvel addition. you are given clues throughout that The Avengers is on its way."
"fleetstar","9","3","6","1 October 2011"," Entertainment at its best
","I watched this film in 2d, and have been a Thor character fan since childhood (in the 1960's). I thoroughly enjoyed every second of it.<br/><br/>After the Iron man films (The first was really good, and the second a big let down), I didn't really know what to expect from Thor. <br/><br/>I think the whole concept was really carried out perfectly as an introduction to the character for those that were not familiar with the comics. I must admit to being quite surprised at some of the negative comments that have been written about this film. It was by far the best superhero adaptation that I have seen.<br/><br/>Some people have said that the character development was inadequate, I don't agree. This type of film, people go to see because of the action and the larger than life stories. The film is nearly 2 hours long, if more character development was added the either it would be longer (and many will say its too long) or some of the action sequences would have to go. You can't have it all ways.<br/><br/>I stopped reading these comics over forty years ago, and have not kept up with any of the updates, but I think the updated occupations compared to the silver age comics were well carried out.<br/><br/>To me it was really just like reading a really good Thor comic, and that is all I expected. As a good Thor comic it was a classic."
"Wuchakk","8","3","6","28 September 2011"," More than just a superhero flick
","Released in 2011, ""Thor"" is based on the long-running Marvel comic book. The comic was unique in that the stories regularly involved three realms -- the mythical Asgard and neighboring areas, uncharted expanses across the universe, and Earth. I rarely appreciated the Asgardian segments, but I often enjoyed the many creative cosmic explorations and the Earth-centered stories.<br/><br/>The film is amazing in that it successfully recreates Asgard and its main characters for the screen, not to mention that it actually makes them interesting (I never found Odin, Sif or the Warrior's Three interesting).<br/><br/>THE PLOT (minor plot SPOILER): Odin the ""Allfather"" is about to anoint Thor as the next king of Asgard, but his son displays folly, arrogance, disrespect and rebellion, forcing Odin to discipline him. Thor is stripped of his godhood and his incredible hammer, Mjolnir, and banished to the earth with no more power than any mortal his size. Thor encounters Jane Porter & her colleagues, as well as the US Government, in his quest for Mjolnir and redemption. Meanwhile his jealous brother Loki enacts schemes in Asgard, forcing the Warrior's Three and Sif to leave and find the exiled Thor. Loki sends The Destroyer to eliminate his brother, which also threatens the thunder god's new group of mortal friends.<br/><br/>You couldn't ask for a better cast: Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Anthony Hopkins as Odin, Tom Hiddleston as Loki and three total babes as Jane Porter, Jane's friend Darcy and Lady Sif -- Natalie Portman, Kat Dennings and Jaimie Alexander respectively. Some complain about the Asian and African actors in the roles of Hogun and Heimdall, but Hogun always seemed to be modeled after Mongol-types. And who says there aren't other races on Asgard anyway? The Norse encountered some Asgardians many centuries ago spurring their mythology, which naturally didn't include (then) far-off races, but who says the real Asgardians weren't racially diverse? <br/><br/>Some criticize the film as campy because it deals with Norse mythology and the fact that the whole realm of Asgard can seem outlandish and cartooney. Yet the movie isn't about their mythology but about the actual Asgardians, who are very real in this story.<br/><br/>""Thor"" works so well because it's more than just a bunch mindless superhero mumbo jumbo and exciting action/CGI. The deep themes include the pitfalls of arrogance, juvenile rebellion, jealousy, rivalry and deceit, as well as the universal nobility of humility, repentance, courage and sacrificial love. Then there's the ""fish out of water"" element of Thor exiled to earth and the curious things he does. On top of all this, we get a complex and interesting villain for a change. Sure the movie has a comic booky vibe, but that's what ""Thor"" is based on. To dismiss it as a campy superhero flick is grossly inaccurate.<br/><br/>The film runs 115 minutes and the Earth episodes were shot in New Mexico.<br/><br/>The DVD features 4 deleted scenes, a ""Road to the Avengers"" featurette, a director's commentary and a few trailers.<br/><br/>FINAL WORD: I don't think you could ask for a better film adaption of the Thor comic and the thunder god's adventures in Asgard, Earth and elsewhere. The addition of the Destroyer is a plus<br/><br/>GRADE: A-"
"md-ulus","9","3","6","28 September 2011"," Surprisingly good
","I admit, I had low expectations, however, those were exceeded, bravo.<br/><br/>Thinking about this movie always left me confused. Here you have a demi-god that carries a big hammer around. It's not exactly the same appeal as a sword or battle axe. As a kid I never really understood Thor.<br/><br/>The art direction was great, the costumes were pretty cool and many scenes were very well executed in terms of visual style. I give the effects a solid ten, overall they were very well done, some of the best I've seen.<br/><br/>There are a few funny moments scattered throughout as well, though it could have used a few more as the story progressed, just to keep my brain going. As things went on the story began to trudge a bit. Branagh managed to introduce some drama.<br/><br/>I give this 9 out of 10 because of how it relates to the genre, a genre with a very low bar IMHO. Even judging it as a pure action movie however I'd give it a solid 8. It's a good flick that is accessible and entertaining even if you haven't a clue why a god carries a hammer around."
"jakimiku","8","3","6","5 September 2011"," Scandinavian mythology put to Marvel
","""Thor"" tells a story about Thor, Norse god of thunder, whose arrogance and hot head results in his castout of the fantastic realm of Asgard to Earth. Here he must redeem himself by learning to be humble and controlling his rash emotions. Meanwhile in Asgard things are not going to according to what one might expect at start.<br/><br/>I can honestly say that this is one of the better superhero (and action) films around. The story is very good (i've never read the comics though) and i found it astonishing how well they've incorporated and linked actual Scandinavian mythology into the film (again, maybe it's in the graphic novels too). Thor himself is an interesting and original character. Coming from a different dimension and not being genetically mutated or having unlimited resources, his powers come from his hammer Mjöllnir and being a warrior back in Asgard. Also, he is not your usual blue-eyed character, fighting for justice, the poor and against crime, but has his own motives and ambitions for impressing everyone around him, thus it is interesting to watch how his personality is portrayed throughout the film.<br/><br/>Visuals are outstanding, the whole realm of Asgard, the space and the city are done spectacularly. Effects are quite unbelievable, the fighting scenes and traveling through different dimensions. That's a standard we've grown to expect from these kind of movies, and Thor delivers. Nothing bad to say about the plot either. Cast is beyond great. Chris Hemsworth is a real gem, his portrayal of Thor is everything one might expect, i was really impressed with him. Might reckon we'll see him in other major roles in the near future. Tom Hiddlestone does well as Loki too, a character who is growing bitter for his own reasons. Anthony Hopkins (who plays Odin) in a fatherly role and Natalie Portman as Jane provide more of an experienced heavyweight support and are great in their respective roles, as one might expect from Academy Award winners.<br/><br/>All in all, Thor is one of the best comic book adaptations to date, an outstanding visual and a film that keeps you in the seat absorbed to this fascinating world. Again, look out for the after the end credits clip, which links together different parts for the Avengers build-up. Honestly, Thor was this good that we'll do well to be waiting anxiously for the sequel and the Avengers before that. Two thumbs up."

","I've always loved Marvel movies. Kenneth Branagh directing a superhero flick could have been risky but surprisingly Thor comes out to be big and great. There is no moment in the whole movie where you'll feel like skipping. Moreover After so much time I've seen a movie without skipping forward. Chris Hemsworth has done a terrific job as Thor. His dialogs are great and are the only hints of good humor throughout the movie. I've always loved Natalie Portman. Tom and Anthony are good as well. The action scenes are pretty good and must have been great in 3D. Thor with a beard might look odd for the comic fans but it served well to me. Well yeah do wait for the end of the credits as there is another sequence just like Hulk and Iron Man. It seems they are all set for a grand plot for Avengers. Anyways the movie was very good for me. Scope for betterment surely remains but its a must watch. Great job done there."

"gabepugh","9","3","6","17 May 2011"," From someone barely familiar with Thor...
","The sum total of my knowledge about Thor came from reading the backs of Marvel cards in the early to mid-90's. His bio said he was really powerful and had an awesome hammer, and that was about all I remembered. So going into the movie I was just looking for good special FX and a decent enough story not to aggravate me, ala Transformers 2.<br/><br/>As it turns out Thor was pretty good. I'd say the reviews that equate it to being about on par with The Incredible Hulk are almost accurate - they're missing a big part of Thor's final score when they tally it. Ready...<br/><br/>Thor is an unfamiliar, untested, and in most cases brand new character in the pantheon of Marvel movies - and yet, it is pretty freaking enjoyable. Believable acting. Strong story. God action and FX. And don't forget that Thor's box office performance so far, while not stellar seems appears better than such an unknown pseudo-newbie would merit. It did better in it's 2nd weekend than either The Incredible Hulk or X-Men Origins: Wolverine. <br/><br/>So jump don't be the last loser on on your block to try Thor, everybody else's doing it. Come on, just on try. How could a billion Chinese people be wrong?"
"jon-broeke","Null","3","6","17 May 2011"," Jump head first into the fantastic world of the Norse gods, who then cross over to become fantastic super heroes.
","Superhero movies are huge at the moment. Currently, the second Batman release, The Dark Knight, is the highest grossing film of all time, but going back far further than that, back to the 80's, when the original Superman was released. What an impact that had on film. Then, with Batman later, the era of the superhero film had begun. But those are both DC heroes, and, at the moment, Marvel seems to be the topic of the day. From the original Spiderman, which was a resounding success, a fourth re-vamped version being released later this year, to The Incredible Hulk and the two Fantastic Four Films, Marvel has taken the reigns. Thor is no exception.<br/><br/>Born to the King of Asgard, Odin (Anthony Hopkins), Thor (Chris Hemsworth) grows to be a great warrior, but he is too full of himself, and a little to keen to fight rather than talk, so when Asgard is invaded by a rebel group of Ice Giants, the inhabitants of one of the other realms the Asgardians control, Thor wants to destroy them. Odin orders him to stay in Asgard, but, with a little tempting by his younger brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the god of mischief, Thor and a group of warriors from Asgard go to battle the Ice Giants, needing to be rescued by Odin. After returning to Asgard Odin punishes Thor by banishing him from his home and sending him to Earth to live among the humans as one of them. On Earth Thor meets Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), a physicist studying the great machine that allows the Asgardians to travel between worlds, but what she thinks is just strange weather formations. With her help Thor discovers that some things cannot be solved with relentless violence, and he learns the true power of love as well.<br/><br/>This is one of the highlights of this year's movie calendar. The effects are huge, the action is pounding and the story is comic-licious. Every person performs their roles with precision. Chris Hemworth is both big and foreboding as the hammer wielding god of thunder, but at the same time brings a vulnerability to the character that make his plight completely believable. Anthony Hopkins is his fantastic self as the king of this incredible place, trying to groom his sons in the best way he knows to be good kings, and Natalie Portman is great looking. Her role in this film is not the acting stretch that she had in Black Swan, but a film like that comes maybe once in a persons career. She is a good science bound woman in this film and looks really good doing it. The stand out in the film is Tom Hiddleston as Loki. He brings a devilish charm to the character that makes him slimy, yet sympathetic. You actually find yourself understanding his reasons for his actions, and partly empathising with him.<br/><br/>All in all, Kenneth Branagh, the director, has done a great job with this film. Now we need to wait for Captain America, releasing August 5th, and then The Avengers, which is releasing sometime next year, and our comic filled lives will be complete.<br/><br/><ul><li>www.celebrit-enow.com -</li></ul>"

","My summer of the superhero kicked off this week with the god of Thunder Thor.I was a little skeptical they could pull it off with Thor not being a well know character. I have to say they pulled it off very well. This action adventure drama starring Chris Hems worth ( Thor), Natalie Portman( Jane foster) the always entertaining Sir Anthony Hopkins as(Odin king of Asgard) and Kat Dennings(Darcy Lewis)for just the right amount of comic relief . Thor runs for 114 minutes and is directed by Kenneth Branagh.<br/><br/>The story line surrounds Thor and his arrogance and recklessness by disobeying his father Odin. Thor decides to confront the frost Giants after they attack the castle while Thor's coronation is talking place. In doing do Thor reignite's an accent war among the frost giants from before he was born. In doing so Odin takes away Thor powers and banishes him to earth so he can learn the true meaning of leadership. <br/><br/>I enjoyed the story line around this film, because he is not a real well known superhero unless you are a comic book geek.They didn't take the whole idea very seriously to the point of overdoing it. The acting was very well done. I was glad to see they brought in some talented actors to help build the story around. They added just the right amount of humor to the story about Thor and his quest to learn on earth what he needs to ascend to the throne of Asgard.Thor goes onto a local dinner has breakfast with Jane and drinks a cup of coffee and say's I like this drink I want more and smashes it like the a Viking. Thor walks into a pet store and demands a horse to go in search of his hammer, and the store keeper looks up with a look like how much have you had to drink. I thought the scenery of New Mexico was great choice because that where they found Thor's hammer in the end of iron man 2 .The design and special effects of Asgard was amazing. Anthony Hopkins looked very comfortable in his role as the King of Asgard. <br/><br/>The biggest thing that stood out was how they built Asgard. That was amazing scenery how they built the world of Asgard, the city bridge going to earth and the 9 realms. Tom Hiddleston added just the right touch of evil as Loki. He didn't take his role to serious to the point it might have been considered over acting. The one thing I noticed was the only tie into the avengers in 2012 was Erick Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) made a reference to a scientist he worked with who was studying the effects of gamma radiation. I was kind of hoping for an appearance of one of the other avengers. They seemed to realize what they had to do bring the mythological god of thunder to the big screen. They accomplished it very well with the cast, scenery and the script.I think Kenneth Branagh did a commendable job pulling this story together and giving the movie going public a very enjoyable 114 minutes.<br/><br/>I definitely give it 3 stars.<br/><br/>My blog is http://www.thehollywoodreview.blogspot.com/"

","Thor (1:55, PG-13, 3-D) — fantasy: comics & pulps, biggie, crossover<br/><br/>""When someone asks you if you're a god, you say YES!""<br/><br/>This advice may well have applied to Bill Murray or Dan Aykroyd, but Sigourney Weaver's Zuul would never have even thot to ask it of Chris Hemsworth, who is so obviously a deity that the question would never have arisen.<br/><br/>There's probably a casting hall of fame somewhere in self-congratulatory Hollywood. In it you will undoubtedly find Madonna as Evita, Patrick Stewart as Prof. Xavier, Angelina Jolie as Lara Croft, and, on a plinth in the grand lobby, Christopher Reeve as Superman. Save a spot for young Mr. Hemsworth, because he is every ell the incarnation of the Norse thunder god Thor.<br/><br/>If there's a like mecca for production design, seek not there for the shabby, Holiday Inn Olympus of Percy Jackson or Clash of the Titans. But Thor's Asgard truly deserves recognition. It is a proper home for the gods, grand, sweeping, and awe-inspiring. Not at all claustrophobic, it uses SPACE. This is what 3-D was made for. Regrettably, the sole Imax theater in my city was already committed to Born To Be Wild, so I didn't get its added benefit, but I would have leapt at the opportunity.<br/><br/>If you've been following along in the series of films set in the Marvel comic-book universe, you know that Col. Nick Fury of SHIELD (Samuel L. Jackson) has been assembling a team of super-heroes to meet the recurring existential threats to humanity. SHIELD's top field agent, Clark Gregg's Coulson (or ""son of Coul"", as Thor calls him) keeps turning up on the periphery of Iron Man, Hulk, etc. Here he has a larger role as the AIC investigating the overnight appearance in the New Mexico desert of an impressively heavy artifact fallen from the skies. This is Mjolnir, the thunder hammer, forged from the heart of a star and wieldable only by one worthy of its might and power.<br/><br/>First on the scene of its appearance is a trio of anomaly trackers, led by researcher Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and including mentor Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård) and brilliant grad assistant Darcy Lewis (the scene-stealing Kat Dennings). The SHIELD guys, arriving shortly thereafter, confiscate all of their research notes, but not before they've already encountered the quirky, tall, handsome, muscular blond guy who says he OWNS the artifact. They decide to join forces with him so everybody can get their goodies back.<br/><br/>OK, it must be admitted up front that Natalie Portman, Oscar fresh in hand, is not going to displace anybody's idea of a top female astrophysicist. That will always be Jodie Foster's Ellie Arroway from Contact. But Portman isn't called on to do much astrophysicking here, and she's properly heroic, winsome, capable, flustered, and imaginative as required. She's an ideal foil for Hemsworth's Thor, who is undergoing a crisis of integrity, thrown out of Asgard by all-father (and HIS father) Odin after leading an ill-conceived, if daring, raid of retribution against the frost giants of Jodenheim. ""A wise king never seeks out war,"" intones Odin (a regal Anthony Hopkins), ""but he must be ready for it!""<br/><br/>The action alternates between the realms of the gods and the mortals, with occasional side excursions to Jodenheim. The interstate highway of the heavens begins on the rainbow bridge, Bifrost, at the far end of which is the giant rotary spherical zapper that can propel the gods halfway across known space; it's guarded by the taciturn but totally impressive swordsman Heimdall (Idris Elba).<br/><br/>Thor's fellow godlings are a worthy bunch, and Rene Russo's few appearances as Odin's consort Frigga leave a much bigger impression than their brevity would normally warrant. Tom Hiddleston as Thor's ""brother"" Loki is highly effective, and his role is particularly well written, abounding in ambiguity and plausible motivation.<br/><br/>While I've concentrated on the grandiose (as does the movie), there's plenty of nitty-gritty realism, including mud, blood, pain, and grief; PG-13-level romance; and no small amount of humor. The film does a good job of portraying Thor's time on Earth as a large-living odd duck out of his normal pond without making him seem overbearing; if this part had gone on too long, it would have irritated, but it doesn't, primarily because our hero (for who could doubt that he is?) is a quick study and innately a noble protector of the underdog.<br/><br/>And so another piece in the larger puzzle slips into place. Next up: That super-soldier from WW2. Is HE still around? We may have to wait nearly until August to find out."
"Al_The_Strange","8","3","6","8 May 2011"," ""Whoever wields this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.""
","Remember the post-credit scenes in ""Iron Man 2,"" where the Shield agents discover a mysterious hammer-like object in the desert? Well, they finally made a movie all around that concept. ""Thor"" throws us into a world where Norse myth collides with the science-fiction Marvel universe in a surprisingly sublime fashion. With this clever setup, we are introduced to the title character, who battles giants and mortal men alike with thunderous force. There is plenty of action throughout this flick, and lots of beautiful special effects. Even when Thor isn't bashing the hell out of things, there's enough character-driven drama to keep it strong. And of course, nothing's more amusing than watching an archaic deity walking among modern man; there are a few funny moments throughout. It's maybe not as action-packed as some of the other Marvel films, but ""Thor"" met my expectations perfectly.<br/><br/>The story's a little predictable, especially if you're already familiar with the comics or Norse myth. But it is well-presented, and presents enough decent characterization to keep it fresh. I do believe that something is missing; Thor never seems to learn much when he's on Earth. But he does learn something, and when the climax comes it makes good enough sense.<br/><br/>The film has good photography for the most part. The frost-giant battle shows some rather jittery cameramanship and editing, but afterwards it's all solid. Some shots have some really funky crooked angles, but I think it's cool. Acting is great; I loved Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman in their roles, and Anthony Hopkins is a naturally good choice for Odin. Writing is not terribly sophisticated, but it gets the job done. Production value is phenomenal, with loads of excellent sets, props, costumes, and some very imaginative settings. It's especially impressive how the designers have adopted Norse myth into the story and designs to fit into a sci-fi niche, and still make sense. The music score is not bad.<br/><br/>Recommended! 4/5 (entertainment: 4/5, story: 4/5, film: 4/5)"
"MikeBuzzSaw","3","5","13","2 May 2011"," Bore, sorry, Thor fails to entertain
","The trailers for Thor had left me with some sense of anticipation. Coming from the same stable as Ironman 1 and 2, I thought I was in for a rollicking, rip-roaring action adventure. How wrong could I have been? Thor was, frankly, boring. Well before the tedious 114 minutes were over I was finding myself constantly looking at my watch and praying for time to fly and the end credits to roll. Even seeing it in 3D didn't make any difference.<br/><br/>The film started promisingly enough with the usual preamble. Details concerning Odin, and Asgard, fighting the Ice Giants in defence of the pitiable humans on Earth. But from then onwards it went down hill as fast as a trip on the Bifrost Bridge. The characterisation was so poor I ended up not giving a hoot whether Odin was going to die or not. Thor being banished to Earth for disobeying his father? Seen it all before. The younger son seeking to take the throne that rightfully belongs to his brother, yawn central. A collection of throw away companions for Thor to use as a backdrop to his own performance? So failed to move me that I couldn't remember the characters names without referring to IMDb. They just weren't memorable enough nor did they establish themselves in the film's narrative structure.<br/><br/>The fight scenes were well done but nothing that you might not have seen elsewhere. The dialogue, with the odd olde worlde English term used, at times felt like the recycled script from an old sword and sorcery movie and the love interest, Natalie Portman, sparkled like a lump of wet coal. I like Natalie Portman, I thought she performed well in V for Vendetta, but in this cinematic turkey she seemed to be a lost child looking for direction. Her character, the scientist with brains and looks, was drowned out by Kat Dennings' Darcy character, who managed to delivery a few moments of levity amongst the many minutes of boredom.<br/><br/>The process of Thor's redemption, from war loving two dimensional character into an empathic and thoughtful god like mega being, was so quick and shallow as almost to appear instantaneous. The sight of Thor, as a penitent mortal, acting as a waiter and serving breakfast to two humans was so jarring that I thought it was meant to be a comedic scene. Unfortunately, it wasn't.<br/><br/>The film rattled on towards the expected final battle between Thor and his brother, Loki. Where upon Odin awakes from his deathly slumbers and saves the day but not the unfortunate Loki. Loki drifts off into space to some unspecified fate from which he might well arise in a sequel. Cue a couple of scenes where the now ""grown up "" Thor gazes off into vast distances while mooning for his human squeeze (Portman) who's shown trying to develop her own Bifrost Bridge (the original having been destroyed in the extended and frankly dull final battle scenes). Roll credits and massive yawning from this audience member.<br/><br/>Further thoughts: For a film with a budget of $150m I thought it came over as cheap. Perhaps if more had been spent on the script and less on the CGI it might have been a triumph rather than a dull drudge that won't be entering my DVD collection. The real proof of the pudding was my son's opinion. The twelve year old, who'd been so enthusiastic to see this film, announced that it had been dull and he didn't want the DVD when it came out."

","The sets, special effects are just what you would expect form a major Hollywood movie. It looks great. In particular I loved the ice giants they were the best thing in the movie.<br/><br/>What I struggled with was a mythical god-like being, if not actually a god, who grins a lot, is rather polite and lacks all presence apart from his muscular development which on its own doesn't carry it. I don't think it is because Helmsworth can't act. But the fellow is meant to be Thor, that is THOR!!!!! Not someone who might ask if you want fries with that.<br/><br/>A little bit of grimness, perhaps a little bit of age might have helped. Shouldn't he be a few thousand years old at least? He does start off a bit rash but his big character change occurs, seemingly, because he had a single beer with a fellow of Scandinavian origin. Certainly there was nothing in the Natalie Portman relationship that engendered any interest of need to reassess his approach to life. In fact the gorgeous Natalie was rather irrelevant.<br/><br/>The Asgardians themselves were good whilst in Asgard but out of that context they looked rather ridiculous and with entirety of the Earth action all taking place in what looked like a back lot we really needed to get back to Asgard asap.<br/><br/>So yes it looks great (mostly) and there is plenty of action, if that's what you want but when it was finished I was not looking forward to the sequel. I really didn't care although if they bring back the frost giants I'd watch them. In fact secretly I was cheering for them all along. They had the menaces and gravitas that Thor lacked."

","I enjoy Scandinavian mythology and am well familiar with all its cinematic and musical offshoots.<br/><br/>That said, this movie has all of the following features: 1. Great special effects 2.

Any kind of entertainment for an even remotely intelligent mind<br/><br/>At the end of it I felt I had just wasted my time. It just wasn't entertaining at any level. It added no value to my life either. The best things about this film are probably Kat Denning's boobs. But they weren't seen (or felt) either so...<br/><br/>I wondered later why it was so overly hyped worldwide.<br/><br/>I realized that you can generally avoid hyped films and be rest assured of having not lost anything important. <br/><br/>Reading glowing reviews of this film here really made me laugh.<br/><br/>If Thor could see them, he'd laugh too.<br/><br/>Oh and remember less one in four people is intelligent."

","I enjoyed Iron Man, I found the two Hulk movies in 5 years laughable but okay. I'm sorry but it's just hard to enjoy a movie with obvious CGI that looks completely unrealistic. So coming into Thor I had no expectations. I knew going in that it and probably Captain America were both movies that were only produced to set up an Avengers movie. While watching the movie I found myself laughing. Dialogue was completely predictable as well as was everything else in the movie. There was little heart and no character depth. This movie had a good director, a suburb cast and obviously a large budget. There was no reason for it to have been this bad other than the lack of a script. In my opinion it's a thrown together, forced movie that never needed to be made. The only perk of this movie was a couple of good battle scenes. The best of which started the movie off, which left the ending to be anti-climatic to say the least. I know a lot of people enjoyed this movie but I just can't understand why. I blame everyone who signed up to do this paycheck of a movie for it's existence.<br/><br/>3 of 10 - A very fair rating in my opinion. If you like movies like, Priest, Legion, Hulk, The Incredible Hulk, Jonah Hex etc... with lots of action and little else then you may like this movie. Otherwise save your money."

","Probably the funniest movie I've ever seen. Not because the humor was well-written. Was there any? Can't remember. But because the effects were so ridiculous that I just had to laugh. Granted, I saw this movie with my theatre group after an exhausting play week at 11:00 at night. But that may just have been the movie's saving grace for me. If my friends and I hadn't been so exhausted that everything was funny, I probably wouldn't have made it through the ending. I love Kenneth Branaugh. Anthony Hopkins is amazing. Natalie Portman just got an Academy Award. But none of them could make anything of this movie. The acting was awful. The sounds were way too loud. The effects were unbelievably dumb. All of the flying scenes were hilarious. I can't even describe them. And when Thor is lying there dying, and his hammer suddenly flies through the air, and he reaches up and catches it in conjunction with the lightning and epic music... Oh man. So hilarious. And I may be a writing snob, but there was no character arc. Thor went from arrogant and stupid and annoying to kind, peaceful, humble, stupid and annoying. So yeah. Don't spend money to see this in theaters. If you're curious, at least wait for it to come out on DVD. I'm not really a superhero movie person, but our theatre director is. And she didn't like it. No one in our group did. Don't waste your time. That's 2 1/2 hours you could be spending doing way better things. Like chopping your appendages off with a butter knife or something. That would have been way less painful."

","Went to see Thor last night with some high expectations, after reading some of the reviews here. And, as much as i would have liked to enjoy the movie, i did not. Don't get me wrong, using comic heroes and comic book plots in films proved to be successful. That's why the whole world knows about Superman and Batman. But now, we've got a group of lesser known superheroes aiming at our money. One of them is mighty Thor with his deadly super-hammer weapon. I am not going to write about the plot, and character development, although Thor is very well developed (gimme the same stuff the actor was eating to get that body in just SIX months!). We want visuals from this type of films, and screw the rest. Producers, directors, actors and all others involved in this multimillion dollar project realize that viewers want entertainment, but do they deliver? Well, they do, most of the time. I only have a couple of questions: 1) Why did they spend money on expensive stars in secondary roles (A. Hopkins and N.Portman) instead of making better visual FX? 2) Why the computer drawn villains are so primitive (all ice giants look the same, and that ironman mummy is unimaginative)? 3) When will producers realize, that shaky camera in fighting scenes makes people dizzy? 4) Did they use Transformers to model some of the characters armor? I guess the answers to these questions will be more clear after you've seen the movie. But don't expect anything epic. It's just an action film about people running around, killing things and destroying stuff for no particular reason. And it doesn't even matter if you will not like Thor, because he'll be back!"

","Absolutely stunning FX. The whole story and characters were brought vividly to life. Slight change to the original Comic book, but nothing at all lost in translation. 3D was totally unnecessary and gave me a headache. Roll on Cap and the Avengers!!!!!!!! Hemsworth, brought the cockiness out excellently. Hiddleston was eerily compelling to see and Hopkins, well, there's no one quite like him to bring Odin to life. In case their is anyone worried about the Religious overtones - don't be.

"kss-3","2","3","7","10 January 2014"," What was wrong with the original manuscript?
","So, I decide to see the movie Thor, but with some hesitation. This is my own culture as a Scandinavian, so maybe I am not supposed to write a review, maybe I will just spoil it all. I will of course be critical. <br/><br/>When I grew up I read the Edda, so I know the stories of Norse Mythology well. This is also my first question, when you read the real stories, as they were taken down by my distant ancestors, what is it that make the writers and directors change them when making the movie? Is it because they were not good enough? The movie Thor reads like a five year old who was told the real stories but decides to vulgarize them. Or maybe it was due to bad memory, maybe it was on purpose. <br/><br/>The fact remains, they have taken a beautiful story and ripped it to pieces. It makes me sad because when people hear ""Thor"" they will recall all the wrong images. Sure, some ideas have been preserved, like some of the names and places, but just as many are made up and the whole conflict with the ""Jotuns"" have been turned into a simplistic black and white world. It makes you wonder, was this done because movie makers think that viewers cannot understand the real story, that it would be too complicated? <br/><br/>And then the whole connection with the present, it turns the figure of Thor into a freak-show. And the sword associations to King Arthur with the sword stuck in the ground. Can't Hollywood tell a story without mixing it with Anglo Saxon familiarities? When Jackson made the Ring at least he tried to follow the original book. It's difficult to understand how Branagh could put his name to this lot. It's all very embarrassing, from story to acting."

"JackKirbyStanLee","10","3","7","15 May 2011"," I've Waited 30 Years For This Movie; Absolutely Spectacular!
","I'm a professional in my 30's. As a young boy, I'd read Thor comics and so many times, I had visualized the other realms created by the minds of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. I've waited 30 years for a film to present the fantastic universe that I imagined so many years ago. Not only did Thor exceed all of my expectations, it did it in a way that brought back those wonderful moments of my youth. It also allowed me to share those moments with my son, age 9. There is not a single thing about this movie that could have been done better. Despite my high expectations, Marvel has produced a masterpiece that exceeds anything they've done so far.<br/><br/>VISUALLY SPECTACULAR. The images of heroes hurtling through space and time, the battle-scenes of unleashing otherworldly, God-like power, and the panoramic images of the supernatural universe were utterly breathtaking. I have not stopped talking about this move for more than 3 days now. I had the expectation that this would be just a story about Thor falling to earth and doing human things. Somehow I just expected that the trillions of worlds explored by Thor and his companions could never make it onto the big screen. Boy, was I wrong. I can't say more without spoiling the film, but I will just say that the special effects were truly MIND BOGGLING. I will be seeing this movie a 2nd time... and I never watch movies more than once.<br/><br/>MUST BE SEEN in 3D IMAX I've seen 3D movies that didn't quite work in 3D. In recent years, 3D has gotten better and better, but I feel that no other movie has taken full advantage of 3D like this one. Even Avatar- for all its brilliance- does not hold a candle to the way Thor immerses viewers in scenes that can truly only be called epic. And by epic, I don't mean the overused internet version of the word, but in the classic sense of the word. Thor in IMAX 3D has to be the most visually stunning film I've ever seen.<br/><br/>CLEAN ENOUGH DESPITE PG-13 *** I tend to be super conservative about what I let my kids watch. Thor never once made me squirm. Although the battle scenes were powerful (our seats were shaking and rumbling) there was no gratuitous violence. If nothing else, only the previews were objectionable for kids under 13.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT I'd say this is the best movie I've seen in more than a decade. If I can make any suggestions, it would simply be to make sure you see the IMAX 3D version, as anything less would not do it justice.<br/><br/>10 out of 10! I am looking forward to seeing the next chapter of the Thor saga!!!!"
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","3","7","7 May 2011"," ""Thor"" earns its power with strong leads and a focus on character arcs
","Looking at the whole of the Marvel universe, Thor would have to be the black sheep. For one thing, he's the Norse god of thunder. His world — the realm of Asgard — is completely foreign to us, as is most Norse mythology. Greek mythology, maybe, but definitely not Norse. As for the hero himself, similar to Superman, he possesses inherent power and immortality and wields as brute an arrogance as his mighty hammer. In other words: hard to identify with and hard to like. Yet under Kenneth Branagh's direction, the worlds of magical legend and that of the contemporary superhero manage to find a common ground through humor and relatable themes of familial conflict. Channeled through Chris Hemsworth's bravado and highly aware performance, ""Thor"" manages to stand tall as a hero's journey among all else, a trait that serves as its saving grace.<br/><br/>Bouncing back and forth between Asgard and modern day New Mexico, ""Thor"" tells the story of how the young arrogant king-to-be of Asgard reignited a long-ended war between his people and the evil Frost Giants and was therefore banished to Earth by his father Odin (Hopkins). Now a mortal on Earth, Thor seeks to reclaim his power and the throne with the help of an astro-physicist (Portman), while his younger brother Loki (Hiddleston) plans to secure his own place as ruler.<br/><br/>Thor's personal quest as well as the conflict between him, his father and Loki provide the film's true lifeblood. The three give the film's best performances, and though familial treachery rates far from original storytelling, there's a reason these Shakespearean plots have been around forever. Hiddleston thrives here as the story's most complex character, which is a title more often given to someone other than the villain in a superhero film. His transformation from untrustworthy worm to full-on bad guy feels complete thanks to the way Hiddleston seizes every moment of screen time.<br/><br/>But that doesn't mean he overshadows our golden-maned hero. Hemsworth shows a definitive comfort as a leading man, happily commanding the attention that ought to be demanded of an actor playing a god. It helps that he's 20 different kinds of jacked and therefore physically appropriate for the role, but he shows surprising depth. In the Jotunheim (Frost Giants' planet) sequence, the one that gets Thor in trouble with Dad, he infuses a childish innocence into his untempered pride, and we become more apt to root for his predestined change of character rather than despise his arrogance. Although the writers give him one too many shouts of ""Noooo!"" during the film, he makes it convincing, especially when he comes to the realization that he simply cannot take back his hammer, Mjolnir, or his powers through simple use of force.<br/><br/>Speaking of force, Hemsworth makes the grade as an ass-kicker without a doubt, yet the action sequences leave a bit of something to be desired in terms of excitement and creativity. But while Branagh might not be a student of action filmmaking, he never loses sight of what's at stake. The writers have ensured that the action sequences feel necessary rather than like needless fluff; the tension of the story keeps the fights engaging and Branagh retains focus on the characters involved.<br/><br/>The element of the script that will divide opinion the most will likely be its humor. Kat Dennings' character carries the brunt of the comic relief as Darcy, an intern for Portman's Jane Foster and Stellan Skarsgård's Erik Selvig. Sometimes it goes a bit too far, but I would almost label her as crucial: she helps keep ""Thor"" from getting too serious to be taken seriously. ""Thor"" contains a lot of talk about magic, science and rainbow bridges; it helps to have a character that takes all of it lightly and also breaks the rhythm of what would be an all-too-typical ""girl meets boy fallen from the sky"" love story between Jane and Thor.<br/><br/>At the same time, Hemsworth ends up being the funniest of anyone. He doesn't even flinch as he proclaims his enjoyment of a cup of coffee and smashes the mug on the floor demanding another. He doesn't play it up for laughs or try and act confused by why it's not acceptable behavior: he lets it be part of who he is. Branagh and the script also do a nice job using humor to break the awkwardness that occurs when the Warriors Three and Sif (Asgard's best fighters) come to Earth looking for Thor. Their extravagant costumes look simply awful out of the context and set design of Asgard that one of the film's pivotal action sequences that follows would've lost all sense of credibility without some self-aware humor. Considering the potential for ""Thor"" to be a laughingstock in this manner, it's actually impressive how well Branagh, cast and crew handled the clash of fantasy and reality. <br/><br/>The only significant chunk of the film that didn't quite hit was the love story. Despite being excellent in the role, Portman had no reason to take the part of Jane Foster. She's criminally underused in the film and rather one-dimensional. She cares about her life's work and is smitten with Thor. Their scenes together are nice, but hardly serve to up the stakes when Thor returns to Asgard for the final showdown. My curiosity for a ""Thor"" sequel definitely hinges more so on wanting to see Asgard and its realms more fully realized than wanting to know whether Thor and Jane can keep their flame alive despite being worlds apart.<br/><br/>But no matter how many misfires you can find in certain aspects of the film, its devotion to its core conflict and character arcs helps make everything more entertaining. The plot of ""Thor"" remains simple and pure; a lesson in humility that few summer blockbusters are ever willing to learn.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"

","I remember thinking when I was watching this movie that if someone asks me how I liked it I would tell them, ""I loved every minute of it."" And I did except for 3 minutes when toward the climax it became a little confusing. You'll know what I mean when you see it.<br/><br/>I have appreciated Kenneth Branagh's talent as an actor and director since I saw Henry V in the 80's. He has a way of telling a story that is huge and complex in a very human and personal way. And it is just like that in Thor. The images of the Heavens match the beauty that we saw in Avatar. Beautiful with deep, rich colors and scope of focus and never losing us in its sweep. The relationships that Thor has with his family are just like that with human ones. He catches Thor at the cusp of his becoming a man and ready to be knighted as king of the heavens. And like many of that age he falters and his weaknesses overcome him. But through adversity and temptation his spirit is tried and purified.<br/><br/>When Thor arrives at Earth, Kenneth Branagh gives us quite the humorous look at the interaction of god and beautiful woman and her colleagues. The movie has humor in abundance which is such a rarity for movies of this sort.<br/><br/>I gave this movie 9 out of 10 stars because in so many ways it was nearly perfect. A treat for the eyes, ears and heart. I hope you like it as much as I did."
"alibibeats2","10","3","7","6 May 2011"," Thor
","Well, I must say leading up to the release of Thor, I wasn't excited at all and was trying all I could do to avoid it. Reason being, I was never a fan of Thor when I was younger. My 1st encounter with the character was when he was featured in an episode of the Incredible Hulk series back in the 80's. And I remember I was not impressed at all with the outfit & mythology that surrounded his Character. Thor the film however changed my mind. Its amazing how an adaptation can go so far and actually emulate the kind of imagination the creators actually had for this Character and his universe. I congratulate the Director & all involved in this movie for making it such an awesome experience in the cinema as the visual effects were outstanding & nailed to the core. The story itself was an absolute gem. Yes, we may have stumbled across similar story lines elsewhere. But the writers did a brilliant job to make this their own. All the Characters were built up well throughout & I don't say this often, but the acting was probably one of the best you will see in a Marvel movie adaptation. Thor is actually a masterpiece. And should go on to claim to be this years greatest blockbuster. DC comics have the new Batman flying its flag. Marvel have, The Iron Man, Thor & possibly Captain America & the Avengers. Its exiting times to be a comic fan, with films like Thor laying a new benchmark in story telling & it could only be justice to us fans to wait for a second Thor movie. I for one, will be extremely anxious to what will happen next. One thing though,.... do watch Thor in 3D. Truly amazing."
"freemantle_uk","8","3","7","1 May 2011"," A hell of a start to the 2011 summer season
","We all know that in 2012 we should be getting the ultimate superhero film, The Avengers, being set up by Marvel Studios. But they have to set it up first, starting with Iron Man in 2008. Now Marvel have to turned to another on of their properties, Thor, and again made another entertaining superhero film.<br/><br/>In 970 A.D. there was epic war between the Asgardians lead by Odin (Anthony Hopkins) and the frost giants, who want to conquer Earth. Years later Odin makes his son, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) his heir but a group of frost giants attempt to steal the Casket of Ancient Winters. Thor's brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), convicts Thor and his companions to go to war against the Frost Giants, against their father's orders. As punishment Thor is banished to Earth with his powers and hammer, Mjolnir taken away from him. On Earth Thor befriends a young scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her companions Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skargard) and Darcy (Kat Dennings). Thor sets out to receive his hammer from SHIELD whilst in Asgard Loki continues his plotting ways to take control.<br/><br/>Thor is Marvel's interpretation of Norse mythology and he is a God, with powers to much. A problem could have been that Thor would have too powerful so would not be in an real danger, but the writers were able to counter at it in two ways. First is Thor does have powerful adversaries, who can match or at least give him a good run for his money. The other idea was that Thor's powers were taken away from him and he become not more then a physically fit man who was fallible. Thor has to earn his powers back and prove himself, that is the core of the story.<br/><br/>Marvel has made bold choices when picking their directors: Jon Favreau was an actor before turning into a family-comedy director and Louis Leterrier was a full on action director. Kenneth Branagh is known for making Shakespeare adaptation and films about classic stories, so it was interesting choice for both the director and the studio. Whether or not you like Branagh's movies there is no denying he has a grand visual style and a perfect fit for bringing all these different worlds to life: the bright fantasy world of Asgard, the dark cold world of Jotunheim and Earth looking like it does in Iron Man. Thor itself is a strange mix of fantasy and science-fiction, trying to combine the two. The special effects were of a high standard and the action was good, with Hemsworth being particularly convincing as a fighter, beating his way through SHIELD. I'm sure if Branagh returns for a sequel his action direction will improve. Branagh ensured that there was a health mix of action, drama, romance and comedy, all the ingredients needed for a fun at the cinema. They are obviously trying to be like Iron Man, having a prologue then showing the set-up and matching its tone.<br/><br/>There is a great cast in the film, I expect Hemsworth will be a big star. He was really convincing as a young warrior who is impulsive and defiant and has to learn to be responsible. Hiddleston is wonderfully weasel like, a power hunger individual who manipulates everyone around him, he is a complex character, the opposite of Thor. Loki lacks strength but is cunning and his character was similar to Commodus in Gladiator and Wormtongue in Lord in the Rings. Portman and Hemsworth have excellent chemistry together and I expect Jane's knowledge will be of use later on in the series. Skargard's character was basically in the film to arch Vikings myths to the characters, but it was done effectively. And Thor is easily Anthony Hopkins' best performance in a film for a long time.<br/><br/>I do have criticise that Thor did rely a little too much on comic relief. Of course a film like this does need a little comedy, but the Dracy character was only in the film so all her lines can be jokes and wisecracks.<br/><br/>For comic book fans there are little references for you, including a cameo by Jeremy Remner as Hawkeye. I would to have like to seen a little news footage showing the events of Iron Man 2, because they were going on at the same time as Thor. And everyone needs to stay behind for the post-credit scene because it will be important for later films."
"candidateshan","7","3","7","1 May 2011"," Thor! What should I watch it for?
","Looks like it's going to be open season on Thor puns and Norse jokes. ""My kingdom for a Norse"" and ""Thor-oughly good fun"" have already been thrown up in other reviews. And I've Thort up a few myself.<br/><br/>I'll admit, I'd decided even before I saw the movie that I was going to start this review with ""Thor! What will it be remembered for? Absolutely nothing."" Because, you know, it just seemed like that sort of film. But here's the thing - yes, it has a ridiculous premise, and slips irretrievably into superhero clichés halfway - but the rest of the film is actually a blast.<br/><br/>The movie opens with Natalie Portman, Kat Dennings and Stellan Skarsgaard knocking down a man who's materialised in the middle of an unusual storm. We learn from a quick flashback that this 'homeless crazy dude' is actually a God named Thor, exiled by his daddy to the mortal realm because (Spoiler) he picked a fight he shouldn't have with the Frost Demons next door. Thor has a brother, Loki, who is much cleverer but - is he all that he appears to be? And what is the terrible secret Odin is hiding from him? Will Asgard be forced into war with the Frost Demons, allowing Branagh to shoot more cool war sequences in a Lord of the Rings-meets-Antartica setting? (SPOILER) All this stress and family drama drives Odin to the divine equivalent of a heart attack, which sets the stage for Loki to proclaim himself king and prance around in villainous robes.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Thor wakes up on earth and is understandably upset to find that (a) of all the states in all the countries in all the nine realms, daddy's cruelly chosen to banish him to New Mexico and (b) he can't get his Giant Tool to work any more. No, really. His divine power comes from a giant, swinging hammer. There's lots of unresolved sexual tension between him and Portman, and he promises to come back for her once he's reclaimed his um, hammer, but nothing happens because, you know, (SPOILER) he can't get the um, hammer up. Up off the ground, that is. Really, there's nothing Freudian about this at all, stop rolling your eyes.<br/><br/>The best parts of the movie are actually those where Thor is learning to function around humans. There's a running gag in the movie – Thor makes sneering comment to human, is promptly taken down by a hypodermic needle, or Kat Dennings' taser, or knocked down by a car. In the vein of - ""You dare threaten me with that puny aaaargh"".<br/><br/>Branagh directs these scenes with great comic timing, keeps the main story arc moving along at a terrific pace, and finds time to showcase the formidable acting chops of British actors Hopkins and Hiddleston. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, with Thor gone from Asgard and Odin in the Vikingtensive care unit (Norse! My sponge bath!), Loki effectively doesn't have a nemesis, and here the movie begins to slip into mediocrity, as the script struggles to manufacture conflict. By the time Loki has sent a weird fire breathing suit of armour to destroy Thor, things have gone from bad to Norse. <br/><br/>Still, let's keep perspective here, it's a superhero movie based on a B-grade Marvel comicbook series. It could've been much worse, but the tight pacing and superior acting helps it rise above the source material. Chris Hemsworth brings tremendous physical presence and an effortless, masculine charisma to the titular role, reminiscent of Russell Crowe in his Gladiator days. Yes, he's a loud, spoilt, arrogant bruiser just itching to start a fight, but you can't stay mad at him, he's so earnest and likable. And of course, there's the scene where he swaggers into camera shirtless, the better for you to admire his power lifter's torso.<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins is always a pleasure to watch, even when he's phoning in his performance. Shades of the role he played in Beowulf here, the long suffering ruler with a dirty little secret that nearly proves the undoing of his kingdom. Kat Dennings steals every scene she has a line in and elevates her character well above the Scooby Doo caricature it had been scripted to be. Jeremy Renner makes a blink-and-you-miss-it cameo as Hawkeye, looking like he's reprising his role from 28 Weeks later (swapping his a sniper rifle for a bow). And Tom Hiddleston, as Loki, delivers easily the best performance in the movie, creating a complex, sympathetic villain.<br/><br/>Now, I'm not faulting Natalie Portman's acting, I'm just asking - why is she even in this movie? Since her riveting, award-winning turn in Black Swan, the woman seems determined to prevent us from taking her seriously. First, a buttock baring, leather thong wearing role in Your Highness, and now this. ""Look, I'm a scientist, I can spout astrophysics jargon, I'm smart ....(sees Thor, jaw drops) ..well helloooo handsome. Oh nothing, just sitting here by myself (giggle), trying to figure out how wormholes work. What? A rainbow bridge connects the nine realms (including one with Frost Monsters in it) and that's all there is? Oh, you're so big and clever and strong (giggle) ... shall we go someplace quiet and talk astronomy?"".<br/><br/>Anyway, all things considered, it's a fun movie, and good for a few laughs (I loved the bit where Thor calls Agent Coulson ""Phil, son of Coul""). Go see it, just don't expect the Dark Knight. And stay for the post credit teaser scene that's become the trademark of these pre-Avengers movies."

","the movie delivers pretty well. i think the best thing about marvel studios is that they have a big interest in the characters themselves. the performances made the movie for me. the story is not as twisty as i have expected but it does not bore at all. the battle scenes are awesome but there's a lesson to learn, don't watch marvel movie trailers ever again. All the action sequences are shown in one way or another in the trailers (just like iron man 2), but it was great fun, I'm gonna definitely watch it again and i know I'm not the only one. i loved Chris hemsworth as Thor, he was the best part of the film in my opinion (robert Downey and Edward Norton were the best part of their respective films also, so we can conclude marvel is doing a damn freaking great job) plus the scene where selvig and Thor return to the trailer after some drinks is priceless... the 2 cameos were great as well."

","It was always going to be a challenge to make a live action version of the fantasy hero Thor, but I think Kenneth Branagh has achieved it.<br/><br/>Chris Hemsworth was impressive as the god of thunder banished from Asgard and all the main actors also were well acted. Tom Hiddleston was great as Loki, Thor's evil brother and while the connections to the other Avengers were in the film, it wasn't as blatant as Iron Man 2.<br/><br/>Overall definitely worth watching on the big screen and make sure you stay to watch the bit after the credits.<br/><br/>The bar has been set, next up is Captain America and how they will fit Thor, Hulk, Captain America and Iron Man into one film will be interesting to see!"

","First off I am not a Thor fan nor i am a comic book fan. I went into this movie with no expectations, expecting another popcorn fest along the lines of the Ironman movies. Therefore I was quite pleasantly surprised by Thor. Whereas most comic book movies lack plot or storyline, Thor actually engages the viewer with the classic tale of loving father and the wayward son finding his way along with all the typical action requirements of a comic book movie. I can't vouch for Thor's faithfulness to the comic of course but that it still managed to entertain this none-fan is a testament to the movie. Whilst not perfect it's certainly more entertaining than that other popcorn flick, Battle LA which deserves a Razzy award.<br/><br/>If you know nothing of Thor, go watch this movie and be entertained as Thor certainly does. The only issue I may like to mention is the poor use of 3D. The cinema I went to only had 3D for Thor and I was thus forced to watch it in 3D. Having previously being wowed by TRON LEGACY in 3D I can say that the 3D work on Thor was quite lacking. Also I feel that 3D is been unnecessarily pushed onto EVERY movie with the slightest amount of action, and Thor's problem is many of it's action scenes don't need the 3D treatment. My advice is watch this in normal 2D and save yourself some money."

","Saw it this morning and as excited I was for this movie it did not deliver to the expectations. They tried to make it a bit funnier like Iron Man but not every superhero movie can me made like that. The special effects in the movie were undoubtedly spectacular however, the movie was moving too quick. The lead characters for Thor and Loki were perfect in their characters but the script was somehow not able to justify their characters better. I hope they do not repeat it in the next Thor franchise and end up doing multiple Hulk like mistakes. This movie could have been a bit better if the script could have allowed the character to settle down like they did it for Iron Man. Let's hope for the best for the rest of the Marvel movies coming out this year."
"The-Last-Prydonian","6","4","11","2 May 2011"," Derivative and hackneyed but Hemswroth scores highly
","With just one more movie to go before next years big screen adaptation of Marvel comics ""The Avengers"" hits the big screen ""Thor"", the penultimate film in the Marvel chain of films that makes up one quarter of the Avengers team that acts as a precedent to what is to come. Preceded by ""Iron Man"" and It's sequel as well as 2008's ""The Incredible Hulk"" reboot, not one of those films (although none of which were bad) were anything close to remarkable. So with this in mind I have to admit that my hopes for ""Thor"" weren't incredibly high but I decided to at least give it a chance and watch the movie with an open mind. However once again I can't say that my expectations were not confirmed.<br/><br/>The set up which is plain and simple enough is this, King Odin (Anthony Hopkins) rules over the world of Asgard. A realm where magic and science are one and the same. His people defend the nine realms from the Frost Giants of Jotunheim and in defending the Norse people of Earth in 970 AD they come to be worshipped as Gods. In the present Odin has two sons Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and Thor(Chris Hemsworth) who will one day take his father's place and ascend the throne of Asgard. When a group of Frost Giants invade their kingdom in a failed bid to retrieve the Casket of Ancient Winters which was taken from them by the Asgaridans after their defeat over a millennia ago. Thor demands that an example must be made of their icy foes. Going against the orders of Odin he leads a band of his friends to confront them ultimately leading to a war which enrages Odin who strips Thor of his powers and exiles him to Earth. It is on Earth he is eventaully forced to redeem himself and become Earth's greatest defender while befriending scientist Jane Foster (Nathalie Portman)<br/><br/>As a film ""Thor"" marks a departure for it's director Kenneth Brangah who up until now has been concerned mainly with helming serious drama's as well as his trademark inclination for adapting Shakespeare's plays to the big screen. I was intrigued how he would cope with handling a big budget fantasy/adventure movie and It's to his credit that he does an admirable job. His handling of the fight scenes is top notch and are well choreographed where upon the cinematography fits in well with the flow of the action. While the more light hearted moments of the script compliment the overall feel of the film which means it never takes itself too seriously. The fish out of water moments where Thor explores the new world that he has found himself banished strike the right chord and are handled with good natured charm. As Thor Chris Hemsworth is equal parts charismatic and charming while portraying the acquired level of cockiness so that he makes a affable yet flawed hero who doesn't fall beyond the way side in to caricature. He also proves to also be adept at the more physical aspects. The supporting cast are also solid with Nathalie Portman proving to be likable and touches the right note of sincerity as Jane, while being a neat foil to Hemsworth with Anthony Hopkins providing a commanding and wise presence as Odin. But the break through performance for me has to go to Tom Hiddleston who is fantastic as Loki. He really makes you believe in Thor's stepbrother if at times you find yourself struggling to completely swallow everything due to the slightly leaky script. I am keen to see how his career will progress on the back of ""Thor"" as he he is someone who I think might have a promising career ahead of him.<br/><br/>What lets the film down is It's flat, routine plot which is overstepped by of the action and the overall grandeur spectacle. The sub-plot regarding Thor's road to redemption meanders in to cliché and is therefore predictable, relying on his trademark hammer as a threadbare tool to punctuate the point. Some of the characterisation from some of the supporting characters is a little too hammy and a bit thin on the ground and seem at times to be nothing more than window dressing to help further the progression of the films narrative. I also found myself not being able to reconcile myself to the motivations of Loki who the film tries to inject some depth in to him which goes beyond that of being a mere villain and that of a tragic figure but it doesn't come off as the least bit convincing. It's easier to envisage Loki as being a man driven by greed and ambition rather than that of a despondent antagonist left rocked by the sudden revelation that his father has been forced to impart on him. Triggering him to further an agenda to prove his inner worth. The presence of SHIELD, the government agency seen previously in ""Iron Man 2"" is only there to generate some action and create an obstacle to Thor retrieving his magical hammer which has been sent to Earth along with him. Anything other than that it just seems like they factor in as plot set up to next years Avengers movie and offer little else to the films plot making them largely obligatory. An overawing experience for non-fans although I suspect those more familiar with the comics will find more to like. I wouldn't bet my hopes on the film finding a wider appeal beyond it's fandom on the strengths of it. As this type of film goes It's inoffensive enough and passes the time and has It's colourful. little flourishes to commend it. However It's just another by the numbers blockbuster that ends up putting It's money where it's heart should be."

","Up until 2011, I hardly knew anything about Thor. My knowledge of Thor was only from 'Adventures in Babysitting' when the little girl was obsessed with him. This movie just struck a cord with me. I loved it! I even saw it a second time at the theater. I love fish-out-of-water stories. Thor has a flare for the dramatic and when he gets to earth, he goes around throwing coffee mugs, talking Shakespearean and goes to a pet store looking for a horse.<br/><br/>After Odin banishes him from Asgard, Thor crashes on Earth, right into Jane Foster. His hammer, Mjolnir lands about 50 miles away. Whoever is worthy will be able to wield it. Thor takes Jane on his mission to retrieve it, but he cannot pick it up because Odin took all his powers away.<br/><br/>Meanwhile. Thor's adopted brother, Loki looks to control Asgard and sends a Destroyer to Earth to kill Thor and annihilate the town he's in. Thor and Loki go head to head in a fight between brothers. There's plenty of action, comedy and sci-fi. If you love Norse mythology and comic book movies, you'll love THOR!!!"
"narine_tevosyan","8","2","4","27 April 2019"," Review
","Thor is about the god of thunder trying to get back to Asgard after being banished to earth for starting a war. In the movie, his brother Loki tries to take the throne os Asgard and to destroy his brother and a species of ice monsters.
This fun, adventurous, visually appealing and surprisingly deep film is perfect for kids and adults alike. The advantage of this movie is its cast. Chris Hemsworth is great as Thor, and the legendary Anthony Hopkins is notably good at playing the Allfather Odin, Thor's father. Also another advantage is the story and the messages that it offered. When Thor becomes the king, his behavior in this period is not wise and boyish and because of that his father sends him to our land. However, in the end he realizes that to be king he must be wise and prevent war. He learns his lesson by almost getting killed to protect the ones he loves. This message can have a strong impact on the viewer's mind and we can learn a lot. The disadvantage is its love story. The romance falls short and far too rushed with Natalie Portman's Jane Foster character. However, because it is an action and it is more about the battles and saving the world, it can be forgiven.
All in all, an action-packed adventure with amazing special effects and some romance makes this a good family movie."

","This movie is definitely not the best Marvel movie I have ever seen (Still debating over Guardians of the Galaxy or Avengers: Age of Ultron), but it is definitely the most beautiful one I have ever seen, The closest I have ever been to crying in a movie, and I saw Frozen before it was stupid and I also saw Gwen Stacy's death, 10 out of 10, definitely watch it. I probably wouldn't recommend it for ages under 10, some scary stuff like how the destroyer threw Thor and he was pretty bloody, it can also be kinda violent, like the anger that Odin used to yell at Thor, gives off a bad vibe, and the cameos are hilarious, like the billboard saying Journey into mystery, a reference to Thor's first comic appearance. I love it, and I'm not even a big Thor fan, I thought the movie would suck."
"andrewnmiller","10","2","4","6 March 2015"," All hail the God of Thunder.
","Having never read a single Thor comic when I was younger, I didn't know what to think of Thor when I sat down to watch it. Well, I will say that Thor is a great movie from its impressive visual design to its acting and even has a little Shakespearean drama thrown in for good mention. <br/><br/>Our story starts off well, first with Natalie Portman clobbering Thor with her car then the film cuts to 965 A.D. where the Asgardian king Odin does battle with the Frost Giants and their king, Laufey, defeats them and seizes the Casket of Ancient Winters. In the present day, Odin's son Thor is about to become king when the ceremony is rudely interrupted by the Frost Giants trying to recover the Casket. Against his father's orders, Thor, Loki and a few friends journey to Jotuhnheim to challenge Laufey. A fight breaks out between the Asgardians and the Frost Giants resulting in Odin having to saving their hides. For his son's overconfidence, Odin strips Thor of his powers and exiles him to Earth when Thor meets Dr. Jane Foster, Darcy Lewis and Dr. Erik Selvig. Meanwhile, Loki seizes the throne, while Thor learns to become more human and begins to develop a romantic attraction to Jane, but Thor must prove himself worthy in order to return home and stop Loki's devious plans. <br/><br/>Like other Marvel films before it, Thor show that in the right hands, a comic book film that may seem stupid can have secret complexities when it's put in the right directorial hands. Any discord I would have had with Kenneth Branagh being the director seemed to vanish in the first 30 minutes of the movie. This is a brave and dicey move for a director who is known for showing the theatrics and details of Shakespearean dialog to the silver screen to tackle a superhero film meant for general movie goers. Adding to the film are the Shakespearean undercurrents of disloyalty and sacrifice, not to mention Branagh bringing a bit of realistic feeling to the magical setting. It's also fair to say that Branagh understands the character of Thor and while his version of Thor differs from the comics, he still gets the main points down pretty well, much like how Christopher Nolan handled Batman. <br/><br/>When it comes to the humor, it doesn't feel overdone and provides us with a great change between what is going on in Asgard and Earth. Out of all the MCU films I've seen thus far, Thor got to be one of the most visually stunning, the effects and production design is eye-popping; Asgard just might be one of the most astonishing landscapes I've ever seen. I had to strain my eyes, attempting to take in all the elements in, but visuals can't sell a big summer movie without action and the movie gives us some great fight sequences. The battle on Jotuhnheim is fantastic, with Thor and his buddies showing off some awesome moves, the fight at the S.H.I.E.L.D. compound is realistic and thrilling, while the showdown between Thor and the Destroyer is another mind-blowing action scene. The musical score is also great with Patrick Doyle providing us with some unforgettable tunes that enhance our viewing of the movie.<br/><br/>The sibling conflict here is handled perfectly and is a powerful driving force during the film and is fully understood by the actors. Thor does show love for Loki, but there is an absence of understanding along with jealousy and loathing. Loki is far from being a one-dimensional cartoony villain but instead being a more likable villain who admires his father but also hates him. <br/><br/>As for the cast, they're all perfect. Chris Hemsworth exemplifies the personality of Thor perfectly, projecting Thor's journey from an egoistical warrior to a more humble, understanding person with ease along with humor, fighting, and love all being embraced in his performance flawlessly. Natalie Portman is enchanting and magnetic as Jane Foster; the scenes of her and Hemsworth together just seep chemistry while her scenes with Stellan Skarsgard and Kat Dennings excel with a great sense of friendship. Tom Hiddleson steals the film whenever he is on screen as the sliding, scheming yet strangely sensitive Loki; this is a perfectly dense part, and Tom never misses a beat while playing the character. Anthony Hopkins, rather than hamming it up, bring a great seriousness to the role of Odin by being threatening, yet wise and tried from his years of knowledge and learning, The sequences between him, Hemsworth and Hiddleson are wonderful, with each actor bringing all their talent to the table and accomplishing it beyond anyone's hopes. Jamie Alexander, Ray Stevenson, Tadanobu Asano and Josh Dallas are all good in their respective roles. Renee Russo gets a few brief appearances here and there as Frigga. Idris Elba is awesome as Heimdal and is a force to be reckoned with. Clark Gregg shows up as S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson and has a bigger role to play here. Stellan Skarsgard is great as Dr. Selvig. Even Samuel Jackson and Jeremey Renner show up briefly, teasing future MCU films. The only actor that I disliked was Kat Dennings as Darcy as she came across as annoying and pointless to the overall plot of the movie. <br/><br/>Now, I do have some problems with this film: the romance between Thor and Jane feels a little rushed into the story at break-nick speed and is given no room to develop into a much deeper love story. My other issue is how when Thor comes to Earth, he changes from being an egocentric warrior to being a more compassionate person within a matter of days, something I think could have been explored much more deeply. Outside of those problems, I really enjoyed Thor and you're a fan of comic book films, Give this film a watch, it'll knock your socks off."
"DonaldDooD","4","2","4","24 July 2014"," A Generic Action Film With a Superhero Coat of Paint
","Thor's 77% on Rotten Tomatoes is the #1 reason why I don't try out Marvel movies. I'm willing to see popcorn-only films, but Thor is so average, the action doesn't cover up the bland characters and pandering plot.<br/><br/>The deepest characters are barely two dimensional. You never get to sense Loki's deep envy of Thor, and Thor's only defining trait is arrogance. There is potential for Thor to grow up, but he never matures. He is punished for breaking the peace...but is forgiven for being heroic, a trait he never lacked. This is not how character arcs work!<br/><br/>And they're the most developed characters of the film. Anthony Hopkins literally sleeps through most of the movie. Sif and ""The Warriors Three"" are one dimensional, forgettable, wastes of time. S.H.I.E.L.D.'s inclusion is pointless, and the trio of human characters Thor hangs out with only subtract from the film. Kat Dennings only delivers ""funny"" quips, and the romantic subplot with Thor and Natalie Portman's character is as forced as they get. There's more romantic chemistry in Marley and Me. The only character I could get behind was Heimdall. Idris Elba keeps ending up as the strongest actor in character-weak films. But Heimdall serves little purpose beyond his role as gatekeeper.<br/><br/>If you really like comic books, I suppose the action is okay, but I was never amazed, nor amused by camp. I can't believe it doesn't get called out for its terrible script more often. Its just another Hollywood action flick that doesn't even pull of the tropes well. We deserve better than this."

","""I never wanted the throne, I only ever wanted to be your equal!"" – Loki<br/><br/>Marvel: Phase One is hurtling along the Bifrost (Norse Rainbow Road) at break-neck speed towards the eagerly awaited Avengers Assemble. Hold on a second though, as we're still missing a character: the God of Thunder, Thor son of Odin. With Iron Man, Captain America and the Hulk's backgrounds already covered, Thor was the final major Avenger to appear on screen, and, similar to Black Widow's incorporation into Iron Man 2, we are introduced to the complete Avengers line-up by the end of Thor, as Clint Barton (Hawkeye) features in a small role as an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Onto the small task of giving Thor a strong foothold then; Kenneth Branagh was arguably given the most arduous pre-Avenger movie to direct, having to create a story spanning across several worlds. Whilst it doesn't stand up to Iron Man and Iron Man 2, Thor is a decent enough film in its own right, greatly helped along the way by a strong cast.<br/><br/>Having disobeyed his father, King Odin (Hopkins), Thor (Hemsworth) is banished to Earth from his home realm of Asgard on war-mongering treason counts. Little brother Loki (Hiddlestone) becomes the de-facto heir to the throne. Whilst Thor tries to adjust to his human body and lifestyle, he meets an enchanting young scientist, Jane Foster (Portman), and gradually learns to quell his rash judgemental character. However, Loki has been secretly spinning a web to ensnare his extremely gullible blonde-haired brother, hatching a plot to wreak chaos wherever he possibly can.<br/><br/>Positives first: Kenneth Branagh did a very good job directing this film. He successfully got the best he could out of his actors. Hemsworth is commanding, loud, and has a perfect grasp of the term ""fool-hardy"". He shares a workable chemistry with Portman (some awkward moments, but nothing drastic), and plays extremely well off of the brilliant Hiddlestone. The two on screen brothers have an essence of polar opposition; one a devious, sincere and resolute thinker with patience in abundance, the other a foolish, brutalising warrior with a thirst for blood and glory. I'd like to have seen more of their relationship explored though, especially with their father. The supporting cast are also largely accomplished, Skarsgard, Hopkins and Elba in particular. Unfortunately I have to harshly critique both the character of Darcy and her portrayer, Kat Dennings. Pointless. She should never have been written into the film in the first place and genuinely ruined every scene she was in by being generally annoying and interrupting of any positivity taking place. Thor's crew were also fairly weak, and were merely there to serve a purpose of providing him an ally, nothing more, nothing less.<br/><br/>Storywise, Thor started very strongly; the mythical Lord of the Rings feel to the opening, and the exploration of Asgardian culture was all excellent, the visuals are mind-boggling to boot. The tone suggested at this point that Thor would be a sincere epic, detached from the general quirky Marvel superhero film feel. Enter Earth, and things change drastically. A let down at first, Thor's experiences on Earth are rife with comic relief, less in-your-face than Iron Man, but also less natural to the script. However, as the story develops, you begin to appreciate the change in tone between the two worlds as a representation of cultural differences. Branagh handles directing this complicated matter competently, but the story jumps around a bit too much to allow you to do the same (something I would suggest had something to do with the large number of writers). Along with a few questionable plot points (Loki knowing what Earthlings wear when he manifests himself onto the planet, Thor's regaining his powers from his comatose father's tear), the ending was fairly weak. Loki was beaten far too easily, and his story wasn't concluded properly, undeserving after a strong performance. The whole thing also felt a little rushed, possibly because the premise was to introduce Thor's background and set up his place in Avengers Assemble.<br/><br/>Thor is a mixed bag with regard to music. Asgard is littered with grandiose and majestic passages of music that would grace much more artistic films, and are befitting of the fantastic CGI scenery they are accompanying. However, Patrick Doyle is forced to work with the jagged tone of the film, and had to sacrifice building on the epic Asgardian themes for something more fitting with a general superhero score on planet Earth: piano for the romantic moments, standard percussion heavy action music for combat scenes, and so on.<br/><br/>Overall, Thor is an enjoyable film. You're not going to watch it if you're looking for something you have to immerse yourself within. It plays out exactly as a standard popcorn movie does: good guy versus bad guy, pretty, independent girl who suddenly is overcome by burly protagonist's masculinity etc. Where Thor excels beyond mediocrity is through its strong cast (Hiddlestone in particular), unbelievably stunning visuals (Asgard just blew me away) and a lack of reliance on action scenes to fill out the running time. It does, however, suffer from distinct changes in tone and disjointed plot elements, and a feeling of being three quarters finished due to the big rush towards Avengers Assemble."
"toqtaqiya2","7","2","4","23 December 2012"," The fourth Marvel Studios film is another triumph that's witty, dramatic and entertaining.
","Thor was one of two films by Marvel Studios released during the summer of 2011, the other being Captain America: The First Avenger. Both Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Captain America (Chris Evans) appeared in The Avengers (2012), a film that I initially didn't like much but after some time have grown to appreciate. The Avengers is a superb superhero film, one of the best of all time in fact. In Thor the best performance is by Tom Hiddleston as Loki. Tom again played Loki as the main villain in The Avengers. Loki is clearly up to no good but Hiddleston managed to show that he's a complex sympathetic character. Hemsworth was a good choice to play Thor, the crown prince of Asgard. With his dirty blond hair and ridiculously chiseled physique Hemsworth has plenty of charisma as Thor. The humor is frequent here and so is the action. The CGI was put to good use, and the realization of Asgard and the Bifrost is especially impressive. Still, the center of the film is the relation between Odin (Anthony Hopkins) and his two sons. Director Kenneth Branagh was a good choice to tell this drama reminiscent of a play by William Shakespeare. Hopkins is a commanding presence as Odin, so his is another standout performance. But really, all the actors deliver here. There's Sif (Jaimie Alexander) and the Warriors Three, there's Heimdall (Idris Elba), and there's Jane Foster (Natalie Portman). The love story is a bit rushed since Thor and Jane fall in love by the fire with a starry night sky behind them. The pacing too isn't perfect but Thor is a thrilling film which can improve just about anyone's mood. Patrick Doyle delivered a good score, and the Foo Fighters song Walk was also included in the film. In conclusion, there's much to like in Thor and I highly recommend seeing it."
"lil_mexx31","7","2","4","4 September 2012"," Perfect blend of Fantasy and Action
","Of all the movies leading into the Avengers, Thor was perhaps the film i was least looking forward to. Whenever I think of Marvel's superheroes, I think of Spiderman, Fantastic 4, IronMan, Hulk etc. The last guy that comes to mind is Thor, who is ""the god of lightening"". After watching this film however, he's right up there. I enjoyed the blend of fantasy, Shakespearean folklore and modern action. Everything seemed to flow through easily. The transitions from the planet Asguard and Earth were seamless and very well done. The special effects were decent and not too overbearing. The buildup to the Avenger's movie is in full effect in Thor with regular appearances of Agent Coulson representing S.H.I.E.L.D. <br/><br/>Thor was a pleasant surprise. I enjoyed the movie from start to finish. Chris Hemsworth performance as Thor was great. He was a natural fit for the character and showed a great range of emotion. He can be menacing and funny in one scene. He can also be serious and mellow as well which is impressive. His interaction with Jane (Natalie Portman) seemed authentic which would've been difficult to do with the story behind Thor. <br/><br/>All in all this movie kept me engaged and I bought into the Thor Mythology. I was entertained through out the film. There was a good balance of comedy/drama/action in Thor. Looking forward to the next phase in the next Thor movie.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

","After a slow start, with lots of actors speaking in stiff, we-are-an- ancient-peoples voices, Thor picks up as the vain, arrogant god comes to earth and hooks up with some scientists. But while the movie does get better, it never moves past the mark of a Saturday afternoon time killer. There is some pretty scenery and some nice effects (the fire-shooting armor giant is particularly nicely done), but nothing that raises this above the ordinary.<br/><br/>The acting is decent, although Thor's romance with the scientist feels less like true love than like two good-looking people who have fallen in lust, and there's not an ounce of real emotion anywhere in the spectacle. But it's perfectly fine for what it is."

","Speaking of movies, I saw 'Thor' last week. It's the story of the title character: Thor (played by the annoyingly-good looking Aussie Chris Hemsworth), God of thunder, son of Odin (Anthony Hopkins), and prince of the magical realm of Asgard. Thor is a powerful warrior who wields 'Mjolnir' the enchanted hammer and one of the most powerful weapons in the universe. He is also, however, arrogant and foolish. After going against his father's orders by towelling up an army of frost giants and reigniting an age old war, Odin strips him of his power and of his hammer and banishes him to Earth to live among the Earthlings. This is where the real fun begins.<br/><br/>The Thunder-God's interactions with the lowly mortals and his efforts to deal with his fall from grace provide bucket loads of chuckles and even a few LOL's. It's here that he meets astro-physicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her team. Natalie Portman is just delightful. Really, I think she may be my new favourite, or at least equal with Katy Perry, obviously for different reasons. Katy has the curvy figure and the sex appeal market cornered, but Natalie is just so pretty. She has that 'take home to meet mum' old fashioned goodness about her. You'd love to just cuddle her, and not just 'special' cuddles either. She'd also be perfect for 'picnic' cuddles, 'beach' cuddles, 'romantic movie' cuddles, or if you are a freaky old German 'abduct and keep hidden in your basement dungeon' cuddles. Seriously, she is worth the price of admission alone.<br/><br/>Anyway, the movie is just huge. Huge on special effects. Huge on epic battles. Huge on awesomeness. Plus Chris Hemsworth is huge. I may have to look up the diet he was on to prepare for the role. I assume that by eating the food he ate and doing zero exercise I will look equally as good with no shirt on after three months.<br/><br/>The movie gallops along at a lively pace for the whole 2 or so hours. If you go to the movies to kick back, not think a lot, and just enjoy yourself this is the movie for you. As far as action/ fantasy/ blockbuster films go this one is hard to beat. I give it a solid 4 out of 5 stars. The other great thing about it is that Marvel studios is tying it in with its other big movies 'Ironman 1 & 2', 'The Incredible Hulk', and the soon to be released 'Captain America' to make a massive 'Avengers' movie which will feature all of them fighting together. How awesome will that be??!! It's pure fan boy comic book fantasy.<br/><br/>And on another side note, Thor would kick the absolute crap out of Superman. Seriously."

","Thor seems like a movie that should have been really really bad when you hear the premise. The God of Thunder is punished by his father for disobeying him. So he sends him to Earth where he meets a college student and falls in love. Meanwhile his father has fallen ill and Thor's brother, who becomes evil, takes over as king. Yeah, doesn't really sound like it would turn out good, but surprisingly it came out pretty well.<br/><br/>I think the only reason this movie worked as well as it did was because they played it so over the top. Everything is overblown, and that's why the film is entertaining. It's downright hilarious in a few parts. Had they taken itself as seriously as The First Iron Man, or the first two-thirds of the Incredible Hulk this film would have been a disasaster.The character's themselves are fine, Thor starts out as a bit of an ass, but since they play it so over the top I didn't mind it as much as Iron Man. The villain was pretty cool. And I really liked Darcy, I don't know why exactly, but I just really liked her.<br/><br/>However, because the film is so over the top, when it does try to take itself seriously, it doesn't always work. Sometimes it just comes off as unintentionally hilarious. Other problems I have: the action is too short at times and too few of them. But like I said, it's funny enough to where I forgive that. I didn't like how quickly Thor just adjusted to human life. This may be a spoiler, but after Loki tells him his father is dead and he can't return, he mopes for one night, and then seems like he's perfectly happy with it. Come on Thor you can't get over this that quickly.<br/><br/>Really this film just didn't blow me away. It was entertaining, but there was only one part where I was really impressed. That was the scene at the end of the credits. I won't spoil it, but of all the pre-Avengers movies post credits scenes, this one is my favorite"
"jzappa","7","2","4","10 September 2011"," A Darwinian Superman II with Big Laughs
","Nearly half of Thor is set in Asgard, one of the universe's nine ""realms,"" which is reigned over by King Odin. Thor is Odin's oldest son and is therefore entitled to the throne, but he's foolhardy, bigheaded and impetuous, which is why he heads a group of fighters in an anticipatory assault against Asgard's foes, the Frost Giants. For this, Odin takes away Thor's power, which comes from his magical hammer, and expels him to Earth, where he's accommodated by Natalie Portman, in her third decidedly unambitious screen role since her success with Black Swan, an astrophysicist who's in the infancy of hypothesizing the very universal trapdoor through which Thor just came. The biggest shock is that the film is most effective and involving where you would least expect it. One would think that Branagh would do more with the film's unsmiling supernatural constituents and probably labor over its more down-to-earth relief stretches, yet it's precisely the opposite.<br/><br/>The tone is unexpectedly good-humored. Baffled as to who he is, Jane imagines that Thor might be extraterrestrial, although her partner Stellan Skarsgård is dubious because all the words and names that Thor uses are recognizable to him from his Scandinavian background. Nonetheless, they wind up helping him in his pursuit to reclaim the hammer, albeit double-super-secret government agency S.H.I.E.L.D., headed by Clark Gregg's Agent Coulson, known from the Iron Man movies, has located it already. Meanwhile, back in Asgard, Thor's younger brother Loki, who initially seemed to be a level-headed sounding board, is scheming behind Thor's back to guarantee that his exile is eternal and he inherits the kingdom. Given Branagh's qualifications in Shakespeare and literary adaptations, one would assume that the royal and familial plot on Asgard would be the film's highlights, but these scenes are indeed very tedious, and occasionally fairly stilted.<br/><br/>Maybe it's due to all the digital sets and backdrops, which are lavishly accomplished but never quite seem palpable, not to mention a whole 'nother century of cinema's worth of dutch angles. Where Branagh genuinely enlivens the film is on Earth, where a light-hearted and even cleverly hilarious streak offsets the take-me-serious histrionic matters. The first half hour of this silly movie is indeed a drag as it's too sanctimonious, but once Thor discovers himself in the deserts of New Mexico, it's priceless, and all the more so as it's so unexpected, to see these very relatable mere mortals look on while he speaks in some sort of imitation-medieval English. ""I need sustenance!"" he proclaims at a small-town diner, shortly before smashing his coffee cup on the floor. And eventually he grasps, rather hilariously, that he's no longer as mighty as he was before, his schooling in modesty and logic assume a valid emotional concentration.<br/><br/>Thor, a prince in any case, is chivalrous and reverential of women, but also a hard-drinking, giant-slaughtering conqueror once deified by Vikings. We find ourselves regularly laughing with the movie, for instance at the way he reacts to doctors attempting to take his blood, or how he asks for that second cup of coffee at breakfast. Still, where the movie loses my interest is in that faraway dimension, where the set design's tawdry golden flash envelops the quarrels of the gods---essentially, the swarthy conspirator against the heroic Aryan---comes across as an incessant, uninflected one-note huff. Kat Dennings as Portman's friend discharges some well-delivered lines and then practically evaporates, beautiful bosom and all, but on Asgard, Rene Russo, as Odin's wife-slash-Thor's mother, has one line and nothing else to do.<br/><br/>Thankfully, the Shakespearean at the helm manages to inculcate a taste of the Bard's irony. Speaking of which, just because Loki's a hackneyed character doesn't mean young British actor Tom Hiddleston wouldn't make a first-rate Edmund in King Lear: He's better at relating his resentment and jealousy than any evil or wickedness. Thor boils down to nothing more than big laughs, loud and tacky Hollywood action, and a hero who requires suffering the loss of his might before he can truly be mighty. It's a lesser installment in the superhero adaptation bubble, but one that is wonderfully entertaining on its own restricted conditions."

","When it comes to Marvel Studios, they really know how to put well made movies together. Better yet they know how to adapt them from their source material and make them into entertaining, humorous, and action packed movies. They started with surprisingly great Iron Man, then went on to make an improved Incredible Hulk movie than the 2003 Ang Lee version, and last year they put out, the not quite as good as the first but still enjoyable, Iron Man 2. Now this year we get to Thor, and in July Captain America.<br/><br/>Thor might not be as well known as Spider-man or even Iron Man, but once audiences check out his movie he will definitely be known. He is the God of thunder, son of Odin (Anthony Hopkins), and he's played by Australian actor Chris Hemsworth. When his father banishes him to Earth he meets a girl named Jane (Natalie Portman) and her research team which consists of Kat Dennings and Stellan Skarsgard. While on Earth, his father falls into a deep coma allowing his brother Loki (Tom Hiddelston) to be King and force his ways on everyone in Asgard. All the while Thor must find his mighty hammer, for it holds great power.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie we get lots of action sequences, some laugh out loud moments, and even some well played out drama that works mainly because of the chemistry between Hemsowrth and Portman. Kenneth Branagh has put together a movie most thought wouldn't work well or fit in well with the other characters in the Avengers since Thor is a Norse God and isn't from Earth. So it's a good thing they were able to make such an enjoyable movie out of his character otherwise he could have brought down the Avengers in a way.<br/><br/>One of the problems a lot of people had with Iron Man 2 was the fact that they tried way too hard to put in little hints at the Avengers whenever they could. In the end it felt it was just too many and the majority were not needed. With Thor, they handle all the Avengers mentions quite well. Other than a scene after the credits with Samuel L. Jackson back as Nick Fury, we also get Jeremy Renner showing us a little of his character Hawkeye who will be in the Avengers, as well as Clark Gregg back as Agent Coulson who works for S.H.I.E.L.D.<br/><br/>All in all I would say definitely go out and see Thor while it's in the theater. It's a great summer popcorn film that the whole family should be able to enjoy.<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10"

","I confess i loved this movie, and at first i laughed at the concept. Thor! In modern day, seriously?! But finding out Kenneth Branagh was on board immediately had my attention. The man is a gift to theatre and movies alike, genius like this deserves full attention so needless to say this caught mine.<br/><br/>I saw this in the theatre because I was convinced it was a movie that merited my very rare trips to the big, full-screen-and i was not disappointed. From the very first, I was happy to surrender disbelief. The casting was excellent-though I did grumble at Anthony Hopkins at first. I felt he would distract me from the story-he did somewhat but not enough to destroy the flow of the story, and Renee Russo was undeniably gorgeous.<br/><br/>After that it was all story. Imagine...take Norse Mythology and smash it into the 21st century. Pure fun. <br/><br/>Only serious complaints: some clumsily done special effects and costumes-especially Ray Stevenson in a fat suit. Sigh.<br/><br/>Would I see it again? <br/><br/>Absolutely."

","It's a fun flick but that's about it. I particularly thought the action scenes could be a bit cooler and complex towards the end but all the excitement and fight scenes occur early on. The ending fight scene was lame. Also the Frost Giants were all clones... very dull enemies. However, that's just the action. The story was very simple and I felt like any Marvel Comic fan or reader could've easily written it. Nothing out of the extraordinary. You'd expect a bit more ingenuity in the screenplay. I thought I'd expect more especially since the casts were so high standard but I was slightly disappointed. Not a memorable film but it's still fun film. I'd give the Action 6/10, Screenplay 6/10, CGI&SFX 6/10, Acting 7/10, Fun Factor 7/10. Overall about 6.5/10 but I'll downplay it to a 6 since I don't understand how this movie could get such a overall high rating... It's fun but not that great. Maybe the rating is high because it's Thor which I think is understandable haha. If it wasn't Marvel, I doubt it would've gotten such a high rating."
"exinator","6","2","4","18 May 2011"," It's meant to entertain! It's meant to provide us with the Summer Blockbuster we've been waiting for! Unfortunately it does neither!!
","THOR Directed by: Kenneth Branagh Cast: Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Tom Hiddleston, Anthony Hopkins and Erik Selvig Dear Kenneth Branagh . We like you , we really do but when you take something which is meant to be entertaining and turn it into a boring melodramatic tale of fathers and sons who like to play with trippy lights and hammers which go underutilised in one place throughout most of the film......it just ticks us off.<br/><br/>Thor is a summer blockbuster. Thor is meant to be a break from low budget films and is supposed to provide us with a blockbuster feel. But unfortunately it does neither. Instead what you get is a movie which starts off well, introduces good looking characters and then while we wait for that moment which leaves you grasping for air it takes a dive down and provides us utter disappointment. Like many others I love summer blockbusters. It's that time of the year when we don't really care for mind boggling theatricality and twisted convoluted plots (although if we get them too along with the high budgets then two thumbs up). Instead we just like to lie back as we watch things blow up and watch characters do amazing things in slow motion. Everything in short that a 200 million budget should provide us with.<br/><br/>It's with that expectation that I went for Thor. Having watched a couple of films of the director I knew that although unconventional, good things were expected out of the film which claimed to have merged the world of mythology and superheroes in one film. Odin (Anthony Hopkins) is the king of Asgard who has claimed victory over the frost giants. He has two sons, Loki ( Tom Hiddleton) and an arrogant yet charismatic Thor( Chris Hemsworth) . As the elder son Thor is to step on to the throne. But a sudden attack from the frost giants makes him disobey his father and go to their planet to wage an attack with the help of his friends.<br/><br/>Arriving just on time Odin rescues Thor and his Troupe but is enraged by his actions and henceforth banishes him to Earth and strips him of his powers and from his hammer (which is his mighty weapon). Arriving on earth he bumps into Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), a scientist, who agrees to help him in exchange for his explanation of the galactic phenomena through which he arrived on Earth. From here on most of the film focuses on him searching for his hammer and on discovering the plot because of which the events were in motion.<br/><br/>As a film it started off well and did delight us with amazing effects. It even moved at a steady pace and looked all set to finish off well. Till the first half it seemed above average but then the second half took a steep drop with the climax being a complete let down. The basic motives of the characters seemed to be lost and we got over dosed with the light effects and teleportations .<br/><br/>As a super hero film the action was mostly missing replaced instead by men in suits who looked completely lost and out of clue. Throughout most of the second half we kept looking forward for the wow moments which we felt sure had to be there. Just as we got the spark and we sat up straight we realised that the moment was gone and alas it never returned again. Even the romantic equation between Hemsworth and Portman never actually set properly with everything feeling incomplete.<br/><br/>As characters Chris Hemsworth did justice to his role and Portman did the best she could with her role but the other characters hardly roused any emotions and yes I include Anthony Hopkins as well. It seemed they packed all that they could in the first half and let the second half drag and suffer in the process. Disappointing is the word.<br/><br/>Rating 5.5/10.<br/><br/>Vikram Agarwal for MuvieMadlyDeeply.com"

","I don't know it is only in China or not, the English version is 2D only here, the 3D version is exclusively Chinese-dubbed, I cannot figure out whether this maneuver is supposed to promote the 3D or 2D (a quite stupid one though), but I had no hesitation to choose the non- dubbed version (latter I would got some delightful news that the so-called 3D version is not worth the pennies). <br/><br/>As the starter of the summer Hollywood blockbusters here in China, Thor intricately possesses a singular trait, the actor-turned-director Kenneth Branagh had remained to be an odd option since he was announced as the man behind-the-wheel the this heavy-budgeted vehicle for all cinephiles. How the Shakespeare-addicted Kenneth could on earth create a marvel-labelled popcorn picture? Now the wait is officially over, I must say the outcome of this incompatible combo tastes quite bland.<br/><br/>Compared with other superhero-studded peers, Thor does look a bit shabby, the setting of the land of all Gods is mainly covered in a monochrome dark hue, which is nothing near splendid and in lack of any virtual existence, lavish but kitsch (3D glasses also cannot help). The earth set, on the other hand, the seediness is ubiquitously, no spectacular scene to satisfy my eyes, everything happens in a tiny desert town with a dozen of extras, running and screaming.<br/><br/>The essential bedrock of the film centers on the father-son battle, which is Kenneth's stunt, but in a cartoonish way unfortunately, Kenneth may have exerted himself fully to balance the duel between money and art, however, in my opinion, he failed to achieve both.<br/><br/>As for the cast, Just as I expected, nothing noteworthy, the only two exceptions, alongside Sir Anthony Hopkins is Tom Hiddleston, who unexpectedly devoted a feminine but not campy existence as the villain Loki, however, this film surely doesn't worth their talent. (Sorry, but I am intentional to leave out the new Oscar winner Natalie Portman here, I find her part might be the weakest amongst all)."
"owen_osu","10","2","4","16 May 2011"," Thor Review (with absolutely no Stop, Hammertime! jokes)
","So I FINALLY went to see Thor on Friday (a week after the release, I know, what a sacrilege). 3d, IMax, 5:30 showing of Thor..$15.50. Wait, seriously? Is it really that much to show a movie? Oh, well So, I sit down, put the stupid 3d glasses on, and waited for the movie to start. With all of that stacked against it, it was the greatest Marvel movie I have ever seen, the previous best being the original Iron Man (notice I said ""Marvel"" not ""Comic Book"" – The Dark Knight will always and forever hold that title).<br/><br/>It starts with Narrator Anthony Hannibal Lector Hopkins telling a story about him being the King of Asgard, and battling the Frost Giants, and him defeating King Laufey, and eating his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti, blah blah. This opening is a story being told to Kid Thor, and Kid Loki. Right away, you can tell Thor is the ""favorite son"", and Loki holds a lot of resentment for his older brother.<br/><br/>Cut to grown-up Thor, arrogant and cocky during his coronation. This was kind of odd for me, since the only Thor I have experience with is the current Thor, which is the godly, prim and proper variety, akin to classic Superman. The current comic book Thor would storm Jotenheim if it was the right thing to do, but not because he was butt-hurt about the ceremony interruptions.<br/><br/>However, I loved this version. Of course the prince of Asgard would be a spoiled brat, with no real-world experience, and no sense of diplomacy. He grew up with romanticized stories of his father defeating the Frost Giants, and he wanted to live up to that story, even on his first day as king. And already, we see Loki's manipulative tactics, urging Thor to defy their father, and take the fight to King Laufey. One amazing action scene later (did he FLY through the back of that things HEAD!?!?!), and Thor is banished, sent to Earth.<br/><br/>They spend about 5 minutes on the ""fish-out-of-water"" part of the story, which is great, because it would have been horrible for much longer. He quickly becomes the man on a mission to reclaim Mjolnir, and his rightful place as king (by the way, Kat Dennings saying Meow-Meow, was hilarious every time).<br/><br/>When he breaks into the SHIELD area, where Mjolnir fell from the sky, is a fantastic scene. Non-Powered-Thor, fighting highly trained guards, was amazing. Then, Agent Coulson calls in the sniper, who passes on a machine gun, and a sniper rifle, for a compound bow.. HOLY S#!T, IT'S HAWKEYE!!! Jeremy Renner was on screen for about 20 seconds, and he was a perfect Clint Barton. He doesn't even fire and arrow, he doesn't even need to, it was perfect.<br/><br/>It's the small things like including Clint in the movie, what makes this movie much more fun for people like me. From the Dr Donald Blake name-tag on his shirt, to the Journey Into Adventure billboard, to what might have been the Eye of Agamotto in the Armory. Granted, I'm the only one in the theater who laughed at the name-tag thing, but it was so satisfying.<br/><br/>The thing about these kinds of movies is, no matter how many there are, I am always worried about casting. Okay, Robert Downey Jr. might as well legally change his name to Tony Stark, because they are forever one in the same. When I even heard that Loki was going to be in this, I was nervous. Loki is manipulative, cunning, and brilliant. Loki will go through his own flesh and blood to get what he wants. Loki was a woman for like 2 years in the comics. Tom Hiddleston was creepy, deceitful, and subtle in the role, and it was awesome. After Thor (which, come on, Chris Hemsworth is Thor, just like RDJ is Stark), Loki is the most important character to get right in this movie, and man, did they get him right.<br/><br/>He lies to both sides (the people in Asgard, and Thor, on Earth), as a means to an end, which is to become King. He convinces Thor that his banishment is for the good of Asgard, and that Odin is dead. He double- and triple-crosses like sic different people throughout, to the point where I had no idea whose side he really was on, and what he ultimately wished to gain from it all.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie wasn't the big dumb smash-em-up, Hulk-esque movie I was expecting, but it was way more. It turned into a movie about family strife, resentment, betrayal, deceit, and revenge. And honestly, this movie was better for it. Hulk smashes, and smashes well. Let him.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed this review, please visit thehousethatnerdbuilt.blogspot.com, and leave a comment"
"dixon101","7","2","4","14 May 2011"," Super hero love story...
","The Thor character is a bit goofy and very child like so if it weren't for his good looks and super hero abilities he would be very lacking. That being said, there was enough character development to engage you towards the personalities in this film. The action was really good, it was not over used. The special effects were used sparingly, so no distraction from too much fake looking CGI (like in some of the spider man movies). All in all, a fun trip to the movies. If you want a light hearted fun evening at the movies, I recommend this movie. For the ladies... Thor is very generous about showing an exceptionally developed torso. When I first saw this preview with my girlfriend, it seemed she wanted to see this movie mostly to see Thor without shirt. So ladies you will be pleased."
"kunalkhandwala","7","2","4","12 May 2011"," The Norse God has arrived....
","The Norse God's arrival on Earth was imminent from the appearance of his hammer, Mjolnir at the end of 'IronMan 2' and director Kenneth Branagh presents The God of Thunder upon our humble planet while making it entertaining with fantastic scenes of the realm of Asgard and quirky moments of Thor adapting to life on Earth. But those who know of the arrogant, powerful and reckless son of Odin, the expectations of thunderous action would be greater than the might of the hammer as depicted in the movie. <br/><br/>On the day of Thor's crowning as King, some frost giants mysteriously break into the secret chambers of Odin and upon such discovery, Thor ventures into their realm of Jotunheim to respond to their threat. Along with his friends, Thor wages a reckless war with the Jotuns, with Mjolnir swinging wildly at any adversary and Thor flying brutally through a monster's mouth; but it is Odin's wisdom that saves them at a crucial juncture. Annoyed with Thor's rash behaviour and to teach him a lesson, Odin sends him to Earth without his powers and it is on this humble planet, that Thor, in his powerless state, learns to respect life and calms down as an almighty. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), who crashes into the fallen Thor in the middle of a stormy desert, cools his temperament and serves as Earth's cheesy interest for him. His foster brother, Loki, meanwhile, plans to usurp the throne of Asgard while Odin is lost in his sleep and unleash the frost giants upon the beautiful realm. It's up to the mighty Thor to re-gain his powers and return to Asgard to re-establish order and destroy its threats.<br/><br/>Undeniably, Thor is an exciting adventure. From the spectacularly depicted realm of Asgard, to the brutal battle with the frost giants and through the funny moments of Thor's introduction to our planet, there is entertainment galore and with Chris Hemsworth's cheeky Norse-like persona, Thor is all the more enjoyable. However, there is one major element that disappoints. This is a movie about Thor - The God of Thunder. The almighty one who has fallen from Asgard into the correctional facility that is Earth. His nemesis include frost giants and the destroyer that is sent to Earth by the evil works of Loki but apart from their brief confrontations, there is a certain dearth of the mind- blowing action that we would expect. The Mjolnir is hardly put into use after the initial battle and thunder is never used upon Thor's commanding. While the anticipation for the climax grew, the realization that there wasn't any action to be enjoyed, was the film's most disappointing aspect. It just did not end on a high that would be worthy of a thunder God. <br/><br/>Instead, Branagh's approach seemed to center around portraying Thor as the reckless hero who couldn't control his mighty powers with a short fuse. Hemsworth enacts that aspect brilliantly with a boyish charm. Branagh also takes the liberty to throw in some cheesy romance between Thor and Jane which just doesn't suit the Norse character. Natalie Portman blushes her way through awkward moments and the excitable ones. Hemsworth too, seems lost in those romantic escapades since even he cannot relate to the Thunder God indulging in the cheesiness. Anthony Hopkins, in his brief role as Odin blends rather well and so does Tom Hiddleston as Loki, the insecure and mischievous foster brother of Thor. <br/><br/>It does seem impossible to overlook the inspiration for the battle sequence with the frost giants ('The Lord of The Rings'), the depiction of spectacular Asgard (Rivendell) and Odin's palace (Minas Tirith) but the result however, is simply astounding.<br/><br/>Thor could've been a bigger, more thunderous epic but from a director with a Shakespearean background; this works. For what it's worth, Thor entertains in a wholesome manner with all the gorgeous effects, action and a superhero's helpless struggle being on Earth. Thundering into the summer box-office, Thor sets things up for S.H.I.E.L.D.'s 'Avengers Initiative' that is due next year and as the disclaimer in all superhero movies goes, ""wait till the end of credits."" <br/><br/><ul><li>8.199 on a scale of 1-10.</li></ul>"
"jonnyhavey","8","2","4","7 May 2011"," Superhero Magic: Deity Entertainment
","Marvel's most recent Avenger's prequel is about one of the most interesting superheroes. Director Kenneth Branagh's (better known as an actor, Valkyrie) Thor bridges the gap between mythology and the comic book superhero genre with action and mystical CGI. The film could have done without the third dimension (3D) and it needed better script writing, but in the end Chris Hemsworth (Star Trek) successfully brings the god alive alongside big name actresses Natalie Portman (Black Swan) and Kat Dennings (Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist). The film begins where Iron Man 2 left off with a supernatural storm landing Thor in the middle of New Mexico. There, scientist Jane Foster (Portman), assistant Darcy Lewis (Dennings) and Doctor Erik Selvig (Stellen Skarsgard, Pirates of the Caribbean) accidentally hit him with their vehicle wondering where he came from. How did the all mighty Thor end up in the middle of New Mexico? Thor was on the brink of becoming king of his father Odin's (Anthony Hopkins, Silence of the Lambs) realm Asgard. However, after the Frost Giants from the realm of Jotunheim interrupt the ceremony, Thor leads his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) with a small group of companions to Jotunheim without his father's permission. An epic battle scene unfolds and as the Frost Giant's leader Laufey (Colm Feore, Changeling) fights Thor off, Odin intervenes and banishes Thor to earth for his disobedience stripping him of all his powers. Thor is forced to embark on a journey to regain his honor on earth as he falls for Jane Foster while evading the mysterious organization SHIELD whose intentions come with Furry.<br/><br/>Thor is everything a summer superhero blockbuster should be: funny, visually spectacular, action packed and most importantly entertaining. The film is uniquely shot, moving between the mystical realm of Asgard and the Earthly world intertwining the two almost perfectly. Hemsworth, Portman, and Skarsgard were all worthy cast members mending the shoddy script they were given. Hemsworth was definitely big enough for his role, while Portman balances his might as his petite, fragile love interest, and Skarsgard's multidimensional mentor figure. These three still aren't the best part of the film because of a surprise cameo that may not be very obvious, but if you know what is happening you may freak out.<br/><br/>The film's visuals are very impressive, however, the 3D is completely unnecessary. Everything seems blurred, dark and cramped because the 3D picture takes away from the beauty of each realm. While this may not be as noticeable to some viewers the script has evident dialogue mishaps creating an underwhelming cinematic opening to the film. Script problems are subdued as the film progresses as the magic of cinema takes hold, but the script may also be to blame for the insertion of Dennings's character in the film; a character without a purpose.<br/><br/>Director Branagh does his part in bringing the latest of the Avengers to life in grandiose fashion by creating comic book mythology. The film is everything that the Clash of the Titans remake wishes it was with a side of earthly superhero magic."

","The Marvel magic continues with Thor, as they create yet another throrouly enjoyable, fun, action packed and humourous adventure, where we're introduced to a bigger universe extending far beyond Earths realm.<br/><br/>What this movie does perfectly is ground the characters, and link them to our reality so that even though we're dealing with the mystical Frost Giants or the humoungous Destroyer, the characters do not appear other worldly or over powered to the existing superheroes.<br/><br/>The visuals are captivating, whether it be the splendours of Asgard or the chilly Jotunheim, the CGI is excellent. The story is crisply told, fast paced and simple, taking us across the realms and giving us a background to some really interesting, well written and well portrayed characters.<br/><br/>Chris Hemsworth nails the role of Thor with this charm, comic timing and of course good looks. He brings across the carefree, impulsive Thor while also showing a compassionate, gentle side to the character who'd otherwise have been all brawn and no brain.<br/><br/>Antony Hopkins is brilliant as ever, playing Odin Allfather with all the gravitas that the ruler of the nine realms should possess. He shows his steely, ruthless side, as well as his soft, wise nature with elan.<br/><br/>With Tom Hiddleston Marvel have struck gold when it comes to antagonist. His portrayal of Loki is by far the best negative character in the Marvel universe thus far. The God of mischief oozes charisma and brings out his underlying conflicts to perfection.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman and Stellan Skarsgard play important roles in helping Thor in his transformational journey, and we get small bits and pieces of Idris Elba and Jeremy Renners Heimdall and Hawkeye with a hope that they'd play meatier parts in future movies.<br/><br/>The action sequences are frequent and fun, there's a lot of humour, especially as Thor adjusts to the ways of the Earth and it keeps you engaged from the start to the end.<br/><br/>All in all, this film provides a perfect introduction to other worldly elements to be incorporated later in the MCU while managing to hold its own as a spectacle.<br/><br/>It may not be on par with Iron Man when it comes to a deep, rich story line, but it's the closest a movie in the MCU has come so far in touching those grand heights."

","The writing is okay, but the characters are too many. The Warriors Three and Darcy Lewis could have been written out. Volstagg, Hogun, and Fandral do not do much, their powers and skills are inferior to most known characters in the MCU so far, and their relationships with Thor are not so close. Darcy Lewis does not do much as well, her contribution to Jane's project or for Thor's problem is not significant and her relationships with any other characters are not explored. The root cause of Asgardians and Frost Giants' conflict should have been explored more, along with the latter's background and intentions, because they are only introduced as the bad guys. The character development and character growth are well-done for Thor, Loki, and Odin. Thor is completely arrogant and annoying at first and this movie explores his growth to be humble and selfless. In the end, Loki's motivations and actions are very understandable for what he has been through. Thor and Loki are the only ones who maximize their powers, especially the latter's mischievousness. The Frost Giants are definitely depowered.<br/><br/>Some casting are good, some are so so. Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Tom Hiddleston as Loki, Stellan Skarsgård as Erik Selvig, Anthony Hopkins as Odin, Jaimie Alexander as Sif, and Clark Gregg as Phil Coulson are well-cast and their performances are good, especially Anthony Hopkins. Thor's banishment scene is very cool. Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, and Idris Elba as Heimdall are good, but they would shine much more in the future movies. Casting Natalie Portman as Jane Foster is okay, but her performance is not compelling in some scenes, because she acts like a fan-girl of Thor.<br/><br/>The production design (Asgard, the Mjolnir site, and Jotunheim), costumes, props, and music are beautiful. Most action scenes are disappointing (SHIELD agents, the Warriors Three, Frost Giants, battle with Destroyer, the final battle with Loki). Some visual effects are gorgeous (like the colorful skies, Bifröst, Asgard), but some look fake, like the Destroyer. The sound editing is not smooth and accurate enough. The bright tone is good, but it is uncomfortable when the scene suddenly changes to night time. The Frost Giants' make-up and effects look good."

I really felt bad at the middle when Thor couldn't pick up the hammer.<br/><br/>Looking back Tom Hiddleston as Loki is phenomenal. His acting of slowly working, in the back, for jealousy and planning to trap Thor to get unworthy is so great.<br/><br/>The Shakespearian elements were great but it cuts short for Earth's story, which is also great but both mashed together didn't feel so right.

The final battle of Thor and Loki was good at first watch but Loki sacrificing just for future tricks didn't work after multiple viewings.<br/><br/>Some of the earth's character were annoying.

","This is a throw-off piece of Marvel fiction that is packed full of cliché and predictability...to a point.<br/><br/>I found myself cringing at a lot of the scenes of heroism and there's a definite stink of pure cheetos-stained fanboyism in many of the scenes in general, with the usual over-the-top ""glory"" of this old four-color trope.<br/><br/>But certain things caught my attention as well-done.<br/><br/>First, Asgard is absolutely beautiful. They went all out in making a realm of metallic and elemental grandeur. I had no trouble in buying this as the realm of Asgard, the ultimate land of beautiful heroism. In particular, the rainbow bridge, the weaponry, and the interior scenes were very fitting in general style and specific detail. Very impressive visually and even thematically.<br/><br/>Second, Branagh's touch can be seen with Shakespearean flair in the family of Odin the AllFather. Odin himself is brimmed with both the rime of age and the wisdom that comes with it and yet his voice can instantly summon fearful authority. Hopkins does well with that balance, even through some cheesy scripting.<br/><br/>And the brothers... the sibling rivalry here is very very potent in that it is nuanced and fully realized by both actors. There is love there, but also a lack of understanding, envy, and hate. Loki is far from a cardboard villain, in that we see, all in one package - a fighter who protects his allies, an honest counselor, a liar, a cautious thinker, a smooth tongue, and an awkward one. He loves and reveres his father, but comes to almost fatally doubt him and even hate him...but it's all very real and very stirring. And even when it's clear that he's done very grim deeds, you can actually understand and accept his motives...and his last scene in the film brings all three of the family men together in a very poignant moment of utter loss.<br/><br/>I was pretty surprised how moving this all was, especially when put in the middle of some otherwise-uninspiring hero pablem.<br/><br/>So in summary, this movie both met my negative expectation of disappointment and surprised me with some purely moving content. See it to see if it surprises you at all as well, and forget the whole comic-book hero thing, since that's been done far better.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading."

","SYNOPSIS:
After making an irrational decision based off of emotions, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is cast out of Asgard and his powers are taken away. He ends up on Earth where he has to prove himself worthy of Thor's power once again all while his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has dark plans for the future of Asgard.<br/><br/>REVIEW:
Thor would simply be that friends that everyone messs with, you know? Like a chill guy who's just good to his core and very compassionate and if you cross him you get the hammer. This film creates that so well. This is probably one of the funniest most entertaining MCU films so far. I know a lot of people will disagree, but I think this film is funnier than Ragnorak. Hate me all you want and my answer won't change. With all of that being said, I don't think it's top 5 Best MCU films ever made. Possibly not even top 10. I'd have to go through every film again and by the end of this marathon I'm having, I'll have an updated list. I think as far as a character study, this film did great, it really introduces us to the type of person Thor is, as a superhero film, it was decent. Nothing terrible and nothing amazing. What keeps you in this film is the dynamic of Thor and seeing going through this rough experience and coming to peace with the fact that he made a mistake that costed him everything he loves. The love story between Thor and Jane (Natalie Portman) was done a lot better than The Incredible Hulk, however, time spent on that could've been spent on the rule of Asgard at the hands of Loki and that dynamic. Again, I understand this film went more the route of introducing characters and it does just fine with that. Chris Hemsworth carries this film from beginning to end and this film accomplished what it set out to do and for that I give this film a 7.1/10."

","First write a great script - Stan the man and the 5 writers handle that. Then get an 28 year old 6' 3"" hunk and put 2 very good cast people around him. This adds up to Chris Hemsworth, Anthony Hopkins, & Natalie Portman . Add Tom Hiddleston 30 year young talent as Loki whose great. This one is a winner, all the way. Kenneth Branagh does a fine job directed this one too.<br/><br/>As for the plot, well any writer fan of Thor and Stan Lee comic should find it a labor of love. Sure enough, this script comes off that way. There's good humor all the way through and dramatic moments for Hopkins Odin plus the some special moments.<br/><br/>A throw back moment for me is the scene with the attack on the town. Kind of reminded me of Superman 2 though the Destroyer is much more effective than the 3 were in that movie. Lodi really designed one tough machine.<br/><br/>As is normal for Marvel, they introduce Shield run by the government in this one. There are other characters introduced along the way. The great thing though is the immediate talent shown by the younger male actors with the more experienced crew. The casting director hit the jack pot here. Enjoy this one and watch at the end for some extra credits. There's more to Thor than meets the eye, even though his first film is a lot calmer than you'd expect.<br/><br/>The effects and the 9 USA filming locations are used well in advancing the story. The cast chemistry goes along really well. It ends with the usual ""well maybe I will see her again."" Portman is only 2 years older than Thor, but she is more experienced than him. Here though it is rated PG for Pretty Great. Darn, it's hard to believe Portman is turning 40 soon. How did that happen?"

","The first time I saw this I gave it a 4 rating and was meh on the script. It was a production catering to the fanboy club of people who never collected the comic books from a long time ago. It was filled with cool computer FX and it looked good visually, but the script stunk and the direction was below what I would want for a character like Thor.<br/><br/>Thor isn't bad in the other movies, I liked the character particularly in the Avengers productions. I prefer the animated Thor over any of the live action because the character is more true to the original. The problem with the live action is the contracts signed behind the scene which require an actor to have X number of words and/or screen time based in minutes (for the Avengers).<br/><br/>Thor isn't bad, it is terrible. I couldn't watch it again if you can me a million dollars. When I watched it the second time I had to flip through it. The script is boring and the characters one dimensional. There is too much packed in to one story line to ever really get the story flying. It ends up taking off early and then crashes and burns at the end of the runway.<br/><br/>Again, visually the movie is fine, but the script and the direction is terrible. This is what happens when ""suits"" get in the way of the ""art"".<br/><br/>BTW - I will never accept a black Nick Fury or a female Thor. No I'm not a racist. or a misogynist. I'm a purist who collected the comics."

","The movie's best moments are its comedy. Everything else just does not really work for me. I can't take the more serious fantasy elements as seriously as the movie clearly wants me to. Everything that happens in this movie feels like it happens way too fast for beings whose lifespans are approximately 5000 years, yet it also feels like nothing actually happens in the movie? People joke about how forgettable the sidekicks are, and they're not wrong. Also Thor and Loki's wigs are not good, and Thor's eyebrows are the worst. And so. many. Dutch. angles. why.<br/><br/>Hawkeye, whom I love, gets the absolute worst cameo in what is probably the best scene in the movie.<br/><br/>It's not all bad. It is always nice to see more Coulson. Seeing people on the opposite end of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s actions was a clever choice. I really like the Destroyer's design. It is also the first installment in the ongoing Thor Smushes His Face Into Glass saga. Seriously, if you haven't picked up on this yet, he does this in every movie he's in.<br/><br/>Odin is the second Marvel Bad Dad™ in a long list of them."
"zaidmnomani","5","0","0","13 May 2020"," Mediocre
","Thor (2011) feels surprisingly small-scale and simple, much more than I remember it being. This is one of those films that doesn't quite stand the test of time. Back when it first came out I liked it a lot. But watching it again, it struck me as quite formulaic. Everything feels so dull, with no energy whatsoever.<br/><br/>The pacing is quite slow, and for the middle chunk of the film nothing much happens other than a really bland love story. Thor and Jane just have no chemistry at all and it's hard to care about their relationship. The humor is okay, not particularly funny but serviceable. Loki is alright. He's interesting enough, but Tom Hiddleston hasn't quite got the charisma that he had in the Avengers film. Here, he is just your typical villain.<br/><br/>The plot is exactly what you'd expect from a Thor movie, with no unexpected elements that could keep you interested. The action is pretty entertaining, but nothing more. The actors are doing an okay job. Again, everything about this movie is average and mediocre, nothing more or less. It's not good enough for me to say that I highly enjoyed it, but not bad enough for me to laugh at it.<br/><br/>The special effects are pretty good, especially for the time. If you compare the CGI of this movie with Green Lantern, (which came out the same year) then it's quite impressive. But perhaps the biggest fault with this film is that it's uninteresting. The premise is promising, but in execution this movie hardly delivers. It's fun, but I can hardly see myself re-watching it."

","Thor is a film directed by Kenneth Branagh that stars Chris Hemsworth, Anthony Hopkins, Natalie Portman and Tom Hiddelston and tells the story of Thor, an Asgardian prince who is cast out of Asgard and forced to live on Earth and learn humility. I was very excited for the Thor film as a kid, I loved watching him on ""Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes"" (a great show that I recommend the kids watch on Disney plus) and when I heard they were making a Thor film, I bought a magazine that went in depth on the making of the film and I was Thor for Halloween that year. Watching it as a kid, I remembered enjoying it pretty well and I was excited to see him team up with the other Avengers, once the epic team up was released. Rewatching Thor very recently, I have to say that it was still a solid watch. I like Chris Hemsworth as Thor in this, he's as believably arrogant as he is badass in a fight and as I'll touch on in later reviews, I like the evolution of Thor as a character throughout the MCU films. Hell, I even enjoyed Thor's evolution as a character in this as he learned humility and attempted to right his wrongs with his family, it was nicely done. I also enjoyed the fish out of water element in that Thor had to adjust to life on Earth like the coffee cup smashing scene or the ""Give me on of those large enough to ride"" line at the pet store. Natalie Portman did a decent job as Jane Foster and her friends portrayed by Kat Jennings and Stella Skarsgård felt very realistic. This is a bit of a side note but Skarsgård in particular has a scene in an MCU film I'll be reviewing later that is downright hilarious so stay tuned for that. Tom Hiddelston was brilliant as Loki and to this day is arguably the best villain the MCU has to offer. I loved seeing the effect that being Thor's little brother had on Loki and how his upbringing made him feel like an outsider as it really pulled you into his character. His plan in this film was sketchy but I'll get into that a bit later. I've liked Anthony Hopkins in just about every role I've seen him portray but as Odin, he really shines as a wise but powerful aging god. The action sequences in this film were pretty fun as well, be it the opening scene where Thor and his friends take on frost giants or the fight on the Rainbow Bridge at the end. I think the film's highlight action sequence was the fight between Thor and the Destroyer though. I also enjoyed some of the energy brought to the film from director Kenneth Branagh, who is very experienced in filmmaking of the Shakespeare variety. There were a few things in this film that I didn't like as well. I didn't find the Frost Giants or Thor's friends known as the Warriors Three to be particularly memorable. The Frost Giants being cold (pun intended) emotionless beings whose sole motivation is to attack Asgard due to their history and grudge against Odin. The Warriors Three basically each having a character trait and consistently sticking to it throughout the course of the film. I honestly completely forgot about the Frost Giants until I re-watched this and forgot about the Warriors Three until Thor Ragnarok but that's for later. Loki's plan in the film was incredibly convoluted and didn't make much sense to me. The first few things he did made sense don't get me wrong but afterwards it felt like he overcomplicated what should've been an easy task. The film has him strive for the affection of Odin in the end and his birthright as prince of Asgard but in reality I think the film could've been more effective if it went in the opposite direction. I would've loved to see Loki try to concoct a plan like he did in Earth's Mightiest Heroes because it made way more sense than this films version of the character. The effects in this film were okay but they really haven't aged well. All of the metal in the film whether it's Asgard, the Destroyer or weapons and armor seemed overly chromatic at times and it was distracting. Speaking of distractions, I'm not sure how many of you guys have heard that the main critique of this film is the over-use of the Dutch angle, where the camera is tilted fourty-five degrees to start the scene. I'm only mentioning this because I'm pretty sure every scene in the film starts like this and admittedly it gets pretty annoying after awhile. SHIELD makes yet another appearance in a long line of them here and while it is important to the plot this time it also takes a decent amount of time to set up Hawkeye, the Tesseract and Captain America both for the film and for the Avengers. I do like seeing Phil Coulson though as Clarke Gregg is a treat no matter where he appeared be it in agents of Shield or the Avengers. It just felt to me like Thor suffers for being a stepping stone to the Avengers in the same sense that Iron Man 2 did in that it can't fully establish itself as a film because it has to set up future films. If it took more time to build on the lore of the Frost Giants and the Asgardians aside from that opening sequence or maybe even establish other Asgardians aside from Thor, Loki, Odin and Heimdall as complex characters, you might be talking about one of the better Marvel films out there. I definitely feel this film could've benefitted more by establishing Asgard more as a location and by people more so than those Earth in both regards. Still though, even with the same weaknesses as Iron Man 2 though it was a bit more enjoyable and I definitely didn't mind it as a film at all. I think if you go back and rewatch it, you'll actually see that it was decent."

I have always considered the first two Thor movies to be the weakest of the MCU because I just couldn't get behind Thor's arrogance and the over-the-top melodrama. This time, however, I felt like I connected with him a lot more, as I understood the struggles he was going through and appreciated the human side of the character.<br/><br/>The dutch angles don't really bother me, in fact I think it gives the movie a distinct style that differentiates it from others in the franchise. It feels refreshing to revisit the MCU's early films that don't have the weight of the entire cinematic universe on its shoulders.

"The_Celluloid_Sage","7","0","0","6 April 2020"," Gets better with subsequent viewings
","Kenneth Branagh (yes lovies, that Kenneth Branagh) brings us the fourth film to be released in the MCU with a slightly humerous script from Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles and Andromeda writers Miller and Stentz. This was a film that puzzled me when I first watched it as I really didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would. Maybe the setting and the company at the time perhaps but I certainly found a new appreciation for this feature upon a subsequent viewing and found it much better than I originally thought.<br/><br/>We start in the desert of New Mexico as we follow a small group of people monitoring the skies during the night. Suddenly the heavens open and as they tray to hight-tail it out of the area, what appears to be a man comes crashing down to earth. We are then transported back to nine sixty-five A.D. and a monologue informs us of the past and the Gods who gave us their help before returning to their ever eternal Asgard and the peace they brought to all worlds.<br/><br/>Branagh was certainly an unusual pick to make this kind of film given his usual work but he really steps up to the plate and delivers us a good solid superhero film. The fantastical and mythology regarding Norse legends and their Gods perhaps suited him and along with the screenplay he did a good job of bringing Thor to the big screen and into the Marvel cinematic Universe. Branagh's style is actually perfectly suited to Thor's grandeur and own style as well as the old English that he so often uses.<br/><br/>This is pretty much both an origin film for Thor (a dashing Hemsworth and his brother Loki (Hiddleston) and a film to bring them into the universe in preperation for The Avengers. It works in both ways as we find out about them as children and screen time is split steadily between Earth and Asgard. While Thor amuses himself on earth we see Loki bargaining a deal with the frost giants of Jotunheim but the main problem here is that, while all this is going on the actual story is perhaps a little on the dull side.<br/><br/>Chris Hemsworth makes the film though without a doubt. he is every bit the image of the mighty Thor with his blue eyes and flowing golden locks. Arrogant, cocky and full of himself Hemsworth well and truly steals the show and that is a good thing, as without his presence, ability and charisma I fear this could have turned out to be another Incredible Hulk. As it was this proved another huge success for Marvel if not quite to the excellent standards of the first Iron Man film which still stands head and shoulders over the other released films.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman (in a more reserved role this time) and the ever wonderful Stellan Skarsgård add extra chops to this feature and while neither are terribly central to the film or its plot, both play their parts well and add extra quality to a film that would have missed their ability also. I do unfortunately have to say that Hopkins does play Hopkins rather than Odin and I personally think he has become far too samey in his performances of late. Likewise Hiddleston while also an excellent actor is not very imposing here and just seems far too whiney.<br/><br/>As is par for the course now, Agent Coulson pops up (which you should have guessed from Iron Man 2 (or the Marvel One-Shot) and we also get our first glimpse of Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton in a small cameo role (though uncredited), also in preperation for The Avengers. Idris Elba also crops up as Heimdall, the guardian of the Bifrost which allows the Asgardian Gods to traverse worlds. A small role perhaps but one he excels at and looks every bit the part.<br/><br/>Visually the film is highly impressive with its special effects and photography, especially the Jotunheim segments. The action scenes are all well choreographed and shot even if some of the close up action gets a little dizzying. A solid entry in the franchise with a likeable and humerous Thor but which also tells a deeper story within its action. I just wish we could drop the shoe-horned love interests as they really don't add a great deal to the stories we are being told. Recommended to even non superhero fans.<br/><br/>

","Thor (2011) is the first film in its franchise and was received with several positive feedback. Overall the movie does have a decent feel and solid scenery but the story is quite basic and bland. Not as great as lead to believe and isn't anything special. The character of Thor just isn't too interesting and a full length feature film about him doesn't exactly fulfill its potential."

","Thor, god of thunder, got his first film in 2011 with the film Thor. Thor did appear in the 1988 TV film, The Incredible Hulk Returns. What we end up getting is an overall good film. Chris Hemsworth did a great job as the god of thunder and I cannot really say there was a bad performance in this film. The film has a nice story following Thor being exiled from Asgard only to have to protect Earth. It is nice to see a character like Thor try to adapt to the lifestyle on Earth. The action scenes are done fairly well but nothing that was ground breaking. The connection between Thor and Jane does give a feeling that it absolutely has to happen. For the most part, Thor 2011 manages to be a good film with a good story and surprisingly good action."

","It was incredible at the time of release to know a Thor film was on the way. The comic character had certain pulpy characteristics, but Marvel managed to create a film that did the main character justice. Hemsworth was an incredible catch for Marvel and they managed to launch a new franchise, separate from Iron Man. The film had a few pitfalls, mainly the storyline on Earth. Loki was a great choice, but his scream time is impeded by the standard Marvel hero focus. Thor was yet another hit for Marvel and at this risky venture, was already heading for The Avengers team-up."
"cashbacher","8","0","0","16 January 2020"," Entertaining, but lacks the style of dialog of the comic
","While the special effects representing the abode of the Norse gods known as Asgard and the Bifrost bridge are extremely impressive, the storyline is less so. At the start of the story, Thor is depicted as an impulsive, emotional god that must be reigned in by the reigning god, the wise Odin. Thor's behavior is so out of line that Odin banishes him to New Mexico with no godlike powers and without the ability to control his mighty hammer known as Mjolnir,. Although he is still tough as nails and capable of physically defeating nearly all human males, he can still be whipped up on.
When a small team of astronomical researchers encounter the deposed Thor when he is hit by their van, a relationship between them is begun. Thor's mighty hammer also lands near where Thor did, and it defies all attempts by humans to move it. There is a great cameo by Stan Lee in that sequence of actions. A massive team of U. S. government agents (S. H. I. E. L. D.) swarms in and begins the study of the hammer, yet despite the highest of technologies at their disposal, they learn very little about it.
Meanwhile, Thor's brother Loki learns that while Thor is Odin's true offspring, he was in fact adopted by Odin. This leads to a great deal of resentment and Loki engaging in a great deal of underhanded machinations in trying to ascend to the Asgardian throne. Since Thor rekindled the hostilities between the Asgardians and the Frost Giants and they are plotting to recover the source of their power from Asgard, Thor's absence gives the Frost Giants an advantage. Since he is the spawn of the Frost Giants and the Asgardian throne is at stake, Loki does not hesitate to align himself with the leader of the Frost Giants.
The weakness of the movie is that the events on Earth sometimes come across as forced and uncertain. The S. H. I. E. L. D. agents are arrogant, ignoring the laws regarding search and seizure and some of the action scenes are played with needless destruction by the killer robot known as Destroyer. It is a fun movie, but the dialog does not have the charming Shakespearean quality of the comic book character."

","Finally, a good movie from Marvel, and most people don't seem to like it very much.<br/><br/>I love about 50 minutes of this movie, the first thirty minutes and the last twenty. Everything in between those bookmarks of operatic emotion and design is somewhere between functional and pretty good.<br/><br/>The film opens with three people in a van in the middle of the desert looking to the sky at night. Some strange formation of clouds and light forms in the sky, they race towards it, and they find a man who shouldn't be there. I'm not a huge fan of this tendency to start a movie after the story has started as some sort of teaser, but I think it works quite well here based on what follows. The opening couple of minutes is designed to ease the audience into the film and inform them that things are about to get weird.<br/><br/>And weird do they get, and it is glorious. We fly across the cosmos to Asgard, a realm full of giant ostentation and seems to be built on a dual plane instead of a spherical celestial body. Sets are huge and covered in gold. The emotions the characters subscribe to are bold and large. The acting fits so appropriately, and we are in this cosmic opera, wallowing in its luscious details for a solid half hour and I love it. Odin, king of Asgard, tells us of Asgard's place in the cosmos as protector and their chief antagonist, the Frost Giants of Jotunheim, another planet. He tells of Asgard's subjugation of Jotunheim, and we see him with his two sons Thor and Loki. At the ceremony to mark Thor's ascendance to the Asgardian throne to replace Odin, the Frost Giants sneak into the Asgardian weapons vault and are promptly killed by the defenses.<br/><br/>Thor is furious and demands that they travel to Jotunheim to punish the Frost Giants for their act of war. Odin bites back with fervor. I swear, Anthony Hopkins as Odin is one of my favorite things about these movies so far. He balances the large delivery of big emotions so well, creating an atmosphere that allows for others to operate at the same level of emotion. His two major rebukes of Thor are absolutely wonderful. Thor, of course, goes to Jotunheim with Loki and some pals, cause some havoc, and need to be rescued by Odin. Odin, as punishment for Thor's senseless actions that threaten to ignite war between the two worlds, casts Thor out of Asgard and to Earth. This scene between father and son as Odin calls his oldest a ""vain, greedy, cruel boy"" is probably my favorite scene in Marvel.<br/><br/>Then the movie loses a bit of its step as its action comes to Earth. Jane Foster and her two pals guide Thor through a cute (but not too cute) fish out of water tale. Thor throws a coffee mug violently on the ground to express his approval of the drink. He walks into a pet shop to demand a horse or at least a dog large enough to ride. It's cute. The plot turns when Thor learns that his hammer, the mythical Mjolnir, is just a few miles down the road, and he needs to get it back in order to return to Asgard. The organization SHIELD has set up a perimeter and Thor easily cuts through their defenses to reach Mjolnir but he can't lift it from the ground because he is not worthy. He cries and gives up before Jane's older professor colleague, Dr. Erik Selvig, gives a story that SHIELD doesn't believe. They let Thor go in order to follow and potentially learn.<br/><br/>Back in Asgard, Odin has fallen into the Odinsleep (which, I assume, is some sort of hibernation that he must go through in order to extend his long life) and Loki has consolidated power through default. He works to keep out Thor from coming back. I don't think Loki was ever as good again as he was in this movie. He learns that he's actually a Frost Giant, and he's deeply wounded by the fact that Odin hid that from him. On top of that, he sees Thor for the brash man who would be a disaster as king and works to undermine him in the eyes of their father. His motives are strong, Tom Hiddleston plays him really well, especially in his big moments with Odin in that first glorious half hour, and he's smart. He's the first antagonist in this series worthy of the name. No wonder they can't let him go through the rest of the series.<br/><br/>Anyway, Loki sends the giant terminator like machine to kill Thor back on Earth. Thor sacrifices himself to save his friends, and at that moment, Mjolnir comes alive at Thor's worthiness, flying into his hand and giving him his old clothes back because, sure why not? The Asgardians make it back to Asgard and the movie turns kind of great again. It's all operatic all the time again. Brother against brother. Giant light bridge of rainbow light. Huge emotions as Thor crushes it and prevents him from ever going back to Earth to see Jane Foster again (yeah, right). When Odin awakes and Loki sees the disappointment in his father's eyes for his actions, Loki just gives up, and it's shockingly sad. Loki's just so great.<br/><br/>So, yeah, I glossed over Jane Foster and her little gang of misfits. They kind of don't matter. They're entertaining to a degree (Selvig is the best of them), but they don't really affect Thor's core arc very much. Thor is humbled by his brother, and redeemed by his own sacrifice against the Terminator machine. The puny humans provide some room for Thor to demonstrate his lowered ego, but they don't drive it. They tend to drive lighter comedy bits, but they simply don't work as well as the big operatic beginning and end of the film.<br/><br/>Visually, the movie is really good beyond the design of Asgard. Kenneth Branaugh is a quality director who gets good performances from his actors (I want to see him direct Anthony Hopkins as King Lear), and he uses the visual language of the medium intelligently. His use of Dutch angles is either done to achieve interesting compositions or to imply that reality has been skewed. So we see these tilted camera angles when Jane Foster gets introduced to the world of magic through Thor but also when we just want a good shot of the warriors three standing in a line up some steps. The color pallete is alternatively vivid like in Asgard and with the rainbow bridge, dark and blue like at Jotunheim, or light brown and dry like in New Mexico.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a solid film that looks great and works best at the bookends."

","I just watched this for the first time; fast forwarding through the CGI trash. I stopped after Hemsworth and his friends flew back to Asgard. I look at this ""film"" as a perfect example of what started the end of true cinema. It only proves a simple fact: If anything is packaged and marketed enough (whatever ""anything"" may be), the masses will accept it. The very best story telling via cinema us done by a small handful of incredibly gifted directors. Unfortunately, the best are dead; however, there are still a few who are exceptional. This and all other comic book films are not amongst them. Enjoy it all you want; just don't try and compare it with real artists: people like the two best masters of them all: Stanley Kubrick and Orson Welles. We still have Marty Scorcese, Terrence Malick, Neal Jordan, Ridley Scott and his heir apparent, Denis Villeneuve. So this ( and other ""superhero"") type of movie is great if you're 13 years old. If your in your 20's and up, forget it. I suggest watching every film Kubrick made: a dozen plus one he removed. Also, all of the actor Steve McQueen's films (not today's director, who is good); lastly all the great 1970's films. Then make up your mind. As Martin Scorcese wrote an op-ed in the New York Times recently, he basically explained he wasn't denigrating this type of film in an interview he had done in Great Britain. He received a lot of pushback which is why he wrote the op-ed: To explain how these type of films, studios, theaters and their P.P. and marketing strategies done on Late night talk shows promoting themselves (so to speak), they have caused an extreme loss of Independent films (and their corresponding theaters). I agree with him 100%."

","Thor is one of the few Marvel films so far to have a really strong villain in Loka with Shakespearean motivations. Stories that go way back, similar to my favourite movie of all time Gladiator. It has the themes of acceptance and jealousy. Thor played by Chris Hemsworth is hungry, egotistical and ready and willing to prove he was the right successor to the throne. Orid father of Thor, sends Thor to earth in exile from home Asgard for his trigger happy war seeking actions on the ice giants. The ice Giants enter the palace in violation of their treaty. Thor reacts with lack of honour to their treaty and must learn the true value of his virtue. On earth he meets Jane Foster played by Natalie Portman where he learns love and value. Striped of his powers and now understanding not all one entire race is evil Thor acts with his heart protecting people he now cares about. The stand out performance comes from Tom Hiddleston as we are left constantly guessing what he is up to next. Envious of his brother believing he to be the true worthy candidate for the throne. Mischievous action is being made back on Asgard. The story is one that has been told many a time but not on Asgard and not with what was fresh characters for the big screen at the time. The visual effects are stunning and leaves us wanting to visit Asgard again in the future. The main downfall of this film is pacing as it does seem to drag at times and the spontaneous relationship between Jane and Thor seems to instant."

","Natalie Portman starts out the film as an astrophysicist in the New Mexico desert. There appears to be some kind of UFO crash, as apparently aliens have the ability to fly all over the planet without crashing, except New Mexico. The movie then flashes back to 985 AD in a heavily CG background as Asgard, led by Odin, aka Anthony Hopkins, is fighting the frost giants, who look like blue skinned versions of Freddie Kruger. They end up with a truce. During the coronation ceremony of Thor, a frost giant enters the realm of Asgard and disrupts the ceremony (why this was done at the time was a mystery). Thor in his passion leads a group of warriors to the planet of the frost giants to teach them a lesson. The simple touch of a frost giant freezes the skin like liquid nitrogen. This was great in 2D, I can only imagine what the CG graphics was like in 3D.<br/><br/>Odin is upset with Thor and takes his hammer and powers. He banishes Thor who speeds to earth only to crash into Natalie Portman and company in the desert (beginning scene). A bad hammer pun and a taser later, Thor is on his way to medical. The hammer lands elsewhere in the desert and is lodged like the Sword in the Stone. A group of yokels gather to have a cook out and attempt to remove said hammer. . . until the FEDS show up.<br/><br/>The film moves back and forth between events on earth and in Asgard, as Loki has assumed the throne of his ailing father. In order to convince the audience this is the real Thor, he speaks a Middle Earth style of English, making over frequent use of the word ""realm."" It works well as it allows him to flirt with Natalie Portman, who he thinks is the most clever person on the planet. (Isn't this one of the seven signs?) Perhaps the movie's biggest fault is that is attempts to link mythology, science fiction and science fact is such a way a 9 year old might buy it.<br/><br/>Like good trekkies, Thor's friends come to earth to rescue him, because the needs of the one out weigh the needs of the many. They show up and are as conspicuous as Vikings in a credit card commercial. Memorable line: Stop! You are using unregistered weapons technology!""<br/><br/>For me the story wasn't light enough. There were a few comic lines attempted to break up the seriousness of the film, but it needed more of them. I was hoping for something along the lines of Iron Man 1. Perhaps the worst I have seen Ms. Portman in a while was her parsed OMG line. Other than that one bad line, she was great.<br/><br/>No sex, no nudity, no f-bombs. Safe for the kiddies.

"Lori_ruelo","7","0","0","6 January 2019"," The first hammer throw of the Thunder God!
","The hammer-wielding and good-looking Thor in his first adventure in the MCU. Director Branagh passionately takes over the narrative style, from this comic book template. You can already see, however, that Branagh is a big Shakespeare fan. Almost monumental, he draws the figures of Thor, Odin or Loki. The city of Asgard is also more likely to come from Hamlet than Marvel. The story tells Branagh well and he also incorporates a lot of humour. For when Thor falls to earth, he has already lost the power of a God. It's not until the second half of the film that stands out. Therefore, it is amusing that the arrogant and beautiful Thor himself falls on the snout and remains equally entitled. Of course, Thor is the hero, so you have to disguise it that he is the same as a human being. He can still fight better and has more strength than three people combined.
In addition to Hemsworth as Thor, there are other confessed performers to his side. Natalie Portman gives the typical, chaotic scientist. While she's a bit cranky, she makes her likeable alongside the overpowering heroes. Stellan Skaarsgard is an old professor who is more than a father figure to Portman. And, of course, Anthony Hopkins as Konigsgott Odin, who still brings a bit of sparkle to this hero saga. Narratively and visually, Branagh has managed not to straddle the adventure on torture for long. You look at it to the performers, which was fun. But among the other Marvel heroes, Thor remains rather weak in content. Although Thor is like that, everything remains self-evident and remains superficial. Conclusion: A colorful adventure that is told briskly. Only character drawing is left behind!"

","Many Marvel fans and nonfans alike tend to view this film as one of the weaker entries in the MCU, especially after the release of Ragnarok - but I personally couldn't disagree more. I hated the third installment of the Thor series because the main villain was terrible from a character writing perspective and I absolutely loathed the nonstop comedic direction that they took. But this isn't a review on that film nor is it me trying to force my opinion down your throat, this is why I personally love Branagh's Thor and why I feel it deserves a revisit.<br/><br/>The set designs for Asgard are off the charts beautiful. While we may only see Asgard for 50% of the movie and Earth for the other 50%, it is far more memorable and unique here than it was in The Dark World and Ragnarok where it looked like a discount Game of Thrones set.<br/><br/>Patrick Doyle's soundtrack for this film is probably the best in the entire MCU. If you tried to name the original scores from Age of Ultron, Ant-Man 1 and 2, or even Infinity War and Iron Man 1 and 2, you just can't because they are just so bland and devoid of identity. With Thor's soundtrack however, you instantly know which movie it belongs to - and the soundtrack is used perfectly for almost every scene in the film.<br/><br/>At least an hour's worth of this film is dedicated to Thor's development. This isn't like The Dark World where Thor more or less begins and ends as the same generic superhero character or even the first two Avengers movies where his character just isn't very interesting - here he actually begins as an entirely different person than what he is at the end of the movie. His character may not be as sympathetic or memorable as Bruce Wayne in Batman Begins or Tony Stark in Iron Man 1, but he at least has a point where he hits rock bottom unlike all of the other portrayals of MCU Thor prior to Ragnarok. The important thing about Thor in this film, to me, is that he actually redeems himself -something mostly lacking from Thor's other MCU appearances - and earns his powers back during the Destroyer's rampage in New Mexico.<br/><br/>While I still love plenty of other aspects of the film, my main attachment to it is our introduction to Loki, who makes a great villain. Tom Hiddleston was the perfect casting decision for the character and so many scenes with him are masterful. The reveal of him being a Frost Giant and confronting Odin about it is a 10/10. My only issue with Loki here, which certainly doesn't stop me from loving the character and enjoying the film, is his goal had his plan come to full fruition - if I had learned that my father had lied to me my entire life, the last thing I would be concerned about is trying to impress him. Nevertheless, he is one of the best villains in the MCU and this film is a great introduction to him. And unlike Hela in Ragnarok, Loki works really well because you get a sense of there being a fleshed-out relationship between him and Thor and he has relatable motivations, unlike Hela who was just evil for the sake of being evil and had practically no relationship with Thor.<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins also does a great job playing Odin and Idris Elbra is really good as Heimdall. The Warriors Three aren't the greatest characters in the world but they still work just fine.<br/><br/>I can understand how the scenes on Earth in New Mexico involving Jane Foster and her friends Selvig and Darcy would be a drag for many casual fans since the chemistry between Portman and Chemsworth is often lacking and comes off a bit forced, but for me none of it was ever a deal-breaker.<br/><br/>So you can have your Thor cracking bad one-liner after one-liner and not really earning anything in Ragnarok, or you can have your stereotypical superhero with almost no development like Thor in The Dark World, but give me the Thor that Branagh gave us and give me Loki as the main villain. Give me the amazing Asgard sets and Patrick Doyle's soundtrack. Give me world-building and not literal world-destroying like Ragnarok.

","The end credit scene of Iron Man 2 showed Phil Coulson finding a large crater in New Mexico. At the center of the crater was a hammer, which many people were attempting to move, to no effect. This was an obvious tease at the superhero based on a Norse God, Thor. Thor was an obscure superhero, known for his goofy winged helmet (that I love). Nobody thought Marvel could turn him into a convincing hero. Were they right? <br/><br/>The main issue with this movie is that the quality is very different depending on the location. On Asgard and Johtanhiem, this movie is great. On Earth it's pretty bad. It's not awful, but it's still bad. The directing is distracting, with a Dutch angle every other shot. I like the shots at first, but it becomes distracting. <br/><br/>The cast is also split in half. Chris Hemsworth was a good Thor, though he would get much better in the films to come. Same can be said about Hiddleston as Loki, he wasn't great but he was good. Hopkins is good as Odin, and I think Jamie Alexander could be a great Sif if given time to shine. On Earth the only character I like is Erik Selving. Kat Dennings is annoying, but she gets worse in the sequel. Natalie Portman just phoned in her performance as Jane Foster. <br/><br/>The effects are still pretty good. The opening action scenes and the closing two look great. The Frost Giant fight and the Destroyer battle are particularly exhilarating. The final fight between Thor and Loki is good because you like the dynamic the two have, and want to see the conclusion. Asgard looks fantastic, and never looks better then it does here.<br/><br/>Overall, Thor is okay. It's one of my least favorite MCU movies but it's still serviceable.

Thor gets thrown to Earth after being rash and kind of stupid. This is where he meets Jane. They start to fall in love, I really didn't care much more the falling in love thing but is wasn't bad the movie just got kind of boring in the beginning and then Odin decided to fall asleep until they needed him most, which I thought was annoying. Anyway it turns out that it was Loki all along and then the brothers fight it out in a beautifully cinematic way.

","Thor goes at it hammer and tongs and forges some good spectacle for the viewer. Tom Hiddleston produces a good performance as the weaker of the two sons who claims power unduly when this is taken from the heir to Asgard kingdom. Chris Hemsworth makes a good fist of the role, convincing us of the Thunder God's alpha male traits. The visual effects of the distant realm are pleasingly colourful but a little distracting for their confection - we are expected to use our imagination for such a place but it looks rather computer generated rather than mystical. The fight scenes and sound are tremendous and there is great support and talent on offer, and underused I might add. How the film is held together depends on story and that is where the film disappears down the wormhole, so to speak. It is essentially a bridging of special effects sequences and not much is built in feeling for us to care about, certainly there is not enough feeling between the brothers for us to think Thor cares quite as much about his brother by the end. All the fantastical characters are not interesting. They're defined by their attributes, not their personalities. But, there is enough in the film to spark the imagination for it to be entertaining and quite funny."

A few flaws that needed to be omitted, and I actually can't believe professionals in the industry did not see this. When they drive just 50 miles to the 'crash site' it starts off in broad daylight, but they arrive there when it is pitch dark.

Hemsworth and Hopkins give such great performances in their titular roles. Hemsworth is just so likeable and charming, he really made me care for the character who used to be my least favorite avenger. Hiddleston is also fantastic and he really knew how to craft Loki into a mischievous villain while also being sly and weasly. So Asgard is great, Thor's great, the effects are great. What could be bad? Well the scenes on earth are actually kind of meh. Nothing against Portman, Dennings, and Skarsgård they perform well, it's just after seeing the world of Asgard we are thrust to a bland Earth in a New Mexico dessert of all places. The story is well crafted however, and there is so much character development for everyone, but the origin story and the plot (mainly Earth scenes) feel less epic and more or less unwanted, but they needed it for the story so you can't really complain."

","Thor is the introduction of the god of thunder with an introduction and expansion for a lot of other big name characters and plot elements featured later in the MCU. With major characters like Stellan Skarsgard as Professor Erik Selvig, Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson, and Samuel L. Jackson as Agent Nick Fury with the small part by Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye as well with various teasers throughout hinting at more to come possibly years later in the MCU too. <br/><br/>Story wise this is my least favorite origin film in the MCU including second stage characters like Ant Man, Dr. Strange, and Guardians of the Galaxy. When I first felt this film I didn't get the same impact I did from watching Iron Man or Captain America in their first movies in the series. And honestly this movie is very much a bridge movie. This was the last film in the series of origin stories until Avengers came out and this movie just exploded with setting up that film. With Tom Hiddleston's Loki being the main villain and the after credit scene setting up Avengers with showing more of Shield too, a lot more than any other film yet. It feels that the story is almost put on the back burner to get what is considered today to be 'the best team up movie of all time'. Even the romance story between Thor and Jane feels weak and hollow during it compared to Pepper and Tony, and Steve and Peggy. <br/><br/>Directing wise, Kenneth Branagh, who's famous for 'The Murder on the Orient Express', 'Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit', and 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'. Directed this film instead of producing and acting like he typically does in cinema's. Overall this film is probably my least favorite film he's directed because of the over use of dutch angles. I don't mind them when their used sparingly but when every other scene or every third scene is on a very dramatic dutch angle it bugs me and honestly gives me a headache. They also feel misused during production of this film. They worked very well in the interrogation scenes and some of the fight scenes early on but when it's just normal dialogue scenes, it gets sickening. <br/><br/>Writing wise done by Ashley Miller, Zack Stentz, and Don Payne. They did a good job defining the dialogue and making each character feel unique with their sentence choices and feel special and not so generic. The small scenes of comedy comes very strongly too like the Stark jokes throughout and Thor adjusting to Earth are very funny and makes some boring scenes enjoyable and almost memorable. The best performance on the whole movie that was written perfectly for Hiddleston is Loki. He comes off so relatable but so hateable as well and it makes the film so much more enjoyable. And especially with his mixed emotion during various scenes makes the audience really puzzled on what his next moves will be.<br/><br/>Acting wise and special effects all look good. It bugs me that they bleached Hemsworth's eyebrows though to stick to the blond while in Avengers and every Thor movie after that they stick to his dirty blonde brows instead. But the costume designs and set designs look amazing, by far the biggest production of the MCU so far and the special effects have a big jump in it too compared to even Captain America which came out roughly 3 months before Thor. <br/><br/>This film had a lot of potential and sadly fell short on a few things but gave us a strong bridging movie for the upcoming Avengers that premiered a year after this. It is still a fun movie that has some great characters in it and expands the universe for the MCU.<br/><br/>Thor gets a 7/10"

","Marvel does fantasy and fish-out-of-water with Kenneth Branagh's ""Thor,"" a superhero film that film that explores different realms to engaging results. While the film tests the burgeoning Marvel cinematic universe's mettle by moving back and forth between contemporary Earth and fantastic kingdoms, two decidedly different narrative and cinematic landscapes, the work appeals with its larger-than-life characters and classic themes. It is a strong and swift action outing.<br/><br/>When Chris Hemsworth's Thor, son of Odin, is cast from his home of Asgard and into southwestern wilds of Earth, the god-prince finds himself tested by old enemies and dangerous, new forces. This premise sets up a classic hero quest; but the narrative movement between the fantastic and the Earth-bound can be jarring. The two sides of the plot are both robust, but there is little easy connection between them. Still, the operatic Asgard moments somehow bolster the comparatively simple New Mexico segments. The story packs surprisingly potent romance, exhilarating heroism, and invigorating world-building into its mix of old-world and contemporary mythology.<br/><br/>Branagh weds the two sides of the narrative, steeping each in effective designs and visual styles of its own. Asgard is colorful and royal, while Earth is suitably genuine. The production gleams, and action beats are sturdy and thrilling. The cast is inspired, and Hemsworth makes a mighty addition to the canon but Tom Hiddlestons, mischievous Loki completely steals the show. Branagh's steady directorial hand balances tones, mythologies, and aesthetics while keeping a focus on the film's characters, story beats, and spectacle.<br/><br/>""Thor"" could have easily taken a torn toward camp based on its very nature, but it is able to allow its disparate sides to coexist without lapsing into silliness. Thanks to its direction, cast, and committed sense of self, the film succeeds. ""Thor"" proves the viability of the Marvel cinematic universe's ability to take stylistic and narrative risks, and it all makes for an rousing, entertaining experience."

","THOR is yet another 'origin' story designed as part of the Marvel universe as a prequel to the big-bucks adventure AVENGERS ASSEMBLE. The only time I've experienced the comic book hero Thor beforehand is via his cheesy presence in one of those Incredible Hulk TV movies of the 1980s. Thankfully, this THOR is a much better movie overall, better even than the po-faced CAPTAIN America: THE FIRST AVENGER.<br/><br/>The film's success lies in the storyline, which is predictable but nonetheless interesting. The idea of the Norse Gods living in space is odd at first but eventually well-realised via the endless CGI effects, which are more than up to the job. Chris Hemsworth proves a good fit for the hero, a likable, laid-back presence that fits the character nicely. The film's running time is brisk and there's plenty of action to see it through.<br/><br/>That's not to say there aren't flaws, because there are plenty here, not least some cheesy comedy that doesn't really work. The supporting cast are also less than impressive. Natalie Portman seems to think she's in a romantic comedy and is quite dreadful, as is Kat Dannings as the comic relief. Tom Hiddleston's Loki isn't imposing at all and reminds one of a petulant child throughout. Still, Anthony Hopkins, Stellan Skarsgard, Idris Elba, and in particular Ray Stevenson are all good value and worthwhile presences. THOR glides along while offering plenty of entertainment value and a breezy, light atmosphere that works in its favour. It's the best Marvel set-up story out there that I've yet seen."

","By Odin's beard! Verily, yon mighty picture house of Marvel doth demonstrate the courage of a warrior battling a rampaging Bilgesnipe to tell the tale of Thor. Metal men and monsters of medicine? Aye, but ye literal Gods of Olde, told with nary a snicker? Forsooth! But hark - they who doth dare to scorn know not the Lord Kenneth of Branagh, whose soothsaying doth be as pure as his heart. He approacheth the lore of Asgard with the eloquence of yon Bard of Olde, but addeth the slow-motion and explosions of yon Michael Bay. Zounds. And lo - though it be the first foray into fantasy outright for yon kingdom of Marvel, Thor abideth the test of time - robust, clear-headed, and, verily, as fun as it be mighty.<br/><br/>Too ridiculous an opening paragraph for you? Thankfully, Marvel and Branagh are, quite wisely, on your side. Here, the Thor comic's characteristic Stan Lee swipes at 'Olde Englishe' are as absent as his feathery helmet (that is to say, restricted to cameo status). Branagh is cognizant of this potential for silliness, and works hard to carve out familiar, safe ground, opening with a contextual prologue that leans on Lord of the Rings tropes so extensively, it's almost a shock not to see Cate Blanchett pop up.* Still, Branagh proves as adept at blockbuster filmmaking as he is at gilding classical wordplay, and, after a few cliché-courting opening moments in the (cool but fairly wobbly CGI) realm of Asgard, it only takes moments to be swept up in Thor's brisk pacing, crisp action interludes (excessive slow-mo notwithstanding), and ready levity, all skepticism receding to a dull ebb. <br/><br/>Instead, Marvel's challenge of selling Norse mythology as hip, blockbuster entertainment provides a intriguing opportunity to repackage the rote, superhero 'learning powers/coming of age' tropes as something altogether more mature. Unlike the average hero, the arrogant Thor begins his titular film at peak power, and the film's biggest action blowout is in its first act, where he lets loose with all the thrilling, trailer-stinger hammer-'n-lightning blowout moments against an army of frost giants in the tundra wastelands of Jotunheim. Soon afterwards, however, we're grounded in New Mexico, where our fish-out-of-water deity is, begrudgingly, forced to learn humility through nonviolent valour. Here, Branagh slows down to a crawl, with more talk of astrophysics, governmental investigations/Avengers world-building (including a happily extensive hangout with Clark Gregg's adorably deadpan Agent Coulson), and the comedic schtick of Kat Dennings (who is just funny enough to not feel flagrantly out of place) than punching and kicking. In his downtime, he stokes a romantic subplot, with flirtations housed in constellations, conflating science and magic, and pop tarts. No one could ever accuse Thor of being unambitious. <br/><br/>If the initial premise itself heralded perilous camp potential, this forced juxtaposition is doubly so. Thankfully, Branagh meets the silliness head on with a cheerful twinkle in his eye. Ample amounts of Thor's gregarious, out-of-place posturing (""I need a horse!"" and ""This drink - I like it. Another!"" can face off for the film's biggest laugh) and physical slapstick help take the sting out of the Asgardian brooding, while keeping the film accessible and fun. This, in turn, carves out breathing room for Branagh's Shakespearian credentials to work their magic on the larger-than-life melodrama, helping terse, booming confrontation scenes between a golden bondage pirate and a Gothic teenager with ibex horns breathe as surprisingly natural, sombre and resonant, without hammering it home (ha). Amazingly, before you can shake a sceptre, it's all coalesced in a din of flamboyant opposites that (somehow) achieve thrilling counterpoint, woven together by the strains of Patrick Doyle's handsomely heroic musical score. By the time we're swept away to climactic battles with a gigantic Day the Earth Stood Still robot and a god vs. god beatdown on a CGI rainbow bridge (keep your Mario Kart jokes to yourself), we, like Thor, feel we've earned the catharsis of the CGI-bloated action, and are too invested not to cheer in the face of the raw jubilance of it all. <br/><br/>Still, Branagh's careful balancing act would be nothing without the exceptional casting of Chris Hemsworth as the titular god of thunder. Bringing an impeccable comedic timing, and boisterous charisma as colossal as his dazzling physique, Hemsworth commits to his performance with such enormous, brazenly sincerity that his fall from grace and reclamation of honour are somehow as primally resonant and compelling as any high melodrama. Similarly, Tom Hiddleston attacks the inherent underdog pathos of Thor's seedy sibling Loki with such ferocious nuance and presence that he's nearly as commanding, sympathetic, and beguiling as his titular brother, even in the midst of committing unspeakably despicable villainy. Natalie Portman may struggle to fish comparable depth out of her quirky love interest/dubious astrophysicist, but she's neurotically adorable enough to make her rushed romance with Hemsworth surprisingly sweet. Anthony Hopkins lends Odin the requisite thunderous gravitas while largely resisting the expected sleepiness and impulse to phone it in, while Stellan Skarsgård is unreasonably entertaining as the resident 'straight-man scientist,' fishing perennial incredulous humour out of the chaos with practiced ease. Finally, Rene Russo, Jaimie Alexander, Ray Stevenson, Josh Dallas, and (especially) Idris Elba all find their moments to lend humour and class as fellow Asgardians, despite functioning more as endearing action figures than fleshed-out characters. <br/><br/>Despite, on paper, sounding like the superhero genre's most absurd entry, Thor excels as one of its most straightforward, breezy, deceptively intimate and character-driven, and invigoratingly enjoyable. We've believed a man can fly; now we can believe a god can fall, and capture our hearts all the while. In the words of Odin, Thor is worthy.<br/><br/>-8.5/10<br/><br/>*Or apparently she's just been biding her time for six years. Stay tuned for Ragnarok!"

","Thor (2011): Dir: Kenneth Branaugh / Cast: Chris Hemsworth, Anthony Hopkins, Tom Hiddleston, Natalie Portman, Stellan Skarsgard: Impressive adaptation of the classic Marvel comic book superhero. Thor is famous for his hammer weapon, which sustains certain power. His father led the war that defeated the Frost Giants. He has two sons, one being Thor whom is about to be crown King, and the other is Loki who is jealous. Kenneth Branaugh seems a strange choice to direct this material but he pulls it off with breathtaking visual effects of skyscrapers of gold and silver. He previously brought Hamlet new life. Chris Hemsworth brings out the youthful nature of Thor. As the film opens he hurls to Earth after being banished for leading retaliation against the Frost Giants. He is discovered by three science researchers where he is under watch and struggles to adapt since his powers are gone. His hammer is embedded in the desert and nobody can free it. Anthony Hopkins plays Odin, his father who has conquered yet demonstrates authority when he is tricked to banish Thor. He will be reduced too a heart attack until contrivance prevails. Tom Hiddleston as Loki is a worthy villain who betrays his people. This will all be settled with the standard corny violent showdown. Natalie Portman as the researcher who discovers Thor is reduced to useless romantic clichés unworthy of her talent especially after winning an Academy Award for a superior role. While it doesn't always work, the adaptation is fun and sometimes amusing swinging more than just a hammer. Score: 7 ½ / 10"

","Being more of a DC comics guy myself, I know little more about Thor other than he has big hair, a big cape and a big hammer. I suppose he's as close as Marvel got to a Superman- type hero, but with more angst, as expelled for youthful bravado in confronting his home world Asgard's old enemies the Frost Kings, he finds himself exiled on Earth,where he quickly (too quickly in my opinion) goes native there, getting caught up in defying the authorities and falling for Natale Portman.<br/><br/>The film itself entertains with its sword and sorcery plot-line and neatly contrasts the fantastical world of Asgard and Jottenheim with modern-day America. The story of sibling rivalry is as old as the Old Testament and creates suitable tension in the narrative, while Anthony Hopkins presides over his sons' feuding with the necessary gravitas.<br/><br/>The action sequences are especially well done, including the first battle with the Frost Giants, Loki's dispute with Haemdell and especially Thor and his band's fight with the seemingly invincible Destroyer. The c-gen SFX are suitably dream-scape in scale, particularly the depiction of the Bifrost Rainbow Bridge.<br/><br/>The acting is serviceable rather than memorable, only Hopkins making you look more at him than the scenery behind him and while I understand the interpolation of S.H.I.E.L.D for continuity reasons leading up to the Avengers movie, for me they were still a distracting presence.<br/><br/>All told though, this more grounded super-hero movie was better suited to my taste than those aimed closer at the lucrative market for 13 year old viewers of others of the same ilk."

","Thor. He's one of the most powerful and famous super heroes in the history of Marvel comics. It is said that super heroes are basically modern day interpretations of ancient mythology. Thor is unique becomes he comes almost straight out of mythology and has since left an impact on the world, especially with his involvement with the Avengers, so the movie has quite a bit to live up to. Thankfully, it fails to disappoint. How so? Let's take a look.<br/><br/>Long ago, Odin the ruler of Asgard defeated the Frost Giants, led by their king Laufey, who tried to take over Earth (or Midgard as they call it). He later has two sons, Thor the god of thunder and Loki the god of mischief, and they soon grow up to be great Asgardians. But when Thor's arrogance as left Asgard on the brink of war with the Frost Giants, his father Odin banishes him to Earth where he develops a bond with a few local scientists, especially Jane Foster. When Odin enters his so called Odin Sleep and the cunning Loki takes over, Thor must prove himself worthy of the title hero in order to save both Asgard and the Earth.<br/><br/>The execution of this film is excellent. Thor lives up to his reputation as a warrior as the the action scenes are pretty awesome and the forces of good and evil go about beating each other up back and forth. There are a lot of cool moments throughout the action like when Thor rallies some lightning. Equally great is his interactions in the modern world which is just full of hilarious moments. I also love the other elements of the film like the SHIELD agents and a familiar-looking hero that make further connections to the upcoming Avengers movie.<br/><br/>The other characters are a load of fun to. Anthony Hopkins is perfectly cast as the wise and all-powerful Odin, living up to practically every single quality of the character. Sif and the Warriors Three (Volstagg, Fandral, and Hogun) are great supporting characters and so are the scientists like love interest Jane Foster played by Natalie Portman. This film's version of Loki is very interesting as he is surprisingly complex. While his villainous acts make him truly despicable, you really do feel sorry for him for he does have some decent qualities, which really moved me a little. The other villains are cool too, Laufey being cool and threatening and the Destroyer Armor being awesome and powerful as hell.<br/><br/>I give this movie a thunderous applause. Extremely well done, though I would have like for the final battle to be a little longer. I give this movie an electrifying 8 for entertainment value and an extra point for all the subtleties throughout the film. This movie is worth every penny, so check it out."

The story follows the origins quite well, with the use of his fake mortal name (Donald Blake) being used and the way Loki's helm holds those curved horns. There are a few problems, however. We don't really see Thor in all his costumed glory for long. And the main problem is The Destroyer. This large machine looks like it could wipe out the whole town yet it only blows up a few cars and plastic restaurants. It really doesn't show off it's potential. But Thor is a great little point towards The Avengers. An uncredited Jeremy Renner appears for a few moments as Clint Barton, also known as Hawkeye. And, as usual, there's a scene after the end credits, which gives even MORE insight into The Avengers and links Thor to Captain America. See it."

","Overall, this was a very good but not perfect adaptation of the mythology of the comic character Thor. The casting was almost flawless with the exceptions of Idris Elba as the black Heimdall, Tadanobu Asano as the Asian Hogun and of course Samuel L. Jackson as the black version of Nick Fury, but I suppose Jackson's miscasting can be blamed on Iron Man and the producers wanting to keep that mistake going with other movies in the Marvel franchise. Hollywood diversification at the expense of staying true to the characters they're adapting. I can hardly wait to see Luke Cage played by Hulk Hogan.<br/><br/>The main actors played their roles well, with Tom Hiddleston completely surprising me with his initial low-key Loki who gradually revealed himself to be the sinister schemer that fans of the comic series have known and loved. Chris Hemsworth was an excellent choice as Thor and the always reliable Anthony Hopkins was the perfect Odin, even with the missing eye.<br/><br/>The story was well-written but, being a reader of Thor's epic comic book battle with the Destroyer, I felt the metallic menace was felled a bit too easily. The special effects were above average and Asgard's mystic realm was awe-inspiring to say the least.<br/><br/>All-in-all, a very good beginning for Thor. I give it a solid 7 and would have rated it an 8 if not for the woeful miscasting of the secondary characters."

","Right now, I am looking at my accurate, true-to-scale, panoramic Picto-Map of a typical Asgard street scene, drafted by the late, great Jack Kirby and compliments of the early, here and now Stan Lee! I am mentally comparing this street scene of daily life in Odin's realm and everything appears to be in order. Here, under the MONUMENT TO THE UNKNOWN WARRIOR, I am expecting a party of twelve to help me take in the sights. Unfortunately, we will not be visiting the RAINBOW BRIDGE as we have been informed it is presently undergoing reconstruction...<br/><br/>Cudos to the men and women of the Art Department and the Special Effects Department for taking the designs and plans of Lee and Kirby and using them as blueprints to transform what are essentially colored sketches into a living, breathing reality whose boulevards and avenues can be strolled by true to life people. This alone is worth the price of admission to 'THOR', a film directed by Kenneth Branagh and boasting a cast with the likes of Anthony Hopkins, Rene Russo, Natalie Portman, Idris Elba, and capable newcomers such as Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston. The screenplay, crafted by Ashley Miller, Zack Stentz and Don Payne, has ample mood and pace, and 'BABYLON FIVE' J. Michael Straczynski, along with Mark Protosevich also seem to have contributed substantially to the thematic infrastructure of this interface between Science and Technology/Dream and Mythology.<br/><br/>'THOR' is essentially a morality tale for children about the pitfalls of Pride and how it can lead to warmongering and uncalled for destruction and the virtues of humility and how it can lead to spiritual renewal and reconciliation. It takes the concept of the Invincible Warrior of the West which has been the bane of aboriginal peoples and leavens it with the Christian Ethic of rational sacrifice for the greatest good exercising the principle of the greatest love espoused by Jesus from what many would tell you is the highest authority. It does so in such a playful and witty way that should you blink, you just might miss it.<br/><br/>After that, it is back to Warriors and Monsters and the political intrigues fueled by sibling rivalry and infantile good intentions gone awry. The Western deification of patriarchal power bolstered by the triumph of Science and Technology plays out its idea matrix creating new divisions and spiritual unities and setting the stage for the next act of this fairy tale in progress beyond the stars.<br/><br/>Oh, by the way, you can find that Picto-Map of Asgard in the MARVEL TREASURY EDITION of THE MIGHTY THOR Volume One, Number Three, 1974."

"MaximumMadness","9","0","0","6 March 2012"," ""Thor"" is a bit of a clichéd story, but it is so visually magnificent and has such a delightful cast and light-heart, you will forgive it! One of Summer 2011's best films!
","The fourth released film in the ""Avengers"" sage (thus far including ""Iron Man"", ""Iron Man 2"", ""The Incredible Hulk"", ""Captain America"" and this film) is the delightful, visually astounding ""Thor"" from director Kenneth Branagh. Starring some great actors including Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Anthony Hopkins, Tom Hiddleston, Rene Russo and even Stellan Skarsgard, with strong supporting performers as well, this Summer treat is one the finest action films of the year 2011.<br/><br/>Based upon the popular Marvel Comic (itself based upon the gods and legends of lore), ""Thor"" follows well Thor, the god of thunder, as he is banished from his home in Asgard to live as a mortal on Earth, where he seeks a way to reclaim his power and return home, along the way falling in love with a beautiful scientist, and tangling with those pesky SHIELD agents that were established in the other films. There is also a strong plot involving his troubled brother Loki, whom seeks the approval of their father Odin, as well as fears between Asgard and the neighboring world Jotenheim (that's probably misspelled).<br/><br/>Despite some of the bigger names in the cast, including Hopkins and Portman, the real star of this movie is director Kenneth Branagh. Being familiar with some of his other films (particularly the incredible visual treat ""Frankenstein"", which despite having poor pacing is worth watching for Branagh's stylish direction and visuals), this is clearly and completely one of his films. From his kinetic camera work, and poetic use of dutch angles, slow motion and sweeping wide shots, to his design sensibility, this film is a wonder to behold. He also works well with pacing the story very well, and getting some great performances from the cast. This is a strong Branagh film.<br/><br/>The cast is very notable. There are no ""sore thumbs"" in sight, everyone plays their roles perfectly. Hemsworth plays a convincing Thor, and the transformation his character goes through from arrogant boy to responsible man is convincing and touching. Portman is outstanding as Jane Foster, a human scientist whom Thor falls in love with. Hopkins as Odin is perfect casting. Tom Hiddleston is a remarkable Loki, giving the character pathos and sympathy. Skarsgard and Kat Dennings serve as Portman's teammates, and both are fun, fleshed out roles. Everyone is remarkable in this film.<br/><br/>The script is very tight, and supplies a lot of action, and also plenty of light-hearted humor, which is what makes this film work- it's a very ""fun"" movie to watch, and despite trailers promising a dark, brooding fantasy, it is full of fun belly-laughs and quirky dialog. This movie will put a smile on your face as you are wowed by the action and seduced by the humor.<br/><br/>All this praise being said, I have the same problem with this film as I did with the first ""Iron Man"" film- it gets itself too bogged-down by clichés early on, and you will guess the twists and turns from a mile away. In addition, it does feel a bit anti-climactic, and despite some strongly choreographed and character-driven action sequences, the fight scenes are all too rushed and generally over after only a minute or two. It's like the production ran out of money right before all of the action was shot.<br/><br/>That being said, this is still an incredibly fun film, and a surprising treat in the Summer 2011 movie lineup. I give ""Thor"" a strong 9 out of 10 for the sheer fun-factor, and look forward to seeing the character again in 2012's ""The Avengers""!"

","""Thor"" was another solid foray into the action/adventure genre by Marvel. When I saw the preview for it I was wildly excited. Although I have never read the comics, I am a huge fan of Norse mythology. After seeing some of the other Marvel action offerings (Iron Man, Iron Man 2) I was not disappointed by ""Thor"". <br/><br/>""Thor"" is a fantasy movie with door-busting action and intense fight scenes. It is set in modern times, with a brief back story into the history of the Gods, Ice Giants, and mortal humans. It is a story about a father, Odin, and two sons, Loki and Thor. One son would betray his family and his kingdom for power, the other must face himself and learn humility in the face of adversity. <br/><br/>""Thor"" had well choreographed action scenes. The fight scenes are fast paced, with stunning special effects and interesting weaponry. They avoid the pitfall of long, drawn out fight scenes leaving you saying ""yeah right"" after they are over. You actually believe the fight scenes because, well, these people ARE immortal. I also liked the special effects involving the kingdom of Asgard. They may be considered overwrought by some, but they left me fascinated. <br/><br/>The acting in Thor left something to be desired. Anthony Hopkins is always a solid bet, and did well with his part as the father although he is in a coma most of the movie. Chris Hemsing definitely looked the part of Thor. The audience, especially the ladies, will probably get more out of admiring his physique than his acting skill. Even after his ""attitude adjustment"" he reminds me of the self centered tool that nobody else can stand. Tom Hiddleston did an excellent job playing Loki. His dark, mysterious and hawk-like visage give you the feeling that you wouldn't trust him with anything. Natalie Portman's character was not developed at all, but was able to establish a relationship with Thor leaving a convenient open ending. <br/><br/>If you are looking for lots of action and not much thinking this feature will provide that. It is a solid bet for a good Saturday night action flick with the kids or girlfriend. Chalk up another win by Marvel."

","There have been so many superhero flixs churned out of the Hollywood factory this past decade. So much so that it has made my head spin.<br/><br/>I have high expectations when it comes to superhero movies. While they rely heavily on special effects, I also expect a great storyline and a believability factor to go along with it as well. With that said, few superhero films over the past decade have lived up to my expectations. While most films have nailed the special effects criteria, they just can't seem to get the plot thing down so well. The Dark Knight was by far the best of the bunch and I did enjoy the X-Men trilogy, but felt the Wolverine spin-off fell short. Unlike most other people I didn't really care for the highly successful Iron Man and Spider Man franchises. They made Robert Downey , Jr's character Tony Stark in Iron Man overly comical and Spider Man was too slow throughout the series. Both Hulk movies, Batman Returns, Superman Returns, Electra, Daredevil, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, and Fantastic Four were all major disappointments. I could add more recent superhero films to the list, but you get the point. It shouldn't be a surprise to tell you that, as with other superhero movies to grace the big screen this past year (Captain America, Green Lantern, The Green Hornet), I had no interest whatsoever in seeing Thor. The only reason I did see it was because my best friend rented it and pretty much forced me to watch it. I'm glad he did.<br/><br/>This was a surprisingly entertaining movie with some interesting plot twists. The war scene that kicks off the movie is a little too dark so it's hard to make out what's going on, but that soon changes once we get into the meat of the storyline.<br/><br/>What can you say about Anthony Hopkins? He's a great actor and gives nothing less than a great performance here as Odin, king and God of Asgard. He's also the father of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Loki (Tom Hiddleston), although we learn things are not as they originally appear with this family.<br/><br/>The best part about this movie is it has a believability factor to it. The characters are well developed and the overall plot works well. I would have given this film a higher rating but there were a few elements to the story that were confusing or just stupid. The fact that we didn't see Hemsworth shirtless more throughout the film is one of them. With a body like that you don't need dialogue!"

","I always think movies which are made out of comics are good but the movies which are made out of books may or may not be as good as the book itself. Thor is another example. The movie is interesting as well as entertaining. The effects are cool and Chris Hemsworth looks cool in the role. Anthony Hopkins -- no words... Whatever part you give him, he will blow you away.. Natalie could have been shown more glamorous ;) Personally I think the villain in this movie is a bit of a loser. Common there should have been a big fight. The villain cant lose that easily :D There could have been lot more. But not forgetting the movie revolves mainly around Thor and his character, so that should be expected. Overall.. This movie is worth a watch!"

","Marvel continues its push towards its ultimate goal: THE AVENGERS (also known as the most ambitious comic book film endeavor ever). Before we can bring all of the major superheroes together on the big screen, we're treated to a series of introductory films for each of the main characters and that means we were given a theatrical release for someone I've always considered a B-grade character in the Marvel universe, Thor. For those unfamiliar with Norse mythology, Thor is the god of thunder and wields the powerful war-hammer Mjolnir. In the Marvel canon, he is a being from the mystical realm of Asgard. He is the son of Odin and next in line for the throne, but he's got a few personal issues to work out before Odin hands him the keys to the kingdom. Asgard's longtime enemies, the Frost Giants, sneak into the palace in an attempt to steal a powerful artifact, and Thor reacts with a desire for war. He gathers his comrades for an attack on the Frost Giant realm of Jotunheim. Thor's actions result in war between the two realms and Odin banishes Thor with hopes of teaching him a valuable lesson. Thor is stripped of his power and exiled to Earth (Midgard) while his brother Loki uses the opportunity to rise to power as ruler of Asgard.<br/><br/>If that was hard to understand, I believe it. For anyone who hasn't seen the film and doesn't have an established understanding of the comic's canon, the plot to this film is a bunch of gibberish. I really am surprised it did as well as it did in the box office, but I'm happy to see it. I've never been much of a Thor fan and I wasn't excited to hear he'd be getting his own film. When Kenneth Branagh was brought on as director, my interest was piqued but I still had a hard time caring. The heavy fantasy/mythological angle of the Thor series never appealed to me and, even with Branagh's talent behind the camera, I was still worried that a movie trying to cram so much exposition into a single story was going to collapse under it's own weight. I was wrong to doubt THOR, as it turned out to be an excellent bit of summer popcorn fun. It's not as good as Jon Favreau's IRON MAN, but it's a fun, flashy bit of blockbuster action. Visually, it's amazing. The mystical realms of Asgard and Jotunheim look amazing; I could've watched an entire film in these realms without ever setting foot on Earth and I'd have been satisfied. The costume design somehow pulls off a miracle: making the outrageous costumes of the comic work in a serious(ish) film. Thor's winged helmet or Loki's horned piece don't stand out as comically as I thought they would.<br/><br/>The film really looks fantastic but the story is pretty thin. In an effort to ensure they had enough time to explain what the heck we're looking at to people who've never seen the character and his world, the actual story is pretty thin. Thor is sent to Earth to learn a bit of humility and compassion, his manipulative brother tries to assume the throne, lessons learned and everyone's saved. I'm sure the next film in the franchise (and with almost a half billion in worldwide box office, it IS a franchise) will move a lot smoother now that the general population knows the character and it's new worlds. Origin stories are always the hardest to present but THOR does it pretty well. It's a fun ride with great characters (well, the Asgardians anyway) and great action, and it continues Marvel's winning streak with its line of films leading to THE AVENGERS."

It tells the story of Thor, the God of Thunder, an arrogant warrior with total strength, who is sent into banishment by his father Odin, and gets transported into the real world, where he meets a female scientist that changes his feelings. Alright, ""Thor"" is now another excellent superhero movie of the year so far, since the incredible ""X-Men: First Class"". Directed brilliantly by Kenneth Branagh, this movie is a perfect example that Marvel superhero movies rock. Chris Hemsworth does an excellent performance as Thor, Natalie Portman quite improves at her role in the movie, Anthony Hopkins does brilliant work as Odin, and Tom Hiddleston does a breathtaking performance as Loki. Also, the breathtaking art direction of Bo Welch, the amazing visual effects, and the incredible costume design by Alexandra Byrne, is all enchanting and wonderful. ""Thor"" beats the odds of an ordinary superhero flick, and it has been took to the next level with great acting, amazing effects, incredible environments, and super directing.

However, as Thor encounters Jane (Natalie Portman) in her small town along with her colleagues, he starts to change his ways. I like the characters in this film, each fits their roles. I do feel like the fight scenes and the time on earth for Thor is a bit short or maybe I enjoyed the movie so much that it went by quickly.

","For a Hollywood movie (albeit directed by an English actor) the story was interesting. I grew up reading and loving Norse mythology. And I quite enjoyed their 'sci-fi' modernization of it, although hated that Loki was made a completely recreated, Hollywood character. Also it was done very professionally - the music, the scenery, the CGI, the pacing, it was fun etc.<br/><br/>Unfortunately almost everything else sucked. The biggest problem was casting. Casting a male model with a rah-rah voice doesn't substitute for an actor. The Thor I knew from my childhood was rough, indolent, irrational and charismatic. This Thor is good looking and boring, completely overwhelmed in the role. I am being a bit to harsh. A bad director with just the right instructions can make any actor look bad. And to be honest, despite the all star case - Rose Byrne, Sir Anthony Hopkins etc. - there certainly won't be any academy awards coming to any actor."

","Thor is an entertaining superhero flick that is thoroughly refreshing, thanks to its source material, which is pretty different from the other superheroes we've seen on the big screen from Marvel's camp. Thanks to Thor's not-from-this-Earth origins, we get a spin on the traditional Norse myths that gives the film a fun fantasy feel. <br/><br/>I dug the tone as well, which can be compared to the mix of impressive action and humor that the first Iron Man flick nailed. Chris Hemsworth is a perfect fit as the charismatic, hot-headed Thor, and he's surrounded by an equally impressive cast. Natalie Portman, Kat Dennings, Anthony Hopkins, Idris Elba, Stellan Skarsgard and Tom Hiddleston are all excellent so excellent in their roles that it's a pity we don't get to spend more time with them. <br/><br/>Which brings me to my only real problem with the movie, the length and pacing. It felt a little too short to make the character development seem completely authentic. Specifically, Thor's maturation into a wiser man and his relationship with Natalie Portman's character. Given the fact that the movie takes place over a very brief period of time, it makes those two events less than believable if you take the time to think about it. The length of the film just felt too short, though I admit I'd much rather have a tight experience like this than an overlong or boring one. I also felt like the movie peaked in the first act, and never quite rose to that level again. That's not to say that the last two-thirds of Thor isn't good. It is. The movie just becomes less unique and more like other superhero flicks as it progresses. <br/><br/>All in all, Thor is a fine piece of entertainment. Whether you're a fan of the character, addicted to superhero movies in general, or you just want to be prepared for the Avengers mega-event that's coming in 2012, you should check this out ASAP."

Natalie Portman does a excellent job and the chemistry with Hemsworth is also excellent. Again, if those moments, just mentioned, lasted longer, we would have seen more of Jane (Portman) and enjoyed more of her interplay with Thor. These are the moments that have us talking about the movie long afterwards. This is part of the human condition we savor. <br/><br/>The entire cast performed well, but kudos to the person who hired Hemsworth in the first place.

","It has taken me way to long to finally getting around to seeing Thor but, let me assure you, it was well worth the wait. Thor is the second most recent addition to the growing Marvel franchise of films that are slowly leading up to The Avengers. It tells the story of (surprise) Thor, the Asgardian god of thunder. Thor lives a lavish life of luxury in Asgard until he is banished to Earth by his father, Odin, played by Anthony Hopkins, for his reckless and immature behavior. While on Earth Thor meets a young scientists named Jane (Natalie Portman) whose has been researching things that, unbeknownst to her, relate to Asgard. With her help, Thor finds his mighty hammer and uses it to defend Earth from his traitorous brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston). It's a film of epic proportions and it matches up with exactly what we would expect from a great Summer popcorn flick.<br/><br/>I figured Thor would end up simply being just another addition to the series and just another reason for me to look forward to The Avengers. But after watching it I realized I was sorely mistaken. Thor more than holds its own against the other Marvel films to come out in recent years. It is an epic scale film with a huge budget and a quality team of filmmakers behind the scenes. Most notably is the gentleman sitting in the directors chair, the highly acclaimed Kenneth Branagh. Mostly acclaimed for his Shakespearian adaptations like Henry V and Much Ado About Nothing, Thor seemed like an odd departure for him. But when you watch the film it becomes evident that Branagh is completely within his element. The ancient speak of the God's fits right in with what Branagh loves, and his passion for beauty and grandeur comes alive, especially when he is backed by a $150,000,000 budget.<br/><br/>The great thing about Thor is that it catches your attention immediately. The film begins in the glorious Asgard, so right off the bat I was blown away by the film's visuals and is immaculate design of the godly realm. It is also about 15 to 20 minutes into the film that Thor and his friends go to the realm of the ice giants and we get our first taste of the incredible action sequences which Thor is not at all in short supply of. The cinematography of these scenes combined with wicked special effects and terrific creature design immediately got my adrenaline pumping and my excitement over this film only continued to grow.<br/><br/>I was worried that when Thor is sent to Earth the film would take a turn for the worst. I thought it would become dull and lifeless, but it actually manages to keep the spirit of Asgard alive. Granted, it does cut back to Asgard many times as the plot continues to unfold there, but there are also some incredible scenes that take place on Earth. A cheesy love interest between Thor and Jane builds during Thor's time on Earth, and that got a little silly, but not enough to detract from the main plot.<br/><br/>Thor was simply awesome. It pulled out all the stops and delivered one heavy punch after another, staying wildly entertaining for two hours and restoring my faith in the quality of superhero movies. Thor is obviously a different breed of superhero and the film emulates some of that with its Old English dialogue and Shakespearian grandeur, but at its core, Thor is an incredible superhero flick that is more fun than any that have come out recently. It is an epic that more superhero films should look to for advice."

","Film Review For Thor (2011)<br/><br/>What is it about comic book adaptation's that so divides people? This is one of those films that people seem to either love or hate. I get the feeling that the people who hate this film would hate the comics as well, so the question then becomes, who do you listen to when reading the reviews? Should this film be judged on its merits as a film that stands independently from the comic, or should it be judged on whether it is a good adaptation?<br/><br/>I will come right out and say that I think it is an excellent adaptation of the comic. It is worth bearing in mind for anyone who has even a passing familiarity with Norse mythology, that the Marvel Thor is based fairly loosely on the original myths. Norse mythology is at its heart very dark and more than a little depressing, unlike the gods of most other cultures there is no happy ending. In the final confrontation with the giants (Ragnarok) most of the gods are killed, including Thor, who after battling and defeating the Midgard serpent takes nine steps and dies from the effects of the serpent's poison, this film being based on the Marvel comic's character is decidedly lighter in tone than that. Kenneth Branagh has in my opinion given a film that could have just been a special effectathon some real heart. At its core this film is about redemption. Some have criticised how quickly Thor seems to learn his lesson, but they are not taking into account what befalls our hero in a very short space of time. He loses his power and is banished from his home and everyone he loves, and then is told his father is dead! Yes he quarrels with his father and grows inpatient with him, but he does still love him and those who think his transformation from angry young rebel to sad and regretful man, happens too quickly, should perhaps pay closer attention to the details. Chris Hemsworth plays the lead incredibly well, so well in fact that I cannot now imagine anyone else as the god of thunder. Tom Hiddleston gives I think, the standout performance of the film, his portrayal of the trickster god Loki is exceptional, subtle emotions like envy and regret briefly flash across his face to be quickly replaced with the impassive and other worldly look of a being who regards everyone else around them as mere insects. Loki is a villain with real depth who unlike the two dimensional villains Hollywood so fervently favours, is motivated by many sometimes conflicting desires, he is by far and away one of the most interesting characters in mythology, and I was very glad to see him portrayed as an unashamedly complicated individual.<br/><br/>As someone who grew up with Norse mythology I was particularly impressed with the films realisation of Asgard and Bifrost, the rainbow bridge. The film takes the stargate route with the Asgardians and explains that, while they were once worshipped as gods, they are in fact a technologically advanced race, even going so far as to directly quote Arthur C Clark who said that, technology sufficiently advanced would be indistinguishable from magic. The special effects in this film are breathtaking, and while the irascible Mr Hopkins may have thought them overused it is hard to see how the film could have been made with any less than we see.<br/><br/>As a comic book adaptation this is very good indeed, and as a piece of cinema it's not bad either. Could some things have been done better, of course, that is true of almost every film ever made, but I for one enjoyed it very much, it's not a life changer or a film that leaves you wiping away the tears but it's not trying to be, its entertainment and I for one, was entertained."
"chaos-rampant","Null","0","0","2 September 2011"," Twilight of dual worlds
","I am always on the lookout for movies that operate on two levels; one the apparent reality where human experience is trapped in the inadequacy of dual opposites, the other where karmic ledgers are kept, as in film noir , or, as in Solyaris, where the images we use to describe reality are born. The motifs may appear distinct but they describe the same thing; the level where things arise and disappear.<br/><br/>So, here we have the heavenly world in the old-fashioned notion as actually above. It's a campy spectacle, disarmingly overwrought, where costumed thespians pantomime sweeping proclamations about war or betrayal surrounded by the most outrageous computer-generated sets – the Bifrost as this dazzling neon catwalk. It is like mock-Shakespeare furiously situated inside anime. You will want to smirk at the outmoded pomposity.<br/><br/>But then all of this trickles down below in the mortal, waking world, where, amidst small-town mundanity, the lofty drama is shown to be just how silly and out of place - just as we thought. Branagh takes the p#ss of the gilded world above – his own cinematic world, where once-powerful kings slip into their meridian and sons conspire for the ascendancy – but it's pretty delightful stuff.<br/><br/>There is, of course, the notion that mythology is merely the primitive, degenerate narrative of some secret, now lost knowledge or revelation – if you ever found merit in von Däniken, you will feel vindicated by this. The more sophisticated, important reading of world myth of course, is that we are directed inside for revelation.<br/><br/>It is interesting then to see how Hollywood transmutes the myth in pursuit of that revelation. The film imports these characters under a guise that will make contemporary sense; so, Thor is basically the good old fellow, except tragic enough - the fallen son of a king - to register on a dramatic level.<br/><br/>But Loki and Odin, far more complex entities, present a problem. In both their original context and the film, they are who set the world in motion. Odin creates the world from the body of a slain adversary, while Loki fathers the instruments that will bring it to an end. Thor is merely the action hero.<br/><br/>So while Norse Loki is the agent of world end; by freely traversing the lines between good and evil, he reconciles, shatters both into the plan of life-renewing destruction and exists, in the first place, so that all of this will be reborn anew, the function of Branagh's Loki is narrowed-down to a misguided, disgruntled tyrant. He schemes not for world end, but for flag and nation. So, look how the idea of war has shifted in the interim; it is no longer the means by which to release the energies, but a way to preserve them. Loki is thus reduced from trickster to represent the status quo clinging to power.<br/><br/>Odin is a different matter. Here, the spiritual essence of the Allfather is carefully concealed behind kingly robes. It is left to us to decide whether or not the entire narrative of the film was engineered by him in the first place; but at the crucial moment of conflict he slips into meditation – deep sleep according to the film, in simplified terms, but tellingly a sleep from which he sees all.<br/><br/>This is the most enduring image of Odin. He did not lose his eye in battle, as the film shows, but willingly sacrificed human vision for world wisdom; hung, aftewards, upside down from the windy tree for nine days, he sees and knows all in the one, all-seeing perspective.<br/><br/>So this image of Odin lost in meditation we need to work to unearth in the film. How the world is set in motion by the twin-engine of Loki-Odin is built into a shaky structure. The narrative engineered by Odin in the film resolves to provide Thor, the son, with simply a lesson in good governance; it's stuff like this that just barely stand. But it's still the best Marvel film to date. Which is not saying much either, considering how low the bar has been set."

","A couple of friends had reported liking this movie, and I finally caught it on a plane ride home. ""Thor"", directed by Kenneth Branaugh"" makes the cut pretty well - it's a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously in places which is important for Comic Book movies. (spoiler) For instance a wonderful Bar-Scene with ""Thor"" having drinks with an earth-scientist. The story is well thought out and interesting and the lead, Chris Hemsworth does a fantastic job with a witty, well written script. Indeed his dialog and speeches are close to Shakespearean-like. The special-effects are enhancing and mostly competent. The earthlings played by Portman and company are satisfactory if uninspiring. The movie reminds one of the original Superman movie in good ways with father and son relationship, and a beckoning to ""magic"". Pretty enjoyable."
"gregeichelberger","7","0","0","9 May 2011"," Kicking the summer season off just right ...
","While I certainly had my trepidations about finally bringing the story of the god of thunder to the big screen (after all, the film had been in development since 2006), I was indeed pleasantly surprised with the outcome, as well as Kenneth Branagh's fine direction of this mythological action/adventure.<br/><br/>""Thor"" borrows heavily from the original ""Clash Of the Titans,"" in which Oscar winners Laurence Olivier and Maggie Smith traded barbs in the heavens while the pitiful humans try to figure things out on this mortal coil, and the hero must prove himself worthy of his calling.<br/><br/>Here, the king of Asgard, Odin (Anthony Hopkins, ""Fragile"")), is nearing the end of his reign and must pass the torch to either arrogant, warlike first son, Thor (Chris Hemsworth, ""Star Trek"") or weak but cautious Loki (Tom Hiddleston, ""Midnight In Paris"").<br/><br/>After years of keeping a delicate peace with the lizard-like Frost Giants of Jotunheim (defeating them and capturing the source of their power - the Casket of Ancient Winters), Thor upsets the balance and invades their realm, causing destruction and war to fall upon Asgard and her environs once again. <br/><br/>Angered, Odin cast the rebellious son to Earth, where he is discovered by a group of scientists, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman, ""Black Swan""), Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard, ""Goodwill Hunting,"" ""Mama Mia"") and Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings, ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"").<br/><br/>The portal in which Thor - as well as his hammer of power - is cast through is also the subject of investigation by several government agencies led by Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg, ""Iron Man,"" ""The 500 Days Of Summer""), among others. All the while, everything is being observed by the treacherous Loki - who is now the ad hoc king - and his minions.<br/><br/>Like other Marvel offerings, this picture is heavy on the action, as well as the high-tech explosives and CGI pyrotechnics. What sets this one apart, however, is Branagh's Shakespearian touch (he did earn an Oscar nomination in 1989 for his acting and direction in ""Henry V"", so maybe we shouldn't be too surprised).<br/><br/>The otherworldly dynamic between the feuding brothers and the disappointed father is well-played, as is the relationship between the earthbound characters. Portman - fresh off of her Academy Award victory - and the lightweight Hemsworth are not given much to chew on in the romantic department, but the other characters, especially Selvig and Lewis add some real humor to the story.<br/><br/>Also, look for the obligatory appearance by creator Stan Lee (I will not give it away, but it is short and hilarious). Smartly-written by Ashley Miller and Zack Stenz, among others, and expertly directed, ""Thor"" kicks off the summer film season just right. Here's hoping the movies that follow will be able to live up to this example.<br/><br/>That hope springs eternal, but experience may sadly prove otherwise ..."
"jmar1978","7","0","0","8 May 2011"," A fun afternoon at the theater
","My parents forbade me from reading comic books when I was kid so, um, I read them all -- at friends' houses, cousins' houses etc. And I loved them to death. So I was very much looking forward to this film, as ""Journey Into Mystery,"" which featured Thor, was a favorite of mine.<br/><br/>This is a fun movie but ... not great thought-provoking cinema. I enjoyed myself, but left the theater feeling that this film will not reward re-watching, as so much of its pleasure comes from wondering what will happen next and the pleasure of how the writer and director worked things out. I'm more interested in how they will play things out in the inevitable sequel than I am in re-seeing the film. That's why it's a 7 and no more for me.<br/><br/>The lead performances were all quite strong and believable, and I was very pleased with the performances of lesser (but still important) characters like Colm Feore as Hlafi (in the official cast, ""Laufey,"" meaning these guys need to get their Old Norse geek on), lord of the frost giants, Kat Dennings as Darcy, and (what a pleasant surprise) Rene Russo as Frigga. Tom Hiddleston was a convincing (and wonderful) Loki, and I can't wait to see where he ends up in the sequel.<br/><br/>What I really enjoyed was how the movie created a wonderful and believable comic-book world. It isn't the actual world of the Thor comics (where he transforms into Donald Blake, M.D., and is in love with his nurse-receptionist assistant, Jane Foster), but I really don't care about that. The worlds of Asgard and the land of the frost giants are wonderfully realized (with CGI), and the film neatly integrates the whole ""S.H.I.E.L.D. is looking for a team"" motif that's become part of the Marvel film universe. The ""son of Coul"" remark was priceless as was ""I'm not getting killed over six college credits"" and, the one that left me chortling, ""Oh, my God!"" I think I was the only one in the theater who got it, though. Buncha rubes there, I guess.<br/><br/>I'm sure that the chap with the bow mid-film will become Hawkeye by the time some Avengers movie comes out, and I was a fool to leave before the credits were over, as I've now heard we get another Nick Fury cameo.<br/><br/>So overall, fun -- if rather predictable. Comic-book fun. But hey: if they keep making them like this, I'll keep buying tickets."
"ajs-10","7","0","0","7 May 2011"," Lots of Humour... Lots of Drama... & a guy with a BIG hammer!
","I had heard one or two good things about this one before seeing it and so I was looking forward to a nice afternoon's entertainment on a wet Saturday in Yorkshire. It was good, but didn't quite live up to my initial expectations. Instead, I got something with a lot more humour than expected and a lot more drama too, but I guess when you're dealing with the Gods, drama is obligatory.<br/><br/>We begin with Thor arriving on Earth and immediately being run over by a vehicle owned by storm chaser, Jane Foster. We then get some explanation of how he ended up there this is quite long and involved, but necessary. In Asgard Thor was war-like and hot headed and, prompted by his brother, Loki, he had defied his father, Odin, and his actions almost caused a war. So Odin took Thor's powers and banished him to Earth. He also sent his hammer with the proviso that it could only be held by someone worthy. Back with Thor, Jane is interested in the 'storm' that brought him to Earth and offers to help him find his hammer if he will tell her about it. Unfortunately, by the time they get to where it's landed, agents from S.H.I.E.L.D. are already there. Back in Asgard Odin falls into a deep sleep and Loki takes over as king, he has his reasons, but I'm not going to tell you what they are here. Believing Thor to be a greater threat to him, he sends the Guardian, a great warrior entity, to destroy him and all those who would oppose it. Can Thor find the humility his father desires to see in him and regain his powers? Will he get the girl at least? All these questions and more are answered in the film I'm not telling you here.<br/><br/>As I said at the beginning, there is an awful lot of humour in this film, a lot more than I expected. Of course, Stan Lee gets his little cameo it wouldn't be the same without him. Unfortunately, I found the plot very complicated and there was an awful lot of dialogue explaining everything which tended to get in the way of the story. Having said that, the visuals are quite stunning, the scenes in Asgard and the other worlds are quite breathtaking.<br/><br/>Performance wise, everybody did a pretty good job, newcomer Chris Hemsworth was pretty good as Thor, his voice matched the character really well and he had the physical presence too. Natalie Portman, although not at all stretched, did a decent job as Jane Foster. Tom Hiddleston was well cast as Loki, as was Anthony Hopkins as Odin. Honourable mentions go to Stellan Skarsgård as Erik Selvig and Kat Dennings as Darcy Lewis.<br/><br/>Over all, although I found it a little long and the plot was a little wordy and hard to follow in places, I pretty much enjoyed this film. One teenager was heard to announce to the audience as he was leaving the cinema that he thought it was 'shit', but I'm not going to listen to this budding 'critic'. There were enough good things about this film to make me want to watch it again sometime maybe not for a while, but it certainly wasn't 'shit' Recommended.<br/><br/>My Score: 7.4/10"

"jtm1583-376-890995","4","3","8","21 May 2012"," Ehh... Would've been much better with a good writing team
","You know your movie is doomed to fail when the villain is the most likable character. Sadly, however, this is the case with Thor. To keep from giving away the entire movie, I'll just give a list complaints and then let you decide whether or not you still want to watch it. I'm sure there will still be plenty of spoilers however: <br/><br/>-Thor is not likable. I feel more sorry for Loki than anything. <br/><br/>-There is next to zero character development. The scene where Thor cannot lift the hammer is supposed to be very emotional. I didn't care in the least. I also can't really figure out why Loki turned evil, as he didn't know he was adopted until afterward. I suppose it's because he wanted to be king, but it seems to me as though there were countless other, easier ways to do that. Plus, that seems very... Lion Kingish. <br/><br/>-The acting is subpar. Tom Hiddleston and Kat Dennings are the only ones that really sell their character. <br/><br/>-The writing is subpar. Tom Hiddleston's quite impressive acting performance was overshadowed by the lack of any character depth, and Thor's character was just plain annoying. None of the more minor characters had any memorable lines either, and lots of the comedy falls flat.<br/><br/>-Thor's character changes overnight. <br/><br/>-The movie can't seem to decide what direction it wants to take: Witty action comedy, or intense adventure epic. As a result, it fails at both,<br/><br/>Conclusion: I feel like the writing was what really killed this movie. The acting left something to be desired, but having seen all the actors in one or more other things (Hiddleston, Hemsworth, and Skarsgard in ""The Avengers"", Dennings in ""Two Broke Girls"", Portman in many things), I feel like that was largely because of the writing as well. Overall, I'll give it 4 stars: 1 for decent special effects, 1 some pretty cool action scenes (though some of that time should have been spent on character development), 1 for Portman's hotness, and 1 for Denning's humor."
"pureraver18","3","3","8","14 May 2011"," Cliché
","When i went to cinema to watch this movie, i expected to see huge spectacle with a lot of action. <br/><br/>Instead of that i saw cheap story with very few action scenes. I think that this movie is even worse than Spiderman with even worse story and acting. Natalie Portman should not allow her self to act in this movie especially after perfect performance in Black Swan. Chris Hemsworth is classical good looking guy with no talent for acting. The best part of this movie was the end when some girl in back row of the cinema told: ""Oh, no! Will they be together again?"" <br/><br/>All in all this is just one of many cliché movies with totally predictable stories. My advice is that if you really want to watch this movie wait for DVD."
"icrogi","4","3","8","10 May 2011"," Shoulda Coulda Woulda but wasn't.
","Warning: There are a few spoilers in my review.<br/><br/>The movie went by too quickly for the epic origin to be properly told. I think that they properly displayed Thor's arrogance and punishment in the beginning of the movie but that should have been followed up with a more in depth telling of his time on earth and his newly formed relationship with Natalie Portman. There was barely even a love connection between the two within the movie. In the comic (yea, I hate that I have to be 'that guy') Thor's whole reason for staying on earth was his love interest. They could have at least made that seem believable. Sadly, it was more of a couple of girls drooling over how chiseled Thor was. Woopty doo, a ""sexy"" homeless guy.<br/><br/>The ""epic"" fight scenes weren't even epic. Apparently, a giant robot who's only ability is to fire a super loud laser in one direction is epic enough right? Surely, a loud blast following a Michael bay sized explosion will seem epic ya? To give credit where credit is due, the fight scene with Thor and his super pals laying' the smack down on the frost giants was pretty cool. Aside from that however, there was nothing else. Even hawk eye had a pointless role. ""i'ma stand here and point a bow at Thor without firing. My cameo is more than enough."" I was more disappointed than entertained but it had it's moments. Mainly the ones I recalled from Conan O'Brien's show. I'm Thooooooorrrr! ha ha. That definitely brought a good laugh at the theater. Unfortunately, I'm pretty sure that that's not what the writers/directors/producers wanted for Thor. A comedy.<br/><br/>Loki was actually done quite well. I was pleased with his performance but I can't help but think that the majority of the actors/actresses in the movie didn't put their all into their roles. Even Anthony Hopkins (am I right that he was the one playing Odin?) was asleep for the majority of the movie. ""You mean....you mean...you'll pay me a million dollars to sleep on screen!? OF COURSE I'LL DO IT!"" They even put Kat Dennings and all of Thor's posse in for comedic relief in some parts. That's not what the movie needed. Now, I seem to remember Thor's father Odin casting him out of Asgard because he needed to learn a lesson. When he gets to earth he just acts like an arrogant retard. He can't pick up the hammer until he is ""worthy"". First of all, nobody knows what the heck worthy is to Odin so right there they're being way to vague. It helped them out in the long run however because when Thor goes to fight Loki's giant loud robot (I swear they got Michael Bay in this one for a little bit) lays Thor out and he ""dies"". How does dying make you worthy to wield a hammer and be king of Asgard? I'm pretty sure they skipped something there guys. Like...oh yea, why his dying was significant! Nope, he just dies. Nothing more nothing less. ""It's OK Natalie Portman, i'm Thor, son of Odin. I can take on this robot thing no problem."" *Thor get's dead* *Natalie Portman holds a dying Thor in her arms* ""I was...sorely mistaken. bleh* It's like the writers weren't even trying. The actors even. I mean, each actor is good in their own respects. Except Kat Dennings because some how Michael Cera rubbed his crappy acting skills off on her. It's as if the actors read the script and said ""really? this is what you came up with? seriously? I don't even read comics and I know this is wrong..."" ""we'll pay you each a million"" ""Deal!"" Movies these days are all visual. It's all about the oohs and aaahs. Sure, they can make Asgard pretty and majestic but without a proper storyline (which the movie lacked even though the storyline was already written for Christ's sake!) the movie is nothing. All they had to do was say ""look. Thor isn't just a super hero. He's a god. Thor has been around forever. The guys who wrote him into the Marvel Universe even had the decency to stick to the mythology. All we have to do is a little research and make this movie what it's supposed to be. Epic. No cutting corners. If the movie needs to be long then so be it. If it costs more than all of the other Marvel movies, so be it. If we do this right, we will do more than profit. Seems like a win win."" Nope. In my personal opinion, they messed Thor up royally. Again, I hate to be ""that guy"" but why couldn't they just make it more serious about it and make it good like The Dark Knight was? There's a quality that all of these people making super hero movies should strive to achieve. There's no dignity in film anymore. And if there is then you don't see it because it's buried with all of the other B movies. So, here's my suggestion to you.<br/><br/>If you're into flashy lights, Chippendales, Natalie Portman (gotta love that chick), sleepy old dudes, and black guys with swords then this is for you. If you want a storyline, sick fight scenes (plural) and an emotional connection to the characters then look elsewhere."

It had some incredible visuals (such as of Asgard, and the Ice Giant home whose name I cannot pronounce, let alone write, nor remember). Many beautiful, flashy effects that, sadly, it would appear to have sucked the budget dry, as the characters were one dimensional (I won't get into details for those who wish to see it), changing at a whim without rhyme or reason. The majority of the actors were under utilized, except to look pretty (such as Thor's companions, the Queen, Odin, and everyone but Thor), leaving it with a pretty dull, and unimaginative story, with a large number of too unlikely plot devices to save the hero. Not worth the money, and the 3D special effects added life to it, but were unused mostly."

They seem to have skipped all the parts where he didn't know who he was (etc) - This Thor knows he is the God Thor all through the movie, and is a nearly unlikeable fellow. Over the course of a day and a night, he somehow goes through a catharsis that completely, and unbelievably, changes him from a spoiled fool into an noble hero. My kids liked it, but not as much as they've liked any other move they've seen the past few months (rio, etc). My wife fell asleep. I stayed awake, but kept hoping for some emotion, some soul-searching, some well, some anything. Never got it. As for the 3D... Well it's OK. Not great, but not bad either. Succumbs to some of the normal problems with 3D movies (ie, too much out of focus -- the coolness of 3D is that you can focus on anything, not just on what you want us too - remember your view master?)<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is probably near the bottom of super-hero movies, Somewhere between ""The Phantom"" and ""The Punisher"". Don't expect Iron Man quality."
"Rant_Bralding","3","3","8","6 May 2011"," Too MANY People
","As soon as I started watching this movie, I said to myself, ""Oh no, Oh NO, there are too MANY people in this film!"" I wanted to watch for one reason only: to see my old friend Thor, the God of THUNDER! But there are literally hundreds of other characters in this film, many of whom are simply in the background, never given any dialogue or explanation. How was I supposed to know where they were going or what they were doing if they never even got a close-up? My knowledge of Norse mythology was simply no help, because so much has been changed in this adaptation, and the people in these newer films are just so small. Like I said to a friend of mine afterwards, children these days are so productive, thanks to modern technology, that they simply have too MUCH time to read comics and learn complicated back-stories. I confess I felt a little left behind, because the rest of the audience had clearly done their research and had no problem following this story of thousands. On a positive note, I must praise the musical soundtrack of this film. Though modern storytelling leaves me behind, little has changed in the musical world, and thanks to a lifetime of watching movies I was able to anticipate which moments were intended alternately to terrify, excite, or titillate me, and to react appropriately! Thus the movie became a blind, primal roller-coaster ride of an experience; despite having no intellectual understanding of what I was seeing, I was able, like a child or a drug addict, to follow it emotionally in full or even more than full capacity. Therefore I conclude that while ""THOR"" makes no concessions to the unprepared viewer, it will have its rewards for those who ""do their homework""! I hope you enjoyed this review!"
"Danish_Psycho","4","3","8","6 May 2011"," Huge potential, but ultimately failed
","Thor is not a good movie, but it is not a bad one either. I don't regret paying money to see it. But the major negative thing about it, is that it had the potential to be sooo much better. I guess it has everything it needs to in order to appeal to a wider audience. There's action, drama, intrigue, comedy, love and geeky insider knowledge and cameos. But it excels in none. The action is...half-assed at best. Not really exciting except for maybe a single short battle, the climax is clumsy and sluggish, not to mention, over way too quickly. The characters...well, Thor looks the part...and sounds the part, but he just doesn't seem like a three dimensional character. He seems like an actor trying his best. His character development is awkward and cliché, not to mention how he changes from arrogant and self-serving, to protective, honorable and gentle almost overnight. Natalie Portman's character is utterly forgettable. I like her as an actor, but her character in this movie...honestly, I wouldn't care if she lived or died. Other characters seemed mostly like filler. Anthony Hopkins played...well himself, and did alright. The Loke character wasn't bad, but also very forgettable. The only truly memorable character would be Heimdal, who is pretty awesome. Thors friends - Sif and the other three guys...I face-palmed over and over again. Okay, Sif looks the part, but all in all they were pathetic. Come on! You're supposed to be Gods...throw some cars, rip up some lampposts, knock those bad boys around...but no. They can't even charge the opponent without a 'leg-up' from their friends. The comedy part has it moments where you laugh or smile a little, but at many times it's pretty awkward and lame. The romance is irrelevant and the political drama seems contrived and unimaginative. Many superhero films lately have utterly failed (Spiderman 3, The Hulk 1+2, Daredevil, Elektra, Wolverine, X-men 3 and so on), and unfortunately this one joins the list of forgettable movies that, in my opinion should not have been made. And this also brings me to the subject of The Avengers Movie that is coming soon. It seems like they just need to get all there other movies done with, so they can get to the real juicy stuff. I can't wait for that movie, but so far, having due with movies like Thor, is not really helping with my expectations."

"Sinth01","6","2","5","8 August 2013"," Superhero adaption lacking the spark of depth
","The movie adaption of Marvel's superhero story Thor is a decent one with the common superhero movie themes. It is a bit shame since some of the characters could have easily been far more interesting, especially Loki. The lack of depth in characters is the biggest flaw of the film. I ended up wondering whether the writers and the actors knew what kind character they are playing or not since there was obviously some themes lingering around that made the film to feel a bit more unique than average. Also some of the sceneries are awesome and very well made and they turn out to be the most impressive thing in this a bit over the average super hero movie. It was amusing superhero movie to watch and made a difference between other superhero movies. Unfortunately sharpening the characters and adding more depth into the plain good versus bad, the hero versus the villain could have made this a remarkable movie."

","Thor was the last in a series of comic books brought to screen i've seen within a relatively short time frame. It turned out to be among the best of them and the reason might be Kenneth Branagh directing it. Not that the movie breaks the mold of the genre, it just has a good atmosphere when dealing with the inhabitants of Asgard and supernatural creatures they're fighting.<br/><br/>However, Kenneth Branagh didn't have a particularly demanding task. When depicting Asgard and the realms of the other side, he heavily relied on his Shakespearean background. The scenes on this Earth are a mixture of thriller and action movies. And as every such movie Thor needs a large fight, similar to the end of a level in any video game, if you know what i mean. Thus, Thor confronts a large monster as seen in numerous Japanese monster movies or even in Beastie Boys' video for Intergalactic.<br/><br/>The cast deliver a solid performance, with Chris Hemsworth being a prefect choice for arrogant and blunt Thor. I'm curious whether he'll be typecast for the rest of his career.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is fun, but don't expect more than that from it."

I would have liked this big film to be more on about the characters & plot and less on the battle action. This film seems to be more directed to adolescent boys and fanboy adults. The additional great casting of Hopkins and Russo in important roles seems to be wasted here. It was enjoyable for one viewing."
"Pycs","1","2","5","1 May 2012"," Oh.....my.....God!
","Thor was simple thrust out by the studio to make a quick buck and establish the character before the release of The Avengers. And boy, does it really show here! The first half of the movie, set on Planet Asgard, was generally interesting, even if Anthony Hopkins was sleep walking through his performance. The Frost Giants of Jotunheim presented pretty scary villains and if the film had the courage to keep the setting there, with the Frost Giants as the main antagonists, they would of made the film all the better (I know the comic takes place on Earth, but c'mon, we've seen the superhero comes to earth and saves the day a million times! Try something new!)<br/><br/>Just like The Green Lantern (which is still much worse), my biggest criticism is that they don't spend enough time in the foreign landscape of Asgard (Oa in GL), and head to dull old planet Earth in no time. The first time this was done (on screen, of course) in 1978's Superman, it was a refreshing take on the fish-out-of-water story. Here it acts like a poorly done comedy, throwing the tone of the whole first act off. There is a few laughs to be had (as when he wanders into a pet shop), but really felt forced for the most part.<br/><br/>Then there's the love story. Look, I realize films like these aren't too concentrated on developing character bonds like a (much superior) film such as Before Sunrise would, but at least show us why the two are in love! I, of course, speak of Natalie Portman's character and Thor, and the inevitable attraction that grows between them. First off, and I know other reviewers have stated it before, but Natalie Portman is horribly miscast here. Either that, or she's giving one of the worst paycheck-performances I've seen in some time (there's one line reading in particular near the end that is so excruciating, it might as well of been nails on a chalkboard). But all the 'romance' consists of is Natale Portman giving Thor an awkward, teenage-crush like smile, for maybe a scene or two. In the climatic fight (no spoilers here), Thor takes a fall, and Portman's character rushes over to help him - in which I don't know how she doesn't get killed, but this movie's logic is not exactly present. They have a moment where we get those Natalie Portman tears and her eyebrows scrunch up (as they always do when she cries, in like EVERY single movie she's ever been in.) As the audience, we're suppose to feel an emotion connection to the two that just doesn't exist. They both could of been killed right then and there, the credits roll up, and I wouldn't of felt the least bit unsatisfied. Of course that doesn't happen, as you can surely guess what the outcome is, which only irritated me more.<br/><br/>Tom Hiddleston is an up-and-coming actor I have high hopes for. He was great as F. Scott Fitzgerald in Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris and one of the best parts in War Horse, but here is given nothing to do here in the role of Loki. It's no surprise he'll become the villain, as it's hinted at constantly in the film. But when he does become the main antagonist, his motivations are very askewed. Is he an outright villain? Is he a sympathetic villain? Is he even a villain at all? The film doesn't seem to know how to handle these questions. One scene he'll act one way, the next scene he'll be a completely new person. It'll be like if the Joker from the Dark Knight tries to kill Batman, then a minute later saves his life and buys him a beer. Is character continuity that difficult of a concept? <br/><br/>Stellan Skarsgard, one of the most unappreciated actors working today, also isn't given a chance to really make anything of his character. There's an assistant scientist, played by Kate Dennings, who doesn't really add anything to film and is only there for 'comedic' relief (I use the term very loosely.) Chris Hemsworth is a pretty good Thor, he comes off as very arrogant and strong-willed. But when he's asked to handle more dramatic scenes, well, I'll just says he's no Brando.<br/><br/>I'm sure this movie isn't directed at me (I usually prefer, you know, movies with a brain and pulse), so I'm sure this will make money and produce needless sequels. But, for my money, I think the material could of been handled a lot better."
"alexthestudmeister","2","2","5","28 February 2012"," Sickeningly boring and predictable.
","Thor has never been one of my favorite ""superheroes"", but I still respect his character. This movie spit in the face of Marvel, Thor, and comic books in general. This movie was definitely one of the absolute WORST comic book movies I've ever seen. The plot was boring, predictable, and poorly written. No suspense or captivation whatsoever. In my opinion, all of the actors were bad for their roles, and offered nothing to the movie. There was really no story at all, just bad CGI, pathetic ""lovie-dovie"" B.S. and random, unnecessary action scenes. After seeing the highly successful Iron Man movies, I had high hopes for this film, but I was sadly sadly disappointed. Now I have no hopes for The Avengers."
"quickiesonthedinnertable","Null","2","5","18 November 2011"," Watch only for the SFX.... if you're into that.
","I am a huge fan of mythology, whether it's Greek, Norse, Asian, Celtic.....whatever. So that was a huge motivation for me to watch this movie. The other reasons I decided to watch it were Natalie Portman, Anthony Hopkins and Kenneth Branagh. I didn't read any reviews before watching, but still had some misgivings as I suspected it would be one of those OTT, effects driven, summer blockbuster type movies I honestly shy away from.<br/><br/>Most of my misgivings turned out to be true. Noisy, pull out all the stops and throw in the kitchen sink visual and sound effects, that left my temples throbbing and me nauseous; I think epileptics may not be able to watch this.<br/><br/>Not much in the way of character development or plot. Most of the portrayals were two dimensional or predictable (you see Loki's deceit and villainy a mile away) and even Natalie Portman, who in my book can do no wrong, was painful to watch. She came across as a giddy, too easily smitten 'teenager' who too quickly developed too deep feelings for a man she hardly knew. Anthony Hopkins as usual though, even with his limited screen time, really sunk his teeth into the role and totally convinced as an aging but still powerful Norse deity; he was the high point of the movie, for me.<br/><br/>It's not a terrible movie, but with names like Portman, Hopkins and Branagh involved, the eventual outcome made me feel I was set up for a fall. It would probably have come out a lot better, had they decided to camp it up instead, something that should have been considered given the rich scope for parody - different time frames, wildly divergent parallel worlds, culture shock at every turn, outré costumes etc.<br/><br/>You will probably like this if you're a die-hard comic book hero or SFX fan. Anyone else would probably want to give this a miss and if you're a mythology freak like me, stick to the books."

","Anthony Hopkins' weird performance is just off and even gives an impression of mockery towards a childish script. And if so he is right. Stuffed with badly delivered, meaningless dialog and unfunny crap and with a general lack of any kind of intensity Thor is not to save. Not like the TV cast, logopedic case Chris Hemsworth or action-unknown director Kenneth Branagh ever had a fair chance of doing so. Thor is an alibi for a movie, existing only to set up a supporting character for another flick, not a lead one. It's not even an investment, it's just a supporting part of a business model. It was never meant to fully satisfy and so it does not. Just ask the accounting at Disney for further explanation."

","I was interested in seeing this ever since it came out. After finally seeing it I am so glad I did. It is a visually stunning film with excellent cinematography and editing and the costumes, settings and effects look wonderful. There may be the odd longueur in the plot, with a little too much of admiring the scenery, but most of it is amusing and while not sticking true to the original source material there are a lot of nods to it. Kenneth Branagh directs superbly, the action is earth-shattering and the script is filled with witty fish-out-of-water moments. The acting is fine with Chris Hemsworth giving his all in the role, Anthony Hopkins bringing some welcome gravitas to Odin rather than hamming up, Natalie Portman more than a pretty face and Tom Hiddleston's Loki a villain worth watching for. All in all, an immensely enjoyable film. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
"jonathanruano","3","2","5","31 July 2011"," Thor and Natalie Portman's downfall
","Perhaps the best way to start this review is with an observation about a very talented actor's career. Natalie Portman demonstrated with her spellbinding performance as Nina in ""Black Swan"" that she can act really well, but then she went on to act in three terrible films, ""No Strings Attached,"" ""Your Highness"" and now ""Thor."" In ""Thor,"" Portman is simply miscast. She is not a warm actor meant to play in romantic films(that is more Amy Adams' vocation), but instead a cold and efficient actor who is more suited to roles where she is expected to play a villain or someone socially awkward (if not anti-social) or a gifted prodigy with inner demons. Yet director Kenneth Branaugh and the producers put her in this film where she is expected to play a romantic lead -- something that she never did very well throughout her two-decades long career. As a result, every romantic scene with Portman looks forced from the flirtation to the laughing to the kissing scene. She does all these scenes with professional efficiency, but that unfortunately is the problem. There is nothing professional or efficient about love. Love is this irrational, emotionally charged and fantastic thing. If anyone experiences love the same way Natalie Portman's Jane Foster character did, then perhaps they should reevaluate their relationship and find someone else.<br/><br/>But that is not the only problem with ""Thor."" This movie fails at the screenplay stage. There are so many wall-to-wall special effects and blasting soundtracks (Hollywood frequently confuses loudness with good music) that there's no room for a plot or for character development. Moreover what little story line there is was taken out of dozens of movies which exhausted these plot gimmicks. Chris Hemsworth plays the ""Thor"" character in the same spirit as Dustin Claire played Gannicus in the second season of Spartacus, except that Claire's character evolved beyond the caricature of the muscular cool guy at the gym who is loved by all women. Hemsworth's Thor, by contrast, has not even lived up to the caricature, because the plot allows for no character development. Or take how Jane Foster (Portman) and Darcy (Kat Dennings) react to the appearance of the muscular Thor. Those scenes of women enamoured with Thor's manliness are essentially a page taken out of a less than memorable scene in Cecil B. Demille's ""The Ten Commandments,"" when muscular Moses (Charleton Heston) crosses the desert and happens upon a small farm with an elderly farmer and his daughters. The daughters are thrilled because they see a muscular, heroic man. In other words, ""Thor"" is really the product of wall to wall special effects and recycled story lines. The immediate impression I got was that the producers decided to go with the first draft of the screenplay rather than telling their writers to go back to the drawing board and come up with something better. The result is mind numbing entertainment.<br/><br/>As a final comment, the villains in this picture are not compelling. The frosty giants do not do anything except turn other people into frost or get knocked down in record numbers. This, of course, is boring because we have known for more than ten years that computers can create fake armies battling each other. Moreover this film does not have the guts, the imagination and the intelligence to show how brutal and dehumanizing violence and war really are (even though there are two battles on screen). Instead the violence appears to come out of several mindless video games. Something mildly interesting was done with the villain Loki, who may not have seemed as bad as the other villains, but even then Loki's character was so limited and oversimplified that he just wasn't interesting. I was stunned to see IMDb.com awarding this terrible film 7.4/10. It goes to show how easy it is convince the viewing public that they're not watching junk. I think 3/10 is more suitable."
"bbck7","2","2","5","5 June 2011"," Good 3d, no plot
","My nine year old grandson could have written a better script. A total waste of great actors. I resent paying fourteen bucks a ticket to see a movie and the director and/or producers cannot hire writers that can compose a rational plot with dialog above a second grade level. They probably spent 200 million on the 3d and the cinematography and paid a thousand dollars for the script. Well, I said all I want to about this terrible movie, but I need more lines so here goes. How these good actors could possibly be connected with this production is beyond me, they must have paid them huge sums. Why the producers think they can make a good movie without telling a good story is beyond me."
"Field78","8","2","5","24 May 2011"," Don't mess with the God of Thunder!
","I have never been very familiar with Thor the Marvel Hero, so I can't say that I was very enthusiastic about a movie with Thor in it at first; having seen screen shots with long-haired men in shiny armor, I feared for something unintentionally ridiculous like Catwoman. When I heard that Ken Branagh was taking the directorial duties, I was somewhat reassured that they would at least make a serious attempt to get something good out of it. But, this being a movie about gods with super powers, I was still less than convinced that they could make something out of it that was both entertaining and engaging.<br/><br/>When the reviews came in quite positively, I decided to give Thor a chance, and I am glad to admit that I was pleasantly surprised. Mixing fantasy with reality in a believable, non-corny way is no small feat, but Branagh and his team pulled it off greatly.<br/><br/>The start was shaky at best, though. The narrated prologue was quite hectic, throwing in vague concepts and weird creatures in a train of fast-cut, badly lit and shaky action scenes, making it hard to make any heads or tails from it, either story-wise or visually. However, then the story slows down considerably and things start to make sense. The rest of the movie is well-balanced between a story of a troubled and arrogant young warrior who has to find his place and prove himself worthy, and some energetic action scenes where you CAN discern what happens, who hits who and what explodes. The feeling I had after seeing the first Iron Man movie certainly comes to mind.<br/><br/>Even though I make the comparison with Iron Man, I also should point out that Thor will require a bigger part of your imagination. The flying suit in Iron Man also needs some stretch of the mind, but it is still basically very advanced technology. Thor requires that you accept the existence of immortal superior beings within our world, edging much more into the realm of fantasy. As I said, I was curious if Branagh could handle this 'clash' between reality and mythology without becoming either too serious or too campy, but he succeeds, by using these situations to great comical effect, again balancing it skillfully against the dramatic moments.<br/><br/>He has some excellent actors to thank as well. Chris Hemsworth does a great job as a superhero who has to be tough, cocky, but at times fragile and funny as well. Same goes for Tom Hiddleston, who is both devious and likable, making for a convincing bad guy. And last but not least, sir Anthony Hopkins in a part that requires his greatness, divinity and fatherly strictness for a change; all too often, he seems to be cast just to give movies some British stage class and grandeur, but here he is the right man for the part. <br/><br/>The 3D presentation of this movie doesn't really add that much; it makes for some nice action scenes, but the 3D rendering has the unfortunate adverse effect of considerably darkening scenes, which was problematic in the prologue and some more scenes that are already dark in themselves. So I'll be looking forward to the 2D BluRay version.<br/><br/>So I certainly recommend seeing this movie, and I even suggest that you sit out the end-credits for the traditional Marvel productions post-credit scene, the best so far in my opinion."

","This was an output from Kenneth Branagh - and it was an utter failure. Even though some of my favorite actors appears in leading roles in this movie, it just can't raise the bar of quality. The movie is so utterly void and lost in the act of trying to spin a story around the supposedly love connection between thor and ""the mortal girl"". Where were all the details from the viking mythology? Even Sleipner, odins horse, missed several legs - and if it had its 8 legs, it was not even properly portraited. <br/><br/>I can't recommend this movie.

Don't be suckered like I was last night. The movie is HORRIBLE. The characters are flat (that they are in 3D does not help), their actions are not motivated, the story is lame. There's is nothing. It is like a mixture of batman and robin (with shwartz as the ice man) and mask 2, with all character (if any) gone. Natalie Portman, shame on you! It is too early for you to cash out. Don't look at Hopkins, he has some great roles, so he can do it. Battle scenes are messy and dialog is non-existent.

","This movie had the potential to be, for lack of better word, epic. But it was not. The movie was good, but it could have been extraordinary. The story moves along much too quickly for the audience to develop any real connection with the characters. But there are a great deal of action shots, especially towards the first half of the movie that most people are going to really enjoy. The use of storyline from Asgard and the nine worlds is brilliant. This movie has the potential to make so many different categories of viewers happy because of the choice of story and actors, but I don't know why the director and writers failed to develop it fully? If you're going to spend that kind of money on the movie, why not push for serious completion? The movie felt seriously rushed. Frankly, I'm a bit disappointed, because I had high hopes. Nonetheless, I would watch it again for sheer brute fighting scenes. The movie does manage to get your heart pumping with adrenaline, which is a good sign. The 3D was well incorporated into majestic and powerful scenes, so kudos to the digital artists for that one! THIS COULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH MORE!"
"DemiRonin","6","2","5","16 May 2011"," Chris Hemsworth may be mighty as a god, but his film is merely mortal.
","Thor is the Marvel comic book adaptation of Thor, the Norse god of thunder. Thor played by Chris Hemsworth is the son of Odin, King of the realm Asgard. We are introduced to the golden world of Asgard during a ceremony in which Odin, played by Anthony Hopkins, is about to pass the throne to Thor. Unfortunately some frost giants from the realm Jotunheim ruin event by trying to steal a powerful magic artifact, an artifact that was once theirs but was lost in a long and bloody war with the Asgardians. <br/><br/>When the thievery is thwarted Thor goes into a rage demanding payback for the insolent frost giants. Thor request permission from his father to assault the frost giant's home realm. When Odin refuses Thor and his band of warrior friends leave for Jotunheim in secret. Equipped with his mighty hammer Mjolnir, which gives Thor super speed, strength, the ability to fly, and control over lighting and wind, Thor goes on a smashing spree in the ice world. Without heeding the words of his younger brother Loki, played Tom Hiddlestone, and with little regard for his friends Thor breaks the long truce between Asgard and Jotunheim. <br/><br/>Angered by Thor's arrogance and disrespect Odin strips Thor of his powers and sends him to the realm of Earth. Thor lands in New Mexico where the Astrologist Jane Foster, played by Natalie Portman meets Thor by accidentally hitting him with her car. From here on it's a ""fish out of water"" story with Thor learning humility by living as a mortal. All the while back in Asgard, Thor's brother Loki plots to take power for himself. <br/><br/>Thor is competently made and for the most part you'll be enjoying the ride, but after it's over you'll most likely dive straight back into your busy life without giving Thor another thought. Thor is not the cinematic master piece that is The Dark Knight and it's no Iron Man 1. The reason being is that Thor's character development is at best, awkward. At first he's arrogant wanting nothing more that to bash some big frosty bodies. The next he falls in love with a scientist who basically all she does is drive him places and feed him. Thor's highs and lows are too extreme to build much an emotional connection to the audience. <br/><br/>However, Chris Hemsworth does have a magnetic aura and there's no doubt we'll be seeing much more of him in the future. Throughout the film Chris pulls off both bravado and comedy. Hopkins plays a great king and Hiddlestone can definitely act. The acting all around is superb but with one minor exception. You wouldn't think that this weak spot would come from a 2011 Oscar winner but unfortunately that is the chase in Thor. To her credit Portman did the best with what she had, but what she had can be summed up into a single thought - Fall in love Thor because he talks funny and is a hunk. There is absolutely no chemistry between the two and there conversations are literally: Portman - I don't understand you. Hemsworth - Don't worry it'll be okay. <br/><br/>The cinematography is alright but reminds me a bit of the 2009 Star Trek with all its flashy lens flares and overuse of tilted shots. The editing is fairly well done for a movie that has to jump back and forth between Earth and Asgard. The special effects are definitely up to par with Marvel's recent films, I especially liked the how the did the Metal guardian 'Destroyer'. My main visual gripe is with in the first battle scene. It's far too dark and up close to see much, it felt a lot like Batman Begins where you see all this cool action but you just wish the camera would back up 2 feet. <br/><br/>All in all Thor is an 'ok' film. It's not a disaster but it just feels like something you should to watch in order to be prepared for the up and coming Avenger film, rather than something to enjoy just for itself. <br/><br/>Who this film is not for: -People with high expectations <br/><br/>Major gripes: <br/><br/>-Battle scenes are in the wrong order. By far the coolest battle scene was the first one and the weakest one was the last one with Loki. In the beginning of the film Thor took on like a hundred frost giants by himself while Loki struggled to take on just two. How are we supposed to take Loki as a serious challenge to Thor at the end when they are so vastly different in power? Loki didn't even use the all power Frost Casket thingy that he used on the bridge guardian!? <br/><br/>-In the battle with Loki and Thor, Loki does an illusion Trick and is able to get a free shot in the back of Thor, yet when he does zap Thor with his staff, Thor's not even hurt!? He gets up and smashes his hammer into the ground and Loki flies 20 feet away. <br/><br/>-What happened to the Frost Giants saying blood will flow!? Whatever happened to that war? <br/><br/>-Natalie Portman and all the human characters were basically shallow vessels for plot. Kate Dennings' character is useless except for making jokes <br/><br/>-Odin conveniently having a 'heart attack' when Loki yells at him was a little over the top...way to be original Brangah.... <br/><br/>-Thor accepting his fate on earth in like two days was a bit of a stretch. When his friends come to return him to Asgard Thor's like ""it's cool dude, I'm just gonna stay right here, I don't care about being King anymore or seeing my mother or my home land or getting back my powers"".... yeahh..... rightt......"

","In the climactic battle of brother against brother, Loki (amazing Tom Hiddleston) confesses to Thor (commanding Chris Hemsworth), ""I never wanted to be King. I only wanted to be your equal!"" That arc captures the surprising greatness and ambition of Director Kenneth Branagh's ""Thor"". Branagh, who is known more for his Shakespearean adaptations, is an unlikely candidate for ""Thor"", based on the beloved Marvel superhero. However, here Branagh's Shakespearean sensibilities well serve ""Thor"". ""Thor"" is mesmerizing as it retells the Norse Mythology of Odin and Asgard. ""Thor"" tells the timeless story of sons vying for their father's love, and betrayal. ""Thor"" at its summit is classic Greek Tragedy, like the best comic book heroes. This is so unexpected given the numerous screen and story writers involved: Ashley Edward Miller, Zack Stentz, Don Payne, J. Michael Straczynski, and Mark Potosevich. The source material is the comic book by Stan Lee, Larry Lieber, and Jack Kirby.<br/><br/>""Thor"" is defiantly engrossing. It is also so well acted with Academy Award Winners Anthony Hopkins as Odin and Natalie Portman as intrepid scientist Jane Foster. Both command gravitas, especially Hopkins. Rene Russo strongly plays Odin's wife devoted Frigga. Tom Hiddleston virtually steals the movie as the duplicitous Loki. He brilliantly balances villainy and tragedy. Idris Elba is powerful and noble as gold armored Gatekeeper Heimdall. Newcomer Chris Hemsworth is charismatic and surprisingly charming and funny. The dude is classically handsome with blonde mane and chiseled body. I had read how he trained for ""Thor""-- he looks amazing. He is a great action guy as he dispatches S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents like nothing. More impressive than his ripped abs, is his screen presence, and he holds his own with Hopkins. He and Hopkins have a visceral chemistry. In a touching scene Thor admits to his Father Odin, ""Someday perhaps, I shall make you proud"" In that moment I was reminded of Hopkins and Brad Pitt in ""Meet Joe Black"".<br/><br/>In ""Thor"", Thor (Hemsworth) is a reckless, vain, and arrogant warrior and god. He is Odin's favorite son, and that wounds the very soul of his brother Loki (Hiddleston). Thor is next in line to King Odin. We learn from Norse mythology that Asgard maintains a truce with their mortal enemies the Frost Giants, lead by malevolent King Laufey (darkly seething Colm Feore), following a legendary battle with Odin. Outraged by terrorist interruption of his ascension Thor leads his loyal group of warriors along with Loki to engage the Frost Giants. His rashness threatens all out war in the Realms. Odin says, ""You are a vain greedy, cruel boy."" Thor strikes back, ""You are an old man, and a fool!"" Odin banishes his son Thor to Earth. His mighty hammer Mjollnir also plummets to the deserts of New Mexico—as we recall from ""Iron Man 2"". Only the one deserving to wield the power of Thor can raise the hammer. Scattered genius Dr. Jane Foster (Portman) literally crashes into earth bound Thor. Jane and her team, Erik (Stellen Skarsgard) and Darcy (funny Kat Dennings), have been tracking repeated cosmic disturbances in the desert.<br/><br/>Geeky and klutzy Jane resists her attraction to the hunky Thor. Shocking. At the same time, the Government agency S.H.I.E.L.D. and Agent Coulson (deft straight man Clark Gregg) isolate Thor's hammer in a covert operation of grave national security. They also confiscate all of Jane's research. There is some funny fish out of water humor at Thor's expense. As much as Erik does not want to admit, all things point to the Norse God of Thunder. Thor gives his Viking word of honor to Jane, knowing that he endangers them both.<br/><br/>Back in Asgard, the conflicted Loki is both beholding to and jealous of his brother. He so fiercely desires the love and approval of his father. Loki confirms the tragic betrayal from Odin, who then falls gravely ill. Hiddleston is powerful as Loki perpetuates a lie. He dearly loves his brother, but he cannot forgive his perceived betrayal. In this ""Thor"" soars. The weakness in ""Thor"" resides in the Earth bound story. Granted ""Thor"" is a predictable transformation and surrender of courage and humility. However, the love story of Thor and Jane is the least evolved. I think in the classic story of the Hero, Director Branagh intended this to be a source of power, but perhaps this got lost in the editing. What remains is still great and compelling. ""Thor"" is heroic tragedy with its tale of a Father's love, and brother's betrayal. Hopkins, Hemsworth, and Hiddleston are awesome in Branagh's Shakespearean rendering of ""Thor""."
"elvisrivet-1","7","2","5","8 May 2011"," A mighty way to kick off the summer movie season
","I just got back from seeing Thor at my local theatre, and I have to admit I was impressed by it. To those who are wondering to go see it or not, you should it's different then the other super hero movies. Thor is based on the marvel comic of the same name, it's of course about the God of thunder Thor. The movie starts off on earth, then changes to Asgard. I have to admit the Asgard scenes were some of the best visuals I've ever seen in a movie, some of the visuals even match that of Avatar. Of course all of the actors were great. Loki was just a bad ass I wasn't expecting to like him but I did. For once they made you feel for the villain they gave him emotion. Loki is quite the character and by the end of the movie you kind of end up feeling sorry for him and the way he's been treated. Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddston give the best performances of the whole movie I have to admit. The action scenes were great in the movie, exactly what you would expect from Thor. The movie ends with a bang, and if you don't know already there's a scene after the credits, so stay for that. Now I saw this in 3D so as far as that goes, the movie did a good job with it, it's the best 3D converted movie I have seen, but not the best 3D movie. Some of the scenes really didn't seem 3D, which is why it's only decent 3D for, the scenes that really worked in 3D were Asgard and the action scenes. I'd say go see it in 3D if you like 3D movies, but 2D would be just as good. Anyway I'm giving Thor a 10/10."
"jpachar82","9","2","5","6 May 2011"," The God of Thunder
","Open up the heavens and let the thunder come, because Thor will unleash his wrath upon the planets and the galaxy. I really wasn't supposed to see this movie, but I'm glad I did because it was pretty awesome. I actually learned something: don't mess with the god of thunder. Chris Hemsworth played the title role beautifully, Natalie Portman, she's great in any movie, but the wonderful Sir Anthony Hopkins – no one can compare to him, he is a god among men.<br/><br/>Kenneth Branagh, 9 years ago played Professor Lockhart in Harry Potter & The Chamber of Secrets, did an excellent in the director's chair of Thor. I don't know what else to say about this movie, but it was really good and I was on the edge of my seat waiting for thunder to strike. As they say, thunder strikes twice in the same place."
"evetsview","Null","2","5","6 May 2011"," Another Marvel gem - THOR a thunderous hit
","Yes - it is worthy<br/><br/>After seeing the other Marvel entries, I agreed with many that THOR would be the most difficult to adapt to the big screen and I was hopeful when I heard Kenneth Branagh would be directing, having enjoyed his Shakespeare films in the past and the possibility of lending his classic twist to a popular tale, and now after seeing this film, I am pleased to offer my congrats to Branagh and Marvel for bringing one of my favorite super hero characters to life.<br/><br/>I was anxious and ready for the grand scope of special effects that would carry me across the rainbow bridge to Asgard and to see the Mighty Thor and his warrior companions in action, but I was very pleasantly surprised with the depth of the characters and the impressive performances from the cast.<br/><br/>Aside from Anthony Hopkins and Natalie Portman, the main players are relatively unknown and yet it is these performances that impressed me most. Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston may not be big names now but after this film that could quickly change. Hemsworth and Hiddleston are worth the price of admission alone, the classic sibling rivalry between Thor and Loki is made obvious but not overdone; especially in dialogue but rather skillfully played through body language and facial gestures (always been a firm believer that sometimes the best dialogue is NO dialogue) The action scenes are fantastic but again not overdone - only enough is offered to where you want to see them again.<br/><br/>*SPOILER ALERT - One of the scenes that particularly stood out was - after being cast out of Asgard and banished to Earth, Thor fights off a squad of highly trained G-Men to claim his weapon but when he realizes that he can no longer lift his enchanted hammer he is devastated and the scene hits you full force - Hemsworth nails the scene perfectly and Branagh slam dunks this part of the story most of all, adding a great deal of depth to the lead character - Thor's face reveals the squandered opportunity to prove himself as rightful heir to the Asgardian throne and at the same time a son's inevitable desire for his father's blessing now being forever denied him. I was surprised to see this element so well done in a film of this sort. THOR is good entertainment with a good ensemble of characters and wonderfully brought to life with a good cast. <br/><br/>I look forward to Thor's return."
"HarpoSpoke","8","2","5","6 May 2011"," Well acted, fun ride, but cuts may have hurt pacing
","In a town with a population of 5588 the midnight 2D showing was almost packed to capacity. There was also a 3D showing. I asked how sales were for each and got a vague reply that seemed to indicate most were opting for 2D tickets. I saw a guy with 3D tickets walk right by the long 2D line and enter his theater. Don't know if that means anything, but Thor may not get a huge boost from 3D if this is typical. He'll have to earn the money the old-fashioned way I guess.<br/><br/>Really had a good time once it got rolling. But felt like something was cut during the early parts of the movie. Things felt rushed. Supposedly 15-20 minutes was cut from the film at the last minute. That may be where the extra 15 minutes was supposed to be. So a guy in a suit somewhere probably stuck his hand in where it didn't belong. The proper ""Thor geek moments"" were all there....and they worked on screen really well. I...kinda want that hammer. Thor as a character is a true bad-ass. More action than the Iron Man movies. More than most super hero movies to be honest. The crowd really seemed to enjoy the movie. At first I wondered if this was biased because the midnight showing was packed with fan-boys who were predisposed to like it. But then the ending credit popped up and over half the theater got up and left! This crowd was clearly not fan-boys. I have to question if many of them have internet connections.<br/><br/>The cast was really good. Hemsworth is great as Thor. The guy has a likability factor that can't be bought and can't be taught. When he smiles you almost have to like him....cannot wait to see him and RDJ trade barbs in The Avengers. Hopkins was magnificent as Odin....""regal"" is the proper word. Hiddleston was also great as Loki. He brought layers to a character that is supposed to have layers. There is a scene between he and Hemsoworth on Earth that is as poignant as any scene I've seen in a super hero movie ever. The ""warriors 3"" were underwhelming though...though Alexander was really good as Lady Sif. Portman was better than I thought she would be. I'm not a huge fan of hers. I like her but don't get all the praise she often gets. But here she made some lines that could have been cheesy work very well. The history of female leads in super hero movies is not good....Portman puts a notch in the ""good female lead' side of the ledger. Dennings did not irritate me like I expected and even made me laugh a couple of times.<br/><br/>I'll give it a 8/10 for the moment. Not quite up to Iron Man level, but better than most super hero movies I've seen. Would probably be in my top 10. Something tells me the directors cut will have a higher score for me. That cut footage hurts it a little. It didn't have a ""left the audience wanting more"" feel...it had a ""left the audience needing more"" feeling."
"TheDarkKnight21","9","2","5","6 May 2011"," Behold the Mighty Start of the Summer!
","Thor was the Marvel property that, at first blush, I thought was a dumb idea to make into a movie. A Norse God becomes a superhero? To a novice comic follower like myself, it sounded ridiculous. But what do you know? Marvel Studios shut me up again like when they released the first Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk reboot. Behold the mighty Thor in all his glory!<br/><br/>Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is an arrogant warrior from beyond the stars trying to prove himself to his wise father, Odin (Anthony Hopkins) in their home realm of Asgard. Thor and his band of warriors assault a realm filled with ice giants (just go with it, it totally works) after a few giants infiltrated Asgard to steal a powerful weapon. For Thor's brazen foolishness, he is banished by Odin to the realm of Earth and stripped of his godlike powers. When Thor slams down to Earth, he is greeted by young astronomer, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), who has questions of her own of the stars. But Thor's brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has some dark plans now that Thor is exiled from Asgard.<br/><br/>The plot's a little complex, but it's easier to see on the big screen. The film is split between telling the epic and chaotic war on Asgard and the classic fish-out-of-water story on Earth. Some people (comic fanboys) were concerned that the whole film would be focused on the Earth side story, which is not at all the case. The goofy Earth stuff you see in the trailer is all there, but surprisingly, that's all there was to the goofiness. A good portion of the film is dedicated to Thor getting back his powers and learning humility while his time on Earth. Thanks in no small part to Natalie Portman, but if you were getting checked out by someone like her you'd be damn sure to reform any of your character flaws.<br/><br/>From this setup, Kenneth Branagh directs his actors to say Shakespearean-like dialogue with such gusto that it almost seems believable. When Thor is speaking in such a way in Asgard, you never laugh because his and others dialogue feels natural in this setting. It's when he arrives on Earth that Thor's mannerisms and speech become funny, but that's how it usually seemed to me in the shows I've seen with Thor. All the actors turn in solid performances with a great script that manages to balance humor and adventure into a nice package. <br/><br/>Then there's the action and wow does it work. Branagh, who's only versed in directing Shakespearean films, shows a little knack for making epic fight sequences between Thor and his various enemies. They feel immense and awe-inspiring, with the computer-generated images never bothering you for a second. Everything just feels right and amazing. You want to see a fun, summer adventure film? You'll find it right here.<br/><br/>My only complaints are small ones. The beginning dragged a bit for the first ten minutes, but when it picks up, it gets going to the very end. The other problem I had was with Loki. While Tom Hiddleston does a fine job with what he's given, Loki never feels like a great threat to Thor. While I'm happy to see they gave some dimension to his character by giving him valid reasons for his actions, he still comes across as a sniveling weasel. For setting up Thor's origin story, he works, but I'm left wanting more from the villain department.<br/><br/>So is Thor worth checking out? That's a resounding, thunderous yes. It's an epic adventure with the right amount of humor and pathos to make this an entertaining summer blockbuster. What's more, it paves the way for the larger-than-life Avengers film coming next summer and shows that no hero under Marvel's control is not good enough for the big screen. Watch it and enjoy the beginning the summer."
"MrJRGO","8","2","5","5 May 2011"," Thor-oughly enjoyable.
","'Thor' has all the ingredients you need for a superb comic book adaptation with a panoply of characters that are perfectly portrayed, easy to follow dialogue with occasional humour, effective CGI and all of this handsomely directed by Kenneth Brannagh.<br/><br/>The performances of the cast are exceptional with no one letting the side down. The two main newcomers, Hemsworth and Hiddleston, are jewels in the crown, with Anthony Hopkins upping the theatrics and Natalie Portman delivering a seasoned performance.<br/><br/>Chris Hemsworth makes Thor his own with a prodigious performance that captures all the emotions of this young, arrogant and powerful warrior on his journey of self discovery. It is hard to dislike him even when he is arrogant, but as the film goes on, you feel overwhelming support for Thor.<br/><br/>Tom Hiddleston manages to catch Loki's mischievous nature with pure precision. Even though he is a deceitful character, you can't help feeling for him as the jealous younger sibling of Thor.<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins is perfect as Odin and delivers a consummate performance of the wise and ancient King of this fantastical realm of Asgard.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman superbly plays the astrophysicist who is caught up in all the action, with a straight laced performance that contrasts perfectly with all the fantastical events happening around her.<br/><br/>Kenneth Brannagh proves the doubters wrong and delivers the goods with clever direction that blends the splendour of Norse mythology with a workable story on present day Earth. Brannagh knows how to pace the action and is happy to give the audience plenty of breathing space with the slower scenes.<br/><br/>Credit must go to Idris Elba and Colm Feore although the latter is criminally underused. Elba is imposing and statuesque as the all seeing Heimdall, with Feore successfully capturing the menace and sadness of Laufey, the King of the Frost Giants.<br/><br/>The intricately detailed costumes and sets are a big positive and the special effects up the bar for other comic book adaptations to beat.<br/><br/>At just under two hours in length, this is a thoroughly enjoyable action packed romp and takes you places you only usually dream of. Just sit back with your coke and popcorn and let it wash all over you.<br/><br/>It's so good, I've watched it twice."
"stevewhite88","8","2","5","3 May 2011"," High Expectations - Does it Disappoint?
","With a budget in excess of $150,000,000 and a stellar cast behind it, I went into Thor will high expectations, and hoped not to be disappointed. Over the past few years we have been treated to numerous superhero films from the Marvel franchise, and I think it would be fair to say many of them have been good, but not always lived up to the high expectations cinema-goers set for them.<br/><br/>Thor is not the traditional superhero film in the true sense of what we have come to expect from the genre – you will not see anyone prancing around in a lycra suit, chasing down a villain dressed as a clown here. Rather the film is based on a mysterious and legendary tale and in particular the Norse God Thor. An interesting theory is bought up with how modern day science is the equivalent ofancient magic, and this provides an effective link from the universe of Thor back to the universe we live in today. The film is focused around two brothers – Loki and Thor – and their rise/attempted rise to the throne of Asgard and the battles that need to be fought along the way. I won't give away too many details within this review, as I don't want to spoil the film, but let's just say they both do not tend to see eye to eye.<br/><br/>As a director Kenneth Branagh excels in what many will consider an unfamiliar genre for his direction. Branagh has long been associated with the stigma of being a director of drama (in particular Shakespeare) something well deserved as he does it so well, but it would be unfair to not give him credit for the work he has done with Thor. The fight scenes throughout the movie has obviously been well planned out, and all translate onto screen effectively under Branagh's direction. Humour is abundant as Thor is forced out of his comfort zone into the 'modern realm' – there is an particularly hilarious scene involving a cup early on in the movie – something that reminded me of a true life incident involving the girl sitting next to me in the cinema! These humorous moments really add to the movie, especially as they offer some light relief from what could have been continuous action sequences, whilst at the same time not taking away from the action too much.<br/><br/>One of the strongest points of this film are the characters themselves and the talented actors that portray them. As the lead Chris Hemsworth shines remarkably as Thor, bringing life to the character with just the right amount of cockiness and wit. Natalie Portman makes up for her terrible outing in Your Highness with an impeccable display as the love interest and modern day scientist, and it would be unfair to forget to mention her partners Stellan Skarsgard and Kat Dennings who compliment her character perfectly. I thought Dennings in particular is an unsung hero in this movie and I look forward to seeing her career continue to blossom in the future. Veteran actor Anthony Hopkins cannot be faulted in his role as King Odin, and one cannot not compliment Tom Hiddleston who puts in perhaps the best performance of the whole film as Loki. He nails the character down to a tee, and it would be difficult to imagine anyone else taking up the role and the character being played in any other way. Tom Hiddleston is definitely another one to watch in the future.<br/><br/>The main issue I had with Thor is that the plot was sometimes slightly too far fetched and leaky. Too much of the film is used to set up for The Avengers next year, particularly with the presence of Shield (the government agency) who also made an appearance in Iron Man 2 last year. I also found the movie to be awfully predictable and it was easy to tell what was coming next, and how it was all going to play out at the end. That being said there was a few things I was slightly surprised over (I won't go into too much detail here) but this was a negative as I though parts were missing that could have been nicely tied up. The film does set up nicely for The Avengers movie, and of course the inevitable sequel of Thor 2 that I expect we shall see in Cinemas within the next two/three years at the latest.<br/><br/>Overall, not a bad outing from Marvel in the slightest. The cast really make this movie what is is, and the action doesn't disappoint. If the story has just been a little bit stronger and I hadn't been made to feel I was simply watching a 114 minute long build up trailer for The Avengers this film would have got a full ten stars from me. Still worth going to watch however, and this looked especially good on the big screen in 3D.<br/><br/>Visit my blog at StevieNight.com for more of my reviews."
"flowerboy","10","2","5","3 May 2011"," Superheroes don't incite wars
","I'm a great fan of superhero movies and I always go out and watch them on the big screen. This week, Thor was released in India a week before it's release in the USA and I dropped everything to go and see it. I wasn't disappointed. Though Thor is not as famous as Spiderman, Bat man, and I don't recall reading the comic, he is a Nordic God, so that makes him pretty big in the scheme of things right? As it shifts back and forth between earth and Thor's planet in another constellation, the movie uses 3D to great effect, much better than I've seen it used in recent movies like Tron. Chris Hensworth, last seen in The Perfect Getaway, makes for an charmingly adorable Norse God and Anthony Hopkins lends great presence in the role of his father, Odin. Shakespearean actor/director Kenneth Branagh adds lots of theatrical floorish to the proceedings, especially in the relationship between Odin and his two sons. The talented women in this film, Natalie Portman (Thor's would-be lady love), Rene Rousso (thor's mother), don't have much to do. Very little time is given to the romance between Thor and earthling scientist and I think it could possibly have been dispensed with totally (a movie without a love angle? why not?). The running theme of the movie is that good kings (and good superheroes) never incite wars, though they must be prepared for it when there is no other course of action. But it takes the protagonists a while to get this, and there's lots of battle in between."

","(sigh). I really don't know what went wrong. Or rather I do, but simply don't understand why it was aloud to happen. Thor is flashy, exciting, and at times, downright epic. It's only when the film slows down (and it does this A lot) and the actors are forced to rely on the script, that the premise begins showing holes.<br/><br/>Thor was going to be tough sell from the beginning. Superhero films were hard enough to market due to some of the source material just being to silly to adapt to screen. Even comic book fans (which I am) can admit that some of the more ludicrous Batman villains (if you're in the mood for a laugh, look up Calenderman) could never make it in the serious, gritty, plausible world of Christopher Nolan. The same goes for any other superhero film. There must be an attempt to ground the more fantastical elements into realism or the audience will taken out of the movie. It's a fine line between realistic, and believable. Thor is about the Norse God of thunder, who's been banished to earth for starting a war with Frost Giants, leaving his sorcerer brother Loki, to plot against his father and all of Asgard; the home of the Gods.<br/><br/>Thor doesn't fit into realistic or believable, to say the least, so that was the first strike. But would not have been the ending blow. Fantsy has done will in the past for summer movies (See Lord of The Rings). But when Thor is bluntly introduced to the very nonmagical world of Midgard (That's Earth doncha know), your mind is suddenly faced with a juxtaposition. This meeting of two very different worlds can work. If the script is any good. And this is Thor's problem.<br/><br/>The dialog feels really wooden at times, and the interactions between Thor and the lesser characters (see everyone who's not Natile Portman), is never developed on. Thor and Jane's relationship just seems forced, as does everything else that's character motivated in this plot. When the film delivers an action sequence, it delivers one HELL of an action sequence. The fights are amazing, and creative, and the effects really show where most of the money went. The acting is great, if hammy at times, and there are no bad actors. There just simply isn't a lot to work with in terms of script. There are some lines that, while emotion is clearly being delivered behind them, just sound flat out silly, and create unintentional comedy.<br/><br/>For what material there was to work with, Chris Hemeisntworth, delivers a more then adequate performance, coming across as the right amounts of kind, confident, but arrogant and angry to a fault. Natiel Portman, feels a bit wasted here, but she delivers a passable performance. Thor is by no means a bad movie, or even a bad superhero movie. Where more of Iron Man 2 territory, rather then Dardevil here. But a poor script keeps the God of Thunder from being great."

"Likes_Ninjas90","7","6","25","18 April 2011"," Here is a film that simultaneously familiarises and dazzles us through a predictable narrative
","In a magical realm, a war has raged between the Norse gods and a powerful enemy called the Frost Giants. These adversaries have tried to infiltrate the majestic city of Asgard, which belongs to King Odin (Anthony Hopkins). Since they were young the king taught his sons that they must never start a war but only retaliate if truly necessary. His sons are Thor (Chris Hemsworth), an arrogant hammer-wielding warrior and the jealous Loki (Tom Hiddleston). To respond to a sneak attack on the kingdom by the Frost Giants, Thor takes it upon himself to lead a group of his friends to punish the beasts. After barely surviving a deadly battle and having one of his men wounded, Thor is interrogated by Odin and banished for disobeying his father's order for peace. He is stripped of his powers and both he and his magical hammer are blasted out of the magic realm and into the real world. Crash landing on Earth, Thor is hit by the car of astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman). She's been investigating the gateways between the real and magical worlds in the New Mexico desert. When her data is stolen by shady government agents, who have also set up a perimeter around the engraved hammer, she enlists the help of Thor to get both of their items back. <br/><br/>Here is a film that simultaneously familiarises and dazzles us through a predictable narrative. We're so swept up by the visual exuberance that Kenneth Branagh shoots the film with that the familiarity of an ageing king and his fractured kingdom rarely troubles us. There are predictable double crosses, some romance and opportunities for redemption. It's hard to go wrong with such safe, timeless and universal material. And given the steady hand with which the epic is presented, the film engages. The kingdom of Asgard is itself a stirring and magnificent creation. It's a golden fortress and a majestic city, sweepingly built upon and viewed from across the sea. The interiors are painted with a bronze palette, only to be crusted over by frosty intruders. It's a handsome film to look at, especially in 3D, where the long shots employ some brief but noticeable touches of depth. But disappointingly as the film progresses the 3D becomes less noticeable, particular in the second half. It probably wouldn't be worth paying the extra dollars just to see the opening quarter in 3D. And the only reason for not hearing some alarm bells during an early battle is because of how booming the sound effects are. There's a slickly handled sequence where Thor and his friends take down waves of enemies, but it also suggests that the film will, like many blockbusters, turn into a big budget video game. <br/><br/>But after this lengthy stint in the magical realm something unexpected happens: the film develops a sense of humour. One of the most enjoyable aspects of the film is when Thor finds himself in the real world, while still retaining his traditional Norse mannerisms. The fish out of water jokes work well because the scenes are actually funny and unexpected. The best of these comedic moments is shared between Thor walking into a pet store, announcing he needs a horse and in a diner where he smashes a mug on the ground demanding more drink. Pay attention for a Tony Stark reference by one of the government goons towards the end of the film and also an extra scene after the credits too. I like Hemworth's performance in the comedic scenes the best. He plays them straight and serious, as all good comedy should be. His charisma does fade in and out, flashing a smile occasionally but largely being reduced to gruff manly, measured speak. Still, his testosterone voice recalls Russell Crowe in Gladiator and he's physically adept too. It's a step up from the Saddle Club and with more opportunities to develop his performance in the inevitable sequel he'll improve. Portman has him more than covered for charisma though. I don't know what an astrophysicist is meant to sound like but she has boundless energy, with an adorable presence on screen. She's a lot of fun to watch. Hopkins has very little time and with mechanical dialogue there's less emotion to be found in his character or Thor's sidekicks. Regardless, the skill shown in the bloodless action sequences is apparent and the humour is relieving. Comic book fans and younger viewers will thrive here on a film that knows exactly what it is."
"CuriosityKilledShawn","5","3","11","1 May 2011"," A film of two halves
","Whoever thought Kenneth Branagh, the man who once gave us a 4-hour long 70mm adaptation of Hamlet, would take a stab at a comic-book movie? I've never read a Thor comic in my life, nor have I been exposed to any other Thor material, so walking into this movie was my introduction to the character. As an outsider to this side of the Marvel universe, I have to admit that the opening 20 minutes are very hard to follow. But as soon as Thor is banished from Asgaard and dumped on Earth, things pick up considerably.<br/><br/>There's plenty of fun to be had (in the vein of Crocodile Dundee) as Thor bumbles his way through human life, encountering the underused and sort-of miscast Natalie Portman, the awesome Stellan Skarsgard, and the cute Kat Dennings. But any time the film cuts back to Asgaard it stops dead. The conspiracy involving the Frost Giants was boring and nearly incomprehensible. I'm disappointed that this is the best story they could come up with to carry the movie. It just didn't hook me.<br/><br/>I'm growing tired of comic-book movies, but at least Thor didn't have to go down the old 'origin story' path, it gets a few extra points for that. But I'm afraid the fun of the Earth-bound half of the film is crippled by the dull Asgaard plot.<br/><br/>And the converted 3D is awful too. Stick with the 2D version people, you'll save yourself a headache. It might have been worth it if Kat Dennings got her ample cleavage out, but she doesn't!"

","Thor was one of my two fave comic book characters when I was young, so I looked forward to this movie. I was not disappointed. I have changed over the many years since I bought Thor comics, and the themes this movie set forth are ones I find satisfying. This review will contain spoilers.<br/><br/>Thor is a brash and arrogant young man who gets his whole world into a lot of trouble by breaking a tenuous peace pact it has with a traditional enemy planet. When he boldly insults his father, King Odin, Odin realizes that he must discipline Thor by removing his powers and banishing him. It seems like a one-way ticket to obscurity, but later on Thor's mother gives us the key to the movie: ""(Odin) does everything for a purpose"". In banishing Thor, Odin pronounces an oath over his hammer, saying whoever bears it, if he be worthy, will have the power of Thor.<br/><br/>Many reviewers here have decried the character change in Thor simply over falling in love with Jane Foster. They have misunderstood the script. Thor does not fall in love with Jane until later (and indeed, his falling in love is very muted in the script). Rather, it is his inability to wield the hammer any longer that humbles him. That leads to his heartfelt repentance when his brother Loki shows up and tells him, falsely, that Odin is dead and Thor is permanently banished. Even though Loki was selfishly and cruelly lying, for the first time Thor sees that his actions affect others and his brashness has been destructive. It is directly after that that we see the arrogance gone, replaced by a servant's heart as he brings breakfast to the small crew that works with Jane. The only hint we have of Thor falling in love is his ""thank you, Jane"" to her while she sleeps. Apparently Jane has taught him the blessedness of helping others.<br/><br/>Thor's new character is most prominently on display a bit later, when he offers his own life in order to save the Earth from destruction. I couldn't help but see the Gospel in this, in which Christ sacrificed Himself for us. And as with Christ, Thor is resurrected, for Odin's oath takes effect. Thor has now proved himself worthy of the hammer, and the hammer will no longer be removed from him.<br/><br/>In all, a wonderful plot line and satisfying character development. The themes on display here are very big indeed."
"senshi_nisha","3","2","6","12 September 2011"," Very bad
","I personally would've liked to see an adaptation faithful to the Norse mythology ,but since the movie is based on a comic book( which has a more ""eccentric"" approach on the matter)I could've come to terms with the magical alien stretch had the concept been well executed.Sadly, even the word ""average"" is a height this movie can only dream of.<br/><br/>Story <br/><br/>Heir to a throne is immature and not yet worthy of it.He is stripped of power and privileges and banished.By finding love he rediscovers himself,grows up and becomes worthy of the said throne. <br/><br/>I do not ask for originality every time I watch a movie,especially not from super hero movies ,but when I watch a movie and I can predict everything that will happen, including the characters' lines ,then something is wrong with that movie. And this is exactly the case with Thor.There was no suspense in this movie,nothing to intrigue me,nothing to stir my emotions. Everything was part of an already known pattern. Another weak point in the plot's fabric is the presence of plot holes and logical inconsistencies ,a not so easy to overlook flaw ,given the fact we're not dealing with one of the most intricate stories ever told. The impression left by the plot is that of a pretext for action scenes and CGI effects.And I also want to note the humor was childish. <br/><br/>Characters <br/><br/>I can define the entire cast in two words:stereotypical and unidimensional. Driven by weak motivations and acting illogical the characters are just some shapeless tools used to make the plot function. The conflicts between them aren't given any depth or scope and the relationships are shallow and undeveloped. <br/><br/>The most eloquent example is the main character,Thor. At the beginning of the movie he is portrayed as being very impulsive,immature,glory seeking,war loving,arrogant,selfish and not so intelligent. Despite all this his father is an inch close to crown him the as the next king of Asgard. I can only wonder how is it possible for someone who has been raised to become a king by a supposedly wise and kind father to act like an immature brat and be so straightforward in his stupidity.And I also have to wonder how the same father seems blind to his son personality and is ready to crown him as king. After being banished Thor's personality changes overnight and the only given explanation is the flaccid romance between him and the mortal Jane.Everything that happens between the two seems forced,existing only for the sake of having a love story which also only exists for the sake of explaining Thor's metamorphosis. And the bad acting doesn't help him at all.All his lines are said in a cheesy yet emotionless and linear manner.And I would've liked to see a more menacing,a more imposing God of Thunder,not some puppy-eyed guy with some overworked abs and pectorals.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman shouldn't have been chosen to play Jane's role.She simply doesn't fit in this movie and I can't buy her character. The rest of the characters from the Earth side are useless and play no part in the plot. Thor's friends doesn't seem to have thoughts of their own.They're simply an extension of the main character,only being there to approve and support him. However there's one aspect of the movie I liked.Loki.Tom Hiddleston fits the role very well and his character shows some emotions and some neuronal activity although is still lacking in character development.<br/><br/>Special Effects <br/><br/>I'm sure this was supposed to be the movie's selling point but in my opinion not even the special effects can save this movie. The colors were nauseating ,the Asgard Kingdom seemed like a bunch of enormous buildings thrown together only for the sake of size,disregarding any sense of order and harmony. The costumes looked fake.The fight scenes were boring and lacked any kind of choreography.<br/><br/>Soundtrack <br/><br/>Almost non-existent.I can hardly remember it.<br/><br/>Overall <br/><br/>Thor,or when you sacrifice plot and character development for special effects and action scenes but you fail even at these."
"namialamri","7","2","6","23 June 2011"," just a really awful movie
","aside from the childish plot, the movie was also poorly shot and directed... ""Assguard"" was a kingdom with about 7 people...<br/><br/>the big names on the cover (Portman and Hopkins) did not have major roles to begin with... actually the only reason i attended this movie is Natalie Portman, she just won an Oscar last year, i thought she can be picky now but sadly her choice was just as bad as Hilary Swanks post Oscar choice of Freedom Writers... the earth part of the movie was comedy and the Asgard part was Action... tough combination to mix and this movie failed in that as well... <br/><br/>not worth the time to watch."
"LazySod","6","2","6","10 May 2011"," More shallow than it should be
","The Gods are crazy. Norse Gods even more so. After long raging battles they rest in Asgard, keeping an eye on the worlds so that they might intervene when necessary. But not all is well, first there is the arrogant son of the King that lusts for power, second there is the constant threat of an ancient enemy.<br/><br/>And so starts the story of Thor, a young brash member of a tight group of Gods that is about to meet its newest challenge. Playing partly in Asgard, partly on Earth this film hits solid gold when reviewed as a graphical feast - the depiction of Asgard is great and would make even the largest creatures feel humble and small. The effects all through the film are quite well too.<br/><br/>But then there is the story. The fact that is biased around Thor is one thing (he is the title character after all) but insulting many of the other players by allowing them little to no screen time is unnecessary. Given the length of the film the makers obviously had no problem making a film longer than average, and an extra 15 to 30 minutes would have solved many of the thin backgrounds to the supporting crew quite decently. It's a shame really for now it's nothing more than popcorn amusement and eye candy.<br/><br/>6 out of 10 bored Gods"
"bigcheeze8","6","2","6","8 May 2011"," The action scenes were cool but nothing special
","I am not a comic book type of person so that is not what i will be talking about. What was good about this movie was everything that did not take place on earth. The battle scene excited me, got me interested. The visual effects that went into making Asgard look real were flawless. My problem with this movie is everything on Earth. Once Thor landed on earth it stopped being and epic tale of the god of thunder to a romantic comedy. On earth he falls in love and she changes his ways in two days. That does not sound like any good action movie. Next was the so called humor. All the jokes were Seth Rogen-esq. By that i mean they were normal statements said at inappropriate times. All the jokes were forced and unfunny. All the film makers accomplished while trying to make a movie that had a little bit of every genre in was show that one movie and be a bad action, romance, and comedy movie all in one"
"thesar-2","3","2","6","8 May 2011"," Slightly Above Thorrible
","Hammer time will have to wait for The Avengers movie.<br/><br/>This feature length version of Thor and his origins was only marginally better than Marvel's Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, Spider-Man 3 and Daredevil. That's not saying much when you factor in the better Marvel films: Spider-Man 1-2, Iron Man 1-2, X-Men 1, 2, 3 and X-Men Origins: Wolverine, Fantastic Four 1, Hulk and Incredible Hulk and Blade 1, 2, 3. Hmmm. Of the 18 Marvel movies (including Thor) I mentioned, that means, Thor ranks as 15/18.<br/><br/>That's not good. Nevertheless, if you're slightly curious, or like CGI-laced movies a lot more than I do, check it out. I wouldn't waste the extra fee for 3D or IMAX, like I did unfortunately, but it's harmless comic-book entertainment. And be forewarned: DO NOT STAY THROUGH THE CREDITS for that extra teaser they've been known to get people hyped for The Avengers movie. At the end of this review, I will SPOIL IT to save you the extra time. Heck, the movie's too darned long anyways.<br/><br/>The movie immediately begins with Academy Award Winner Natalie Portman as Jane Foster who's studying with her colleagues in the New Mexican desert and inadvertently runs into banished Thor (a gorgeous Chris Hemsworth – one of the few pluses of the movie). But wait! How did he get dropped into the desert?<br/><br/>Well, thanks for asking. Over the next 45 minutes or so, you'll learn the background story of Thor, his King Daddy Odin (Anthony Hopkins) and his oh-so-mysterious brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston – one of the many negatives of the movie.) They run the realm of the good guys, and they don't like the ice baddies who want to make everything and everywhere cold. Their leader must've lived in Phoenix, AZ at one point and for that, we will take their side.<br/><br/>The story appears on the surface as kind of complicated, but deeper, it's almost as basic as can be. Thor leads his misfit friends after the ice giants and thus gets banished to Earth – full circle – and now we're back to Academy Award Winner Natalie Portman and her interest in alternative universes and of course, hunk of a man Thor, himself. He, however, is battling everyone to get his precious star-laced Hammer back. Unfortunately, he must learn to be humble to get it back..blah blah blahI never bought his transformation, I just wish there were more of super-powered Thor and the not ""Oh, can't we all get along"" idiot they put on the screen.<br/><br/>The performances were okay. One in six jokes worked. The graphics were decent – MUCH better than 2010's Clash of the Titans. The only thing I looked forward to, aside from seeing the breathtaking Chris Hemsworth on screen, was the never-ending The Avengers/S.H.I.E.L.D./other superheroes either seen or mentioned. There were a lot, but it was welcomed as I was more interested in the ""coming attractions"" and less involved with the actual film I was watching.<br/><br/>Again, recommended for the curious, and not recommended for those few that are, to stay through the final credits.<br/><br/>(And as promised, SPOILER, here's what you'll see after the seemingly 15-minutes of credits one of the scientists, Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) who worked with Academy Award Winner Natalie Portman's Jane is invited into an underground bunker to meet with, yep, you guessed it: Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) again. Nicky wants to use this power cube, but doesn't understand it and Erik is mucho curious about it untilwe find out he's Thor's evil brother Loki in disguise. Yawn. NOT WORTH IT. Couldn't you have shown Thor VS. (or at least, meets) Hulk? Or even Iron Man (in the suit) going at Thor? Sorry, I love Samuel L. Jackson as much as the next human, but enough. Give us something we haven't seen.)<br/><br/>Oh, and by the way, I hope someone had noticed the ""Academy Award Winner Natalie Portman"" as sarcasm. And that's another discussion"
"squiboda","3","2","6","7 May 2011"," Boring
","I dozed off a few times during this film. It was incredibly formulaic and had nothing interesting to offer. Blah!<br/><br/>It was pretty and all, but the story was very uninteresting.<br/><br/>This is obviously a case of Hollywood trying to capitalize on the Marvel Comics franchise with no intention of actually making a movie worth seeing.<br/><br/>I felt that I wasted my time and money on this film. I guess I didn't expect anything different, but it was still disappointing to be proved correct.<br/><br/>Do not bother with this film."
"rollinhay","7","2","6","3 May 2011"," Grandiose action meets simplified theme
","Epic action, glorious 3D and Chris Helmsworth's rapturous good looks make for a gratifying but hardly epiphanic outing for the first God in a crowded superhero genre. Thor is a good action movie. The battles are grandiose and the pace and intensity of action never flags. Ashley Miller's screenplay is family friendly and the characters are as cookie- cutter as they come, with the possible exception of Loki (Tom Hiddleston). The special effects are cool and the different planets sufficiently spectacular.<br/><br/>That said, Thor's kaleidoscopic production values could have done better with a less monochromatic storyline, and more believable acting. Despite his highs and pitfalls, Thor's character remains too much of a knight in shining armor. Perhaps a little more fallibility could have made the character more endearing. <br/><br/>In short, Thor is an entertaining action-packed spectacle, but disappointing if you expect anything more."
"Kungloa","9","2","6","28 April 2011"," The God Of Thunder.
","So I saw Thor yesterday. And I liked it, quite a bit. First things first, casting Anthony Hopkins as Odin was a stroke of genius. His voice alone could be considered his most powerful tool in his portrayal as the All-Father. His presence also instills a certain serious tone, which is just what this movie needed, it being about a comic-book superhero who happens to be based on the Norse God of thunder.<br/><br/>Chris Hemsworth is another example of good casting.<br/><br/>I've always preferred somewhat unknown actors in larger roles, it gives the actor the opportunity to boost his career and the director more creative freedom. Hemsworth does a marvelous job. Aside from his physique he carries himself with just the right amount of charm, pride and vigor to make Thor a lovable character.<br/><br/>The action sequences are amazing and breathtaking to say the least. I can't even remember half of what happened during those scenes, I just remember that my popcorn was running really low really fast. It's certainly a feast for the eyes.<br/><br/>Which brings us to the story. The story is quite straight-forward, aside from it happening in the realm of Asgard. An arrogant and young Thor is stripped of his powers by his father in order for him to learn the value of his life and life in general before he can take his father's place. There is more going on, but I would rather not spoil it.<br/><br/>So in short, Thor is the perfect start for the summer season. A light fast-paced character-driven comic-book movie, upholding the old notion that we have to learn the lesson, of not knowing all the answers."

","The Great and Mighty Thor falls from Odin's grace in this mythical adventure in the MCU.<br/><br/>It's the first time we are introduced to otherworldly concepts and types of transportation such as the Bifrost in the MCU. Chris Hemsworth, in my opinion, is the perfect Thor. He plays the role so well and also looks the part beautifully. For me, this is the second weakest of the entry-level MCU movies.<br/><br/>It's a great story and really explains Thor's character development, which is truly important for his future in the MCU, but it just isn't extremely strong in terms of story. I think the other biggest downfall is the town that they are in, I read that the town was created for the movie and it honestly looks like it. I know that's a petty thing, but it just really sticks out to me. I also feel like Thor's progression from this crass & arrogant person to a noble and gallant person was super fast! I mean literally in the matter of a few days he realizes his years of folly? I suppose the argument could be made that as a ""God"" he can see it and adjust quicker.<br/><br/>Either way, I still love the film and would watch it again."

","Thor (2011)
Marvel Cinematic Universe #4
Director: Kenneth Branagh<br/><br/>I am going to go straight into my verdict for this one: I love this movie. There are no doubts about this at all in my mind. I absolutely love it.<br/><br/>Recently, it has been said that one of the best Marvel movies to date is Thor: Ragnorok. Now I have yet to see this movie, but it is true that my desire to watch these movies again came about as a result of seeing stills of some of the art direction, and truth be told they blew me away. But I do not want to jump into the more recent movies without fully catching up with the rest of the franchise.<br/><br/>Now the reason I brought up Ragnorok is because it has come to my attention that it has delighted many fans because it is laugh out loud funny. Like, rioutously so. This in itself does not surprise me. The issue I have is that it appears to have taken many people aback.<br/><br/>How? Because before tonight, my very memories of Thor and Thor: The Dark World are highly positive, because they were to my mind absolutely hilarious! After the snarky and fairly serious Iron Movies, and the rather humourless and safe The Incredible Hulk, the first Thor movie came out and left me laughing hysterically. Which for a certain amount of its initial runtime, is an aspect I did not see coming.<br/><br/>Initially starting in the other dimensional world of Asgard, the apparent source of all Norse mythology, we are treated to a visual feast for the eyes. With a strong fantasy element, director Kenneth Branagh (responsible for one of my all time favourite movies, the very underrated 1994 Robert De Niro lead Frankenstein), weaves a rather wondrous tale of royal intrigue and treachery, a simple it seems story of two brothers fighting for the approval of their father. It is perfect, and endearingly basic, fantasy fare, as we follow two princes who desire to work hard to defend the kingdom for honour, but most importantly to try and make for themselves a lasting reputation, to live up to the legends that preceded them.<br/><br/>It is visually stunning too. Reminding me of the underrated Ridley Scott epic Legend. Also, the visuals are striking and more than stand up to the likes of Peter Jackson's Middle Earth movies, the finest Harry Potter films and even some of the more fantastical visual elements of the Pirates Of The Caribbean movies. But the tone at first is serious, almost as if someone had tried to turn a Saturday morning serial cartoon from the 80s into a larger than life Shakespearean drama. Which, lets not kid ourselves, is not largely off the mark. Kenneth Branagh is also responsible for masterful adaptations of Henry V (1989) and Hamlet (1996), and Thor was of course a beloved cartoon. Based on his prior work in the directors chair, Branagh may not have made sense initially as the ideal choice for one of the MCU's more difficult characters, but he works movie magic here.<br/><br/>After the first three movies, the change of pace from contemporary superhero action movie to alternate universe fantasy does appear to be jarring. But once, for reasons I won't go into, Thor lands on planet earth (in an isolated New Mexico town of all places), the film changes tone and becomes a literal laugh a minute ride. We have a God, a powerful being, thrown into a world which views him as a madman.<br/><br/>And it is great!<br/><br/>The ever beautiful Natalie Portman plays love interest Jane Foster in a whimsical and adorable manner. It is inevitable that looking like Chris Hemsworth, Thor would be a major magnet for the ladies. And yet it's still really sweet to watch our strong, independent and serious minded scientist fall so in love with this strange handsome, otherworldly or completely delusional beefcake. What has always surprised me, and I find this a charming and adequate comparison, is how similar this blooming little romance reminds me of Disney's similarly themed fairy tale parody Enchanted. In that movie, repressed and overworked Patrick Dempsey is living a humdrum existence, working hard and striving to make ends meet and balance it with a private life. A bit like the real world really. One dull day, while feeling snowed under and dissatisfied with his current situation and future outlook, out of nowhere, a strange woman emerges babbling amusingly about her princess ways and her old talking animal friends, the trees she'd sleep in, knights in shining armour only to then, in the best Hollywood fashion, stop caring about what is normal to just give in to the unashamed romance of the situation. When the woman in question is played so endearingly whacky by none other than Any Adams, it is easy to see why!<br/><br/>Here, we have the big budget superhero equivalent. It works wonderfully! We have an out of this world comedy, complete with old fashioned romance, spectacular special effects, and for once, a small scale final battle in which the hero isn't striving to save an entire planet, but just his few friends and the small town they live in. This really is a fun movie. And I haven't even covered all the positives!<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins as Odin, Tom Hiddleston as Loki (I have avoided reviewing his outstanding performance as the greatest villian so far in the franchise because, let us be honest, we have talked this to death for years already), Stellan Skarsgård, Idris Elba, Kat Dennings (yes, I love her and find her hilarious), the fun with the hammer, the rainbow bridge, the hilarious scenes where various men try too, King Arthur style, pick up the hammer...The way we have a giant killing machine emerge from the sky only to initially be dismissed as one of Starks creations... Thor is a TERRIFIC action comedy masterpiece! After a rather inconsistent start with three movies of varying quality, Thor blew me away with its old fashioned charm, it's wild sense of humour, a flawless cast and a stunning collision of two completely different worlds. It also amazingly builds onto the first three movies, offering us more insight into the inner workings of the mysterious S.H.I.E.L.D., opening up the franchise to include far more than just earth bound heroes, and a real sense of universal grandeur. It is exciting, perfectly paced (the first MCU movie to not drag at all), and for all my discussion of the tonal changes, it balances serious themes in a responsible and forward thinking way for the franchise. And keeping the earth bound action on a small scale allows the franchise a little breathing space to find its feet. To hear of the entire events surrounding this New Mexico town referred to as apparent rumour or hearsay as suggested in the post-credits scene (no spoilers, but the best one yet!), helps to ground this franchise in something closer to our perception of this world. Not every game changing event is covered by our media, we live in dark times full of fear and rumour regarding the goings on in other countries. Should it be surprising that in a world of superheroes, sometimes the biggest changes and developments can also emerge on a far smaller scale?<br/><br/>I could write a million words here in praise of this fantastic movie, but I won't. It has I am sure been covered many times before, which is why I tried to highlight some of my favourite elements of this movie that I do not often see covered.<br/><br/>After a rather mixed bag of movies, the fourth entry in the MCU arrives at just the right time, and it only entices me to further explore this still ever growing cinematic universe.<br/><br/>9/10"
"domtaylor","5","1","2","12 July 2018"," Keep the camera straight, Kenneth.
","Kenneth Branagh is a good director, but the acclaimed thespian probably wasn't the best choice to direct Marvel's 'Thor'. His choice to have almost every single shot on a canted angle is extremely annoying and it gives the film a monotonous feeling. If every shot is tilted, none of them are. The bland screenplay and characters don't help either, as they are the thing that really makes this film boring. The attempts at humour fall flat, yet the film is unintentionally funny on several occasions due to how some serious moments are over-done to the point of feeling parody-like. Saying that, the film isn't terrible; there are some enjoyable action sequences, the score by Patrick Doyle is pretty catchy and the overall message of the film is a good one, even if it is a bit poorly handled. 5/10"

","The First Thor is very uneven interns of quality, and it acts as an okay continuation of the Marvel Universe. It being uneven due to the fact that every scene that takes place on Asgard just slows the movie down and is slightly boring. With the exception being Heimdal who's a great character. When the movie is at it's best Thor is depowered on earth. The scenes on earth are smartly funny and are interrupted by uninteresting scenes on Asgard. Chris Hemsworth plays Thor really well and delivers some good comedy that the movie should've capitalized on more. The rest of the cast is just fine. There's not much to be said about their performances. In terms of action there's only one good action scene. It involves Thor trying to get his hammer back from Shield, and its very well done. You get the sense that even without powers Thor is still a tough opponent. The rest of the action is just generic and fails to exhilarate. With the Final Act being the clearest example of that. Overall, Thor is an okay movie with exceptional comedy that makes it worth seeing. So I give it a 6.5"
"alexanderdavies-99382","8","1","2","2 July 2017"," Above average.
","I was quite surprised at how effective this ""Marvel Comics"" superhero move is. ""Thor"" works because it keep the plot quite simple and therefore, avoiding any unnecessary subplots. The story goes something like this: The Mighty Thor is banished from his own world by his viking father (Anthony Hopkins) and is sent to the modern day world. Upon Thor's arrival, his trademark hammer has been embedded into the ground and no one but Thor can retrieve it. Thor befriends a group of archeologists who have been excavating in the same area where the hammer lays. There is a strong feeling of vulnerability about Thor. For all his bravery and fighting skills, he is rather overwhelmed and bemused by his surroundings. The man cast as the superhero is OK but no actor. Anthony Hopkins does well as Thor's father Odin. The rest of the cast are tolerable. I enjoy this film more than I thought I would."

After finally seeing I have to say this was a good movie. It spent more time developing the villain then the previous 2 movies (which was important given the significance of the character in coming films). The actors were all at their best (everyone had a likable personality good guy or bad guy) The movie featured good fights... some awesome visual, like- able characters and a good set up for the Avengers movies (Iron Man was OK, The Incredible Hulk...

","The closest I've ever got to Odin & Thor is through The Vikings; this was slightly different fare to that classic. I didn't expect much from this but got lots which surprised me – it's the usual Marvel superhero cgi cartoon movie, but taken at a cracking pace, shaved of gristle and utterly daft. Quite good in fact, although I was warned by a few friendly movie experts it was naff – however I always bear in mind none of those particular experts have ever seen or intend to see Citizen Kane.<br/><br/>Hammer wielding impetuous youth Thor is thrown out of celestial Asgard by his all powerful father Odin, crashing to Earth, while his brother Loki machinates for overall control by apparently siding with the grunting red-eyed baddies from the Dark Side. Time is saved not only by accepting the universality of the English language but that standard plot devices involving falling in love, straightforward fight scenes, and metaphorical battles between Good and Evil are implicitly consented to as well. So many things are simply assumed that it gets a bit confused at times, and any characterisation is completely jettisoned as not worth the time – and in kids movies like this it isn't worth the time. The cartoonery is swift and relentless but atmospheric and not as senseless as other similar efforts, such as Man Of Steel for example. The contrast between the serious ethereal world and the flippant real world is cleverly handled, almost impressive and reminded me of The Fountain in its doom-laden commentary. Different story strands all come together satisfactorily, whilst Thor or is it Brad Pitt lopes about suitably heroically. A nice one excellent in its inconsequentiality and well worth watching – Gary Son Of Jan has so decreed."

","Open up the heavens and let the thunder come, because Thor will unleash his wrath upon the planets and the galaxy. I really wasn't supposed to see this movie, but I'm glad I did because it was pretty awesome. I actually learned something: don't mess with the god of thunder. Chris Hemsworth played the title role beautifully, Natalie Portman, she's great in any movie, but the wonderful Sir Anthony Hopkins – no one can compare to him, he is a god among men.<br/><br/>Kenneth Branagh, 9 years ago played Professor Lockhart in Harry Potter & The Chamber of Secrets, did an excellent in the director's chair of Thor. I don't know what else to say about this movie, but it was really good and I was on the edge of my seat waiting for thunder to strike. As they say, thunder strikes twice in the same place."

","Thor (Chris Hemsworth), arrogant son of Odin (Anthony Hopkins), is stripped of his powers and banished from Asgard for disobeying his father's orders (by fighting the frost giants of Jotunheim). Landing on Midgard (or Earth, as we call it), he meets a group of scientists, falls in love with Natalie Portman, learns some humility, and defends the human race against a deadly foe, before finally returning to Asgard to face off against his deceitful brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), who has since laid claim to their father's throne.<br/><br/>I'm finally getting around to watching the standalone superhero films that paved the way for The Avengers, and I've got to say that, so far, I have much preferred the characters in their individual movies than when working as a team; this one is no exception. Thor was directed by Kenneth Branagh, which originally concerned me since he hasn't really had much experience with big budget blockbusters, but I'm happy to say that Ken did a great job, handling the material intelligently, delivering a film that gets the balance just right between drama and spectacular action.<br/><br/>Hemsworth—a relative unknown before being picked to play Thor—is excellent as the hammer swinging God of Thunder, a strapping fellow who not only looks the part, but who also gives a fine central performance. Hopkins is, unsurprisingly, great as Odin, Hiddleston is suitably loathsome as the boo-hiss villain, but Portman is required to do little other than look pretty."

","Growing up, I was a huge Thor fan. It was my favorite comic book. I never came across anybody else who liked it that much though. Over the years as more comic movies started being made, I held out hope maybe one day Thor would be brought to the big screen in a respectable movie. Finally that happened with Kenneth Branagh's Thor. This is an excellent movie with drama, romance, humor, and action. It's quite simply one of the best Marvel has put out so far and a personal favorite of mine. For comic fans, yes they change a few things but they keep the heart of the story and characters intact. As one lifelong Thor fan, I have no complaints. He's a character many said for years would be impossible to sell a movie about. But those people have been proved wrong. There's not much else I can add except to echo the sentiments of many other reviewers that the cast is great, the special effects are solid, and the story is smart and fun."
"diac228","7","1","2","8 November 2013"," The decent origin story of the black sheep of the Avengers
","Thor is the oddball in the Pre-Avengers movies simply because it concerns a character that is quite literally out of this world. That would mean that the origin story of this superhero would require more time, a heavier budget, and more emphasis on making him likable. There was a tougher task at hand: mixing in all the fantasy elements with the literal-down-to-earth elements and giving it the proper balance.<br/><br/>For this main reason, Thor becomes very unbalanced as a script and as an overall film. When a movie looks like sci-fi Lord of the Rings on some scenes, and thennormal for the others it can become quite jarring. And for the majority of the movie it took a while for Thor to find its footing. Luckily once we get to the third act the movie does indeed take off.<br/><br/>We do not have the best script in the world telling the story of Thor, but bad scripts can almost always be saved by good acting. And with the help of Tom Hiddleston, Natalie Portman (Who had the worst lines of all), Anthony Hopkins, and our lead star Chris Hemsworth, Thor survives past the clichés, past the slow middle act, and survives the sometimes-crummy dialogue.<br/><br/>The action also paces like the script, plenty at first, minimal in the middle act, and plenty in the final moments. Even though the direction was a bit muddy (Kenneth Branagh's random career still hasn't given him the ability to helm big budget projects) he still delivers when the emotion is ramped up (which happens more than you may assume in a comic book movie).<br/><br/>Thor's saving grace was the final waning moments starting from when Thor really gets to shine right up until the end, which was actually devoid of your usual blockbuster clichés. By the time we get to the end we are treated with a nice final action sequence, a few surprises, the emergence of a now-notorious villain (Now complete with a massive online following), and a great ending that doesn't wrap the production nicely, but sets the tone for things to come.<br/><br/>As an origin story, Thor could have been a lot worse, could have been better, but considering having to follow up to the likes of Iron Man---this movie does just fine."
"alexxchiodo","9","1","2","6 November 2013"," Thor: The God Among Us
","I really enjoyed watching 'Thor' and thought it was an appealing film. I can't think of anybody better to have played Thor than Chris Hemsworth, I truly thought he fitted the role perfectly. In addition, Tom Hiddleston's performance as Loki was outstanding and I just love Natalie Portman, so the movie was quite compelling right from the beginning for me. <br/><br/>Firstly, I really appreciated that Loki wasn't the antagonist throughout the whole film. His character was particularly relatable because his underlying motives were to prove himself worthy to his father whilst Thor was receiving all the attention. Despite Thor's arrogant, reckless nature at the beginning of the film, Loki still ventured with him to Jotunhelm, exemplifying their reputable relationship with one another. Their relationship really is similar and relatable to anyone who has a brother, just theirs is in the context of being Gods who live in another dimension, but the message is still noticeable regardless of the circumstances.<br/><br/>I thought the humour was embedded nicely and it didn't feel as if it was forced, which gave the film an appreciated light-heartened feel at times. In addition, when Thor was first banished from Asgard and arrived on Earth, it was so amusing to watch him adapt to the culture on Earth and that by the end of the film it was really evident that his character had grown and became more dignified.<br/><br/>From a more critical perspective, I really wanted to see more action/fighting scenes with Thor. Primarily I'm satisfied with the balance between the amount of action to dialogue in the film, but the fact that Thor is just so powerful sees the demise of his opponents too quickly. For example, at the beginning when Loki, Thor and his companions travel to Jotunhelm to confront King Laufey, Thor kills that humungous troll monster in one hit by merely flying though his mouth. I was expecting an intense, epic battle, not just a one hit kill. Furthermore, when Thor regains his powers on Earth and protects everyone from The Destroyer, he takes about 30 seconds to kill him. I know it's all meant to portray how dominant, powerful and strong Thor is, but come on, the battle scenes could have lasted a little longer. Nonetheless, it was still a very fulfilling scene to watch Thor dominate his opponents. <br/><br/>In essence, I enjoyed watching this movie a lot. I thought the characters were flawless and the development within the characters themselves, mainly Thor, was very satisfying to see. The humour was embedded well and didn't seem forced, which I enjoyed, and I really appreciated that they didn't portray Loki as some heartless, pitiless antagonist. There was a considerable amount of time watching his character develop and because of this you felt some sympathy in the end for him, well, at least I did and I genuinely appreciated this. In so many films the 'bad guy' is always portrayed as someone so evil the viewer just wants him dead, and I'm truly glad that Loki was different. Despite the unfortunately short action scenes, there is still a good ratio of action to dialogue within the film and I cannot wait to watch the sequel 'Thor: The Dark World'."
"GTeixeira","7","1","2","11 August 2013"," Strangely Shakespearean superhero film; a bit rushed, but enjoyable
","'Thor' follows its eponymous protagonist, the Norse god of thunder, banished to Earth to learn humility, as his brash and arrogant attitudes provoke a war. Meanwhile, his brother Loki takes his chance to seize the Asgardian throne.<br/><br/>Part of Marvel's attempt to create a cinematic superhero universe (the Avengers franchise), 'Thor' stands apart as the most outworldly of the bunch despite its basic banishment and redemption plot. I did not know much of the superhero beforehand, but I know a lot of Norse mythology and I felt Marvel's attempt to recreate it within a real world to be very good. The visuals of Asgard (and Jotunheim) are stunning and truly worthy of gods, whereas the effects involved in the Bifrost scenes are also wonderful.<br/><br/>Kenneth Branagh, mostly known for his Shakespeare adaptations ('Henry V', 'Hamlet'), is quite an odd directorial choice. He brings a distinct Shakespearean feeling to this film: the Asgardian world has a distinct medieval structure, with Odin (Anthony Hopkins) in special evoking quite a lot the kings of old. Many other developments within the film reminds of 'King Lear', 'Henry V' and other Shakespeare's works, plus a very old-fashioned dialogue.<br/><br/>The cast is partially good. Anthony Hopkins, as Odin, is capable of transmitting the regal wisdom and imperative power of his character. Chris Hemsworth is well cast as Thor as far as looks are concerned, and manages to convey well the god's personality. Tom Hiddleston shines as Loki, a delightfully machiavellian villain, and gives quite a powerful performance as the film's most complex character (surprisingly so for a superhero film). The other Asgardian characters, in special Heimdall (a controversial Idris Elba), are also very good. <br/><br/>On the other hand, the film faces quite a bit of problem with the Earth setting. Not only is this part of the film very dull when compared to the Asgard one, the redemption part of the story is quite rushed with Thor somehow relearning his values far too fast to be believable. The rather weak performances from the human cast (Natalie Portman in particular is very bad, but Stellan Skarsgard and Kat Dennings don't shine either) only makes the situation worse. There are some tries at humor, which doesn't work always, and some rather good action sequences.<br/><br/>The film is mostly successful thanks to the stunning Asgard portion of the story (8/10), but it suffers from the rather poor earthly development (5/10). Overall, still quite a fun superhero film."

"Zazwaz","7","1","2","1 June 2013"," One of Marvel's best
","First off I was never aware Marvel had made a comic out of the Norse mythology, and after doing some research into the franchise I learned why. Suffice it to say ""The Mighty Thor"" is not one of their best characters. <br/><br/>The film is about a race of aliens living on the planet Asgard, who have a history of war with the so called Ice Giants from a nearby planet. Odin, the king of the Asgard who defeated the Ice Giants is dying and his son Thor is set to replace him. However, as Thor is about to become king, a group of Ice Giants infiltrates Asgard in order to steal some weapon or other. Odin stops them, but Thor wants revenge and goes to the Ice Giant's home world to challenge them. The resulting confrontation almost unleashes another war between the planets, but Thor's father intervenes just in time. As punishment for almost starting a war Thor is banished to Earth, where he has to live among humans as a mortal.<br/><br/>If you know a thing or two about Norse mythology you will of course recognize a lot of the themes in this film. King Odin, the Halls of Asgard and of course the thunder-god Thor with his hammer, which also has a prominent presence in the film. While this all sounds rather cheap, far fetched and ridiculous, the writing is surprisingly good. The dialogue is strong and the mix of humor and tension is executed nicely. Most of the characters are strong, albeit only the main ones. The side parts, such as Thor's team of warriors, would have more personality if they were replaced by cardboard cut-outs.<br/><br/>The acting is also, frankly, quite superb. Chris Hemsworth plays the part of the arrogant warrior prince very convincingly, Natalie Portman is great as the love interest and Anthony Hopkins is as good as ever in his role as Odin. However Tom Hiddleston, who plays Thor's evil brother Loki, really steals the show in my opinion. He is given a well developed character to work with and he does it very well.<br/><br/>I was surprised to hear that Kenneth Branagh was directing. Needless to say he did a good job. Being a super hero movie most of it is action, but there are enough quiet scenes to give us a rest from all the running around and screaming and these are also handled very well. The art direction is superb, there are glorious alien vista's and incredible special effects, even if everything is CGI.<br/><br/>To me Thor was a surprising film. The first half hour or so, with all this stuff about Asgard and all the fancy visual effects and not much proper story I found myself thinking that I was watching a cheap, no brains, action movie with no real depth. Just as I started to think that the film seemed to spin 180 degrees and turn into what I now see as a surprisingly good feature. With an all star cast, stunning visuals and good story telling, Thor is definitely one of Marvel's best."
"Bruce722","9","1","2","29 May 2013"," Great film.
","Like the rest of the Avengers films, this movie was fantastic. I thought Chris Hemsworth did a great job in his portrayal of Thor and the rest of the cast was great. Natalie Portman is as breathtaking as ever and the rest of the supporting cast adds a combination of depth and humor. The action sequences were done great and I loved how well this film tied in with the others in the universe. The little nods towards Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk were subtle yet really well played. I thought Loki's motives were a little shaky, especially considering that it's the entire foundation of the movie. Nonetheless, the rest of the plot develops really nicely and the film gets a bit of everything from action to drama to romance to suspense. If you can suspend your disbelief enough to accept the premise of the film, I think this movie is very entertaining and enjoyable."

","One of my favorite comic book characters, I never expected anyone to make a movie about Thor that was any good. Casting Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston made all the difference. Seeing the trailers, I didn't think they really looked the part. Chris especially seems small compared to what I would envision. But both are extremely enjoyable to watch as Thor and Loki, and I liked a lot of the other Asgardians as well. The frost giants looked great, the rainbow bridge was cool, and the fight with the Destroyer was fun. On top of that, the three scientists that find Thor are all good characters. I like the arc they set up for Thor in this movie. It came as a surprise after reading comics for so many years where Thor was already noble and mature. Making him start out as a short-sighted brat was a good idea. He has to earn the right to be the son of Odin again by be willing to sacrifice himself to save earth. When we see him in the Avengers movie and he talks about how he enjoyed battle when he was younger, it gives the character even more resonance. I am looking forward to part two, because this movie and the Avengers were a lot of fun."

They aren't sure what to do with him and as they get to know him, they find that there is more to him than what meets the eye. Meanwhile back home, his father has fallen into a sort of coma and his brother is now the ruler. And not a very good one at that. Chris Hemsworth does a great job in the lead role as does Anthony Hopkins as Odin and Tom Hiddleston as Loki. The movie felt refreshing and although a bit cheesy, it was entertaining. Not as good as ""Iron Man"" and ""Captain America: The First Avenger"", but not bad."

Now, I do not like to call critics out especially Roger Ebert since he is my favorite. But, I have no idea why he was so outspoken against this film.

This part of the movie is comic genius. Of course it ends and the movie goes back to being a little above mediocre super hero flick but for awhile there it broke my expectations in a good way. In fact, its a shame that other parts of this movie were not done better. With a more inspired script, bad guy, acting, etc...this could have been a fun winner like Iron Man.

All the main issues touched have been scrutinized in so many movies, that Thor became just another ""sparrow on the line""...<br/><br/>Of course, as the budget was high, the donors and lenders seemed to want to act for certain: different races, genders and ages were carefully picked.

"dee.reid","8","1","2","21 May 2012"," So this is why that girl from ""Adventures in Babysitting"" (1987) loved Thor so much?
","If you've seen the popular 1987 comedy ""Adventures in Babysitting,"" then you don't need to know what the title of that comment means. But I'm going to tell you anyway: I have to give the little girl in that movie some credit because she's got some original tastes - rather than idolizing something obvious like Batman or Spider-Man or Superman, she chose the lesser-known Marvel Comics superhero Thor.<br/><br/>Thor, or The Mighty Thor, is not one of my favorite superheroes. While I consider myself a Marvel Comics reader more than any other comic book publisher - readers familiar of my reviews will note that I'm an avid Spider-Man fan - Thor is nonetheless an interesting Marvel Comics character to me because he's so different from other comic book superheroes, for one simple fact: he's a god. And not just any god, he's the God of Thunder in Norse mythology - re-interpreted as a comic book superhero. His comic book equals could possibly be Superman (of DC Comics, Marvel Comics' chief rival) or even the Silver Surfer (another popular Marvel Comics superhero) - although astute comic book readers will note that Superman and the Silver Surfer are actually aliens, not gods, but are still quite just as powerful (it'll be interesting to see a fight between the three, though).<br/><br/>Stan Lee, his brother Larry Lieber and the legendary, late, great Jack Kirby were the trio of well-known Marvel Comics personalities who brought Thor to life in 1962, debuting in the issue ""Journey into Mystery #83."" 49 years later, that British thespian/director Kenneth Branagh brought The Mighty Thor to life in his own movie, ""Thor,"" to add the mighty Norse god to the current crop of special effects-laden superhero movies.<br/><br/>For the most part, Branagh succeeds. Marvel's superheroes were always noteworthy for being outsiders, freaks and misfits, so where does The Mighty Thor - a god, remember - fit into that mold? Well, the movie does a good job of representing his origins: the mighty God of Thunder (played by Australian newbie Chris Hemsworth), is exiled from his home-world of Asgard to planet Earth by his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins), in the hopes that his son will learn a lesson in humility. (I'll just go ahead and say that Stan Lee chose his character's flaws rather well: he's one of the first superheroes whose personal dilemma is to learn a lesson and not just any lesson, but a lesson in power and responsibility.) It goes without saying that Thor is arrogant and reckless, nearly bringing Asgard to war with the neighboring realm of the Frost Giants, Jutenheim.<br/><br/>Arriving on Earth stripped of his powers, he must now learn what it truly takes to be a hero and to be responsible for his actions. He's discovered by a trio of scientists in the New Mexico desert - Jane Foster (Natalie Portman, hot off her Oscar-win for ""Black Swan""), Dr. Eric Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard), and Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings) - and they befriend him. It is through his encounters with them that Thor develops a deep fondness and admiration for the human race (in particularly Jane, his would-be love interest) and once he regains his powers - granted to him mostly by the mighty hammer Mjornir - he must eventually combat his traitorous adopted brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), who seeks the throne of Asgard for himself.<br/><br/>I'll say that ""Thor,"" like most blockbuster superhero movies of late, is a breathtaking wall-to-wall action flick. If anything else, this movie also got me interested in learning more about Thor and the world he lives in. Although the movie starts off rather slowly and alternates a lot between Earth and Asgard (thereby creating an unwelcome case of vertigo at times), it keeps your attention throughout. While also not too deep or intelligent as it could be (as it should be), Chris Hemsworth proves to be a capable God of Thunder. Stripped of his abilities and forced to learn that ages-old Marvel adage (""With great power, there must also come great responsibility"") - and also making an unusually quick adjustment to life on Earth (one of the film's key weaknesses, I feel) - only then can he once again become The Mighty Thor!<br/><br/>Newly-minted Oscar-winner Natalie Portman is serviceable as Jane Foster (she did go to Harvard, after all), but I do feel that she is somewhat under-used, as is Stellan Skarsgard, whose Eric Selvig is also quite familiar with the legends of the classic Thor from his childhood. Thor's close friends and fellow Asgardians - his homeboys Volstagg (Ray Stevenson), Hogun (Tadanobu Asano), Fandral (Joshua Dalls), and home-girl Sif (Jaimie Alexander) - also provide Thor with some much-needed back-up on Earth when Loki's forces threaten our planet. And speaking of Loki, I believe that it is Tom Hiddleston who delivers the film's most complex and emotional performance as the son desperate to earn his father's love and respect, even if he has to wipe out all life on two worlds to make it so. So in that regard, he seems like such a worthy opponent to Thor.<br/><br/>I enjoyed ""Thor"" for what it was, a worthy summer blockbuster comic book superhero adaptation. Even if it wasn't as deep or as involving as it could have been, it does serve as a build-up, yet another piece of the puzzle that will eventually lead to 2012's all-out superhero-fest ""The Avengers.""<br/><br/>8/10"
"arginnon","6","1","2","4 May 2012"," The sons of Odin strike
","Thor is a fun, action packed ride, which guides you through this fabulous, Norse myth era of MARVEL comics, hosted by none other, then the one and only Kenneth Branagh. Although we can all agree, that he is a better actor than director, he did a very good job in bringing the script adapted from the comics to life. The best thing about this film is the score. Patrick Doyle is a great musician and he did a marvelous job in scoring Thor. The visuals are stunning, and the cinematography is good too. The actors did their job well, and I have to say, that Chris Hemsworth proved to be the best of the cast.<br/><br/>Now that I listed all the good things, we shall move onto the bad ones: the story is simple and doesn't really hold together, it's like of a not-too-good video game. Frost giants battle the vikings of Asgard, and Odin's son, Thor is banished from the Kingdom, because he was disrespectful with his father (he called him an ""Old man and a fool!""). The Asgardians use this teleport-thing to transport Thor to the Earth where Natalie Portman, Stellan Skarsgard and a second chick hit him with their truck, while admiring a weird storm (it came from the teleport-thing, actually). The second chick is annoying, Skarsgard's character doesn't really have a purpose in the film, he's just there all the time, and the three viking friends of Thor don't really serve a purpose either, they only fight a little. Although I have to admit, the relationship between Thor and Loki is very well written.<br/><br/>I liked that Agent Coulson was in this movie too, and there was a surprising cameo in the film, which I won't ruin for you. All in all, Thor is worth checking out for MARVEL fans, and comic book lovers, because it's a pretty decent adaptation. Not as good as Iron Man though, but it beats the crap out of all the Spidey movies."

While on Earth Thor meets a young scientist (Natalie Portman) who tries to understand where he comes from. I will admit that I've never read a single Thor comic and I'll admit that I find a lot of these comic movies to be rather bland with more action than brains. I really wasn't sure what to expect from this film but I will admit that I was really confused when I learned that someone like Kenneth Branagh was going to be directing. Well, color me shocked to nearly my death because this is actually a pretty solid movie that has some brains, plenty of action, great characters and some wonderful special effects. I was really caught off guard by the screenplay being able to make some interesting characters and this covers everyone from Thor to his father, the scientist, her friends and just about everyone else in the story. It's strange but I found even the smallest of the supporting characters to be people you could connect with and this certainly helped the story. I also thought the performances were extremely well by everyone involved. The arrogance that Hemsworth was able to bring the part was pitch perfect and I thought Portman was fun and believable in her bit. It certainly doesn't hurt when you've got someone like Hopkins giving it his all. Rene Russo is pretty much wasted in her brief role but it was still nice seeing her. I've always said that I'm not a fan of CGI because more often than not it just looks so fake to me that I have a hard time getting caught up in the world it's trying to create. That wasn't the case here because I thought the picture was visually stunning. The opening bit with the space travel looked amazing and I thought the director did a remarkable job at blending the CGI with the story so that it was never distracting. THOR is certainly one of the better comic book adaptations out there."

","Out of all the Marvel superhero movies, this was probably the least likely one to succeed. Not only does it feature a fairly unknown superhero, it also had a pretty unusual cast and crew involved. None of the sings were very promising really but as it turns out, the movie is actually one of the better, modern, superhero flicks out there! <br/><br/>Kenneth Branagh isn't exactly a director who is known for his action- or big budgeted movies. He's a director who is more fond of direction Shakespeare- and Shakespeare type of movies. This approach and style however also proofed to be very effective for this movie. It suits the story, everything that is happening in it and its characters and dialog all very well. <br/><br/>It also doesn't necessarily feature a typical superhero movie cast. For Thor, the unknown Chris Hemsworth got cast, who turned out to be a great choice. As a love interest, it has Natalie Portman, which doesn't sound very likely but then again, she is no usual love interest. It's a very solid character on its own, who just happens to fall for the God of thunder. It's surprising how basically everybody in this movie suits their roles so extremely well. Really, Anthony Hopkins, Stellan Skarsgård, Tom Hiddleston, Kat Dennings, Colm Feore, Idris Elba, Rene Russo, there is not one bad casting choice in this movie, though it all still might sound a bit as an unusual cast list on paper. I would also especially like to mention Tom Hiddleston, who was perfect, in the role of the main villain Loki.<br/><br/>It's a movie in which everything comes together surprisingly well. It's being a great mixture of several elements, such as storytelling and spectacle. It besides manages to find a great balance between the scenes that are taking place on Earth and the ones taking place at Asgard. Both are completely different from each other, with each different 'rules' and visual styles. Yet it all blends in with each other perfectly and the movie feels like one big whole.<br/><br/>It's a surprising spectacular movie, which is also really thanks to its vivid visuals. Asgard looks fantastic and the so do all of the movie its other effects. It's a real special effects heavy movie but the effects often are not necessarily just there to impress but also to help to tell its story and create a wonderful atmosphere for the movie.<br/><br/>Besides, the movie is also being a very classy one. It has some great cinematography and it's obvious that often the emphasis of the filmmakers got put on its actors and their performances and delivery of their lines. It results in often some great dialog and performances by its cast, that help to keep the movie going and great, fun and compelling enough to watch, at all times.<br/><br/>Really not much wrong with this movie and it quite honestly is among the best and also most surprising superhero movies of recent years.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","This movie is all about action, and the writers did a fine job, I have to say, including tons of action in a way that draws your mind away from all your troubles. There is a light love theme, which I feel is very nice, just the right amount. The movie starts out very well, with a slight flash of the future. I was, I admit, a little disappointed that there was only one enemy, but this movie is not just about the ""almighty Thor"" battling enemies, which would have made the movie extremely dumb. As I recall my memories of the movie, for some reason, I don't know where the action was, aside from the battle with Thor and an Iron Giant, and Thor and his friends against the Ice Giants. The way the producers made the show is incredible, squeezing so much action into an hour and fifteen minute film, and make it interesting. This movie is incredibly fast-paced, and some people might have a hard time following it, but I'll give you a hint, this show is a movie that you really have to relax, and not think about anything in order to understand it. Because it's fast-paced, you probably won't remember your questions anyway."

","From the creative mind of Stan Lee who makes his usual Cameo appearance, there arises yet another of his comic book heroes, "" Thor "" the God of Thunder. In this segment, narrated by and starring Anthony Hopkins as Odin, we have the young God Thor ( Chris Hemsworth) learning that being fearless, strong and courageous is not all that is required of the next King of the mystical kingdom of Asgard. Instead he disobeys his father and institutes a new war with the Frost Giants. For this he is banished to Earth to learn some humility and restraint. There he meets Professor Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard, who we last seen in 'Red October'), his wife and Jane Foster. (Natalie Portman) While Thor is gone, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) his half brother usurps the throne and hopes to make Thor's banishment permanent. The entire film, (except for some rather cheesy characters who accompany Thor) is directed (rather well by the way) by Kenneth Branagh, is one incredible and fantastic visit to the Land of Odin. The sets, Costumes and the confrontations with the Frost Giants is nothing short of spectacular and worthy of Stan Lee Himself. Well worth a visit to the Theater and easily recommended. ****"

","I feel that the sequel to this movie is almost destined to flop, if a deal can't be agreed that sees Kenneth Branagh return to direct.<br/><br/>... Initially I thought handing him the job was a mistake, but after judging on the merits of the entire film, I'm confident that I totally understand the choice... Both he and one of his stars (Anthony Hopkins) know how to sell bombastic speeches and make them inspirational rather than hyperbolic. Some people don't understand the intrinsic link between Shakespeare and comic-books (numerous academics have stated that if Shakespeare were alive today, then in their opinion he would be writing serials/soap operas... ) <br/><br/>If they don't get someone in charge who knows how to grace age-old themes with a light touch, then Thor 2 could well sink like a stone... <br/><br/>This is an epic in the truest sense of the word, just with CGI to fill in the story pockets that exist around the basic accomplishment of goals... If the technology had existed to create awe-inspiring sights using machinery, then it's not unreasonable to think that the storytellers of their time would have used them... Good old fashioned grand conflict never changes, though, and Branagh seems to have an instinctive understanding of this principle."
"knowyourmovie","6","1","2","24 January 2012"," A triumph of pure mediocrity
","I have to admit that it is a lot of fun to review bad movies that provide an easy opportunity to sparkle with witty humor, to give vent to your suppressed negative feelings, and to be sarcastic and full of biting irony.<br/><br/>On a rare occasion, it is also quite nice to indulge myself with reviewing a good movie and with reflecting on the multiple thoughts that the movie provokes. It is fun to enjoy praising a visionary director, a talented actor, a moving soundtrack, or some exceptional special effects.<br/><br/>There are movies, however, and ""Thor"" is among them, that are no fun to review, no fun at all. The problem with these movies is that they are average, solidly built popcorn flicks so perfectly mediocre, so utterly derivative, so shamelessly fake, so amazingly shallow, that watching them does not awake any strong emotions or feelings, and does not leave any particular memories or any aftertaste whatsoever.<br/><br/>The story and the dialogs in Thor make the script of ""X-Men: First Class"" look like a Shakespearian play. I cannot help thinking that this is a case when too many cooks spoiled the broth. The story was re- written multiple times: first to lower the movie budget from $300 million to $150 million, then because the change of the director, then for some other obscure reasons. <br/><br/>The directing was ""okay"", although it is hard for me to comprehend why Kenneth Branagh, mostly known for directing Shakespearian dramas, operas, and the other psychologically nuanced movies agreed to work on a film with such a primitive story. The only explanation that I was able to find was that ""Thor"" was among his favorite comic books. Who knew? Oh well, we all have our weird little secrets, I guess <br/><br/>The visual effects definitely suffered from reducing the projected movie budget in half. Sadly, they were quite unoriginal and not even particularly realistic. Sometimes ""Thor"" reminded me a slightly modernized version of these old Japanese ""Godzilla"" movies with the pitiful ""Destroyer"" somewhat clumsily playing the Godzilla part. While I did not expect the special effects to match those of ""Avatar"", or of ""The Lord of the Rings"", it was still disappointing to see such an underwhelming effort in a movie that by definition should have had great special effects as its main strength. <br/><br/>Somewhat surprisingly, a previously little known Chris Hemsworth did not disappoint as the title movie character. While having not demonstrated any particularly strong acting abilities, he was still refreshingly genuine, enthusiastic, and energetic as Thor. <br/><br/>The strongest performance in the movie, of course belongs to Tom Hiddleston, who was quite convincing as Thor's cunning brother Loki. Loki, by the way, was the only movie character that had a little depth in it, as a striking contrast to all the other characters that were so perfectly one-dimensional and so disgustingly primitive. <br/><br/>The primitivism of the characters is the most likely explanation why such talented actors as Natalie Portman and Stellan Skarsgård were so awful in the movie – they just did not have anything substantial to impersonate. Even Sir Anthony Hopkins did not seem to be fully himself, brutally constrained by the outrageously simplistic script.<br/><br/>Personally, I did not feel I gained anything by watching ""Thor"" – a triumph of pure mediocrity. However, if you are excited about ""The Avengers"" hitting theaters in May and are willing to spend some of your free time learning more about the characters involved, watching ""Thor"" might not be a bad idea for you.<br/><br/>knowyourmovie.blogspot.com"
"zereshk","5","1","2","22 January 2012"," Acceptance, if not love, at second sight
","When I first watched this film, I hated every minute of it. The story is full of clichés, the main character is unlikable and the mythological figures are distorted almost to the point of being unrecognizable.<br/><br/>I re-watched the film a while ago after having seen the knockoff ""Almighty Thor"" and it was then that I realized how bad this film could have been but wasn't.<br/><br/>I realized that this film isn't actually that bad. The portrayal of Asgard and its inhabitants - you can call it distorting or you can call it original. Sure, giving the goddess Sif, whose golden hair symbolizes ripe wheat, *dark hair* (that's the colour of mouldy wheat, FYI) isn't exactly a touch of genius. Transforming the god of fire into an ice giant is more than a stretch as well. And the way they presented the giants was just lazy. Why should beings intelligent enough to seriously threaten the gods live in a kind of rubbish dumb surrounded by debris? But on the other hand, Asgard really did look pretty epic. I can't get over the electric rainbow bridge, but other than that it was really beautiful. And most of the gods looked a lot like I had always imagined them, especially Frigg was spot on. Heimdallr being black and Thor having a Japanese friend didn't bother me at all. I mean, why not? Lots of mythologies have gods with animal heads, a different skin colour is ordinary in comparison. Gods don't have to look like the people who believe in them. Asgard having more ethnic diversity than Midgard was strange, but that was a fault of the Midgard arc, not the other one.<br/><br/>The part of the story that took place in Mdgard was what dragged the film down anyway. I didn't care for any of the human characters and I thought Thor became very unlikable as soon as he lost his hammer. Maybe that's a hidden superpower of his weapon. In contrast, I liked Loki a lot... but not in a good way. He didn't come across as a real villain at all. He didn't seem evil and menacing, he just seemed smart, lonely and under-appreciated. My impulse wasn't to be wary but to want to hug him. From what I hear, he'll be the big baddie in the upcoming Avengers movie - he'd better be a little less relateable there because this kind of villain makes the protagonists come across as cruel. I'm used to rooting for the villain but I have rarely felt so sympathetic towards one.<br/><br/>All in all, this actually is an engaging movie, if not a very smart one. It looks good, it is well acted and it has its moments. 5 out of 10 stars."

","While I was as surprised as any Branagh fan, when I heard he would helm a comic book movie, I have to admit, he kept it light and amusing, while still holding onto the threats and delivering a fun character introduction. :o) <br/><br/>Now I can understand, that some people might not like the way this movie is done or are fed up with comic book movies in general. What you cannot say about this movie though, is that it doesn't have a decent enough character or story development. It is cliché, of course, but that does not make it any less decent now does it? It might make it boring for you, of course.<br/><br/>Acting-wise, no one is taking him- or herself too serious. Which is a good thing. I liked everyone in this and didn't feel like the jokes were forced. Of course you could argue about political correctness (Thors ""friends""), but that would be nit-picking, now wouldn't it?

"SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain","8","1","2","13 December 2011"," Thor (2011)
","I'm a big comicbook movie fan and a moderate comicbook fan. I've never really been too familiar with the character of Thor, other than his appearance in an Incredible Hulk TV movie. I knew he was arrogant, confused, and a great warrior. I've also seen him in a few animated movies too. Like many fans, I await the arrival of The Avengers, but at the same time I hoped this wouldn't turn into a suppressive prequel like Iron Man 2. <br/><br/>This was one of the most enjoyable film experiences in quite some time. It nailed everything that a summer blockbuster adventure movie should have. Action, comedy, romance (even if a tad forced), and great set pieces and supporting characters. Hemsworth plays Thor, as an arrogant tool. He thinks he knows it all, and can do it all. After being banished from his realm, a beautifully constructed Asgard that mixes CGI with more traditional set design, he arrives on earth with no powers. While his mischievous brother assumes control of Asgard.<br/><br/>Thor, as a movie, has a lot to do. It has to kick start its own franchise, follow into The Avengers, all the while, mixing the world of Gods and magic, with our human world. It was never going to be an easy task so Branagh was the perfect choice. With his time in Shakespeare, he can do the classical, the drama, the tragedy, and the comedy. All of which is present and has plenty of space to breathe. The humour is difficult to get right, as this is Fish-out-of-water stuff. It's easy to make Thor seem stupid, but Branagh and the writers make him a traveller of worlds. He expects earth to be different, and knows he must at least try and fit in. By the time Thor's friends arrive in a Masters of the Universe fashion, it's clear this film has its tongue in cheek. <br/><br/>On the acting front we get a great bunch. Hemsworth is everything he needs to be and more. His emotional screaming is just as satisfactory as his charm and humour. Hiddleston is the breakout star here. He plays Loki with many layers of complexity, which gradually evolves his frustrated pranks into more devilish acts. Portman is a love interest, and a smart one at that, at least she is able to help the hero in some way. Hopkins is his grand self, and Dennings is a nice if unnecessary addition, which gives her comedic duties allowing Portman and others to focus on the story. <br/><br/>The action sequences are very well handled, although Thor's flying is usually kept at a distance. They never seem too long or too short (looking at you Iron Man 2). This is a great blockbuster and does what it should. Gets me interested in the character, in the franchise, and excited for The Avengers."

With his new found death, he is reborn back into his former self with a new outlook on life and how it keeps things in perspective to his vision. With a band of earthly inhabitants, he realizes that not all is lost in the face of destruction which gains him back his hammer and armour. This film was in all forms, worth a look. The music, the effects, and the acting is on the spot. Natalie Portman plays Thor's earth love (jane) who has trouble believing in his tale, since she hit him with her truck two times. But never the less, gets to see just how powerful he really is. Now with Shield backing him up it is good to see the circle is almost complete to the long awaited film which fans are itching to see soon.

","This movie is an epic waste of time.<br/><br/>After so many repeating sequences of ""Assguard space shooting elevator"", I almost walked away in the very middle of the movie. The story, if it were simpler, wouldn't even be considered as a comic book, let alone a movie. Thor and his brother Loki were ridiculous. The costumes are just a reminder of how USA's finest comic fans like to dress up during comicon, which is what this movie is filled with. Lets add some more comment on the story... Odin played by Anthony Hopkins, casts his son on Earth, cursing his hammer weapon so none worthy could use it. Thor meets geeky girl played by Natalie Portman, while his brother Loki discovers he was adopted child of a Frost giant. Somehow marvel superheroes and agencies are being mentioned like S.H.I.E.L.D and Stark (Irony man). This is a highly commercial movie that offers just a few thrills (mostly CGI) and very little real stunt stuff. Thor just waves his hammer and is able to create a tornado, but it all looks too silly and stupid. No nudity scenes made me blush and I felt like I ended up in an awkward situation thinking Natalie would show off herself. Boy was I wrong... All in all, you need to be hammered real hard either in the head or the other way, to even like this movie."

It also gives us a human element to which most anyone should be able to relate. This movie really is exceptional. From the epic opening set on Asgard, to the awesome battle with the Destroyer back on Earth, Thor is filled with plenty of action, a compelling story and some superb direction from Branagh. Yes, I said superb. Everything I wanted in a film such as this and, actually, quite a bit more.<br/><br/>Yes, I THORoughly enjoyed this movie. Each frame is packed with either action, emotion, drama or intensity.

I enjoyed all 3 Blade films, 2 of the Spiderman films and thought Chris Nolan's Batman Begins and The Dark Knight surpass every other superhero film by some measure the rest of the genre have been pretty grim.<br/><br/>So onto Thor on the plus side it wasn't as bad as Green Hornet but its a close run thing. The Storyline (if it can be called a story) is Thor becomes too big for his boots in Asgrard, gets exiled to earth where he has some 'hilarious' fish out of water experiences before regaining his humility, immediately gets his powers back and everything is put right.<br/><br/>I'm not going to criticise this film because its plays fast and loose with Norse mythology - its based on a comic book or criticise the fact that it departs from the Marvel characters storyline, all the superhero films tend to do that - its just a very bad film. For something supposedly fantastical its just forgettable. I had no interest in any of the characters the dialogue was awful the special effects nothing special at all the editing was dire and the acting one dimensional.<br/><br/>Along with the Captain America film it felt like a very long trailer for the forthcoming Avengers film. Personally both films have made me dread the release of The Avengers. From now on i think i'll stick to Marvel's animated out put its better than the cinema releases."
"axismladen","8","1","2","16 August 2011"," Fails with certain things, but still highly entertaining!
","First thing i need to say is that i'm not very familiar with Thor as a character. I heard of the comic books and everything, but i've never actually read one. With that being said, i can't say whether the movie is faithful to it's original material, but i can say that as a movie it works. It's got that fine line between science fiction and fantasy that in a way makes it stand out from all the other 'SUPER-HERO' movies i've seen. I like all the mythology behind it and all the interesting perspectives of looking at, or at least comparing science to magic. And even though i think that the beginning is too sword and sorcery like as far as the dialogue goes, the rest of the movie works fine in that matter. There are even some good jokes made of it when Thor comes to earth.<br/><br/>As surprising and admirable as it is that Kenneth Branagh, who is considered a highly artistic director, directed this movie, i must say that i think that it was the wrong choice. I just don't think he has an eye for action or for a spectacle as some directors like Sam Raimi, Bryan Singer and Zack Snyder do. I'm not saying that directing is bad, i just think that certain action sequences could've been done way more exciting and simply more cool, which would fit this kind of movie. However, i also think that he brought some goods to the movie as well. And also, now that i think of it, i'm not so surprised that he decided to direct this movie. It has that Shakespearean quality about it. All the family like friendship's and family relationships and betrayals, which were quite predictable by the way, give this movie that tragic undertone which Shakespeares work always had.<br/><br/>That is one of the main problem's i had with the movie, it's too predictable and certain things just don't work and are very poorly done. Like for instance, the relationship between Thor and Jane. It happens so quickly and so structurally bad that it's barely noticeable. Don't be surprised if by the end of the movie you ask your self, when did these two fall in love!?! The two characters were not given enough time with each other, or they did even too much but none of it being a romantic time, and even though they were seeing each other through out the movie i never, not once, had a feeling that they took it to another level or that they were even about to. Well, the camp fire scene near the end looked like they were about to, but guess what, they didn't! Another thing i didn't like is that the only character in the entire movie that is somewhat characterized is Thor. All the other characters are completely ignored and barely anything that happens has anything to do with them. That stands especially for characters from earth.<br/><br/>I'd recommend the movie, but with a note that if the things i mentioned were done better, the movie would've been a lot better. Very interesting and entertaining, but...."
"cosmic_quest","9","1","2","18 June 2011"," A brilliant adaptation of the comic book
","I'm someone who is very excited to see 'The Avengers' in 2012 ever since I first heard about the project. Howvever, I have to admit that 'Thor' was always the film I was least looking forward too since Ironman and Cap are my favourites of the team and I also doubted if adapting the Thor comic book was going to end well. Luckily, I was very wrong! 'Thor' sets up the premise that the legends of the Norse gods are, in fact, powerful aliens who inhabit Asgard, one of nine worlds connected to each other through a wormhole system known as the Rainbow Bridge. Thor is a cocky and egotistical prince who is preparing to succeed his father Odin as king, much to his younger brother Loki's quiet resentment. However, when Thor's arrogance leads the race of Ice Giants (who reside on another of the nine worlds) to declare war on Asgard, Odin casts his son out in the hopes of teaching him humility. Thor then finds himself stranded on Earth, powerless and mortal with only scientist Jane Foster and her friends to aid him. Meanwhile, Loki is plotting away with his own plans of leadership.<br/><br/>Those who were worried about Chris Hemsworth's role as Thor (considering he is best known in the UK for 'Home and Away!) should relax as he carried the character off perfectly, right from Thor's conceited side to his growing maturity and sense of responsibility. By the end of the film, it is easy to see Hemsworth's Thor take his place as one of Earth's Mightiest Heroes. Tom Hiddleston, who played Loki, was also another pleasant surprise as he was excellent in depicting the vulnerability of the character as well as his guile, bitterness and jealousy. Natalie Portman was a good Jane Foster, although this was obviously very much Thor's film and it will need a sequel to properly develop Jane as a character. And, as always, it was great to see Clark Gregg as SHIELD agent Coulson, one of the best original characters that the films have produced.<br/><br/>I found that the plot was near-perfect for a comic book adaptation, doing well to explain the background of Thor's character and how he evolves to being an Avenger. Loki was also nicely development as a sympathetic antagonist rather than some bland 'black and white' villain. There was a good mix of drama, action and humour and the actual story flowed. You can see how this is nicely coming together with the 'Ironman' films to finally culminate next year to 'The Avengers'.<br/><br/>There are some negatives. I did feel Odin could have done with slightly better depiction as he came across as a rather cold father to his sons (it's easy to see why Loki felt he had to take the path he did). Also, there was no need whatsoever for 3D. I've seen the film three times, twice in 2D and once in 3D and felt the latter added absolutely nothing to the film except for making pretty credits at the end. I wish Hollywood would stop with this fad since it's rubbish.<br/><br/>I do highly recommend this film to comic book fans as well as anyone looking for a good film. Roll on 'Captain America' in July!"

","Thor (or ""The Mighty Thor"" as some would call him) is admittedly and personally one of the most uninteresting characters in the MARVEL universe. Not only does he lack any good opposition in his villains but there's only so much a writer can do with an established Norse God turned comic book superhero. In the hands of the wrong team, a THOR movie adaptation could've been equally bad but thankfully this is averted in the case of 2011's THOR.<br/><br/>The movie is pretty much straight to the point, serving as an introduction to the future Avenger and it does its job well. The film thankfully decides to avoid side stories that could've bogged down the story and concentrated on Thor's story alone, ranging from his family problems in his home Asgard and romance on Earth. A small problem with being straight forward is that the film was a bit predictable since it still followed a typical superhero plot (redemption, save the girl, etc.) but this does little to bog down the fact that the film is enjoyable.<br/><br/>The characters are thankfully not as two dimensional as the trailer implied since they're a lot deeper than what one may expect, especially Loki. The whole cast did their part but it was Loki that really stood out for me. Loki could've been a boring one note villain but instead we get a conflicted god trying to prove himself worthy to everyone. Though everyone did play their roles well, not everyone got a balanced amount of screen time, which if done would've made them more engaging.<br/><br/>The action, on the other hand, is kind of weak. Not to say it wasn't bad but it failed to maximize the 3D which, again like most other 3D film out right now, seemed unnecessary. It was rather interesting to see how a hammer would fare against a spear and the like and believable melee weapon choreography IS hard to accomplish so points to the film's team for making it as real as possible without compromising the fun out of it.<br/><br/>Overall, THOR serves its purpose as an introduction to just who the mighty Avenger really is. If some other team made the film adaptation of the character, the end result could've been another DAREDEVIL; we may never know. But what's important is THOR lives up to the bar set by IRON MAN back in 2008; this looks like it's going to be a good decade for MARVEL studios and the rest of Stan Lee's creations.<br/><br/>Again, wait for the credits to roll. There's a stinger there leading up to THE AVENGERS"

","This forgettable piece of junk had one bright moment - the ebullient Stan Lee in a cameo as a truck driver. Now on to the bad stuff: everything else.<br/><br/>STORY: Probably solid as conceived by J Michael Straczynski. Definitely ruined by the credited scripters. Because ...<br/><br/>SCRIPT: Anyone who talks or writes knows to get your point across in as few words as necessary. Early on, Odin instructs his sons that although they do not seek war, ""we have to be ready for it"". A more regal, adult response would have been: ""we have to be prepared"". Odin words sounded like they were written by (or for) 10-year-olds. Sorry if this sounds nitpicky, but it was an indicator of the wretched mess of dialogue for the next two hours.<br/><br/>ACTING: Tom Hiddleston(Loki) seemed to try a bit; everyone else phoned it in. There is not a drop of emotion in evidence anywhere.<br/><br/>ART DIRECTION: Fake-looking all around - from the New Mexico town to Asgard and beyond. The Frost Giants and Destroyer were no better executed than what you find in a movie-of-the-week on the ScyFy Channel, maybe worse. And whose idea was it to make Bifrost, the Rainbow Bridge, a pavement of fiber-optic Lucite?!! Unbelievably bad. Only one person can take credit for that, and he is ...<br/><br/>KENNETH BRANAUGH (DIRECTOR): He has to be the weak link here. Too bad because he seems like a nice guy.<br/><br/>FINAL COMMENT: The story draws on Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's origin of THOR (Marvel version, of course) from 1968 - issues #158 and #159. The two comic greats had applied their cookie-cutter morality play to THOR, as they had to their other creations - Spiderman, Iron Man, Dr Strange to name a few - that of a self-absorbed individual gaining a conscience and becoming a hero. As usual, it was done to perfection every time. I still get a lump in my throat every time I re-read Spiderman's or Thor's origin. (And all done in 20-pages or less!) Reprints of these comic books are out there and I encourage everyone to read them and see why movies like THOR are being made 40 years later.<br/><br/>."

","Firstly I want to point out that I am giving this film 8 out of 10 on the basis that it is a Marvel super hero action film. To review it any other way would be unfair. It doesn't take itself seriously, sticks to the comic book characters well and also links in well with the other Avenger stories / SHIELD i.e Iron man, Hulk and probably Captain America.<br/><br/>It contains everything needed to make it fun and entertaining with lots of action, great special effects, a few laughs and then topped off with more action.<br/><br/>My only issue was that I went to see it in 3D and felt it really didn't need it. In fact I thought it was more of a distraction than anything else when it was used and that didn't seem to be very often, therefore you watch the majority of the film slightly blurred for only a few minutes of real 3D. If I could rewind time I would probably have preferred just to go and watch the 2D version.<br/><br/>All in all though it was just a good film and if you do go and see it just remember what your going to watch, a film adaptation from a comic book, not a serious drama or some artsy fartsy garbage. Just sheer stupid unrealistic fun."

","Thor is one of my least favorite comic heroes, next to, maybe, Punisher and Batman from All Star Batman & Robin. Thor is a boring cliché that somehow lasted longer than all the Blue Beetles put together. The movie, however, is far, far worse than this. It's goofy, cheesy, pretentious, and altogether predictable. I wasn't looking forward to this film. I saw it for a dollar at the Redbox across the street from my home. I still feel worthless and cheated. I could have written a more original script in five minutes with a bottle of Smirnoff as a co-writer. I predicted every. single. individual. scene. Oh, and I did this by merely watching the Super Bowl spot. This is not a good movie by any leap and bound. The only good parts (2) are: 1) Thor's brother, Loki, and 2) Jeremy Renner's character of Hawkeye, who is given, oh, two lines, three minutes of screen time, and no single piece of character information until The Avengers. Two films later. Also, the whole movie is shot from camera angles that Battlefield Earth would shy away from using. I dare you tho play the Thor Dutch Angle Drinking Game (with diluted alcohol). Given the choice of watching this movie in a perpetual marathon of Captain America for five straight hours, or a three- hour marathon of Green Lantern, I would choose the latter. How this was better received than both Green Lantern still baffles me."
"MartinHafer","8","2","8","5 May 2011"," It will blow you away.....unless you are dead!
","I had very low expectations for this movie when my daughter dragged me to the 12:01am showing of ""Thor"" on opening night here in the States. After all, I've never read the comic and there didn't seem to be all that much publicity concerning this film--and I just thought it would be one of Marvel's lesser films. However, when the film began I was absolutely blown away. It had to be the most beautiful and mind-blowing superhero film ever--with gorgeous visuals of other worlds that even sci-fi films haven't come close to matching. And, combined with nice 3-D effects and an exceptional score, you just turn off your brain and absorb it all--like some sort of mind-altering drug! And speaking of the score, while the ""Iron Man"" soundtracks were great (with LOTS of great AC/DC tunes among others), ""Thor"" chose instead to mostly use original compositions--and they were gorgeous.<br/><br/>Fortunately, in addition to the gorgeous visuals and music, the film had a very good story, nice acting and great direction--by none other than Kenneth Branagh (yes THAT Kenneth Branagh). I also admire the script--it had a lot of excitement and occasional humor that made the film more than just an action film crammed with amazing stunts. Well done--and hopefully the film will catch on--it deserves to do very, very well. I'd say this one was about on par with ""Iron Man"" and ""The Dark Knight"" in quality and entertainment value--proving that even film snobs like me can enjoy some good escapist entertainment now and again.<br/><br/>By the way, I did have one complaint about the film. It had among the most obvious and annoying product placement I've ever seen. I got absolutely sick of seeing 7-11, Southwest Airline and Kashi crammed onto the screen. Could Paramount Studio do any worse to whore out this film?! For shame, as the film was terrific but was cheapened a bit by this crass corporate decision. Oh well, at least they weren't paid to place laxatives or hemorrhoid creams in the film!"

It was a lot like Avatar, but not done as well. Good visuals but a stupid and predictable story. All the names of cites and the characters throughout the film reminded me way too much of LOTR.

"invisibleunicornninja","4","1","3","13 February 2018"," This movie cannot be enjoyed if you have a brain.
","When I sat down to watch this movie, I was prepared to enjoy it. I like superhero movies, and I heard a lot of good reviews. I don't agree with any of the critics I listened to before watching. <br/><br/>The beginning is actually ok. The visual effects are good and the action is partially decent (at least at the beginning). The only reason I enjoyed this movie was because I was laughing so hard. Not at any ""jokes"" though. I was laughing more at this movie's incompetence. If you are one of the surprisingly numerous people who enjoyed this nonsense, I'd appreciate it if you actually read my points on why this movie is terrible. <br/><br/>-The romance takes place over the course of about a day, and during most of that time Thor and Natalie Portman are nowhere near each other. Like, she runs him over with his car, they have a few brief conversations, then all of a sudden Thor is crying over the possibility of never seeing her again. It feels stupid and rushed.<br/><br/>-Thor doesn't really do anything to deserve the hammer. Like the stupid love story, this character arc (I was told it was supposed to be one) feels incredibly rushed. What they could've done instead of what they did is have Thor live on Earth for at least a month. They could've shown Thor learning how to live among humans, slowly realize the errors of his ways, and come to regret what he did. Loki's attack could've something that took a while to do and by the time he got around to it Thor could've been ready to defend humans because he actually cared for the species. There could still be the big dumb boring action scene at the end, but at least him getting back the hammer would be deserved. I'm not saying that this would be perfect, but it would be a hell of a lot better then what they went with. <br/><br/>-There's a lot of continuity errors. The shots themselves are good, but when they come one after another - not so much. It kinda takes you out of the movie when it goes from broad daylight to night to sunset and back to day over the span of a few sentences. <br/><br/>-Nothing makes any sense because nothing is ever explained. Powers/abilities aren't explained. None of the technology is explained (and by technology I mean the alien stuff not human technology - though there is some stuff with Natalie's cellphone that makes little sense but that has more to do with how stupid the characters are). Fight scenes have little tension and aren't fun not only because the characters are unrelatable and the fights themselves are poorly choreographed, but because you don't know what the characters can DO. <br/><br/>-The pacing is weird and a very simple plot is made difficult to follow through a very bizarre narrative. <br/><br/>-All the government officials are stupid. I get that the doctors were stupid as a joke (I think it was supposed to be a joke) but SHEILD is supposed to be a group of elite government officials. Why is everyone working for them dumber than a sack of bricks?<br/><br/>-There are so many plot holes concerning Loki that it makes my head hurt. Just try to think about his plan, and when various pieces of information are revealed to him. IT MAKES NO SENSE.<br/><br/>-Thor's friends are all stupid (literally) and underdeveloped. All the characters are underdeveloped, but Thor's friends are practically caricatures. They're annoying and they shouldn't affect the plot as much as they do. Also, ALL the characters are stupid. Everything in this movie is incredibly dumbed down to the point where nothing makes any sense. <br/><br/>I don't know a lot about how this movie was made, but everything feels very rushed. This movie could've been decent with an extra half hour of run time, better actors, and an editor who understands editing. The only people who seemed to know what they were doing were the camera people and whoever was in costumes/makeup/effects."
"seannasuti","8","1","3","8 July 2016"," Marvel's first big 'risk' project turned out well in their favor
","This was arguably Marvel Studios' first big 'risk' project. There was a major possibility that this film could've ended up being an extremely cheesy and laughable affair. And yet that's not what happened. Under the direction of Kenneth Branagh, known for his many adaptations of Shakespeare plays, the film does carry a solid atmosphere with strong Shakespearean themes which help keep the film from being too campy. Chris Hemsworth shines in the role of Thor as does Tom Hiddleston as his brother (and the film's main villain) Loki, though the latter would truly start to stand-out in future MCU films. Some may take issue with the film primarily taking place on Earth but I think it works out pretty well. We see Thor struggle to adapt to human life while also becoming more of a noble hero, which is a pretty great arc for the character. And as for the film's use of humor, I actually think it worked pretty well too, at least when it came to how Thor goes about while on Earth (e.g. ""This drink. I like it... Another!! (*smashes glass*)). It may not be the absolute best of the MCU but I still think very fondly of this film and it once again proved that Marvel could make quality films centered around 'B-level' characters."

So yeah, Thor was punished by his father and sent him to Earth without his powers. Then he only stayed on Earth for like 2 and a half days. Then Thor saved two worlds in one day. <br/><br/>What I'm trying to say is, everything happened so quickly. But still, the actors did a good job portraying their characters especially Chris Hemsworth as Thor and Tom Hiddleston as Loki. It really blends in together. <br/><br/>In conclusion, Thor is okay, even with a rushed story. There are still good parts left."

This ridiculous business quickly became so annoyingly monotonous that I decided that, on top of all of its other flaws, ""Thor"" only deserved a 4-star rating.<br/><br/>From start to finish, this film was an utter disgrace to all things regarded as noble and heroic.

","Translating a comic book legend - with a rich back story - to a one shot adventure - which needs to introduce people to the characters and wrap up the action in a manageable space of time - is a tall act. And compared to Iron Man, or the Hulk, or the Fantastic Four, or Spiderman, who all had beginnings - designing suit/biological change - and had to adapt to their powers, Thor was born to be a ruler, he had the power, and with that comes the arrogance. And that seems to be the crux of this popcorn flick. He's the son of the king, he will inherit the throne, yet his father doesn't think he's worthy. While he has a jealous younger brother who thinks he could do a better job, and feels betrayed. It sounds perfect for the classically trained Kenneth Branagh. Yet his choice to place the action on Earth, to remove Thor of Mjolnir, seems to be his way of creating Thors beginning. To build from a petulant boy, into a hero. Yes, it's heavy on special effects. Yes, it does feel like a really long introduction to the sequels. But it's fun for people who haven't come across Marvels version of Thor, and sadly no film can get the full atmosphere decades have built up."
"ChaosStar","3","1","3","2 January 2014"," The Same Boring Thing with a new cape.
","I could write this post on nearly any popular super hero page but I chose Thor because this was the film that made me want to throw in the towel with these films when I had finally lost all interest in the Marvel and DC films. I will say that I am a fan of Hell Boy, The first 'The Punisher' and 'Batman' (Christopher Nolan's) as I'm a big fan of Memento and The Dark Knight was faultless. <br/><br/>I see these films as just huge eye candy that's only skin deep and will never submerge deeper, leaving this disappointing, rotten skin that something truly heroic could have been produced. I think some fans will say Marvel and DC comic films are 'amazing' and 'awesome' because of the brand itself, not really questioning if it really was unique or outstanding. The films I enjoy (mainly Indie and Foreign of late) may be hyped up because of the cult following. I'm a fan of a strong scipt and driven acting and can't be really pleased with a film for it's grapthics if whats really important doesn't follow through. I digress. Here are some reasons that support my claim. <br/><br/>Wolverine, Iron Man, Spiderman, Thor, Superman and The Hulk; all are characters that have superpowers or unlimited amount of power at hand and are nearly unchallengeable to begin with. Some, they have a lot of fans, others don't, but soon when stripped of their powers, usually at the behest of a girl/love interest, exploited by a nemeses, are cast out and stripped of their powers. When this happens, we the audience can sympathize with them and not be awed by their powers that we don't posses. Now the love interest turns around and gives them strength and purpose and they gain their powers back and kick arse and save the day and are finally accepted by whoever they wanted to be accepted by. Does this sound familiar? It's just recycled story and I don't know what's more disturbing, that this is still continuing for profit or people are still enjoying such wacthing the same thing their spoon feeding themselves with. I do like a good hero tale but I prefer vigilantes, V for Vendetta- Kick Ass- Batman(sort of) and The Punisher or people with personnel grudges."

I have to say, it very much surprised me...<br/><br/>How was the acting?<br/><br/>The acting in 'Thor' was good. By that I mean everyone portrayed their character and played their part above average. The best of the acting was Natalie Portman. She definitely did the best. She played Jane Foster and just killed it. Chris Hemsworth as Thor was a good choice. He portrayed Thor very well. Tom Hiddleston did just about as well as Natalie Portman playing the main antagonist: Loki. Anthony Hopkins did fine as Odin. There wasn't necessarily anything bad or good about his acting.<br/><br/>How was the writing?<br/><br/>It's hard to critique the screenplay for this type of film. I did like how the story went, though. It did have many predictable elements, but some things surprised me. This film did have a bit too many slow parts and the romance between Thor and Jane Fisher just decides to happen, but the things that bugged me the worst weren't those things. It was how there were many illogical, unrealistic, or unexplained things in this film. All of which took me right out of it. Also, the frost giants were way too easy to kill. Those things are twice the size of what the people of Asgard are, and are still killed with one small cut of a sword across their chest. It turns out, the writing was not very good.<br/><br/>Did it have an interesting premise?<br/><br/>I did like the premise and get the humor of what Thor is going through on Earth. Yes, the premise overall was interesting, despite my few flaws with it that I described in the writing section of the review.<br/><br/>Was it entertaining or boring?<br/><br/>Like I said earlier in my review, the film did have a few too many slow parts, making the film kind of boring. Although, the situations at hand during 'Thor' did bring some light into the shadows. The film was entertaining overall, but nothing special happens, and there are only about two scenes that I found exciting. Most of the film was enjoyable, but not entertaining as it should have been, in my opinion.<br/><br/>What things in particular did I like (that I haven't already covered)?<br/><br/>I really liked all of the beautiful scenery, CGI, and effects in 'Thor'. I also liked the direction the film went in story-wise. There were also some pretty entertaining action sequences, too.<br/><br/>What things in particular did I dislike (that I haven't already covered)?<br/><br/>I have already covered most of the things that I disliked about the film, but I have one more. I thought that some of the action sequences were not exciting, a very small number that even that entertaining. There was also one in particular of which I predicted almost everything that happened, and I really did not enjoy it.<br/><br/>How was the film overall?<br/><br/>Despite all of my many flaws with 'Thor', it was mostly entertaining, and had a couple of exiting parts. I say 'Thor' would be good if you don't watch it seriously. That means don't sit down and try to enjoy it. Watch it with a few friends. Text during it. Doing these things could make the film enjoyable. I would give 'Thor' a C- on the grading rating scale.<br/><br/>Do I recommend this film?<br/><br/>As I just explained, I only recommend this film if you didn't try to sit down and enjoy it. If you tried to do that, it wouldn't be very good. If you try to have some fun with it, and watch it with some friends, talk during it, or text during it, 'Thor' could be good.<br/><br/>Will I buy this film?<br/><br/>No, I will not buy this film. If I can't just sit down and watch this film seriously for it to be good, it's definitely not worthy of me buying it."

","This movie is less a saga than a facile riddle scrawled by a child's crayon across the dignity of ancient cultures. Its most redeeming feature is that it raises the credibility and watch-worthiness of such gods-and-humans flicks a ""Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief."" The humans, including Natalie Portman, who is capable of SO much better work, were meek and unconvincing even when shrieking, or proclaiming their commitment to saving each other (or the planet). There was more real emotion in Anthony Hopkins' single tear than in the remaining 99.8% of the movie.<br/><br/>That said, this film is eye candy of the most obvious sort and it gets its points for prettiness. The Rainbow Bridge mechanism verges on Steampunk, a plus in my book. Good gods live in golden halls (and have blond hair), while bad monsters live in bleak, dark worlds and have gray/black skin (or dark hair). It's symbolism with a sledgehammer here, folks, and surprisingly lacking in subtlety for a director like Kenneth Branagh.<br/><br/>Branagh's credit helps explain the mishmash of Shakespearean and Greek tropes imperfectly overlaid on the Norse mythology, like melted milk chocolate drizzled on a grilled trout.<br/><br/>Yeah - not worth watching unless you really, truly, have nothing better to do."

","As a reader of comic books, I am impressed with this instalment in the Marvel Universe's current run of films over most others. A while back, I said that DC's Green Lantern was possibly the best superhero film since Christopher Reeve stepped into Superman's boots over 30 years ago. Sorry folks, you're good but you're not the best. <br/><br/>Being a fan of Marvel's main events when it comes to comics, story arcs such as Civil War, Dark Reign and Fear Itself prove Thor to be one of the company's most bankable frontmen in comics. Not like he came across as Hulk's best friend in the Lou Ferrigno days. And now they have made him one of the most successful cross-overs in recent years with this fantastical and heavyweight slice of entertainment.<br/><br/>The arrogant, cocky, fearsome warrior Thor is one of two sons belonging to Asgaard's great king Odin. He is much loved and respected amongst his family, friends and his father's people. Growing up being told stories of their realm's war with the ice giants, Thor believes that his greatness as potential future king will lay in his conquest of the ice giants once again.<br/><br/>As Thor is about to become king, the ice giants manage to breach the security of Asgard and Thor goes against his father's advice in seeking them out and beginning a war where his father left off. Odin intervenes to keep the peace, just in time...<br/><br/>As a result, Thor is exiled to earth and removed of his powers, where he discovers that life is not so simple. Seeking the warhammer Mjolnir, to regain his powers, Thor finds himself up against SHIELD, the national security bureau (that will one day be responsible for the assembly of the Avengers) and must count on the help of scientists Jane Foster and Erik Selvig.<br/><br/>But what he has yet to learn is that while he begins to grow fond of life on earth, treachery is abound as his jealous brother Loki is appointed king in the wake of his father's unexpected sudden illness. Loki has also made a deal with the ice giants upon discovering a certain ""home truth"" as to his own origin.<br/><br/>Discovering that all is not right, Thor's friends ""The Warriors Three"" and lady warrior Sif commit treason in seeking Thor before Loki brings about his demise.<br/><br/>Thor is an enjoyable adventure featuring a great cast, a great director, plenty of laugh aloud humour and boasting great visual effects that go beyond the expected death and destruction. It is literally an adventure of cosmic proportions that could stand alone without the Avengers.<br/><br/>Chris Hemsworth rocks the viking look and yet enjoys making fun of himself in the role of the god. It is refreshingly well executed as well when he begins to discover that Earth is not a place to be so cocky and arrogant.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman was also a surprise, switching off the heavy acting and seemingly just enjoying herself in a role that required comedy and flirtation and the same goes for Stellan Skarsgaard, who has always had a reputation for playing either dangerous sociopaths, stuck up snobs or dangerously stuck up sociopaths.<br/><br/>The Warriors Three were a totally necessary addition and I think Ray Stevenson was so spot on with his portrayal of the jolly but gluttonous Volstag.<br/><br/>Tom Hiddleston was also great as Loki, despite my reservations for such a slight and straight-faced actor to play a viking god. He really can deliver the goods and his calm exterior is not to be believed for too long - what can I say about Anthony Hopkins that you don't yet know? He rocks the god king armour! <br/><br/>A well executed action adventure of depth, humour and compassion that takes me back to the days when fantasy/sword and sorcery/myth-based movies ruled. It even reminded me of classic Spielberg at times. I look forward to the sequel but I'm a little peeved that they haven't brought back Brannagh."

","I always preface my Marvel movie reviews by stating I never followed the comics in favor of the DC Universe. If I picked up the occasional Spider-Man or Hulk, it would have been for lack of preferred reading material, and Thor was never on my radar as a must read character. But with the prominence of the Marvel movie universe, I knew I couldn't pass this one up forever. So even though I didn't splurge during the opening fanfare, I finally got around to it today on DVD.<br/><br/>Altogether not bad. I probably enjoyed the opening half hour the most as the story took in Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) origin and place among the Greek god pantheon. I think the coolest character was that devil styled Laufey (Colm Feore) who oozed sinister menace without even trying. And Lord knows, Natalie Portman has to be one of the luckiest actresses on Earth, Asgard and Naboo to find herself in the most profitable and popular movie franchises going.<br/><br/>That's not to say this film couldn't have used a little more character development, but after all, we're talking decades of comic book history distilled down to a two hour film so not everything is going to make the cut. ""Iron Man"" probably did it best so far, but this film brought an interesting cosmic dimension to the story that we haven't seen before. For his first super-hero outing, Hemsworth did a creditable job with a physique that admirably suited his character. Somehow I didn't think the character of Loki (Tom Hiddleston) was evil enough, but then I go back to my comment about King Laufey. Love those red eyes.<br/><br/>The best single scene for me, and I look for him in every Marvel flick - Stan Lee marks his presence as the truck driver attempting to dislodge Mjolnir from the New Mexican desert and loses the flatbed! That's a big enuff 'Nuff said' for any Marvel fan."

Kenneth Branagh really does put a good film together here. <br/><br/>In this whole Avengers project that has been put in place i would place this film 3rd after the Avengers film itself and the first Iron Man Film. <br/><br/>Truly well worth watching and a must before you get to see The Avengers film.

","Thor. Really liked the first 30 minutes. Brilliant. As in most Marvel films, Stan Lee, who created the characters, has a cameo roles. Of course he didn't create the character Thor, but he did create the comic book version. <br/><br/>I like this film as it keeps in line with Norse mythology. No fiddling with it. Anthony Hopkins played a great role of the God Odin, Ruler of Asgard. Chris Hemsworth, a relative newcomer to Hollywood. I, for one, had never seen or heard of him and only just found out he played Captain George Kirk in the 2009 Star Trek film. Of course, you can not have Thor and Odin without the mischievous Loki, played brilliantly by Tom Hiddleston also a relative newcomer to Hollywood films. Also, all three of these top roles were played by an Englishmen, a Welshman and an Australian. Sounds like the beginning of a joke. But this film was far from it. <br/><br/>The Special Effects are just amazing. Could not ask for more. Acting, including those previously mentioned...superb. Also could not ask for more. This is truly one of the best films of 2011 and I can not wait for Thor to return in The Avengers and Thor 2. To be released in 2012 and 2013. Amazing film, a definite watch."

","There are two contrasting worlds. The celestial science fiction world of Thor, Anthony Hopkins and the immortals quite grandly shown with epic battles stunning backdrops and serious words. When this is all getting too heavy we move into New Mexico on planet Earth with the rather girlish Natalie Portman for comic relief. Somehow it doesn't quite succeed - it feels schizophrenic. There isn't much chemistry between Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman. He although a bit inexpressive facially does portray an other worldliness but she just seems silly. She wasn't a good choice. The dialog could have been better - it's rather heavy and obvious. Didn't really feel for any of the characters. The only humor comes from Thor being like a bull in a china shop on Earth.

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>Thor (Chris Hemworth), who in ancient Greek mythology was the God of Thunder, finds himself banished from his home planet by his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) after disobeying him and nearly starting a war with the 'ice killers' (or something like that.) Anyway, he crash lands on earth, where he happens upon young researcher Jane (Natalie Portman) and her father Erik (Stellan Skarsgard) who are having their own problems with some local government bureaucrats, which makes him come in handy when he forms a friendship with them after they teach him about earth ways and customs. Meanwhile, back on his home planet, his jealous brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) assumes the throne when Odin dies, setting Thor on a course to return home and begin a battle to the death that will encompass both planets.<br/><br/>Kenneth Branagh is a name that appears to have disappeared to the sidelines in the movie art form, with me last hearing of his name in his initial home of the theatre in some production he was doing there. Here, he appears to have done a bit of a Clint Eastwood and stayed out of view behind the camera, where he's graced this production with his particular style of pomp and grandiose directing. Within the medium of the comic book film, from the iconic Marvel chain line and borrowing from the ancient Greek mythical character, he is in his element, with all the right ingredients to make this the marvellous romp it could have been. Something just falls flat with Thor, though, never coming to life or working as the great fun it could have been.<br/><br/>Even by comic book film standards, this is complete nonsense, not helped by a distinctly humourless streak and a camera man who can't seem to hold it at a straight angle at various important shots in the film. As the titular Thor, Hemsworth carries the role decently enough, with a dashing arrogance that the role requires, whilst Hopkins invests an energy and gusto into his role that doesn't really fit the material. None of the supporting cast, from Portman to Skarsgard, are bad, either, it's just this is one big, lumbering mess of a film, with a bone headed steak that is the biggest surprise of all from the refined Branagh. **"
"tycho-snelder","4","1","3","8 October 2011"," Not the worst movie ever, but really unimpressive.
","This year, the same director who brought us the 1996 version of Hamlet, brought us the movie Thor, based on the Marvel comic book by the same name. A lot of comic book movies came out this year, and sadly, this one happens to be just as generic and uncreative as most of them.<br/><br/>The main aspect in this regard is the plot. I'm gonna write some spoilers now, so if you're planning to see this movie, you should probably stop reading. Thor, the God of Thunder, played by Chris Hemsworth, ignores the orders of his father by attacking the enemies of his country Asgard, the Frost Giants. This leads to the Frost Giants declaring war on Asgard as Thor's father, the king of Asgard played by Anthony Hopkins, banishes Thor to Earth, where he is found by Natalie Portman. What follows is a bunch of cliché jokes centered around Thor not understanding the norms of Earth's society.<br/><br/>At this point, you'll probably notice that the camera-work is just weird. Fifty percent of the whole movie is shot at a 20 degrees angle. I guess this is a vain attempt of the filmmakers to make the film look artistic, but it has no effect to me. It still looks like a generic Hollywood product.<br/><br/>The rest of the second act consists of Thor's brother Loki trying to kill Thor for no reason other than just Loki being evil. Of course Thor sacrifices himself for Natalie Portman, who suddenly became his love interest, which proves that he's worthy of returning to Asgard. How nice.<br/><br/>So in the end, it's easy to conclude that the only thing that can be admired about this movie are the special effects, but they're not enough to save this film. The story and the villain are really standard, the acting is not that good and the cinematography, like I said, is just idiotic. I guess it's okay for young children who really want to see it, but unless you're a hardcore fan of the comics, I really can't recommend this movie to you."

"tieman64","Null","1","3","29 August 2011"," Too many cooks spoil the broth
","Kenneth Branagh directs ""Thor"", a superhero movie which mixes the director's fondness for William Shakespeare (and theatre) with big budget, CGI, superhero, comic book nuttiness. Ironically, it's the film's Shakespearean aspects – a ""King Lear"" inspired narrative in which Gods and Wizards jostle for power and plot against one another whilst a wise King divides his kingdom between sons, outcasts and half-breeds – which work horribly. Probably because it's fundamentally impossible to take such ""high brow drama"" seriously when everyone is wearing underwear, capes and standing on glowing rainbows. It would take a genius to conceive of a believable ""trans-dimensional landscape"" in which alien beings, Gods and lords can convincingly frolic whilst quoting The Bard.<br/><br/>Still, the film's other subplot, which takes the form of a culture-clash comedy in which the mighty Thor bumbles about contemporary America whilst a chirpy Natalie Portman lusts after his heavenly body, works well. Think such ""fish out of water"" comedies like Arnold Schwarzenegger's ""Hercules in New York"", ""The Voyage Home"", ""The Terminal"", ""Moscow on the Hudson"" or ""Time After Time"", and you've got an idea of what Branagh is tapping into. This aspect of the film is cute, but not worth suffering the director's Greco-mythological train wreck.<br/><br/>Like most super hero movies, the overriding theme is proto-fascist: ""how to wield absolute power benevolently"".<br/><br/>6/10 - Worth one viewing. See Branagh's underrated ""Frankenstein""."
"FatMan-QaTFM","Null","1","3","24 August 2011"," A few entertaining moments with an incomplete story
","Oh boy, another Marvel movie! In case you forgot, Marvel has brought us Hulk, Incredible Hulk, Spider-Man 3, Fantastic 4, Special Hulk, Silly Hulk, Elektra, some Punisher movies, and and some iffy X-Men movies. And also Blade, Iron Man, and Men in Black. They have gone from being cheesy comic books and low-budget looking Spider-Man and Hulk TV shows to being very. very. very. serious business. Dark, moody art with special-effects laden films to match.<br/><br/>Thor to me isn't that interesting of a superhero concept. He has the same problem as Superman: invincibility. Krypton can at least mess with Superman, but Thor has nothing – other than good ol' dad stripping him of his power. Nevertheless, my wife and I saw a Monday night screening IN THREE DIMENSIONS with about 4 other folks. Helpful hint for you movie-goers: don't recycle your Real-D glasses. Pocket them, come back to buy the 2D version, and sneak in to the 3D version. You've already paid for those bad boys once with your first movie ticket, so no harm done in my theft book.<br/><br/>The original Thor story begins with mild-mannered cripple Donald Blake discovering he is actually Thor, God of Thunder. He leaves his cripply self behind when he picks up that sweet hammer. New Thor may have lost his powers, but his good looks did not get stripped away. I guess it would be harder to be humble if you were still a beefcake blond. While some folks spent the movie drooling over Chris Hemsworth's pecs and tittering at Kat Denning's quirky antics, I actually paid attention to the story – what little I could find.<br/><br/>Thor felt like a ridiculously long intro to Thor 2. Like it should have been an extra on the DVD, except it ran for over 2 freakin' hours. It also played heavily towards Marvel fans and not towards us unedjumukated masses – references to S.H.I.E.L.D, Nick Fury, Iron Man, and who knows what else I missed. Keeping each superhero in his own little world and movie has worked well up to this point. I believe The Avengers will be the final ""this is crap"" moment for most non-comic movie goers. So I'm supposed to believe that Thor, immortal god, teams up with the Hulk, Iron Man, Ant-Man, Wasp, and Captain America? And this is the same universe that has Spider-Man, who was infected by an alien being (what realm was he from?) and all of the mutant X-Men (Wikipedia tells me Wolverine even joins the Avengers at some point!)? I know we have to suspend a LOT of disbelief to watch the movies, but they all have their own rules and ideas. Mash them together, rules start to break down, and it becomes arbitrary after a while.<br/><br/>I realize have not said much about the movie. There isn't much to say. It took 45 minutes to get to Earth and another 45 minutes to leave. In the meantime we got a few lame jokes and some decent CGI action. This wasn't a cheap movie to make, I'm sure. Why shoehorn in a Thor movie before The Avengers just so the characters are all accounted for by little last-minute Nick Fury scenes?<br/><br/>While the Ultimate Aryan had a few entertaining moments and a surprisingly good cast, it failed to do more than throw as much information on the screen as possible while leaving an obviously incomplete story behind. Marvel, please."

"Robert_duder","Null","1","3","23 August 2011"," God of Thunder? Meh...whatever...
","I've talked to a lot of people that saw Thor and many of them had the same thing to say. It was just okay...it was meh...it left no solid impression on your like other Marvel superheroes that became larger than life on the screen like Spiderman or X-Men. Thor had some stumbling blocks. I think first of all he's a tough hero to translate to the big screen. For that purpose they did okay. The scenery and special effects are truly outstanding. The scenes that are on Asgard and the frost giants world are stunning and something else to see. Although as always the 3D did nothing for me. It looked just as good in 2D. The issue is not the effects. The issue is the characters don't really go well together, and Thor, the God of Thunder spends nearly the entire film on earth and powerless. It isn't until the last half hour or less of the movie when he finally regains his powers and starts to kick butt. Up until then you're just watching an awkward enormous blonde man live amongst humans. The romance that blossoms in the film is forced and downright silly and the action scenes are done almost without Thor for a lot of the time.<br/><br/>There is no doubt that Chris Hemsworth fits the build and look of Thor. In fact he isn't bad in the role. I felt like it was a little campy (nothing compared to the 1970's role of Thor on The Incredible Hulk TV Series) but he still doesn't come to life in front of you. Natalie Portman who is a huge superstar in Hollywood is almost wasted in this movie. She is supposed to be a brilliant scientist but looks like a deer in the headlights, picks up this over-sized brute of a man and then somehow falls in love with him in a few seconds. Portman looks pretty as always but that's about as far as it goes. The chemistry between them is weak. Tom Hiddleston is Loki, Thor's adopted brother and if you know even a little about the Thor storyline you know where his story is going. Hiddleston is good. He makes an interesting anti-hero/villain and while he's a little campy it will be interesting to see where he takes the character. The legendary Anthony Hopkins joins the cast which automatically brings up the ante of this cast but even Hopkins' character as Thor's father is a little empty to me. He is good but he isn't great and that's what you want from a big budget summer flick and Hopkins. Stellan Skarsgård and Kat Dennings have supporting roles as Portman's co-workers and they are good but they don't get a chance to really stand out. Kat Dennings is the comic relief but her comedy is misplaced at times. Honorable mention to Colm Feore who plays King of the Frost Giants. He has a small but decent role.<br/><br/>Thor was supposed to be of course another lead in to The Avengers film which I still think is a risky prospect but Marvel are trying their best. This was certainly the summer of Marvel but I think Thor was the weakest of their entries considering how amazing X-Men First Class was and Captain America was solid too. Thor almost felt like just a filler film that they had to do. Director Kenneth Branagh is a great director and an even better actor but I think he didn't have a lot to work with. They forced it out and didn't try to reach the quality that they often do with new properties like Iron Man. But for fans of Marvel flicks I suppose it will get watched and it is mildly entertaining but it won't stick with you long after the credits role. 7/10"
"XweAponX","10","1","3","12 August 2011"," A Good Feeling from Asgard to Midgard
","I never was that much of a Fan of Thor as a Marvel Comics character. I liked him much better in the book ""The Roaring Trumpet"" by Fletcher Pratt and L Sprague de Camp, a short story which comprises the first part of ""The Compleat Enchanter"" - A book written before World War II. In that treatment, Thor is a big bellowing guy, on the scale of a Bear more than a a European Adonis-Model-Type - who enjoys leaving the imprint of his huge Hammer (named Mjollnir) in the skulls of so many Frost Giants. Mjollnir is the only thing these two characters of Thor have in common: A Huge Hammer that gives Thor his Power.<br/><br/>In this film the Hammer is an Asgardian Symbol of Honour, Responsibility, and Worthiness: And so it was given to this film's version of Thor, but he misused his Authority, and Odin took it away and banished him to Earth and also sent Mjollnir there, until such a time Thor proves worthy enough to once again wield it.<br/><br/>That is the crux of the story as told in this Film. What we call ""Magic"" - A More Advanced Culture would call Technology. And so this film expounds on that idea: Thor is a member of a highly advanced race of beings, called ""the Æsir"", who use the BiFrost ""Rainbow Bridge"" to traverse the ""Nine Worlds"": Asgard, Mannheim (Or, Midgard), Vanaheim (Where the Vanir live), Jotenheim, and a few other places. Mannheim is our Earth and Jotenheim is where the Frost Giants dwell, and this ""World"" has a large bearing on this film. These world are part of Yggdrasil, the ""World Tree"" and Bifrost is the bridge wherein the Aesir can traverse the worlds.<br/><br/>From WikiPedia:<br/><br/>The three worlds above the earth, in heaven:<br/><br/>1. Vanaheimr (Vanaheim): Realm of the Vanir 2. Álfheimr (Alfheim): Realm of the light elves 3. Ásgarðr (Asgard): Realm of the gods<br/><br/>The four worlds on earth:<br/><br/>4. Niðavellir (Nidavellir): Realm of the Dwarfs 5. Miðgarðr (Midgard): Realm of man 6. Jötunheimr (Jotunheim): Realm of the giants 7. Svartálfaheimr (Svartalfheim): Realm of the Dark Elves<br/><br/>The two worlds below the earth, in underworld:<br/><br/>8. Niflhel (Hel): Realm of the dead 9. Múspellsheimr (Muspelheim or Muspell): Realm of fire<br/><br/>It should be noted that the Norse ""Hell"" is a world of Cold compared to the Judeo-Xtian cosmological model.<br/><br/>What I really liked about this film, is that Kenneth Brannagh brought all of this Mythos and laid it out straight at our feet.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman (Jane Foster) is an Astrophysicist who discovers the use of Bifrost in our world, and that in our terminology, Bifrost is an ""Einstein-Rosen Bridge"" - IE, a Wormhole. The Aesir can manipulate this and effect travel between the Nine Worlds.<br/><br/>Chris Hemsworth is Thor, son of Odin (Anthony Hopkins), and Tom Hiddleston is Loki - Thor and Loki are depicted as ""brothers"" who grew up together, but Odin had kept a secret from Loki, which eventually became a source of friction. What is remarkable in this story, is the apparent true friendship between Thor and Loki, something which has never been explored in Book or Film regarding these ""gods"".<br/><br/>There is a section at the beginning of the film showing the history of the Aesir battling the Frost Giants, and the ""childhood"" of Thor and Loki and other aspects of life in Asgard. This portion of the film has excellent CGI, profound music written by Patrick Doyle (Who wrote the music and was also an Actor in Brannagh's 1989 ""Henry V""), and gives an impression of great antiquity. The film's basic story is told in two realms: Asgard and Earth, so we have a split storyline.<br/><br/>One unexpected face was Rene Russo as Frigga, Odin's wife. Idris Elba is Heimdall (Which is one of my favourite Norse gods) and the great Character Actor Colm Feore plays King Laufey of the Frost Giants.<br/><br/>Stellan Skarsgård plays a character named Erik Selvig, another Astrophysist and Mentor to Jane Foster, his character was created for this film and was not previously part of the Marvel Multiverse.<br/><br/>As Norse Myth is one of my favourite subjects, I highly enjoyed seeing how Marvel and Brannagh treated the subject, and this film made a huge impression on me."

","Thor is easily one of marvels hardest properties to bring to the big screen and could have turned out for the worst with being received as corny, cheesy, or just too hard to understand, but leave it to the folks at marvel to get it right. After seeing this movie having to know nothing about Thor, I have to say this is the best marvel film yet and was told in the best way possible that a story like this could be told. The people behind the making of this film do a great job of taking the source material of the comic and reshaping it enough that it stays true to the comic, but also making it have a sense of realism to it so that the audience can relate to it. They make the actors feel like GODS when they need to, but sprinkle a bit of emotion that makes them feel human in a way. The director does a great job with what is given to him and does a good job of making the audience believe what is going on during the movie (jumping from different universes and such). The pacing of the movie adds a little extra to the story line because it gives away small doses of who these characters are and the world they are from so the viewer won't be blown away with all the things being portrayed. The production team really ups the bar with the amount of sci fiction this film has over the ground things we are accustom to seeing. They did this so well that it has the feel of a star wars movie with the whole travel the universe in a way with a dash of lord of rings attributes because of the present mid age vibe and the two element blend very well to creature the genre of film. I also have to say the acting from the characters in this movie were a lot better than performances people put on it passed marvel film or many other film in general. Every person does an amazing great at the role given to them; whether they had little screen time or a major role to play. Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston do an amazing job portraying these two iconic characters and bring them to life. With both actors never really having a big role in a movie before they command their screen time very well and give a break out performances. Also Anthony Hopkins and Natalie Portman do a great job as always making it easy I'm sure for the first time actors. The director captures the audience also with some of the best visual CGI that I have seen in many movies that it is front lining the visual displayed in Avatar. This film has a lot of funny lines drop throughout it that makes it feel very relaxed at times where it could of felt kind of forced and misplaced. On top of that it has fresh story that was well written and not polluted with dull moments that could draw away from what's going on in the film. This is a great film that could branch out and headlight future cosmic non earth bound movies for the future of films."

The plot is rather simple and could stand to be complectified in places, but the characters are complicated and interesting, especially the main antagonist, Thor's brother Loki. Tom Hiddleston (a British actor I've never seen before) plays the trickster god with a wonderful blend of sympathy, pathos and madness. He is a perfect foil to Chris Hemsworth, who does a really good job of playing Thor as a hothead who nevertheless has a heart and is not quite the dumb jock he seems to be. Anthony Hopkins adds gravitas as Odin, and the frost giants are very cool and evil. And the mythology of Asgard is very nicely presented and fleshed out along with wonderful visuals.<br/><br/>So while I wanted a bit more story than I got, I still came away very satisfied and hopeful that the well-constructed mythology we got in this movie will be put to good use in many sequels. Eight stars."
"collinsjay","8","1","3","4 July 2011"," A Bridge Onwards or A Piece of Cinematic Genius?
","The question above reminds me of many other questions; To be strong or to be weak? To have £10 or to have £5? The answer is always going to be the first one. Of course this is multiple choice and so is whether or not you should go and see Thor, especially in 2011's comic-book movie summer...<br/><br/>The film opens with an exciting, albeit short set piece on Earth introducing us to Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) an Astro Physicist out in the middle of know where waiting for a storm. The tension builds up, as even I in the audience became sceptical on anything happening... Until BOOM!! Thor (Chris Hemsworth) arrives with only one question on everyone's mind ""where did he come from?"" Firstly this is a fantastic introduction, it denies the audience any over complexities with the narrative by setting it up so well. As expected it goes on to explain the origins of Thor with a noisy, special effects filled prologue that essentially isn't needed. It seemed almost a duplicate to a Lord of the Rings style battle scene, without a Peter Jackson stab at making it jump of the screen. That's not to say Kenneth Branagh doesn't do a good job. He makes the years of comic book mythology so comprehensive in order to set up the movie and 3D or not he makes Asgard jump of the screen with its beauty. <br/><br/>Hemsworth really makes a believable Thor, his flamboyant antics only help to symbolise this better. Although Thor's written too narrowly for my taste, his arrogance is conveyed too simply and his romance with Jane Foster is far too spur-of-the-moment stuff. The acting from both Portman and Hemsworth however, allowed me to ignore this and the movie just became more and more intriguing. Tension builds as Loki (Tom Hiddleston) moves further towards the films antagonist. I really got the feeling of a medieval ""who shall be king"" battle going on in modern day New Mexico which is a lot of compelling fun to watch. Odin (Antony Hopkins) gives the film stability and understanding as his sons rivalry grows. Expect great effects, great acting and a great story, but don't expect a piece of cinematic genius.<br/><br/>Thor was always going to be the risk in the Avengers lead up movies. It does what it has to in order for the Avengers to be born in 2012 and it does no more, no less. There will be plenty of teases tying it into this ever growing Marvel universe (incidentally stay after the credits if you want to see more of that) and for fans this will be a blast. But fan or not this is a great film just don't expect anything more than a prequel to the Avengers."

","After suffering through a slew of generally horrible superhero movies (the old 1992 version of Captain America, Superman 4 and whichever one had Richard Pryor in it, Catwoman, Elektra, the so-bad-they're-great Lou Ferrigno Incredible Hulk movies, etc), we're finally getting some great superhero flicks! I was very worried that Thor, a favorite of mine since I was a kid, would be ripped from my childhood memories and slaughtered before my eyes - this happened twice before, with Transformers and G.I. Joe - but the end result was quite good. Thor is no Lawrence of Arabia or Doctor Zhivago. It won't be remembered in 30 years as an epic that changed movie history. However, for a guy who was just hoping for a fun flick that made me forget about real life for a couple hours, Thor really came through.<br/><br/>The action and effects were tremendous. I am not at all a fan of 3D (it's more distracting than anything, especially when things are up close), but I didn't let that affect my rating.<br/><br/>The acting won't win any awards, but all of the actors were believable. I really felt that this was the Thor from the comic books. I wasn't too sure about the comedy bits (you've seen the taser bit from the commercials, I'm sure), but after seeing the movie as a whole, it turns out that these funny parts were actually quite memorable.<br/><br/>In all, Thor is right up there with the Iron Man movies (mindless entertainment that is true to the comic series) and is a perfect lead-up to the Avengers movie."
"cmh9202","9","1","3","18 June 2011"," Really good!
","I'll just cut to the chase and say that Thor was very enjoyable and entertaining. Kenneth Branagh directed this film well. The casting was superb also. Of course we all know that superhero films are pretty predictable....and half-way through the movie you will figure out who the main villain is, however, the villain's intentions are the mystery and what make the story go. Chris Hemsworth is really good as Thor and captures the character well. Natalie Portman is good and actually has a purpose as a love interest, which is saying something from me since she usually annoys me. Hemsworth is good as Thor in that you see real character development! Rare in a comic book based movie! The romance element is typical, but not to the point in were it is distracting or annoying. The special effects were really good and just overall well done. You won't be wasting your money if you go see this. 9/10 stars :)"
"redryan64","7","1","3","4 June 2011"," What, No Helmet Laws in Asgaard?
","WELL IT IS surely with mixed feelings that we come away with after viewing THOR (Marvel/Paramount, 2011). On the one hand it is an excellent, comic derivative story with outstanding fx, attractive & able cast and fine, exciting musical score. The only question at film's end is, is this the Thor that we remember from our youth? <br/><br/>RATHER THAN STARTING off the proceedings with (as they say in the Comics Price Guide)the usual ""Origin and 1st Appearance"", we are transported to a sort of background history of the 'Immortals' of Asgaard and how they came to be deified by the ancient Norsemen. We learn of petty family jealousies and intrigues of the sons of Odin. The scenario brings us in contact with an array of twists and dramatic devices that would do even old Will Shakespeare proud. It doth appeareth that be it on Earth or in a mythological Viking Heaven, Royalties is sure bleeped up! <br/><br/>THE GREAT THOR stories that we enjoyed so were more of a mixture of this Ancient Norse Mythology with standard Super Hero fare. Thor may have been the god of thunder; but he still had a dual identity, an ""Alter-Ego"", if you will. In his case, it was that of frail, lame Dr. Donald Blake. The good physician came about his new identity quite by accident; by picking up the hammer of Thor, which bore a warning sign. It was something along the lines of ""Whosoever Picketh Up the Hammer of Thor Will Become The God of Thunder!""* Well, Dr. Don did and then did! <br/><br/>ALL THE WHILE, there was already the quietly loving, Nurse Jane Foster; who was so often given thought balloons filled with such typically melodramatic Stan Lee-esque thought dialog as ""Oh Dr. Blake, if you only knew how I've longed to be held in your arms!"" You see, Jane Foster was already known to Dr. Blake; though not in the Biblical sense, of course.<br/><br/>TO THIS OLD, now long in the tooth, comics aficionado, the script and the occurrences bear a strong resemblance to the ""TALES OF ASGAARD"" stories that Mr. Stan Lee ran as a secondary, back-up feature to the main THOR Story in his JOURNEY INTO MYSTERY Comics magazine.* The stories as we recall, were exciting, even epic in nature. The involved happenings surrounding Thor, Odin and Loki; but all happening in ""the old sod"". They were well illustrated (by superior comics draftsman,Gene Colan, I think). The illustrated continuities even had somewhat of a resemblance to the old PRINCE VALIANT Sunday Pages by Harold Foster or Alex Raymond's FLASH GORDON.<br/><br/>ONE VERY MARVEL-TYPE occurrence was the characterization of the four of Thor's deputy warriors. They all had diverse, feisty and wholly 3 dimensional personalities. This had long been a Marvel Comics Hallmark.<br/><br/>WELL, WE SURE CAN hardly wait for the CAPTAIN America movie next month and for next year's THE AVENGERS. Maybe they can manage to tie up any loose ends and make a little more comic book sense; especially with the addition of Captain America, the Hulk, Iron Man and others.<br/><br/>IN CLOSING LET us leave you with a couple of public pleas. Please give Thor a shave and put his helmet where it belongs, on top of those golden locks!<br/><br/>NOTE: * That's right, JOURNEY INTO MYSTERY was the original title of the mag that was to be the Thunder God's home. Originally it was one of those Weird Science/Fantasy anthologies; which were so popular in the 50's. With the '60's Super Hero Revival in full swing, the title was eventually changed to THE MIGHTY THOR."

","Long holiday here in the UK so I added Thor to the list of the films I watched at the movies with one more to come tonight. I grew up reading the adventures of Thor, and he is my favorite superhero God. I liked the choice of the main actor. The rest of the movie did not come across as powerful enough. It was very run off the mill story. I remember the comics had some very brilliant themes and plots. It seems that Hollywood is finally coming to terms with the fact that Effects are only limited by imagination. And imagination falls short in this movie. It was OK to watch. A nice popocorn movie so to speak.. The Batman series have done Batman justice but this does no justice to Thor."
"shakirrahman19","Null","1","3","30 May 2011"," A story nicely told...
","The best thing about 'Thor' is its story-telling, the quality of which, more often than not, gets scarce in super-hero movies. The part I loved the most about this movie is how the descent of 'Thor' to the earth is handled. Being new to earth he does not start to act all stupid and clunky, but retains his 'cool' as a god. The humor here has been nicely placed and smartly carried out, keeping it subtle enough not to make it cheesy.<br/><br/>The portrayal of Asgard is breathtakingly serene, and so were the action scenes directed.<br/><br/>All in all, a great Marvel movie. I do recommend it to all the comic-lovers!"
"nathan-atkinson-46-523438","9","1","3","26 May 2011"," Excellent film. Not one dull moment
","I must say, I was pleasantly surprised with this film. Their haven't been many good hero films lately (apart from iron man), with the latest spider man film (released a few years ago) being fairly garbage. Thor turned the tables bringing this hard to bring character to life. The graphics were amazing, the storyline kept me on the edge of my seat and it was the introduction to the other superhero movies (and the new justice avengers released next year). If you want a good action movie without having to know the in-depth background of the Asgard Gods, then I highly recommend this movie. Worth every penny of the admission fee to the Cinemas!"
"FeloniousPhunk","8","1","3","25 May 2011"," Not your typical superhero movie
","I liked how Brannagh treated this unique origin story. Most origin stories revolve around the acquisition of some super power and how the hero becomes comfortable with his/her new abilities. But with Thor, it's backwards. He already has the powers of a god and has to learn to be comfortable without then.<br/><br/>Overall, I felt is was a very Shakespearean treatment of the story, which makes sense given Brannagh's background. With kings banishing sons and the betrayals of (adoptive) brothers, it had all the makings of a Shakespearean tragedy, up until the relatively happy ending. I can see where people expecting the spectacular action of a ""Spider-Man"" or ""Iron Man"" might be disappointed. But, given the unique nature of Thor going from god-to-hero rather than man-to-hero, I don't think it could have been handled much better."
"phil-schroeder86","6","1","3","19 May 2011"," Light Fluffy Popcorn..mmmmm
","I saw this movie with a friend of mine. And I will admit the preview looked promising. The film was OK but I'm wondering if I'm just becoming more discerning or jilted in my older age (this film is certainly no 8 rating), granted I'm only 25. For the film tried to move way too fast since it is covering so much material in two hours. In that sense I felt like more could have been done on character development and background but due to the massive amount of material it decided to go the typical Hollywood comic book adaption route, lets cram it all in! That aside the story was fairly cohesive and there didn't seem to be any glaring gaps or horribly inexplicable scenes, some small things perhaps but nothing were I felt it was just an atrocity. The actors were all solid. Which was one of the things that drew me. All of them performed the roles well but once again the largest failing was the writing. Sadly I feel people who adapt these films by and large, although there are exceptions (iron man, x men, watchmen), are trying to appeal to a lowest common denominator. Which financially is sound but for people who like good movies it is a bit of a let down. I'm no comic geek but I know that most comic geeks have very mixed feelings on most of these films. They are happy they came to light and brought new fans but are also disappointed about the loss of nuance. Ultimately after all is said and done it was good light fun for an afternoon but I doubt I'll ever see it again. I'm more looking forward to Captain America, Avengers, and Green Hornet. Hopefully these will be less disappointing."
"camacho-manny","Null","1","3","18 May 2011"," Thor Film Review
","Thor! Finally right?<br/><br/>Yes! Apparently so. We get a movie experience that we want from an amazing comic book character always believed to be to difficult a character to bring to life. <br/><br/>There have been all types of films on the mythical Norse God, most of which are pretty horrible or generally low brow.<br/><br/>There are even interpretations in science fiction, like the alien Thor from the planet Asgard in Stargate SG-1.<br/><br/>Thor is a beloved character, and Marvel's interpretation has taken that character and brought him down to earth, literally.<br/><br/>The film does a great job of humanizing Thor and connecting him to us. I loved the manner in which ""The Warriors Three"" were placed into the film (Hogun, Fandral and Valstagg) which helped in this process. The only issue I had was simply wanting more. <br/><br/>The special effects in the film were fantastic and Chris Hemworth did what I thought was not doable without a giant bodybuilder type. He made you feel like he was Thor. A film like this is incredibly difficult to make. To keep in line with Marvel and appease the fans, hit the mainstream and tie it in to a larger story coming next year. So why was it one hour and forty-five minutes long? <br/><br/>I think that Hollywood underestimates our attention spans - A.D.D. is what some of us suffer when dealing with boring and tedious subjects. Put a comic book in front of us or a comic book movie and we sit at attention. So why give us a shorter film. This movie could have entertained us more inside of Asgard and given more insight into those characters, Odin and Thor with another forty-five minutes. <br/><br/>Perhaps the producers felt it was long enough to tie him into Avengers and wanted to leave other surprises. That's a big ""IF?"", actually it's more like a big ""Perhaps?"" since that is what I typed...Derp.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman was great - coming off two other productions from ""Your Highness"" and last years ""Black Swan"" she is amazingly versatile. I remember a lot of rumor and arguments over Idris Elba as Heimdall and the issues of casting someone black for this role. He was awesome. Directed well and utilized in his role appropriately...again - I'm certain the audience wanted more.<br/><br/>Lets consider this for a moment. It's not that the movie was a complete two - two and half hour film and we wanted more, simply because it was so awesome. It's that the film was fifteen minutes short of two hours and slowly rushed (if that makes sense) through the storyline. <br/><br/>Overall, I still enjoyed it thoroughly as one of my favorite characters came to life. It is an interesting thing to see this character finally in the limelight. Realistically, Thor is one of the most powerful beings in the marvel Universe, he is a God, he is just about as strong as the Hulk, but for all that power he is usually overshadowed by other characters. I feel a little slighted that he didn't get a longer film. He will be key in the ""The Avengers"" next year, but he is also not it's principle character, that falls on Iron Man and Captain America - getting pushed back as the muscle. <br/><br/>While that falls in line with the comics, I guess I loved the film so much, I wanted more and felt cheated. I do not want to give plot points out like other reviews. We all know Odin is angered when Thor goes to war against his wishes and due to his recklessness is stripped of his power and cast down to Earth. We all know that S.H.I.E.L.D. finds the hammer and so on. Go watch the film and learn the rest. It's worth the viewing and your eight bucks.<br/><br/>There are a few changes from the comic books, but those changes are not bad, and the amount of action given to us is solid with great story lines wrapping around that action. We get to see him kick ass as a man and we get to see him WTFPWN as a God...<br/><br/>So I have a thumbs up for the film, it was a great spectacle, even though fleeting and a thumbs down because of that fact. It was shorter than it should have been and slightly rushed in a variety of areas where we wanted more, like Asgard.<br/><br/>If you need more of a Thor fix as your excited little hearts can't get enough like mine. Check out the ""Hulk vs Thor"" Animated feature which has an amazing battle between both of the title characters and has some great incite into Baldur, and the other of Thor's comrades. <br/><br/>This review was posted on our http://www.facebook.com/gpxgaming Profile.

Jackson, Jeremy Renner). Marvel Comics' superhero origin flick about Odin's callow son Thor (Helmsworth, quite decent in a Heath Ledger charming way), who is banished from their Nordic universe to Earth –via wormhole – as a mortal to prove himself rightful heir to the throne via redemption in saving mankind from his diabolical half-brother Loki (Hiddleston). A game cast, impeccable production design by Bo Welch and decent set pieces directed by unlikely helmsman Kenneth Branagh (or is it? Shakespearean undertones throughout suggest not!) makes more for the somewhat talky screenplay by Ashley Miller, Zack Stentz, Don Payne & J. Michael Straczynski & Mark Protosevich (phew!) based on Stan Lee (yes there's a Lee cameo too!), Larry Lieber & the late great Jack Kirby's epic character leading to the inevitable AVENGERS film (next summer) with the ubiquitous Nick Fury cameo by Jackson and possible new Hawkeye Renner. One last note the 3D isn't too shabby either (watch that hammer throw!)"
"EUyeshima","7","1","3","17 May 2011"," Combination of Norse Mythology, CGI Effects and Dry Humor Makes for a Comic Book Epic Worth a Look
","Among the Marvel Comics characters that have come to the silver screen, the biggest stretch to the imagination may be this elaborate 2011 fantasy adventure because the story is rooted in Norse mythology rather than technology and science fiction like ""Iron Man"" or ""Spider-man"". That's probably why producer Kevin Feige chose actor Kenneth Branagh to direct since his erudite touch, showcased in his numerous Shakespearean adaptations, is what the epic film needs to ground the more human elements into something more relatable to the audience. That's no small feat considering the amount of exposition needed at the beginning to give a brief history of Asgard where its king Odin has been waging war against the Frost Giants of Jotunheim led by their malevolent king Laufey. Odin has raised two sons, Thor and Loki, opposites in disposition as the arrogant Thor prepares to ascend the throne while Loki seethes in jealousy. Thor's fate is interrupted when the Frost Giants attempt to seize the Casket of Ancient Winters.<br/><br/>Seeking revenge, Thor recruits his band of warriors to enter battle in Jotunheim, an act of defiance which causes Odin to banish Thor to Earth where he becomes mortal without his all-powerful hammer Mjolnir, which is stuck in a rock in the middle of the New Mexican desert. There he meets scientists Jane Foster and Erik Selvig and their assistant Darcy, where the movie diverges into a fish-out-of-water tale, while back in Asgard, Loki learns of his true identity as the son of Laufey and consequently attempts to take over the throne as Odin lies in a deep sleep. There are plenty of battle sequences to tie the story together and keep the momentum going, including an impressive, darkly lit fight with the Frost Giants and a classic ""High Noon""-style confrontation with a nearly indestructible automaton. However, in the screenplay by Ashley Edward Miller, Zack Stentz and Don Payne, what really makes the movie great fun is its sense of humor during the New Mexico scenes, certainly enough to offset the more austere, good-versus-evil drama occurring back in Asgard.<br/><br/>Ideally fitting the imposing physical dimensions of the title role, Australian actor Chris Hemsworth plays the stalwart, uncomplicated hero with aplomb. As Loki, Tom Hiddleston brings out the villain's veiled smarminess with ease. In danger of overexposure by now (this is the fourth movie of hers I've seen in four months), Natalie Portman manages to make the most of a wafer-thin role as the plucky Jane as we are meant to believe she is a master astrophysicist. Her comic interplay with Kat Demmings, amusingly acidic as ever as Darcy, provides nice relief from the action. Anthony Hopkins isn't really challenged much by the role of Odin, but he brings his trademark authority nonetheless. Idris Elba is hardly recognizable as a stoic sentry, while Rene Russo is given little to do as Odin's wife Frigga. As Selvig, Stellan Skarsgård gets to play the unadventurous voice of reason on Earth, although he has an intriguing encounter with Samuel L. Jackson after the credits. All the production values and CGI effects are what you would expect from a $150 million film, and surprisingly, Branagh manages to tell the story in less time than ""Bridesmaids""."
"ryangozlan","8","1","3","16 May 2011"," THOR Holds His Mighty Hammer Strong
","I will admit after seeing all the trailer and TV spots for Kenneth Branagh's THOR, I found myself a little disappointed as what to expect in theaters. After seeing this film on the weekend, I can't help but praise it, as it was a entertaining, action packed, mystical and even had some great comedic humor to compliment it. Branagh's takes on a mystical adventure with THOR and really seems to find the perfect balance between that mystical world and earth, while also lending to plenty of witty humor for the audience. <br/><br/>This really isn't like all the other MARVEL films you have seen in the past and really separates itself because of it's originality of the story and the tremendous acting that accompanies it. Casting was done extremely well and the mix of British, Australian and American actors all blended in perfectly with their characters. Anthony Hopkins was picture perfect as Odin, King Of Asgard, Chris Hemsworth shows his charisma and powerful personality portraying THOR perfectly, and Natalie Portman does a great job as the beautiful love interest in Jane Foster in the film. Tom Hiddelston was also fantastic as the evil Loki, and all the other supporting cast members including Stellan Skarsgard and Idris Elba played their roles up to par. <br/><br/>Kenneth Branagh really impressed me with his directing in this film. Firstly for a guy not known to do big blockbuster films he definitely hit it out of the park on his first swing. The pace was perfect and everything was very visible to see even trough intense and shaky battle scenes. His direction of the film allowed for an entertaining, hilarious and captivating film for the audience. He also did an amazing job of tying in the realms of Asgard and Earth together, making an almost perfect balance of romance, action and intruge on both planets. <br/><br/>Thor get's an A- in my books simply because my expectations were exceeded above and beyond what I though I was walking into. With it's solid screenplay, acting, visual affects, humor and a tremendous action punch to go with it, THOR is everything you look for in an entertaining super hero filled movie. If you haven't go to a theater near you to check it out then I suggest you do soon, as this movie should entertain and suffice most looking for a journey of adventure, mysticism and creativity. I would also recommend you stay in your seat until the credits roll on through, as a small clip at the very end of them divulges some key infomation to the next installment, The Avengers."

"migperez","8","1","3","15 May 2011"," Summer has begin!!
","I like to call this summer ""The Summer of the Comic Book Movies"" it's a long title I know but it's what this summer consist of. Thor is the first one.<br/><br/>Thor the comic books is based on the God of thunder in Norse mythology, for all you non comic book reading people. The movie explains how there is other realms consisting of different races and how one realm called Asgard protects them all. Odin played by Anthony Hopkins is the king and is about to place his son Thor played by Chris Hemsworth as king. The ceremony gets interrupted when an old enemy attacks the palace and Thor wants to go and punish them. Odin forbids him and Thor with his friends goes to the enemy's realm and causes havoc. Odin punishes him by banning him to Earth and stripping him of his powers and hammer. There he meets Natalie Portman and her crew of astrophysics and together they help each other fight of a malevolent force.<br/><br/>The film is well acted by its leads which are Hemsworth and Portman and they do have good chemistry but it just mostly appears as two very attractive people hooking up. Everybody fits the cliché role of any other superhero flick. Stellan Skarsgard plays the older mentor and always giving out advice and he was like a father to Portman's character how many times I heard that before. Clark Gregg plays the regular agent that appears in every comic book movie and when he comes out the special effects comes out. For comic relief we have Thor sidekicks and I have something to say. Why is Kat Dennings in this movie she played Portman's assistant she provided nothing in the movie matter of fact she looked homeless and wandered on set and they didn't tell her to leave out of kindness. Where the film shines is in its special effects and action sequences which are pretty impressive. The film was directed by Kenneth Branagh whose experience is mostly directing Shakespeare's plays. He does a pretty good job for not being an action director.<br/><br/>The only thing that prevented the movie from getting a higher rating was that the movie has no pathos. Other better comic book superhero films has true pathos ranging from psychological, egos, vanity, insecurity and much more. Thor is just one big fun movie during the summer.<br/><br/>Thor might be lacking in depth but it's still a lot of fun at the movies.<br/><br/>MP 4/5"
"mavrachang1","9","1","3","7 May 2011"," Thor is full of thunder!
","I just saw Thor today, and my first impression is that it's visually fantastic. The designers of Asgard (and the other extraterrestrial realms) did a magnificent job. The actors were all a cut above your typical SF blockbuster, and perhaps the most understated but brilliant performance came from Sir Anthony Hopkins as Odin. Loki was a very interesting character, and instead of your stereotypical trickster, Loki actually had some depth to his character, and some very real issues. Rene Russo was a stealth goddess. I kept saying to myself ""Where have I seen her before?"" I was actually skeptical about Branagh directing, but he did an admirable job. Stellan Skarsgaard was interesting and subdued; he had one of the best lines: ""I don't know if you're really the Thunder God, but if you're not, you should be!"" **Edit** I agree with other reviewers about Idris Elba as Heimdall. Great character, and handled perfectly in character. A minor spoiler: Keep an eye out for the god of all gods, Stan Lee, making his obligatory cameo as the driver of a pickup truck. Natalie Portman had a quiet dignity and made her role more interesting than ""the earth bimbo who falls for the thunder god."" It seems like Marvel is creating a pantheon with Iron Man, The Hulk (not the Ang Lee version), and Thor. Next up: The Avengers! I don't want this to be long and windy: It's a helluva fun movie, the script is intelligent, the artwork is excellent, and make sure you sit through the credits for the S.H.I.E.L.D. teaser at the end. YOU WILL HAVE FUN."

Besides that, I wasn't even very aware of Thor until I learned about him before this movie was released (I'm not a big comic reader at all). Still, I wanted to give the movie a chance and see what all the hype was about. What really got my attention was the very positive reaction from critics. With an 80% on Rotten Tomatoes, the film was getting better reaction than I expected. Since I had work over the weekend, and opening day was pretty much my only chance of seeing a movie during that weekend, I decided to go see it on that day. Walking in I had high enthusiasm, and as it turned out I was very satisfied. Not only is the film very well done in execution, there is also a very deep story involving Thor's brother that really surprised me, which I don't want to give away. I also really liked the character Thor. The way Chris Hemsworth, and the writers especially, portray him fascinated me and got me involved in his arrogant personality, as well as his change of mind. The movie also has tremendous entertainment value. The action sequences are very well choreographed, supported by top-notch visual effects. Director Kenneth Branagh, who directed Shakespeare based films such as Henry V, shows his talents in a god-like setting as well as modern setting. Overall, the Branagh and company handled Thor very well, satisfying me and hopefully fans of the Thor comics."

As per Kirby's dictum that ""comics shouldn't REFLECT reality, they should TRANSCEND it,"" THOR the motion picture TRANSCENDS. (Not in a WATCHMEN kind of way, but Transcendent, nonetheless.) JOURNEY INTO MYSTERY #83 was a dramatic departure from the standard 1950s Atomic Age movie-inspired origins of most of the Marvel super heroes. (Kirby had been using Thor in comics prior to that- his hammer even turned up in a western, at one point-, but, this time around, he zeroed in on the gallant God of Thunder and his homeworld of Asgard.) The result was a comic book that I personally felt outstripped everything that had come before it. (See my comments regarding Kirby's death in a newspaper article that appeared shortly thereafter at capefearcomics.webs or on our facebook site.) Kirby was an artist whose cosmic sensibilities were never really tempered by his blue collar work ethic: he was a visionary in the field, and a quick perusal of any one of the four black and white reprint volumes of the THOR saga (inked by MY all-time favorite Kirby inker, Vince Colletta) clearly shows WHY. Like Bruce Lee, Jack Kirby was an inspiration to those of us who were paying attention- and, like Bruce Lee, Kirby represented the promise of Unlimited Potential. Gods knows this movie doesn't QUITE live up to its promise, but it's close enough for now. I'll leave you now with a few words from Mark Evanier's beautiful Afterword to KIRBY: KING OF COMICS: ""Heroism was much more heroic, villainy was all the more villainous, and love was just plain lovelier."" Not a bad epitaph."
"Samiam3","6","1","3","6 May 2011"," A baroque but dumb entry in swords and sorcery
","Thor rumbles violently enough to shake the theatre, and if that's all you want than that's all you'll get. It's a film that looks spectacular but sounds lame. Such a baroque project doesn't deserve such a bad screenplay which is comprised of stilted dialogue and bad plotting. <br/><br/>Swords and Sorcery is tricky, not many films get it right, and Thor is an example of why. There are too few surprises. It's not all that hard to figure out where the movie is going, and although it effectively gets a few laughs in, Thor feels rather humourless and doesn't have much of a soul. There isn't much of a character to the protagonist, and subsequently not much for actor Chris Hemsworth to work with. In fact, I strongly felt he got upstaged by his co-star/love interest. Natalie Portman is quite delightful, and far more frisky than I'm used to seeing in her, the movie becomes equally brisky when she's on screen.<br/><br/>For a film as Theatrical in appearance as Thor, it comes across as slightly disappointing that it fails to raise a pulse or generate excitement. The only time it comes close is in one scene where Thor, on Earth, must break into a Quarentine to retrieve his hammer. which is wedged in stone and nobody can pull it out. The only thing more discouraging than that is the fact that nobody has considered the option of breaking the stone.<br/><br/>If you plan to go see Thor, my advice is this. don't see it in 3-D, because there are parts where it's too dark to see anything, and don't even bother to make connections between this movie and Viking mythology. Thor will satisfy some, but I wasn't too impressed."
"son_of_cheese_messiah","6","1","3","4 May 2011"," Journey into Mystery, well maybe
","As with most comicbook adaptations, this is a mixture of the stunning and banal. The vivid depiction of Asgard, influenced by Jack Kirby's visionary 1960s art, is hugely impressive. The story is a mingling of various classic tropes from the comic: the humbling of Thor, the destroyer, the Odin-sleep. Even elements prominent in the comic, IE Thor's alter-ego Donald Blake, is slyly referenced. There's always a problem, not avoided here, with introducing so much comicbook mythology so quickly, that the ideas can tumble over each other, whereas in the comic the developed over months over even years.<br/><br/>But the main problem does not derive from the comic but in the new material. The humdrum romance between Thor and Jane Foster, who is supposedly a physicist but talks in this generic teen-speak way, and the utter trivia of the loss of her stuff in this context. The appearance of the ""men in black"", already a tired cliché but out of place here, made my heart sink. Haven't we seen these characters too many times before? But all was not lost, and the film does manage to do a few surprising things and I guessing that the writers' hands were tied to a certain degree by having to bring everything together for the Avengers film (Hawkeye puts in a brief and pointless appearance too).<br/><br/>The cast is ideal. Chris Hemsworth (despite a strange accent) could hardly be bettered in his role of Thor, and is given admirable support from the rest."
"akshaychug14","8","1","3","2 May 2011"," Wrath of the God!!
","Having just seen the excitement and the anticipation this movie created, Thor pulls something new to the standard superhero genre. It takes no time to create the same intensity as other superhero movies do but unlike other superhero movies who were creations of science, Thor was a hammer-wielding God in the Norse mythology.<br/><br/>Now apart from the historical facts, Thor is an outstanding effort by the Director Kenneth Branagh. It's a classic drama feature with straight to the point moves and an action-packed epic storyline. The film is about Thor (Chris Hemsworth), a powerful but an arrogant warrior whose immature acts ignite an ancient war. Thor is then cast down to Earth from the realm of Asgard to live among humans and to experience what it takes to be a real superhero when the darkest forces of Asgard invades Earth.<br/><br/>The feel of the film is very artistic and is presented superbly. The plot of the film is grippy with like able characters and the pace of the film is just too good and doesn't disturb the plot from start to finish. However, Thor does not deliver that much action but it has a story that works well and shows more fantasy than action at times. The giants and mythical scores made this flick a typical fantasy premiere but it's not an ordinary superhero movie, it has a deep storyline and the storytelling made this movie even more interesting and entertaining. Offering stunning visuals and performances made this film a decent flick.<br/><br/>Overall, an engrossing feature with strong scale and screenplay and is definitely a must watch!!"
"Sylent09","8","2","12","27 April 2011"," I dunno yet....
","I dunno yet, Thor is a mighty god (of lightning) and he is very powerful. After seeing many commercials on Nickelodeon about this movie it makes me worry this movie can not live up to the hype. This movie in my opinion should try to be along with Clash of the Titans. A lot of action, some violence in the fight scenes to make them look a little better. Then again the main reason a movie can be redeemed as good is by having a great story line. I hope to see them focus a bit on the actual mythology of Thor, teach you a little bit about him. Some movies tend to skip the most important thing which is telling the audience Thor is a god, how he came to be, what his purpose is, and what exactly he is fighting for and why Thor for that particular reason. I will be seeing this film in theaters and really hope to be surprised by it."

","Chris Hemworth is good just not great. The part when Thor is on Earth is the best part of the movie with Thor getting back his groove while battling the Destroyer. The final battle on Asgard on the rainbow bridge is beautiful but a little boring. The movie tries to go to much into the Shakespearean style of movie."
"UKMovieReviewer","1","1","4","10 June 2019"," Awful.
","I am, and always will be a huge fan of Marvel, however, this is possibly the worse movie i have ever seen. There is more character development in any one of the Thor comics, than this movie. How it has managed to score 7/10 on IMDB beggars belief. Who can possibly like such a meaningless and dull movie. I cannot believe that J. Michael Straczynski actually gave his name to this, let alone that he was responsible for the script. I was expecting something memorable and intelligent, after all J.Michael Straczynski's writing for Marvel's Thor Comic run in 2007 was nothing short of a game changer, intelligent, humorous and memorable. But this movie ! Movies these days have to have some character development so that the characters aren't completely 2 dimensional. This movie was like an explosion in a special effects studio. One CGI scene after another with some pretty bad acting sequences in between. The Marvel Thor comics have always been quite clever at incorporating Norse mythology into the stories. Wasn't Dr Donald Blake meant to be Thor when he originally found the hammer? Here we have Natalie Portman as Jane saying her ex was Dr Donald Blake and gurning. What was all that about? Then we have the 'blink and you've missed it' scene where Thor transforms from a war mongering selfish oaf, to Odin's favourite son again. What was the dramatic sequence of events to cause such a transformation, because i think i missed them? The characters were the embodiments of a cliched am dram production. The simpering stormchasing Jane who has a thing for buff men. The old scientist dude who says 'no' to everything. The geeky character who says geeky things. Please. Marvel, please treat your viewers with a little more intelligence than this. Do yourself a favour. If you like Thor, read the comic. I can't believe Sir Kenneth Branagh was involved in this either. The beautifully executed Wallander series, with minimalist acting and subtle imagery and emotional acting and dramatic tension. How can this be the same person? Maybe the film started off as a clever and witty idea, but became a movie by numbers that was executed by a committee and whose target audience was aimed at children who will buy merchandise?"
"morphricky","2","1","4","18 August 2015"," Pretty package with no character development
","I really should give this a 1 for the simple fact that I couldn't even force myself to watch it until the end. Character development is the one thing that needs to exist for me to enjoy a movie, and sadly, there's none.<br/><br/><ul><li>What I enjoyed -</li></ul><br/><br/>Acting from most of the cast is great. Anthony Hopkins is fantastic as always. The scene where he scolds Thor is very powerful thanks to him.<br/><br/>The costumes and settings are nice. It's especially nice to see them keep the original design of Lokis outfit.<br/><br/>It had some good humor. The hospital scene felt spot on.<br/><br/><ul><li>What I didn't enjoy -</li></ul><br/><br/>Natalie Portman is as pretty as her acting is wooden. <br/><br/>There is no character development at all. Thor changes from arrogant and bratty to a nobleman by watching lovingly into Natalie Portmans eyes. Wouldn't it make more sense if she taught him manners and made him change into a responsible man? Loki appears shy and awkward, his sudden change to deceptive and manipulative doesn't transition well. At times, it almost seems other characters gloat at him and it made me dislike the ""good"" characters. There's also a lot of other weird inconsistencies, such as if Odin wanted to protect Loki from the truth, why didn't he tell him not to go to Jutenheim? There's also no development to Thors friends or whoever they were. I think the sentence speaks for itself. I knew one of the characters names were Sif because I play a Marvel game where she is featured. I did not know it because she was developed as a great character.<br/><br/>The story is not interesting and made little sense. Odin casts out Thor for one mistake, sending him to earth where apparently Thor has no idea of earthly customs. Or well, he doesn't for 20 minutes to allow for some jokes, then he seems to know all about earth he needs to. At this point I stopped watching because I was so bored. There just wasn't anything gripping to keep me watching. Even the jokes became dull, who couldn't predict Natalie was going to hit Thor with her car again?"
"donb-519-335075","2","1","4","2 May 2014"," Now I remember why I despise fantasy films
","So why do I hate this film? Let me count the ways:<br/><br/>1- the most ridiculous love relationship I've seen: Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman - he is a big massive brute and she is an unconvincing Astrophysicist (or whatever) - it is more likely that Homer Simpson would be a scientist than this twit. She and Chris Hemsworth were ridiculous together<br/><br/>2- Anthony Hopkins!!! Please say it ain't so! The actor who is the brilliant Hannibal Lechter sporting an eye patch (how is it held on by the way - bubble gum?) and delivering scintillating lines like - to Thor (after he has impetuously and ill advisedly bulled his way thru every situation) - Hopkins: ""You'll be a wise KIng!"" Are you kidding? - have you been asleep? Are you on drugs? - a wise King? I laughed out loud. Anthony you should be ashamed - maybe you needed the money<br/><br/>3- Actually this is the one reason I liked the movie - Thor's brother Loki wears headgear that is a dead ringer for the big bunny in Donnie Darko. It is hilarious - now if they had only done it on purpose (I can only dream)<br/><br/>check it out: google ""Donnie Darko bunny mask""<br/><br/>4- Loki's laser sword - which shot bolts of something - but I have to remember this is fantasy & that kind of thing happens all the time (wonder if his lance is listed on the USML?)<br/><br/>So what did I like? (after all I gave it a 2) 1- The giant destroyer sent to eliminate this unfortunate town and Thor - was pretty cool - not even a lance through the neck slowed him down 2- Heimdall is a cool guy, although not very good at his job - people are going thru the gate like terrorists through the metal detector in the opening of Airplane - and Heimdall barely has a clue - but he is cool<br/><br/>So why did I even watch this? Our church has film clips right before the sermon - and Heimdall in Thor: The Dark World was on the clip. For those of you who have seen it, it is the scene where he senses the invisible ships getting past the gate & he leaps into the air to spear the invisible ship. (I know, you had to have seen it to appreciate it.) But it was pretty good - and made me think maybe I would like this series. And then I saw Thor 1.<br/><br/>I can only hope that I will be a ""wise King"" and stay away from Thor 2. Pray for me. DonB"
"whistler118","5","1","4","4 November 2013"," An Avenger's by-product - Rushed and unworthy to be a stand alone film.
","Everyone who will read the reviews for this film will know of Thor, either through Nordic writings or from the Avengers Assembled film. For this reason a review almost two years on from its release seems pointless. However, with the second title about to hit the cinemas I look to the original and find both positives but also a major flaw that makes this film a shadow in the light of the other Marval films being released. <br/><br/>The overall production of the film is solid, most audiences will be entertained by this high action film with a touch of humor. The casting of this film is also excellent with every actor selected to fit perfectly with our expectations of the characters. Chris Hemsworth's dominating 6""3 really does help create a god like height to Thor when stood next to the petite Natalie Portman. Apart from these stand out features, the rest of the film's qualities are fairly average. Cinematography, special effects and acting are what you would expect from a high budget film. <br/><br/>With these average qualities we cannot ignore the large white elephant that is the films largest flaw; the film feels rushed. This might be Paramount's insistence to provide a background film for the key Avengers for the blockbuster but it means this critically effects the film's speed. Thor is extensively covered but other characters and other sub- story lines are lacking the attention needed. The relationship that grows between Thor and Jane seems to happen over night, whilst the exile of Thor seems to be less than 48hrs. <br/><br/>Whilst this may be expected, in order to keep to the main plot line, this rushed feel also infects Thor's underlying storyline. With his powers taken from him and left in exile he is to only regain his powers once he has changed his ways and deemed worthy. We see this, rather comically, in his ability to serve breakfast to humans or bring a drunk man home safely. His sacrifice for the safety of the humans, towards the end of the film, is the only real change we see from the hot headed Thor at the start of the film, bringing to question the worthiness of the last fifty minutes of apparently pointless character creation and storyline for this one off action of pure selflessness.<br/><br/>I cannot say i did not enjoy this film, good action sequences and the odd laugh makes this a good super hero film, but good it can only be when in comparison to Iron Man and even Captain America. Sadly I will not be smashing down my copy of Thor 1 and ask for more as it fails to be a stand alone film. When viewed in preparation for the Avengers then this is more than required but by its self it is a predictable story of man who overcomes a character flaw with a romance slapped on the side of it. Needless to say this film will grow dust on my shelf as i will sadly not be watching it again. I can only hope that it's sequel is given the attention it desperately requires now that the Avenger's is out of the way."

","I don't know if this is the first time I've given a movie 10/10, but this does deserve every point. It's got a decent plot, the graphics are pretty damned awesome, and you can tell a lot of thought and money went into making this. It wasn't even cheesy, which a lot of movie conversions tend to suffer with. Marvel did a really good job at converting this comic book tale into a movie.<br/><br/>I'm not going to complain about the use of mixed races in the movie, the actors all did a very good job at playing their roles and they really fitted in very well. And the ending was just perfect. I've seen too many ""and they all lived happily ever after"" type endings, so the ending to this was just right."
"Kane20","6","1","4","31 October 2012"," Review - Thor
","Thor is one of the ""prequels"" to The Avengers - the ""prequels"" are Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America, and The Incredible Hulk. I still have yet to see The Incredible Hulk, but I have seen the other four films. I personally think that Thor is the worst of them. However, despite it's ultimate shortcomings, it does have its positive aspects.<br/><br/>The story is about Thor of Asgard. This arrogant Thor recklessly travels to another world called Jotunheim with Loki and some other Asgardian warriors and attacks the Frost Giants there, stirring up tension and possible war between Jotunheim and Asgard. As a result, Odin, Thor's father, strips Thor of his powers, and his mighty hammer, and banishes him to Earth.<br/><br/>On earth, in New Mexico, astrophysicist Jane Foster is researching a phenomenon in the desert (which turns out to be associated with Asgard-related activity, in this case Thor's banishment). Thor arrives and is discovered by Jane and her partners, and pretty soon he begins to learn the error of his arrogant ways, and he even falls in love with Jane. Meanwhile, Loki has taken over the Throne of Asgard, and he plans to send the Destroyer to earth to kill Thor, and Thor must retrieve his hammer and his powers to save both earth and Asgard.<br/><br/>The film has both its ups and downs. I'll start out by talking about the effects. The visual effects are pretty good. The mythical words are pretty well designed, and the actions scenes are good. As for the script, it does have its flaws, but it's an acceptable script. The story isn't the best, and it's a bit bland and formulaic, but again, it's acceptable. It even has some creativity in it. Unfortunately, however, despite its creativity, it's a bit bland and formulaic. The first act of the film (the first half hour) is, in my opinion, the weakest part of the film, and it felt to me that the movie was relying a bit too much on effects, but it does establish the characters and basis necessary for the story. It's also where most of the film's creativity is.<br/><br/>Weak as the first act is, I did find some things a bit interesting, and some things were introduced that had a lot of potential to get even better and more interesting and creative. But unfortunately, at the end of the first act, right after Thor arrives on earth, the movie abandons a lot of its creativity and resorts to a formula. Some of the things in the first act (which had a lot of creative and interesting potential) are even abandoned and not brought up again in the film. This, and the film's bland-ness, and a few other flaws, are the main reason why I only gave this film two and a half stars instead of three or higher (it almost got three, but it just missed it). Also, I felt that the Thor/Jane romance was a bit rushed.<br/><br/>However, despite this, the film does get going a little bit more after Thor's banishment. This is where the heart and characters begin to shine. That brings up what I liked most about the film: the characters. I found them somewhat likable and interesting. The film even has a surprisingly good sense of humor; there are a lot of good comedy moments. These things are not strong enough to bring the film up to a higher rating, but they are still somewhat enjoyable. I especially liked Loki, even though he's the villain, and I was glad to see him and Thor return for The Avengers.<br/><br/>So, overall, I think Thor is a so-so movie. It is a bit bland and formulaic, and could have used a better story, but it has enjoyable characters, humor, and action, and is not bad overall. It's a bit meh, but it's a bit entertaining, although it's not something I'd want to watch more than once.<br/><br/>My Rating: **1/2 (out of ****) For more reviews, please visit my website: http://robertsreliablereviews.blogspot.com/"

","So tedious. So banal. So painfully predictable. Muddled action sequences that lacked any originality or tension and the dialogue, virtually every bit of it, was a cringe-worthy cliché. Luckily I watched this on Netflix so I could speed through the stupid parts, and by Odin, there were lots of those. This was the worst superhero movie I have ever seen and I have seen a quite a few. The acting wasn't to blame for this farce. I think the actors did a good job, considering what they were given to work with. However, the script writers should have their crayons confiscated and Branagh would do well to leave this dubious accomplishment off his resume. I grew up reading the Norse legends of Thor and Loki. I love the story of how he and Loki visit the land of the giants and the trials the giants set before Thor. That's real storytelling. Even the Thor cartoons are better than this movie."

Love story between Thor and a human? Is this what we are lead to believe happened?? Where? When? There was no emotional scene, connection between the characters or hero/love connection of any kind and no character development in general (none!). The story is very poor and under-developed to under-achieved with many holes. Scenes tend to succeed each other without much dynamic and soon, you settle for a mighty boredom. Some of the special effects were ""fine"" but overall, the whole thing appeared super-artificial (movie directors, please stop believing that a movie will do great with special effects and no stories or no 'art') and not that entertaining.<br/><br/>This movie overall is one of the rare which make me think (not only one third through) that it would be better off stopping before the end rather than continuing - don't waste your time."

"krycek19","Null","1","4","7 September 2011"," Has NOTHING to do with the Nordic mythology!!
","The movie is probably true to the Marvel comics, although I've never read the ones about Thor. I do know, however, that it is not true at all to the Nordic mythology about the gods in Valhalla.<br/><br/>First of all that futuristic look of a golden city in the skies could not be further from what Valhalla looks like. Valhalla was a wooden fortress as they looked during the covered wagon times.The gods were dressed in capes and not gold and metal.<br/><br/>Odin had two talking ravens called Hugin and Munin that were messengers from Asgårdand Udgård, telling Odin everything that went on outside Valhalla.<br/><br/>Thor himself had a wagon with two flying goats suspended to it. Thor never rode a horse like he does in this movie.<br/><br/>And then there was Heimdal, played by a black guy. What the hell?? The Nordic gods had Scandinavian looks, which means they were white with blond hair and blue eyes. And in the movie there is also an Asian guy. There were no black or Asian guys in Valhalla!! And I don't normally have a problem with black and Asian people in movies but this alone is such an insult to the mythology.<br/><br/>As I am from Denmark and I love the Nordic mythology because of the exciting funny stories, I hated this movie from the very beginning. And so did my buddy. We fast-forwarded to action sequences and scenes with Natalie Portman, because she is so hot. I don't even remember the ending of this crap. Except something about a giant Robot that shot fire from it's face. I know, right? I only hope that someday, somebody will get a green light, to make a movie that is true to the mythology and not a based on any comic book.<br/><br/>If Stan Winston invented this version of Thor and Valhalla he should be ashamed of himself and forced to apologize for not making it true to the mythology.<br/><br/>The mythology was a religion for vikings and peasants in Iceland, Norway and Denmark. People really believed in these gods and Thor is a complete mockery of that religion.<br/><br/>Some people will probably tell me to lighten up and say it's just a movie.<br/><br/>But all insults afar it's not even a good movie. It's way too long and boring and it takes itself way too seriously. The serious part is probably the movies biggest flaw, given the laughable premise. The action sequences are too far apart and they are done in a boring way. Kennethy Brannagh clearly has no clue how to make action sequences.<br/><br/>And Valhalla is some of the worst cgi I've seen in a long long time.<br/><br/>Don't watch this crap. The only Marvel adaption worse than this was the awful awful Jonah Hex"
"mariolosasso","5","1","4","9 June 2011"," How do you say ""Meh"" in Asgardian?
","Great Odins Raven where to begin. I like comics. I like superheroes. While I consider myself more of a DC guy (especially Green Lantern and Superman), I have loved every installment as Marvel builds towards next summer's ""The Avengers"" (yes, I even loved ""The Hulk""). But Thor was just flat. I had doubts from the beginning. How was a mythical Viking God supposed to fit in with the universe that gave us Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark? The answer? Not very well actually. Thor was riddled with Oscar winners, but it could not escape the average narrative. The costume looked much better than I expected, but the rest of Asgard felt like a soulless video game back drop. The CGI was so over the top that it became distracting (and actually made me begin to worry about The Green Lantern). Chris Hemsworth was very solid playing the lead. But the movies biggest flaws were with Anthony Hopkins as Odin and Natalie Portman as Jane Foster. Now you would expect 2 such great actors to knock these type of rolls out of the park. Instead, both struggled to maintain competence. Hopkins gave a mail- it-in performance on par with Jack Nickolson in the Departed. Every time he was on screen I found myself begging for it to end. Portman acquitted herself slightly better. i would say she was on par with Kirstin Dunst and her Mary Jane Watson chops from Spiderman. Obviously thats still pretty terrible. Sometimes a character just doesn't translate to film. I think Thor is that character. Cinema has struggled with the portrayal of these God-Like comic characters (see: Superman, All of them), for some reason no one has perfected a way to ground them to a reality based environment. Thor is not a character that lacks nuance. But his abilities do. This is literally a God who crushes all with his hammer. It just didn't work. I am hopeful that a supporting roll in ""The Avengers"" will work well, but as a full length feature I will have to pass."

Horrendous acting (for instance: Thor's father in the cave, Loki's (he's the bad guy) threats, female soldier on the ramparts), marginal special effects (for instance: lava waterfall, Loki's wand of fireballs, army on the plains before the city), terrible editing (cuts from Loki to an individual soldier who looks to be standing in a forrest facing Loki, but he orders and arrow attack on Loki and it comes from the plains before the City/Castle...so where exactly is this soldier located? and why is a lowly foot soldier commanding an entire army? Why is the entire army on maneuvers in front of the castle? They couldn't have known Loki was opening a hole in the good guy/bad guy space time continuum...) I skipped ahead in the move for 5 minutes to see if it was just a really terrible opening opening but there was Loki still threatening in his un-demonic threatening manner and Thor trying to say something that sounded credible.<br/><br/>Sorry....just can't get behind this one despite the fact that I'm old school D&D and really wanted to see a great movie in this vein since there are so terribly few that ever make it to the big time."

","Thor wasn't a bad film, there was definitely a brilliant film in there somewhere but poor pacing, bad editing and marvel studios obsession with trying to shoehorn in avenger references ultimately left me feeling underwhelmed and somewhat disappointed.<br/><br/>To keep this simple i'll start with the characters/actor, then the plot and finally the directing.<br/><br/>Characters - Thor in my opinion was perfectly cast, hems-worth not only looks the part but acted the part. He played cocky, vulnerable, angry all perfectly well and it was a treat to see him on screen and see him develop across the duration of the film (all to brief). <br/><br/>Loki stole the show by a long shot although I didn't quite feel they captured entirely the mischievous nature of his character. Hiddleston gave the best performance by a mile and you could genuinely feel his pain and anguish and it was hard not to root for his cause, he was just a boy looking for the acceptance and respect of his father. <br/><br/>Odin played by Hopkins carried scenes with the most gravitas, i got chills when he hissed at Loki and banished Thor,in fact any scene he was in would always get a smile from me. Hopkins is by far my favourite and most resilient actor working today.<br/><br/>The biggest let down of this film was Natalie port man, she has acting chops but unfortunately she didn't show them here, i couldn't really fully believe her character.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the cast they were mostly forgettable, with idris Elba's character shining through the most but he was criminally underutilised. Stellan skaarsgard should be given a tip of the hat, he played his character brilliantly and was very likable but nothing astounding here. Let it also be said that Kat dennings character was totally pointless and very irritating. She bought no humour to the film even though she was supposed to.<br/><br/>The plot was on of the high points for me, this film wasn't a story of good vs evil to save the world, it was a story of two boys both fighting for th affection and adoration of their father one which touched me, and i can say it was different to what i was used to.<br/><br/>The film was directed brilliantly and you can tell branagh was inspired bu del toro and snyder in scene in asgard and Dunham/ice giant locations. For his first foray into high budget films this was an admirable effort. I don't know who's to blame but i was really disappointed with the pacing of this film and it was definitely cut to keep it;s running time below 2 hours which is a shame because this truly could have been epic. The action scenes were fantastic which is why its such a shame that everything else was so cut so half arsed, rushed and poorly paced.<br/><br/>Asgard could've felt more populated, the scenes of Thor on earth were quite bland and uninspiring and i cant say i really felt anything hems worth and portmans relationship.<br/><br/>All in all its a brilliant summer romp but i recommend you Don't see it in 3d, because the 3d is rubbish.<br/><br/>7/10"
"Favog","5","1","4","22 May 2011"," Well, now I've seen it
","Saw it in 3D, in fact.<br/><br/>It's all about a comic book superhero who's also a Norse god with Norse god friends and relatives. They live Norse god lives in a quadrant of outer space called Asgard and not everybody is who he thinks he is and people can fall asleep at the drop of a helmet and their enemies live in a deep freeze and if you displease Dad you can get banished to Earth without a hammer. The parts of the movie that take place in Asgard are excruciatingly, watch-checkingly boring, and the parts that take place on Earth are bearable at least, and occasionally amusing.<br/><br/>Maybe it's just me; I'm not a comic book aficionado -- haven't been since adolescence about a half-century ago -- so I suppose much of this movie's charm must inevitably be lost on me. But I'm not a total snob about these things -- I did enjoy IRON MAN (cleverly referenced in this film) and I liked the entire middle of BATMAN BEGINS. I just think there was less to like here. Much less.<br/><br/>And I can't quit without mentioning that once again I'm convinced 3D is a worthless gimmick that not only adds nothing of value to the experience of viewing movies like this (and AVATAR and UP and 15 minutes of HARRY POTTER and even IMAX in outer space), but it detracts from my viewing pleasure. Why do so many people seem not to care that watching a movie through sunglasses filters out the color? All scenes in THOR were mostly brown and uniformly dark and ugly. I tried watching without the glasses for a while, and as long as the focus of the scene was on the middle distance, everything looked almost good -- almost acceptable, in fact. But anything close or far was blurry, so eventually I gave up and got with the ugly dark brown program. Three-D is a stupid idea, worthless and stupid and it needs to have a wooden stake driven through its wretched heart so it can slither back to the grave where we buried it in the '50s."

","I never really wanted to see this movie in the first place...I thought it looked stupid from the early trailers, but then I thought it looked funny from the later ones. Needless to say, I had low expectations going in. My coworker said it was good so I went to see it.<br/><br/>I'd give it a C.<br/><br/>The film doesn't ""fail"" at anything it tries to do, but it aspires to so little. It's your typical superhero-being-discovered story. The necessary elements are all there, and arguably they are carried out adequately...and that's all this film is, ""adequate."" I saw no spark of character in anyone or anything in the story. Yeah, it's a comic book, it's going to be cliché, but at least make it your own. Except for the Norse names, every line of dialogue felt like it had been heard before a hundred times. Seriously.<br/><br/>None of the actors gets a chance to do much...the entire movie feels like it could've been done in one episode of Xena. Loki and the (gatekeeper?) bothered to show some depth and it was noted. The big bad ice guy (yeah, I don't remember his name) was to me the most compelling of the entire cast. Still, this is all based on physicality...their dialogue never moved me one way or the other.<br/><br/>The one thing that made this film stand out is art direction. The outer-space fantasy elements are quite stunning (if not overly CG), and some of the costumes are also really good.<br/><br/>The action in the movie was also fairly by-the-numbers. Except for Thor's hammer, there's nothing new here.<br/><br/>Lastly, I thought this movie would be funny (like Scorpion King), but not so much. There were a few laughs to be had, but the film mostly takes itself seriously...which is too bad. I would've much rather preferred a film that makes more fun of itself...especially in this case."
"glofau","6","1","4","19 May 2011"," Mindless, Family-Friendly Action Picture
","When I was a child in the 70's, I was a real comic book nut. If this movie had been put on the big screen in 1976, I would have been beside myself with joy. For my middle-aged self today, however, I must say that Thor left me feeling somewhat indifferent.<br/><br/>I liked the fact that Thor is an old-fashioned family film. There's a lot of violence but it's cartoon violence, not realistic, so it doesn't nauseate you like most action movies do today. Thor is also not salacious, which is refreshing; there is only one kiss and no lovemaking. The only person who shows any skin at all is Chris Hemsworth as Thor, and if I had worked as hard as he has to develop his musculature I would demand to show it off, too!<br/><br/>The film is lavishly produced. The costumes were fitted beautifully and the armor and capes were blocked as perfectly as a Philip Treacy hat... and were equally as outlandish! The sets, lighting, effects... all beautiful, even surreal. When I'm relaxing with a flagon of mead, staring into the gigantic firepit in my cathedral-like living room, there's nothing I like better than to wear full dress armor and a cape! And the Asgard skyline with the inexplicably floating geometric buildings made a fitting homage to classic Thor artist Jack Kirby. I did feel a little sorry for poor Natalie Portman as Jane Foster; the nicest outfit she got to wear was t-shirt and jeans! But everything was lovely to look at... if somewhat lacking in inspired artistry.<br/><br/>The main problem with this movie is the character story, which is weak. How and why do Thor and Jane Foster fall for one another? God only knows! Jane must only be thinking with her crotch because Thor is stunning; nothing else seems to happen between the two of them. I mean, this picture makes Legally Blonde seem deep. And Loki as the quasi-villain... I won't spoil the ending by going into his motivations but the writing and Tom Hiddleston's performance are not very convincing.<br/><br/>Nor does the plot make very much sense. I mean, everything mostly works but the story seems very formulaic... such and such happens on page 27, the climax on page 82, etc. Does the climax of the picture really make any sense? So much that happens in Thor seems pointless and anti-climactic, however grippingly it is presented... the script feels less than heartfelt.<br/><br/>Kenneth Branagh's direction and Paul Rubell's editing make this picture flow along with great pacing, and are really a triumph of movie magic over substance. Patrick Doyle's score is gripping and effective without leaving one with any memorable themes. Anthony Hopkins as Odin really submerges himself in the character to great effect, and Chris Hemsworth is a terrific Thor, full of bravado and bonhomie and hail-fellow-and-well-met swashbuckle-yness. Natalie Portman does a great job with a largely thankless role as the love interest. And the rainbow coalition of racially integrated actors forming the supporting Nordic gods do a fine job... although what they're doing in this Scandinavian realm is beyond me. The special effects are great, beautifully done. It's a very nicely made film and a fun ride, if a little boring in places and lacking in inspiration overall... but check your brain at the door, because there is nothing under the hood. And watch for Chris Hemsworth's beautiful upper body exposed about halfway through, because that's all the skin you're going to see in the entire picture!"
"zetes","8","1","4","15 May 2011"," Perfectly decent superhero flick
","Marvel re-uses its Iron Man strategy by throwing far too much talent at a comic book movie. The results are, much like with Iron Man, actually pretty good, though quite far from great. Chris Hemsworth stars as the Norse god. The story takes place in both Asgard and Midgard (Earth). In Asgard, Thor has led an attack against the Frost Giants. Odin, his father (Anthony Hopkins), banishes Thor to Earth and gives his kingdom over to Thor's scheming brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston). The other gods (including a black and Asian one, although, who cares, they're played by Idris Elba and Tadanobu Asano!) are suspicious of Loki and plan to get Thor back. On Earth, Thor is now a mortal. A big dude, still, but he finds that little things like getting hit by cars to be quite painful. He's discovered by a team of astrophysicists (Natalie Portman, in her third movie of 2011, Stellan Skarsgard and Kat Dennings). Portman thinks that Thor might know something about the weird atmospheric disturbances she's been documenting lately. It's a fun movie. Although it's mostly just CGI, Asgard is always great to look at. When they do use sets, they're cool. And the costume design, while a tad silly, is wonderful to look at. The Earth sequences would probably be a lot less fun, but the writers have a great sense of humor. The fish-out-of-water stuff is very funny, especially the scene where Thor enters a pet store and demands a horse. The actors mostly do a good job. Hemsworth, a relative newcomer, looks like he might be a mindless hunk or a wrestler-turned-actor, but he does a good job. He has a certain charm which most people who look like underwear models don't. Portman kind of fails, but the script is mostly to blame. There's very little time for a romantic angle, but they've shoved it in anyway, and it's pretty unconvincing. My favorite performances were from Hiddleston, who perhaps has the most complexly written character in the movie, and Elba, whom I didn't recognize at first past his costume and glowing yellow eyes. He's definitely the coolest character in the movie. Kat Dennings is really funny with her scene-stealing role as a political science student who is only working with Portman for the college credits. Dennings is a star in the making (check her out in the excellent Defendor) and probably should already be bigger than she is. One could complain that there's too much setting up of the Avengers movie, due out next year, but I generally don't mind that. I like the connectedness of the Marvel films (this one calls out Iron Man and the Hulk). A couple of the Avengers preview sequences are somewhat confusing, though. Like that guy who looks a little like Jeremy Renner (played by Jeremy Renner) who is ordered to snipe Thor but then picks up a bow and arrow, or the completely baffling post-credits sequence with Samuel L. Jackson (seriously, I couldn't make any sense of what was going on there)."
"Guardia","6","1","4","11 May 2011"," Not Quite What I THORt
","'Thor' makes an excellent start as pseudo-historical action adventure, but its misguided focus on redundant elements within the script mean that the film falls short of the promise it makes early on. We begin at Asgard: it is portrayed artistically, magically, and convincingly - a golden, sacred, Romanesque kingdom ruled by the father-figure of the film: Odin.<br/><br/>Sir A. Hopkins plays this character spot-on; he expresses wrath, pathos and vulnerability interchangeably. Under-used throughout the script, he is given only a moderate chance to flex his divine will and power, and he is put away fairly annoyingly to make way for the less convincing and single-sided character of Loki (portrayed unevenly by T. Hiddleston).<br/><br/>Like all modern comic-to-film adventures, the fish-out-of-water mechanism is employed in what seems to be an ever shortening delay from the film's outset. Read: Thor is banished to Earth. Here he we see a cast of supporting players (N. Portman et al) who give Thor the vast majority of his admittedly explanatory dialog. There are a few tries at comic relief here (just how *would* a man-god react to a modern hospital, restaurant and so on...?), but they are fleeting.<br/><br/>Action sequences are just as sparse, and even more baffling is that they are really rather small-scale. Lack of scope is what the film suffers from - and what seemed like the beginning of the end sequence was revealed to be *the* end sequence. Choreography is mixed too; there are some satisfying big hits, but they have to make their way through scrambling, scuffling brawls. Thor's most interesting enemy is dispatched late in the film, but this sequence seems to have arrived too late to have any sway on the plot for this viewer.<br/><br/>3D effects are well executed, and the typical cheap shots of pointy things for the sake of pointy things is tastefully avoided. When it *does* happen, it is with purpose and sound timing. Visuals are smartly married to excellent sound design, the technical aspects are what carry this film through its slumbering second-reel.<br/><br/>Cinematography is victim to repeated tilting of the frame. There is hardly a square shot in the film, and all mid-to-close shots are tilted up to 45-degrees or less. Even establishing shots are annoyingly angled, disfiguring the space of the sets and disorientating the viewer from the physicality of the character movements and local spaces of scenes.<br/><br/>Performances are apt all round - it is a testament to the performers to see them break through some of the stilted characterizations. Thor himself is well played, though most of the performance is carried by physical presence, not emotive expression or dialog. His goofy costume is accurate but plasticy, his comrades literally look like sci-fi convention-goers. I exaggerate not.<br/><br/>The film is worthwhile overall, but suffers from a small-minded script. At least Odin, blessed with divine knowledge, managed to take a nap through the dullest areas of the film. For this, I envied the Gods."
"mirwais-orbit","6","1","4","10 May 2011"," Just an ordinary spectacle
","The biggest problem about comic book adaptations is that sometimes movies are too short for them. That's the problem about Thor. I'm not familiar to the comic book, but it's clear that the story has much more than what 2 hours can offer and it's impossible to digest all at once no matter how long the movie could be. Kenneth Branagh's efforts to transform it into a Shakespearean thing is just an attempt to give to a comic book adaptation a different approach intensifying some mythological beauties and artistic layout within traditional direction techniques so Thor wouldn't be called just another regular action movie full of special effects. But in fact that's what the movie is, an ordinary action movie full of ambition as well as its main character. The movie fails to specify the audience it wants to achieve shooting everywhere and everyone as possible, giving the feeling that sometimes you are watching Henry V with lame dialogs played at a Comic Con event by amateur young actors.<br/><br/>The movie is more beautiful than interesting: the special effects are better than the dialogs and the visuals are better than the plot. Chris Hemsworth did what he was supposed to and Natalie Portman is beautiful and responsible to give the charisma that the movie lacks. Kenneth took a comic book character serious enough giving a huge blockbuster spectacle and limiting the layers he wanted to give instead of just defining it. Thor isn't what it seems to be and that makes it a little frustrating. Kenneth Branagh was responsible for the longest Hamlet adaptation, so of course you can expect hours of useless progress and a movie full of things that regular action movies shouldn't care.<br/><br/>Anyway, the movie isn't bad, but isn't better than other comic book adaptations, but at the same time you can't ignore the fact that it's entertaining most of all because gives one of the best visual effects sequences so far in 2011, the acting is fair and also is Mr. Branagh's first step into action movies."
"Ryan_MYeah","8","1","4","9 May 2011"," One of the most inspired superhero movies to come out in recent years.
","Since the Summer movie season is officially upon us, I'm very glad that it has started off with a bang with the release of the latest superhero movie Thor. Forgive me if I sound somewhat geeky during my review, because I just happened to really, really like this movie.<br/><br/>It stars Chris Hemsworth as the powerful, but arrogant god of thunder Thor, a man who resides in the fantastic realm of Asgard ruled by his father, Odin (Played by Anthony Hopkins), who always seems to favor Thor over his more subdued brother Loki (Played with wry subtlety by Tom Hiddleston). After going against his father's wishes and unleashing a brief attack on an enemy colony (Including a virtually unrecognizable Colm Feore in fantastic makeup), he is banished from Asgard and sent to earth, where he's discovered by a team of scientists lead by the persistent Jane Foster (Played convincingly by Natalie Portman), and with her help seeks to reclaim his sacred hammer which holds his power, and return to his home.<br/><br/>If you're familiar with his previous directorial pedigree, you'd swear that an action film based on a Marvel comic centered on Norse mythology would be the last project Shakespearean thespian Kenneth Branagh would be attached to, but thank God for this man. This movie is every bit as much a breath of fresh air as 2008's Iron Man.<br/><br/>As you would expect, the film is exciting and quite funny, but what I find most fascinating is how Branagh establishes his own take on the superhero genre through his pacing and the direction of his cast. It's a bit hammy to be certain, but in a rather delightful way, because you can detect the doses of Shakespearean undertones that he infuses into the film. His cast is terrific, they're fully fleshed out, and they never take the film more seriously than it needs to be.<br/><br/>The movie is also impeccably designed, boasting fantastic sets and costumes, marvelous visual effects, and inventive sound design by Richard King, fresh off an Oscar win for Inception, and hopefully on his way to another nomination.<br/><br/>It is worth noting that the romance subplot is not always great, and there's a couple lines that unnecessarily provide further levity than need be, but I must commend Branagh for committing to this project, and for creating a movie that is entirely sure of itself, and entirely entertaining. Just be sure to stay for a special scene at the very end of the credits if seeing Jeremy Renner in a brief cameo as Hawkeye isn't enough to brace you for the upcoming Avengers feature in 2012.<br/><br/>I give Thor *** out of ****"

","The Marvel movies of the past years have had only one disappointment, and that was with ""Hulk"" which starred Eric Bana. Thor can be added to the past Marvel films that have made a mark on the cinematic world. I am not a hardcore fan when it comes to the Thor Comic books, but I know him well enough to know what the film version should include.<br/><br/>While there is much to work with for the film I was still wary as to how they would pursue the film version and make Thor as successful as Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, and so on; but they did it splendidly and the end result is a fantastic movie experience with amazing stunts and graphics.<br/><br/>The storyline was solid moving from the Asgard to Earth made the movie much more interesting then having it set in one world. The sets were elaborate, beautiful, and very appropriate for the Norse Gods; and on top of that the futuristic style of the costumes added more to the sets and really brought the characters to life. Another aspect that made the movie was beside the heavyweight actors such as Natalie Portman, Stellan Skarsgard, and Anthonly Hopkins, brought relatively unknown actors to the big screen which added a sense a mystery as to what the audience can expect from the cast.Chris Hemsworth was fantastic, i'm eager to see him in the Avengers; the performances from his friends (Sif,Loki...)complimented his performance brilliantly. But I believe the film to be complete with Darcy (Kat Dennings) she made the movie funny in all the right places.<br/><br/>With that I give this movie a 9/10 because as great as the movie was, it was not perfect some small flaws were, and I know that this is mean, but Natalie actually bugged me at times with her performance. I felt that she was too serious an actress to do this type of film, but as stated it wasn't a horrible performance from her just momentary instances where I was like ""oh my god."" But like anything else its a matter of opinion and preference to which everyone is entitled to. But enjoy the movie for it is a fun and wild ride."
"ARTaylor","10","1","4","9 May 2011"," Excellent Introduction to the Expansive Marvel Lore
","I have to say that Thor is my current favorite of Marvel's movies, though tied with Iron Man at the moment. I absolutely loved every single moment of it.<br/><br/>While I love Thor, I have to admit I don't really know too much about him. Like Iron Man before, I knew of him and some basics about the character but not enough to know much going into the movie. I watched the Hulk vs Thor animated video and his few appearances on animated series. While I am learning and reading more about him, I certainly didn't know him like I do Spider-Man, the X-Men, or Batman. Like Iron Man, this movie really makes me want to learn more about his history and read his comics. Perhaps my inexperience with him made me more open to the movie.<br/><br/>I loved how it was a superhero origin story that wasn't just like every other single origin story. It isn't the usual ""man discovers powers, man learns powers, man uses powers to become hero."" Thor's already the hero with powers. He has to learn to use them wisely. Thor's whole story arc was terrific. I especially love the moment when Mjolnir returns to Thor. It was especially powerful and people were even cheering at that.<br/><br/>The cast was perfect from top to bottom. Not a single miscast actor or badly delivered line. These characters could easily come off cheesy, especially if they started spouting out too many thee's, thou's and verily's. Instead they're seriously done interpretations of how they would interact in the modern world.<br/><br/>The characterizations were wonderful. I loved Thor in every scene. From his arrogance in Asgard to his fish-out-of- water on Earth. Loki was the best and most dynamic villain since X-Men's Magneto. It's hard to tell whether the God of Mischief is sincere or just plotting his plans. Even the smaller parts were wonderful.<br/><br/>Of anything, Kenneth Branagh and Thor were made for each other. His sensibilities derived from his Shakespeare works combined perfectly with the style that Jon Favreau started with the universe. He had an excellent combination of action and humor without any one element overwhelming the others.<br/><br/>I thought the 3D was very effective. It was spectacular in the Asgard and Jotunheim sequences. Though I also thought it looked good in the Earth scenes. 3D can easily get gimmicky with things popping out into the audience, or it can be completely unnecessary and a distraction. Thor does neither. It really helps to project the majesty of Asgard, the dark looming of Jotunheim, and the expansiveness of New Mexico.<br/><br/>The music was one of the best I have heard in quite some time. I went purchased the soundtrack as soon as I could find it. It perfectly blends the epicness of the battle sequences with the more subtle moments between two characters<br/><br/>I have only two things I don't like about the film. First, was that Hawkeye was basically a waste and completely unnecessary. It seemed to be in there just to have an obligatory cameo than anything else. Two, that they didn't expand on the Thor and Sif love story like they should have. She's supposed to be Thor's love interest since childhood. I read one comic where she was very jealous of Amora and Brunnhilde. But there's not one shot or mention of her reacting to Jane and Thor's relationship.<br/><br/>Like Iron Man, the movie was so much fun and enjoyable that I easily overlooked any flaws. It helped to set up The Avengers without focusing too much on it, like what happened to Iron Man 2. I certainly look forward to more.<br/><br/>My rating: 10/10"

Once I heard Chris Hemsworth voice I was like yeah this is THOR! It was very commanding,not Gerard Butler loud but very commanding! The movie is well written with a strong mix of Heroic-ness and ROM-COM bits in to it as well. Chris Hemsworth held his own in the movie despite with Hollywood heavyweights like Anthony Hopkins and Natalie Portman. I didn't think they could pull off complexities in comics like Asgard, the heroic side and Earth which is the rom-com side. Well mixed together I doubt they can make a sequel that's well written like this but I really hope they can!"

However, if you go in expecting to be entertained for two hours and not be grossed out, offended, depressed, or bored, you'll get that. The main actor is good, the side characters are tolerable, the plot is easy to follow but pretty much sticks to the source material (not being a comic reader--my comic buff fiancée watched it and wasn't distressed by any changes), the CGI is really nice, especially for the city of Asgard, and the sound is fantastic, it's really realistic and has a strong impact without actually being loud. There's the general swords and sorcery battling, but no gore, no sex, no real violence or scary scenes, it's just good clean cool-guy-with- powers-doing-cool-stuff and the scenes in the human world are actually quite amusing without being painfully awkward or overdone.<br/><br/>Summary: 7/10, because it did everything it should as a superhero movie but didn't go above and beyond in any way."
"CSHaviland","7","1","4","7 May 2011"," A surprising superhero movie, but could have been better
","I had often wondered how they would introduce Thor at the movies, because unlike most of the other Marvel superheroes thus far, Thor in his comic origins has a basis in mythology rather than science fiction (or science fantasy, if you take my meaning) and originates off- world. Like Superman, he comes from a fantastic planet whose science and physics are so beyond ours that from our viewpoint it is magic. (This does not explain why they all look human, but let's not go there.)<br/><br/>What I imagined from the movie was that they would feature Asgard at the beginning, for an origin sequence, and the rest would take place on Earth. Turns out, Kenneth Branagh and the writers plotted the movie on Asgard for at least 50% of the screen time. This, I think, saved the movie. The otherworldly sequences were the most interesting and important elements of the story, and looked fantastic. This not a movie about Thor on Earth, it's a movie about Thor's conflicts with his father Odin and his sneaky step-brother Loki, wherein his banishment to Earth was just a part of the story arc. <br/><br/>Part of the problem with the Earth-side story is that it's boring. It's set in a very small New Mexico town in the desert. Thor befriends an ambitious astronomical researcher Jane Foster, played by Natalie Portman, whose character seems to have no real depth because we never get to know her personally. In fact somehow he falls in love with her, but I'm not sure how or why this happened. At any rate, the major battle scene on Earth takes place between Thor (with his entourage, who comes to fetch him) and a powerful golem from Asgard that seems remotely controlled by Loki (somehow). The golem (the Destroyer from the comics) was great, but he trashes nothing more than a tiny desert town. Or more specifically, main street in the tiny town (although I don't think there are many other streets to trash). Thor defeats him, end of the Destroyer. That's it? To me this missed a huge opportunity for a more epic battle. It should have taken place in a huge metropolis. Perhaps a Northern European city (because why does it always happen in America?) closer to where apparently the wormholes interacted with the Norse (resulting in the mythology). In fact if Thor crashed in New Mexico, fine, but I would have had his hammer land in Scandinavia or thereabouts, which would have made for a much nicer backdrop, and thus drawing our characters and the conflict to that region. I would have had the Destroyer toppling skyscrapers and smashing castles before Thor could stop him, leaving a path of destruction several hundred miles long through Europe. Not little old Western stores and a café. And the Destroyer should have made a much bigger mess of his friends.<br/><br/>So had the movie spent all its time in a little New Mexico town and its surrounding desert and not returned to Asgard or Jotunheim (the world of the Frost Giants, enemies of the Asgardians) for action, the movie would have fallen flat on its face. <br/><br/>I suppose there could have been a budgetary reason why they didn't ""go urban"" on the Earth- side, because special effects of this rendering scale are not cheap, and they did front-load quite a bit on Asgard.<br/><br/>Chris Hemsworth was okay as Thor, but the character seemed a little too winky and toothy at times. I would have had him cocky and snobby, but not so chipper. His friends seemed a little too much like a bunch of ""hang-out dudes"" (plus childhood gal-pal) than a band of adventurers. I would have made them a little more serious. Chris Hemsworth in particular does look like Thor -- well chiseled and sufficiently Scandinavian looking -- but his acting doesn't have a lot of believable range. He'll need to work on that.<br/><br/>All in all it was a good, but not great, movie. It will not come close to the success of Iron Man or Iron Man 2. But it wasn't a flawed mess like the first Hulk movie was.<br/><br/>BTW: the 3d is worth it for the space sequences and Asgard. And as with all the Avengers-era movies, need I mention, wait for the Easter Egg at the tail of the end credits."

","How well did Marvel and the makers do on this film? Absolutely excellent! Now there are some bad reviews out there, not exactly sure why but there are some nonetheless. Yet for me, I like it! What I found is this movie was more a movie about Thor and Asgard and Norse Religion then a simple comic book. The only thing to do with a comic book was the makers and S.H.E.I.L.D. The movie mainly was about the realm Asgard and about a man, Thor who gets exiled on Earth and his evil brother. Simple! As if it was taken out of a Norse story told over a thousand years ago.<br/><br/>The story was a bit predictable but then that is what happens when they make thousands of movies every year. Our minds are simply able to predict various outcomes in movies because we have seen so many movies in our lives that its trained to think that way. But it was a good story also.<br/><br/>I liked this movie, it is up there with my favorites from Marvel like X-Men (all), Iron Man and the Incredible Hulk."
"jgregg42","8","1","4","6 May 2011"," ""Thor"" the God of Kicking Butt
","First off, I do not consider myself a fan boy or a comic book guy. I grew up on Mad Magazine and their clever fold-ins. The only exposure I had to the comic book ""Thor"" was as a kid I received the free copies from my dentist office. I think it was ""Thor vs. the Cavity Creeps"" or some lame knock-off like that. When I heard that Thor the God of Thunder was making the transition from comic book to his own big screen movie I was cautious. Who wants to see some guy swing his hammer and speak in Old Norse for two hours? I am man enough to admit when I am wrong (I am also the same guy that doubted ""Ironman"" would be a huge success). I was wrong for questioning that stage and screen expert Kenneth Branagh (""Henry V,"" ""Much Ado About Nothing"""") would not deliver a stellar movie. Branagh has the ability to pull a strong performance from his cast without forcing them to over act. He also has the ability to create a supernatural world, Asgard, where Thor and his family of gods reign. Branagh and his art production team present Asgard as a tangible place for gods to live.<br/><br/>In the first few minutes we begin our story in Norway and discover how the Frost Giants come to earth to destroy humans. King Odin (played by Anthony Hopkins) and his army defeat the Frost Giants. We are soon attending a beautiful ceremony where Odin's son Thor (played by Chris Hemsworth) is about to be crowned king of Asgard. Due to a breach in security the ceremony is cut short. Out of anger and vanity Thor gathers his friends to break a truce with the Frost Giants and launches an attack. After Odin discovers what has happened, he furiously banishes his son to Earth, along with Thor's famous hammer, Mjolnir.<br/><br/>Thor crash-lands on earth where he is no longer the once powerful god; he is just a regular guy (a regular guy who looks like he's been doing P90X since puberty). A scientist, Jane (played by Natalie Portman) and her team literally runs into Thor. Jane is trying to discover a wormhole between our world and others in the universe. The two soon realize that they each have what the other one wants and soon become allies.<br/><br/>This is the part where you should start paying close attention. Not because you get a history lesson on Norse mythology but because Marvel Studios is combining their super heroes to make an ""Avengers"" movie in 2012. Thor will be one of the Avengers and there are quite a few references of these heroes and characters from the Marvel Universe - Hawkeye, Ironman, Phil Coulson from S.H.I.E.L.D., etc.<br/><br/>Thor, now without his powers, must be reunited with his mighty hammer, which as fate would have is only 50 miles from him. While Thor is fighting to win back his hammer and return to Asgard, his brother Loki (played by Tom Hiddleston), the God of Mischief, is stirring up trouble between the Frost Giants and Asgard. The entire story climaxes in a way that you would imagine with any comic book movie; good vs. evil, cocky hero learns a valuable lesson, several awesome fight scenes, that whole thing.<br/><br/>Should you see this movie? Yes. It's has action, humor and some outstanding art direction to develop the mythical worlds. Do you need to see it in 3D? Not necessarily. The 3D was too dark in some of the action scenes at night and didn't add much to the day time scenes. As a stand alone story ""Thor"" can hold the audience's attention even if they aren't avid fans of the comic book."
"MovieMystro","Null","1","4","6 May 2011"," Dramatic yet FUN, Very Well Done!
","Thor works on so many levels. It meets its toughest challenge and that is to make its super powerful blond godlike lead character relatable and spark a connection to the audience. For all the action extravagance and adventure, a surprising and pleasant amount of time is devoted to character establishment and development. This certainly isn't some wild video game popcorn flick. It also packs the perfect amount of comedy, with most of the jokes at Thor's expense. Cutting a god down to size, is important for two reasons. One, the story itself is about Thor learning humility and two, it makes the character more believable and more relatable. It's what Marvel does best, give us heroes with flaws.<br/><br/>A lot of this film takes place in the modern era on contemporary Earth and that was absolutely the right way to present the film. That's not to say that there aren't fantastical element, Asgard is breathtaking and incredible. Still, they manage to be dramatic and serious most of the time but balance it with a sense of humor. Thor finds the right mix similar to the way Iron Man did back in 2008. The film never becomes too self-important or portentous but still is dramatic and fun. The most fun outside of the incredible action sequences is when the consequences of the culture clash is played up. That is something to savor and enjoy. The fish-out-of-water angle is played up perfectly. They take a ""hero"" or wannabe hero who is arrogant by temperament and used to having his own way and place him in a position where he has to grow. All the while using comic friction as a great tool to advance the plot and the development. Thor tries to continue to live his own reality because in his mind, he's still prince of Asgard. It's both fun and interesting to watch him come to grips with his situation. As he is humbled and out of place, audiences enjoy recognizing his human traits. Sure, viewers are thrilled by his powers, but we relate to his emotions and his flaws. Add some intense sibling rivalry, great action and romantic entanglements and Thor may just be the best movie of the summer."
"jackyc-123","6","1","4","4 May 2011"," Nice effects and cinematography, cheesy and predictable script/plot
","The only reason why I've not given this a 4 out of 10 is because the computer graphics of Asgard really impressed me, the camera angles and screen play was also very tight, and the music/ sound effects aren't bad either, so from an aesthetical perspective this is a good movie. However, some of the lines in this film are simply cringeworthy. The romance between Thor and Natalie Portman's character simply didn't work for me, it was too cheesy even for a low budget Disney children's cartoon. I think they tried to make the film too ""epic"", like a wannabee lord of the rings, but it doesn't work. And while I don't think that the film pretends to be a serious gritty thriller, it lacks the substance to be anything else other than a poorly scripted action movie. The concept is good, and it's a shame more time and effort wasn't put into writing a better script. If they removed the romance factor this wouldn't be an alright movie."

"cuppa_tetleys","8","1","4","3 May 2011"," Best Marvel film, second best superhero film I've ever seen
","Marvel really have outdone themselves this time with their independent films, creating a mind-blowing motion picture with Thor, the Viking God of thunder, that I consider to be the best superhero film behind The Dark Knight I've ever seen. It's rare that I get this kind of excitement out of watching a film; it's even rarer that I go to see a film twice in the theatre, but Thor has brought about these phenomenons.<br/><br/>These are easily some of the greatest visuals if not the best visuals to date, and for me it trumped Avatar in the special effects department. Yeah, I said it. But it's so much more than just the spectacle that Avatar was (that's all Avatar was to me, Yeah I said it), the action is fantastic, the characters are endlessly entertaining (especially the Viking God on Earth) and both story and script are tight and well-paced, no slow points.<br/><br/>An interesting thing is that one of the things I really liked about Thor, but that possibly kept it from being even better, was it's focus of narrative. It is simply about a super-powered God finding his way, that's it. About as deep as it gets. And that's exactly what I love; you awe at the entertainment the characters, action and the thrill of experiencing it provide, without delving into extreme darkness or emotion that a lot films tend toward nowadays; the notion of 'gritty' and 'realistic'. This is why I compare it to the The Dark Knight; Nolan did the realistic thing extremely well to great success, yet Thor is the opposite - a completely outlandish tale involving Gods and magic that, although while dealing with some of Thor's personal problems, never goes too deep, that keeps you entertained, not shocked or moved.<br/><br/>You'll know the best part in this film when you see it, and it just childishly excites to a level that I have never felt with any of the previous Marvel films. My favourite Marvel film was Iron Man, but this makes Iron Man look dated.<br/><br/>Overall I highly, highly recommend this film and if you haven't seen it yet, DO. ASAP. AND THEN BUY IT ON BLU-RAY."
"kapiniaris","7","1","4","3 May 2011"," good effort...!!!
","Undoubtedly ""Thor"" is a good movie and maybe one of the best movies about comic heroes. I must admit that the beginning of the film was really amazing and some scenes remind me the lord of the rings (my favorite movie ever).However from the middle of the movie and until the end, unfortunately, the rhythm was calmed down and the movie lost the interest which had engender from the beginning. Anyway, the choice of Anthony Hopkins as a king was utterly successful and the same I can say for the actor who play the ""THOR"". In general terms I enjoyed the film and I anticipate to see the sequel with quite more action,and this time at vikings time....!!!!"
"Prichards12345","7","1","4","1 May 2011"," An improvement on Iron Man 2
","Which was, of course, Marvel's last super hero outing. That film, while not bad, felt like an extended trailer for the Avengers at times; happily Marvel have avoided such a mistake in this movie. Thor for the most part works very well; Kenneth Branagh directs with a sure hand, Chris Hemsworth is an excellent Thor, and Tom Hiddleston is equally impressive as his conniving foster brother Loki.<br/><br/>This is a film that could easily have been a disaster - the concept of the actual God of Thunder walking around in our world is as far out there as Marvel goes, yet it's laced with humour, largely manages to avoid camp (incredibly!) and is full of spectacular images. Asgard is marvellously conceived, particularly Bifrost, the Rainbow Bridge, and the movie contains enough cosmic grandeur to satisfy Jack Kirby's legions of fans. Kirby gave the original comic a brilliant visual panache, and Thor does not disgrace its origins. The Warriors Three are fun, too.<br/><br/>On the minus side, Natalie Portman's Jane Foster doesn't really contribute to the story that much, and perhaps the film is a shade overlong. The post credit sequence is a little disappointing, too.<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins brings his usual stature to Odin, and Jotunheim, home of the Frost Giants, is hugely impressive. And as we all know Thor will be back in The Avengers, the ending doesn't lay it on with a trowel. The music is stirring and compelling and in Loki we have a complex yet surprisingly sympathetic villain. I'd say Thor is one of Marvel's best efforts so far."

","Among the early Marvel movies, Kenneth Branagh's ""Thor"" is easily the most visually stunning entry. Branagh's camera is as much a character here as anybody else, moving fluidly across the movie without drawing attention to itself, and heightening the movie's themes and visual iconography along the way. Additionally, Chris Hemsworth is perfectly cast in the titular role, bringing considerable charm and superstar charisma to an otherwise unmemorable role, but it's Tom Hiddleston's electrifying performance as Loki that manages to grip the viewer's attention in every scene he's in. The story itself is almost negligible because the Marvel movies concentrate more on moving the overarching narrative forward, but ""Thor"" manages to demarcate itself from its brethren through Branagh's extraordinary direction and his knack with actors."

","This is an extraordinarily bad film by any standard. I DO like the occasional over-the-top comic book fantasy, but this is just a mindless hodgepodge of hot air. Relentless and indulgent CGI, dreadful acting, the most laughable dialogue coupled with an inflated soundtrack and a hopelessly idiotic and disjointed storyline DO NOT make a watchable movie. Vacuous, noisy and utterly pointless. Save your popcorn for something else.
Truly Much Ado About Nothing, Mr. Branagh - but certainly not by Shakespeare."
"kinson_lao","3","1","5","15 December 2011"," Thor,
","I've always been cautious about watching superhero movies, knowing full well that their loyal fan base laud the movie for being something better than what it is. Having read numerous positive reviews on the newspaper (I'm sorry now that I didn't check IMDb first) I decided that Thor seemed like a good choice to spend a lazy afternoon watching. Oh how wrong I was. Even for a superhero action movie, the character development was utterly pitiful and the actors, well I honestly don't know what they were doing there. Anthony Hopkins was the only noteworthy performance, yet I expected nothing less than him. The film spends an excruciating 45-55 minutes or so explaining the background and lore of this universe yet fails depict Thor's transformation from an arrogant meat-head, into some chivalrous gentleman, in a remotely believable manner I mean, really? 2 to 3 Days? He's a the future King of Asgard for god-sake, not a faithless call girl. As a matter of fact, Loki seems a far more likable and relatable character. He is responsible(mostly), wise, and portrayed as rather a love deprived delinquent, remotely malignant and the very least jealous character, as opposed than the self-righteous, prototypical pretty boy, Thor. While the idea of an ambiguous antagonist may be acceptable in art-house cinema, it should be painfully obvious who the villain is in a superhero movie. Obviously there should be motives to each character in a film yet, it seems Loki is much more believable than the inexplicably shifting character of Thor, who based on such seeming unjustified monumental moral shifts, one really wonders whether Loki was right in taking over as king. Honestly, all the humans, serve little to no purpose plot wise, what so ever, one must wonder why is a big name like Natalie Portman chosen to play such a puny meaningless moronic love interest role (Oh thats right, she a box office grabbing machine), let alone why do these powerful beings want anything to do with our bland Earth at all. The frequent long distance traveling that occurs in this film and the fact that it occurs equally and confoundingly in 3 separate dimensions of the ""Yggdrasil"" does nothing for the films story telling if not, detracting focus. However they do present wonderful opportunities for spectacular CGI environments and sequences(which by now are something of a standard in such films), which singularly constitute the 2 stars out of 10, the other being Anthony Hopkins who has and always be are ""stellar"" performance. (please excuse that terrible pun)"
"zardoz-13","5","1","5","20 May 2011"," Boy Gets Hammer, Loses Hammer, & Then Gets Hammer Back Saga
","Although the newest addition to the Marvel Comics' cinematic super hero pantheon boasts polished production values and a charismatic cast, ""Hamlet"" director Kenneth Branagh's ""Thor"" qualifies as business as usual. This preposterous, larger-than-life, 115-minute, PG-13 rated opus shifts scenes between contemporary New Mexico and the fabled realm of Asgard where Norse royalty reside in opulent splendor. ""Agent Cody Banks"" scenarists Ashley Edward Miller & Zack Stentz along with ""Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" scribe Don Payne gave ""Thor"" their best shot based on a story by ""Ninja Assassin"" scenarist J. Michael Straczynski and ""Poseidon"" writer Mark Protosevich. Despite those best efforts, ""Thor"" amounts to a standard-issue 'origins' epic about Odin's arrogant offspring. No surprises lurk in this predictable, but sometimes amusing epic about the hammer wielding Norse champion. Basically, ""Thor"" boils down to a boy-gets-hammer, boy-loses-hammer, and boy-gets-hammer back adventure. During this lukewarm lark, our hero acquaints himself with the meaning of humility after his stern father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) has banished him from his own celestial kingdom. Handsome Aussie stud Chris Hemsworth, cast as Captain Kirk's father in the ""Star Trek"" reboot, provides the appropriate brawn and blond hair as the eponymous hero afflicted with anger management issues. Mind you, the real Thor of lore possessed red hair and a red beard. Meantime, Academy Award winning actress Natalie Portman, Kat Dennings, and Stellan Skarsgård enliven the Earth scenes, while Oscar-winner Anthony Hopkins lords it over the Asgard scenes as the one-eyed Odin. Eventually, Thor and leading lady Jane gravitate to each other, but the film dwells on family woes more than romantic woo.<br/><br/>""Thor"" opens in Puente Antiguo, New Mexico. Astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman of ""Black Swan""), her mentor Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård of ""Good Will Hunting""), and their wiseacre assistant Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings of ""Defendor"") are in the middle of nowhere at night searching for an atmospheric anomaly. Foster collides with somebody when they plunge into a storm-like phenomena. Before we discover who they've struck, the plot propels us back in time to Norway in 965 A.D. Odin has triumphed over the evil Frost Giants, led by King Laufey (Colm Feore of ""Chicago""), in a war to thwart them from conquering Earth. Odin loses an eye and exiles these icy blue bastards to their frozen world of Jotunheim. Furthermore, Odin confiscates the Casket of Ancient Winters that serves as their source of power. Later, as Odin is about to crown Thor, some Frost Giants infiltrate Asgard and try to recover the casket. Although Odin dismisses the attempt as a botched effort, Thor wants to wage war on the Frost Giants. Odin and he resort to name-calling, and then Thor with his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston of ""Midnight in Paris"") and a quartet of his warrior comrades storm Jotunheim. When Odin learns about Thor's insubordination, he banishes his son to Earth. Thor is hurled into a ""Stargate"" wormhole and hits planet Earth about the same time that Jane slams into him with her vehicle.<br/><br/>As superhero movies go, nobody is ever in genuine jeopardy. The combat scenes generate little tension or suspense. Sure, several characters have some close scrapes with death, but nobody dies. Worse, some characters can get away with more than others because Branagh and his writers don't make us privy to their special powers. Watch Loki and you'll see. As villains rate, Loki doesn't amount to much more than a trickster, and Thor never performs anything incredibly cool, like the heroes in ""Iron Man,"" ""The Incredible Hulk,"" and ""The Fantastic Four."" Specifically, the villains don't pose much of a threat to Jane and her friends.<br/><br/>The chief problem with ""Thor"" is the less-than-gripping scripting. If you're a fan of the original Marvel Comics ""Thor"" from 1962, the Ashley Edward Miller, Zack Stentz and Don Payne version shares little in common with ""Journey into Mystery"" #83. Donald Blake is mentioned a few times in the film. In the comic book, Blake discovered a wooden staff. When he smashed it against a rock, the staff became 'Mjolnir.' Miller, Stentz, and Payne dispense with the usual human who masquerades as a superhero, and pick up the thread of the ""Thor"" comics from later incarnations. Unlike most Marvel Comics where the hero suffers from a fatal flaw, Thor has nothing comparable outside of his anger management issues. Once he finds himself separated from his supernatural hammer, he calms down enough to get it back, but he doesn't have to endure much suffering until then. <br/><br/>Anybody who can catch ""Thor"" in 2-D will enjoy the experience much more than the 3-D version. As it turns out, ""Thor"" was photographed in 2-D and then converted to 3-D. Not once do you see Thor hurl his celebrated hammer 'Mjolnir' at the camera. Indeed, nothing in the 3-D ""Thor"" flies out at you. More fly-in-your face gimmicks would have bolstered the action quotient of this lackluster effort. Nevertheless, the other special effects are beyond reproach. The otherworldly utopia that constitutes Asgard is a mixture of ""Men-in-Black"" production designer Bo Welch, ""Sleuth"" costume designer Alexandra Byrne and ""Mamma Mia!"" lenser Haris Zambarloukos. Asgard is a visual treat if you like edifices that resemble organ pipes. The African-American sentry guarding the Bifrost, Heimdall (Idris Elba of ""Takers""), seems a little incongruous, but then we live in politically enlightened times. The same holds true for one of Thor's best buddies, Hogun (Japanese actor Tadanobu Asano), who is clearly Asian. Marvel movie fans will be happy to know S.H.I.E.L.D's Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) from the ""Iron Man"" films reprises his role. Natalie Portman has little to do but slam her vehicle into our hero. The best parts of ""Thor"" take place on Earth and the fish-out-of-water story with Thor tangling with modern-day life provides the primary source of comic relief. <br/><br/>Altogether, ""Thor"" could have been more."
"ducon4","2","1","5","19 May 2011"," Disappointing
","Huge disappointment... I was excited to see this, I love super heroes movies such as Spiderman, Iron Man, Batman, X men, watchmen etc... But Thor is a failure to me. Maybe I just don't like the Thor universe. It's too super natural to me, too far fetched, the magic, the portal etc... I was well into the movie for a while, I mean there is a lot of humor and that's a big plus. The graphics are also very cool. But I felt like nothing was really new in here. The scenario just took stuff from other movies and integrated it. The big guardian robot is just a copy of the one from The day the Earth stood still from 1951. The scene where the gov. takes away the working materials belonging to Nathalie Portman has been seen and re-seen. The hammer stuck in the ground is just as in Excalibur... Also, there is a lack of credibility. For example, when Thor on earth is released from the CIA (or whatever it is) thanks to a crappy story told to the agents by the Professor after beating the xxx out of 50 federal agents and breaking into the protected area. I mean you cant go more unrealistic.<br/><br/>I felt the director tried to fool with me special effects and a few jokes thinking I would not see the rest. Btw I saw it in IMAX 3d. The 3d is very bad and not worth it at all."
"patdh1028","5","1","5","17 May 2011"," Nice looking but seriously lacking depth
","When I saw the previews of this movie, I thought it was going to be awful. When it came out and I read some positive reviews, however, I was hopeful and so I walked into the theater expecting something pretty good; some reviews put it on the same level as Dark Knight and the first Iron Man.<br/><br/>It is not even close to either level. I found the entire thing to be lacking any real character development and I thought that the plot, considering some of the character's innate traits, could have done a lot more to be less cookie-cutter predictable fairytale stuff.<br/><br/>Thor spends most of his movie time on Earth stripped of his powers (as you know if you have heard anything about it) and it is on Earth that he is supposed to become less hard-headed and fight-hungry. Well, he does; but the methods by which this happens are not obvious and in my opinion, not traumatic enough to actually induce change in what is supposed to be a stubborn and strong-willed character. One second he realizes he doesn't have the same kind of power he had back in Asgard and the next second he's cooking breakfast for the crew alongside a seriously underutilized Natalie Portman. Thor's change is apparently a light switch; he just decides to change his demeanor because he met a (very) pretty girl.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong; if I met Natalie Portman and she was remotely interested in me, I would probably decide right then and there to change a whole lot of things about myself too. But it would make for an unsubstantial movie-going experience. Nobody was challenged in the movie; every sacrifice was made without hesitation or anything less than absolute determination. For a comic hero movie that is not unforgivable, but for a movie that is supposed to be tracking the momentous changes of its main character, it is.<br/><br/>Here's to hoping Green Arrow will be better..."
"frickinfrak","3","1","5","16 May 2011"," Let down.
","I am the type that only goes to the movie theater when I feel that the move must be seen on the big screen. Action movies or movies with amazing scenery usually are the ones, like LOTR, since the theater costs so much. Which is why I usually go see the Marvel films in the theater. They are always fun, and seeing them on the big screen makes them more fun. Thor...well. Not fun. Boring. Not enough action. Any ""funny"" or exciting part, I had already seen a hundred times in the trailer. Anthony Hopkins may have been the only good thing about it, and that is just because he is Anthony Hopkins and he can do what he wants. Everything else, well, not so Marvelous."
"MBunge","6","1","5","16 May 2011"," So, this is what Marvel movies are going to be like from now on?
","Well, there's nothing in Thor that's as bad or off-putting as when Macy Grey showed up in the first Spider-Man movie. There's also nothing in Thor that's as good aswell, anything in the first Iron Man movie. It's thin on plot, stuffed with too many characters and has an imbalance with the best action, special effects and jokes all crammed into the first half. It's also got a few more interesting ideas than usual for a super-hero blockbuster, a lot of appealing performers and is as professionally done as you get for this sort of thing. If you can imagine the lowest bar a comic book adventure flick has to clear in order to be considered good, this film just barely clears it.<br/><br/>If you've never read the comic, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is the Norse god of thunder. After impetuously invading the homeworld of the Frost Giants and sparking a potential war, Thor is expelled from Asgard by his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) and stripped of his power. Thor and his magical hammer Mjolnir are both cast down to Earth, with the hammer imbedding itself in the ground under the enchantment of Odin that ""Whosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor"". While his venomous brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) schemes in Asgard, Thor falls in with astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and is forced to accept being a mere mortal. Then Loki's evil machinations make their way to Earth and Thor and a quartet of his Asgardian buddies must fight to preserve both Earth and the Realm Eternal.<br/><br/>If you want excitement, some laughs, well done special effects and to look at very pretty people on screen, you'll find all that here. Those are the minimal requirements for a blockbuster of this nature and they're not always met, so you have to give Thor credit for being Perfectly Acceptable Entertainment. If this movie isn't good enough for you, you probably shouldn't be watching this kind of movie. The only real problem for this motion picture is that we've seen super-hero flicks in just the last few years that do an awful lot better than just meeting the minimal requirements. From the comic book verisimilitude of Spider-Man 2 to the sparkling storytelling of Iron to the thematic depth of The Dark Knight, Thor doesn't measure up to those films in any way.<br/><br/>The plot is very basic and dumbed down, with Loki's slightly more complex motivations only making the simplistic nature of the other characters more obvious. And besides Thor, Loki, Odin and Jane, there's a total of 6 sidekicks for the god of thunder, two human and four Asgardian, who could have been completely eliminated from the script without losing much at all. There's also two more major supporting characters in Asgard, another major supporting character on Earth and one more minor Asgardian role. That's too freakin' many people gumming up the story. Imagine if Iron Man had tried to squeeze in 4 or 5 more major supporting characters besides Pepper Potts and James Rhodes? Imagine if Spider-Man 2 had given Peter Parker 4 more friends besides Mary Jane and Harry Osborn? Imagine if The Dark Knight had given 2 or 3 more characters as much screen time as Rachel or Alfred? There are also too many scenes where Kenneth Branagh indulges the worst quirk of modern action movies and has fight scenes that are so frenetic that you can hardly tell what's going in them.<br/><br/>Here's another example of how Thor is couple of notches down from the best of its genre. Like Iron Man, this story is about a arrogant winner learning to be responsible for himself and others. In Iron Man, that's a journey that takes Tony Stark almost the entire movie to make. In Thor, it's a transformation that happens in a single scene. Thor behaves one way before that scene and acts differently after it, causing it to feel less like personal growth and more like an afternoon spa make-over.<br/><br/>Looking good and not running aground in any narrative lulls makes Thor worth seeing. It'll be a shame if such meager accomplishments become all we can expect out of super-hero films."
"mornamsnt","4","1","5","13 May 2011"," The good thing is Natalie Portman...
","I've read some good reviews before watching this movie so I really looked forward to it. When the movie was half way I thought: hmm... it probably won't get any better. That was true. However, it actually got worse! It wasn't all bad though. Judge for yourself. The bad things: * The plot was 100% predictable, as were the dialogs. Some moments were meant to be touching or even dramatic, but they were so predictable and cliché they were just very funny. Dialogue (okay, maybe not literally but still pretty much): ""Oh dad, I just wanted to make you proud!"" ""Oh son you already have!"" Drama moment: Natalie Portman running in slow motion to Thor as he dies. Drama, drama. * The plot didn't make any sense. Okay, so Loki hated his brother (or was at least psycho jealous). Why?! No part of the movie even hints at this in their childhood! Thor was arrogant and violent in the beginning and then overnight he's this great guy who sacrifices himself for others? Jane (played by Natalie Portman) suddenly re-deciding on giving Thor a ride? Why? * Some parts made even less sense than the parts that didn't make any sense: Thor making toast with egg. Yeah, I'm sure they had a lot of experience with that in Asgard. Thor suddenly getting his hammer back. Okay, that was cheesy, but why was he alive again anyway? Wasn't he dead? * Some of the actors were really lousy, especially Thor's friends. They made some dialogs sound really enforced. Pity. * The 3D animations were plain ugly. Especially in the ""Earth"" world.<br/><br/>So... why a 4 and not a 1? Because... * The movie was so bad we're still talking about it. It was actually so bad it was funny. * There ís quite some humor in the movie. Not gonna spoil them for you, just wait and see. * Some of the actors: Jane, Thor, Odin and Loki are well cast and make the movie manageable to watch. * The animations of the other worlds (Asgard, the rainbow bridge and such) were pretty. <br/><br/>Overall, it's not a terrible movie as long as you don't take it seriously AT ALL. Unfortunately, the plot and some moments and dialogs do hint at a serious movie, and in that respect this movie is really bad."
"richard_grisham","4","1","5","13 May 2011"," Technology ?
","I find technology is a double edge sword. Technology has finally caught up to making believable Superhero movies, but at the same time story telling has suffered. I would tell the directors of the new digital age, not to let special effect replace a good story. Thor was visually pleasing (and a bit loud) movie, but I found the story simple and unimaginative. Thor so far is the weakest of the Avenger movie prequels. The disappointing story was shocking due to the caliber of actors assembled for this movie. The acting was a lot of posturing and emotion without substance. I know it's action adventure and thrill ride a minute. It did give plenty of action with some pointless encounters and a couple laughs, but I would not recommend spending money on a theater ticket for this movie."

","Thor introduce us a weird vision of the universe and its history. The main story seems too simple, however, the movie works and it does because of the incredible personification of Thor, provided by Chris Hemsworth. Now though, there are no epic battles,and there were no sense of climax. The cast could have been better, since I hated Natalie Portman perform and Stellan Skasgård does terrible, and Anthony Hopkins is boring. And come on we are talking about scandinavian culture, vikings, you can't put an asian face as one of them. Thor does not succeed on becoming a great hero movie, but the enchanting Thor might get you watching it to the end."

Normal people (not the comic obsessed people who like myths and legends) will look at this film thinking 'well I like films such as Transformers and Lord of the Rings, so I should like this??'. Sadly you'll be wrong!<br/><br/>It starts off a bit far-fetched but still bearable till half way through the film. Then it becomes so stupid its not worth trying to follow as it became far too confusing. The last 30 minutes was unbearable as the ending was dragged out. I heard people snoring behind me and I could not blame them!<br/><br/>The only plus point about the film was that Natalie Portman fans will like this as her character was believable compared to the rest of them and she performed well.

","Well this evening my friend's wanted to go out to the cinema, one of which being a huge Marvel fan. I saw the trailer for Thor and thought it looked alright but I didn't have high hopes for it.<br/><br/>I really was blown away in the opening 30 minutes of the movie. The effects were great and the movie seemed to have a decent story going for it. The camera angles were great, not all shaky and zoomed like most action movies seem to like to do nowadays.<br/><br/>Unfortunately as the movie progressed I feel it got a little weak. As soon as we are brought to earth the movie decides to make clumsy jokes and lightens the mood by repeating the same joke about 4 times within 10 minutes. I found it strange that the mood had changed so quickly.<br/><br/>And before I continue I have to say, Kat Denning's character 'Darcy Lewis' made the most annoying and out of place jokes I have heard in some time in a movie.<br/><br/>However the thing I found with the movie is that all of a sudden it becomes great again, then drops a bit, etc etc. In places I felt that they couldn't quite make up which audience they were aiming for.<br/><br/>Now - the acting.<br/><br/>I thought that the acting was brilliant in this movie. Chris Hemsworth was perfect for Thor, Natalie Portman was *as always* great, however I think that Tom Hiddleston who played ""Loki"" stole the show. He was fantastic.<br/><br/>Why haven't I mentioned Anthony Hopkins yet? Because, to be honest, anyone could have played his character. He had no scenes that actually required much acting skill and I just think that he was just there for people to go ""Hey, it's Anthony Hopkins!"".<br/><br/>So yeah, I liked about half of the movie, and didn't like the other half. One half felt epic and brilliant, the other very clumsy and out of place.<br/><br/>However the reason I didn't give it a 5 is because the acting was so good I put it up to a 6."

","I was looking forward to watch this movie and I am glad I went to the theater. The movie is good, a good action/adventure movie, with the addition of the direction of one Kenneth Branagh. His ""training"" in directing Shakespeare's based movies, helped him to add depth to a story that is taken from a comic book. Acting is consistent with the movie and the effects, while plentiful, don't drown the movie. I liked both Thor and Loki, different as day and night, as it was supposed to be. A warning: don't exit before you watch all the end-titles. The only thing I didn't like was the 3d. It makes fights difficult to understand and follow and this movie would have been even better without it."
"mad_mandonna","7","1","7","29 April 2011"," Utter Nonsense, but loads of fun
","I have not read the Thor comics, nor do I no much about the marvel incarnation other than the fact that he has a hammer. So I really am taking this film as it comes, I'm taking it as a fan of science fiction and superheroes. In my opinion the major leader in the comic book movie world is Batman, and mainly the most recent Dark Knight. I've always found some of the marvel stories a bit harder to swallow, and Thor is no exception to this. In a way Thors back story is probably the most far fetched, I'd even go as far to say its utterly ridiculous, however that almost added to the fun of it.<br/><br/>Thor keeps it light all the way through to its conclusion, and the drama is always in the melodrama making it all the more likable. It has epic and outlandish action sequences and even louder costumes than its special effects. The romance between Natalie Portmans scientist and Thor is laughable, misconstrued and cheesier than the old Stilton in my fridge. But for some strange reason this film works. It is so very entertaining, and really very funny. It has an almost self aware attitude that lends itself very well to this particular story. Other films of this genre could have taken a leaf out of its book, choosing spectacle and comedy instead of heavy drama and characterisation made Thor far more pleasant than its rivals.<br/><br/>Take a film like spider-man, that is almost as stupid, but attempts to make it more grounded.When it attempts go for laughs its very false and Peter Parker never raised much of a smile out of me. Thor on the other hand is beautifully humorous and a fairly flawed hero. On a more negative note, though funny, Thor at times experiences some turbulence when it comes to its actors. No one really knows quite how to play the supporting roles. Thors allies are to often a bit serious and self conscious for the pantomime that there leader puts on. Kat Dennings was an obvious standout and Portman was once again great, even if her performance doesn't quite match Black Swan, but was it ever going to match that performance.<br/><br/>All in all I believe Thor is a very enjoyable ride. Non science fiction fans will undoubtedly hate this so steer clear if you're not. But generally if you like Marvel movies this will not put you off. Its got me very much in the mood for Xmen: First Class."

The ice monster, is nothing spectacular.<br/><br/>Like Flash Gordon (1980)it has enough action and OK actors to distract the eye and mind from thinking wow this is a tatty looking film for the majority of the time. Seeing Ray Stephenson beard made me think director Kenneth Branagh wanted to cast Brian Blessed in the role and make Thor his homage to Flash Gordon.<br/><br/>Luckily I saw the film in 2D, and it was an enjoyable romp. Maybe the stereoscopic version added something to it for fans of 3D but I don't think I missed anything special in that department.<br/><br/>The plot and background is bare bones, I suspect there are more than a few minutes of deleted scenes, the cinema patron will have to pay to see or even an extended cut on DVD/BLu Ray Considering this film is set in the same universe as Iron Man,Hulk etc surely its time that people started to focus on the doppleganger of Stan Lee who regulalrly crops up and can surely no longer be classed as cameo appearances.<br/><br/>Stay patient enjoy the Foo Fighters closing tune, read the credits for 5 minutes and the viewer will be rewarded"
"ken1848","7","1","8","28 April 2011"," Move Thee Reviews: The Pursuit of Power Pollutes our Minds
","THOR is an epic adventure about Thor, a powerful but arrogant god whose reckless actions trigger a war. As a result, he is stripped of his powers by his father Odin and banished to Earth where he has to learn what it takes to be a good leader.<br/><br/>Like Iron Man, one of the reasons for THOR's success is the three-dimensional and pleasing protagonist that the audience cares about. Thor is not only a mighty warrior with a powerful physique, but also a loyal friend. However, as a prince born to inherit the throne, he is petulant. Because of his impetuosity, shortsightedness, flashes of rage and disrespect, his father deprives him of his powers and exiles him to earth in the hope that he will become more humble and mature. Unlike other superheroes who gain their superpowers when bitten by a genetically altered spider or hit by a gamma blast, Thor becomes a mortal, like us. Owing to the loss of powers and a beauty's love, his heart is softened. Despite the flaw that Thor's personal growth, i.e. the learning of humility, and his interest in Jane Foster are underdeveloped, Thor is still a charismatic character whom the audience aspires to be.<br/><br/>What makes this movie so relatable to me is the breakdown of the family. Speaking of family, Thor is no different from us. He also has to deal with family issues, e.g. sibling rivalry for power and attention, a son's impatience to prove his worth to his father, Loki's hatred for his father, etc. That the pursuit of power pollutes our minds sounds plausible. Several scenes showing the confrontations between the father and the son are emotionally affecting, thanks to Anthony Hopkins, an acting legend, whose nuanced performance as an aging king and a distressed father who is hurt and disappointed by his son is very convincing.<br/><br/>The delicately crafted Marvel universe sets the scene for this epic adventure. Earth, Asgard and Jotunheim are beautifully shot and their unique features are highlighted. For instance, Thor's stay in remote New Mexico symbolizes the fall of the god. While his arrogance and passion are highlighted in his glowing golden world, his unequaled courage contrasts sharply with the scary snowy world. Thanks to the jaw-dropping IMAX 3D images, the convincing set design and the cool costume design, the three distinctly different worlds are brought to life within the same reality. What's more, that science cannot explain everything and Norse mythology is real adds romance to the story.<br/><br/>Albeit not on a par with Spiderman, THOR is a success as a commercial popcorn movie blending together different genres, mythology, action, a character study, romance, family drama, etc.<br/><br/>P.S. Make sure you stick around till after the closing credits!"
"robertofranco-58021","1","1","9","28 August 2019"," Awful. One of the worst movies Ive ever seen
","I think Thor is the worst superhero to have come out of Marvel Studios ever and I wish that the character would have never starred any Marvel Movies.Ever. Again- He is not a very cool superhero."
"Jonathon_Natsis","6","1","9","25 April 2011"," Avengers Assemble!
","Sometime in 2012, Marvel Studios will release The Avengers, a conglomerate of superhero films all rolled into one, and a film I expect will overthrow The Dark Knight as the highest- grossing superhero movie of all time. How it will fare against Nolan's third and final Batman remains to be seen, but with the Tony Stark character already well established, the time has come to add another crucial piece of the Avengers puzzle with the fantastical universe of Thor, the Nordic god of thunder.<br/><br/>The soon-to-be king of the Asgard realm, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is stripped of all his powers and cast down to Earth, doomed to life as a mere mortal as punishment for disobeying the orders of his king and father Odin (Anthony Hopkins). There he meets sceptical scientist Jane (Natalie Portman), and learns that his power-hungry brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has been conspiring against the ailing Odin back on Asgard, intending to become the king himself.<br/><br/>The very nature of storytelling throughout Thor is well executed. It works many interesting facets of Nordic mythology into the story and, while I can't say I've ever read a Marvel comic in my life, I was impressed by the eccentricity of the plot. Never having been a big fan of director Kenneth Branagh (I feel he has the unwanted ability of drawing pretentiousness from otherwise straightforward subject matter), I admit that even he kept a tight hold on the pace. Okay, maybe he couldn't resist aligning the plot with parts of Shakespeare's Henry V and King Lear, but overall he appears very conscious of what he's directing: a popcorn action vehicle with mass public appeal, mostly devoid of unnecessary literary allusions. <br/><br/>In fact, if I had to criticise one aspect of Branagh's filmmaking, it would be the cinematography. It's hard to miss the constant use of titled camera angles throughout Thor, which I assume were employed to emphasise the 'other-worldliness' of Asgard, but instead just seem lazy and contribute little to the film other than occasionally disorientating the viewer.<br/><br/>Around the time Thor begins his new life on Earth, the film takes on a more comedic direction, with most jokes arising from situations that show the protagonist as a fish out of water (walking across the street with no regard for cars, declaring his love of coffee by throwing his mug against a wall, stuff like that). Unfortunately, most of the jokes fall flat, but this is certainly an area that differs from person to person. Frankly, I thought the best laugh came from a witty and direct reference to the self-centred Stark during the film's biggest set piece.<br/><br/>I don't often review films through comparison, but while we're on the topic of Iron Man, it is a great way of exposing the character flaws of this film. While Thor itself possesses an interesting story, there is little depth to the main character, in comparison to multi-faceted personality of Iron Man's billionaire egotist. Where Iron Man builds towards Tony and Pepper's relationship on the back of over four hours of brewing sexual tension, Thor introduces, deals with and wraps up its romantic subplot all within ninety minutes. Portman doesn't butcher her role by any means, but suffers from a formulaic script lacking any interest in thorough character development. <br/><br/>All in all, this film offers the same sort of action-packed escapism we have come to expect from Hollywood over the Easter holidays. Hey, this time last year we had to sit through Clash of the Titans, and Thor certainly doesn't deserve that sort of shabby treatment. And for any Marvel fanatics out there, make sure to stick around after the credits.<br/><br/>*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*"
"provenelk","7","1","10","27 April 2011"," Mighty Thor!.....or maybe not...
","I think I'm gonna do a first here and NOT relate how good the movie was with how good the special effects are.<br/><br/>With that now abundantly clear, the best thing about this movie is the mythology. I found myself most engrossed in the movie when the mythology was being explored, and the powers of the mythical characters was being shown. This is a bit of a cheap screen writing trick though, so not too much credit can be given to the writers.<br/><br/>The first act is sloppy, and the third act is equally so. Which is surprising considering the second act is usually the weakest, but i think that was the part of the movie where they were able to have fun with the characters, Thor in Nex Mexico -""Delicious! I will have another!"", rather than trying to establish and resolve a complicated universe and weak narrative.<br/><br/>The action was average. At times the only thing you could see on screen was a mess of blurring motion. The were times when i got excited, but it was all rather disappointing. The anti climatic ending felt just felt like a cheap pay off for action rather than any serious resolution.<br/><br/>I think for the most part of this movie i was marveling at the expected power of the characters, but when i actually saw them in action, it was kind of a let down. The hype was good, the reality was bad. And whats with the giant robot man, GORT rip off anyone?! <br/><br/>Having said all of this, it is a good pop corn movie, and a bit of fun, if all a bit silly. Kenneth Brannagh, whom i greatly admire, holds it together in the best way i think he possibly could, and thats the reason i think the mythology is so interesting, Brannagh's Shakespearean background has given him the ability to handle it, and i applaud the Marvel/Paramount suites for picking the right man for the job.<br/><br/>No doubt hordes of Americans will flood to the cinemas, and vast quantities of popcorn will be thrown down their necks to contribute to their already bulbous waste lines. A sequel is inevitable, but thats not necessarily a bad thing.... if you like popcorn."
"Starguitar32","8","1","10","26 April 2011"," Return To Form For Marvel
","An absolute breathtaking movie a true blockbuster. I opted to see this in the 2D version and it did not disappoint. I was slightly weary of Kenneth Branagh directing, there is a lot to get through as Thor is an actual god with awe-inspiring powers and a rich back story. This is the sort of material that has to be handled with care and Branagh does it justice and more.<br/><br/>This is by far the biggest thing Marvel has attempted, its fantasy on a cosmic scale. With a pre-credit stint in New Mexico to a 30 minute sequence in Asgard where we meet all the major players Thor, his brother Loki and their father Odin (a superb Anthony Hopkins). With vast tracking shots through the stunning Asgardian landscapes and unbelievable battle sequences with a race of Frost Giants, its hard to see any other super hero film match this.<br/><br/>Chris Hemsworth plays Thor amazingly, once banished to Earth this is when he comes into his own. Adding new layers of humility and humour to his blustering God of Thunder, the fish out of water works like a charm. Hemsworth emerges a true star, adept at action and good with comedy.<br/><br/>The film leaves you with intrigue at seeing Hemsworth on screen with Downey Jr. and Chris Evans in next years The Avengers. On that note I would say watch after the end credits for a cameo tie-in to The Avengers.<br/><br/>I recommend this to anyone and dare you not to like it kids and adults alike. Everyone has to see this spectacle."

","After defying his father's orders to not seek vengeance against another realm would be king Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is exiled to live on planet Earth by his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) and has now lost all of the powers that were bestowed upon him in Asgard. With the help of scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her team Thor slowly starts to learn where he has been sent and what he needs to do in order to return to Asgard, but it seems that the real threat to Thor is much closer to home than he imagined...<br/><br/>As daft as it sounds the biggest surprise that I came across with this film was when I learned who had directed the film; seeing the words 'Directed By Kenneth Branagh' at the end of the film genuinely had me shocked. I don't mean this to sound bad, because I do respect Kenneth Branagh as both an actor and a director, but the superhero genre is virgin territory to him and the fact that he's directed the film so well makes the achievement even more commendable...<br/><br/>The first thing that works in the film's favour is the tone; it is serious and business-like when it needs to be and is also fun when the time is right. It starts out serious (which is fine as it explains away the war between two realms and continues in this vain until Thor's expulsion to Earth). The film switches tone for a while when Thor is on Earth and what is genius about this is that Thor initially doesn't realise that he's lost his powers - he's still strong, but doesn't have the superhuman element that he had on Asgard meaning that in some scenes Thor is condescending and dismissive towards the 'Earthlings' before being swiftly brought down to Earth (groan...sorry :-(. In some ways though I found this endearing as for a good chunk of the time we're following a man rather than a superhero (there's even a couple of fish-out-of water moments to lighten the tone).<br/><br/>Although the comical aspect with Thor is fun to watch and provides a nice contrast to the serious business up on Asgard, Branagh pitches everything perfectly here (this is mostly when Asgard brings the fight to Earth when the giant robot is unleashed). This aspect of the film brings some tension simply because our superheroes are afforded some vulnerability (yes we all like seeing superheroes kicking ass to a degree, but there's not much emotional investment if you just sit there and think 'Such and such a superhero will get the better of their adversary so why should I care what happens?' This can take you out of a film if it's not done right, but despite knowing where this would go Branagh and his scriptwriters did display vulnerability which gives a rooting interest to the characters.<br/><br/>The film has an A-list cast who mostly deliver A-list performances; Hemsworth was the biggest surprise as I expected him to walk round as though he was coated with Ronseal, but to my surprise he was actually very good and his switch from Asgard persona to Earth persona was delivered with an air of skill and believability. Natalie Portman is far more accomplished so my expectations were higher for her; she is OK, but with so many strong performances from her in the past this is not 'amazing work' from her - although it's by no means a bad performance. Skarsgard is featured in a very slight supporting role and gives a nice nuanced and understated performance. Hopkins only features predominantly in the first half, but makes his mark. Dennings plays a fairly simple slightly ditzy character, but does OK with what she has to work with.<br/><br/>Thor is a very enjoyable film and another solid entry in the Marvel Universe. The script is good, but Branagh deserves a lot of credit for making the whole film flow like water. Knowing that Thor is now a franchise I'll certainly be back for more."

","So I got to the first movie about the mighty thunder God Thor. To read it I decided, oddly enough, after watching ""Dark World"". And at first this movie I liked the first, but about it later. To me personally, the first ""Thor"" seemed boring, but at the same time interesting. The plot and motivation of the characters spelled out very well, but otherwise the film is very lame. Asgard is drawn very poorly, I can not believe that you see a real huge world. Also extremely crumpled redemption and awareness of the Thor, as well as too spontaneous development of the relationship with Jane Foster. Very weak, though not bad, villain. Let's go through the characters.
Thor (Chris Hemsworth) played well. He is arrogant, arrogant and proud, as befits an almost omnipotent God. But, suddenly deprived of his strength in the face of danger because of his ego, he gradually re-educates himself, finds his love and proves the right to be worthy of his strength.
Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) is a controversial character for me. On the one hand, I really like Natalie as an actress. On the other, the character does not cling, and the relationship with Thor, as I said, it's too spontaneous.
Chief, for me, plus this movie-Loki (Tom Hiddleston). He's very motivated. He had a little envy for my brother, so it is also One lied to all my life! And although his plan to seize power in Asgard, to put it mildly, strange, charisma and great game Tom cover everything.
The film is weak, but not bad."

Therefore, I wanted to watch it until the last second. My opinion? It was so entertaining I could not stand up from my sit. There are some movies where you do not give a damn and whosoever who interrupts you, you don't feel bothered. However, when I sat down whereas I was watching it, I felt completely concentrated. It is to this point you realise that the movie earned its own merits. The reason? A good continuity where the last movie (Iron Man) left with S.H.I.E.L.D. Perhaps it could have been more dynamic. Yet the fresh performances of Hemsworth and Hiddleston were significantly important. Not to mention Natalie Portman, who was as lovely as most of people wanted to. Perhaps it did not have so much action but the very beginning. Well, it was compensated with the realm and its vast fields. I know, this flick has got also its faults. It sometimes puzzles you wherever the shoot is being taken, it sometimes results boring due to the redundant I-have-never-ever-been-on-earth-before Thor's attitude. Likewise, Thor's gang do not play a key role during the display.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, you guys have to give it the credit of the top-notch performances, the sometimes-gorgeously made CGI and a convincing intro of Asgard.

","Thor is one the MCU's more forgotten movies to several. Confusing as to why, considering Hemsworth owns the character, the story has a great arc for the character, and it is a very funny movie. The problem with this film is that it is not consistent tonally at all. Asgard is very Shakespearean in dialogue and feel while earth feels more dull and grounded. This was intentional for story yes and creates some funny fish-out-of-water humor, but the shift is too jarring to make this movie memorable for all the good things about it."

","Thor is a pretty meh MCU flick. The Asgard scenes in this film are pretty great. However when the setting switches to earth, the tone seems all over the place and that's where the film gets dragged down. However the action scenes are cool, Chris Hemsworth is likable as Thor, and Anthony Hopkins is fantastic as Odin. So overall, Thor isn't a bad movie, but it's a pretty meh movie."

","Once upon a time, the MCU did not rule the world . The future was uncertain, but Marvel fans waited hopefully for what could be. Iron Man and the Incredible Hulk had shown promise, but the Iron Man sequel led many to believe that this kind of movie simply could not hold out in the long run. Where to go now?<br/><br/>Enter Thor: arguably the first superhero movie to deal with a topic that covers a shockingly large portion of comics lore: the cosmos. In a time when so many superhero films played it safe, Thor dared greatly. The worlds in the movie are expansive and alien but capture that sense of otherworldy magic that fan-favorite story arcs had done. The movie introduces itself with some narration, but allows a lot of room for interpretation. In other words, Thor opened the door to what we know and love as the MCU today. Guardians of the Galaxy, The Avengers and even Antman would not be were it not for this trailblazer of a movie.<br/><br/>The strengths of this movie lie in its soundtrack, which is arguably one of the most beautifully composed of its kind, as well as the idea behind the story. Thor is a nearly omnipotent being who is forced to subject himself to mortal restrictions and downfalls. It is both comedic and symbolic, and resonates surprisingly well. Other forces contribute to the quality of this film, like the easter eggs and world-building it allows.<br/><br/>Now, I do not claim this movie to be the best of the MCU. It has since been surpassed time and time again, and Thor's character has since been perfected. I am merely saying that this was a very large step in the right direction' and is one for which I am forever grateful. So when you sit down to enjoy Infinity War for the 467th time, remember to pay your respects."

","Well done to Kenneth Branagh for this superb work of cinematic art! The casting, script, music & photography capture the sweeping sense of grandeur of these ancient Norse legends. Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of Odin is just magnificent in all the films, as is Chris Hemsworth's Thor. Tom Hiddleston was born to play Loki, and the actors playing Freya, Lady Sif & the Warriors Three were perfect for their roles.<br/><br/>Back on earth, Clark Gregg's ""Phil Coulson"" always manages to sparkle in even the briefest appearances. The only thing that lowered the tone was the part with Jane Foster, her un-amusing friends, and the awkward ""romance"" that strained all credulity. They proved to be even more embarrassing in the Thor sequel ""The Dark World"", so it was a relief when they were omitted from Thor Ragnarok.<br/><br/>The ending scene with Odin and Thor showed the quiet warmth and deep affection between father and son that was truly beautiful to behold."
"rcyoung-02426","6","0","2","28 May 2019"," Borderline Good
","Thor is one of those movies that fuels film debates for me, because I cannot decide if it was good or bad.<br/><br/>On the good side, it's a very interesting take on a comic book movie. Kenneth Branagh does an excellent job of portraying the very Shakespearean relationship between Thor, Loki, and Odin. He also makes liberal use of dutch angles, which do evoke the comics somewhat. It's also quite fun to watch.<br/><br/>But the writing on this is terrible. The plot, really comes down to two things, the relationship between Thor, Loki, and Odin, and Thor needing to prove himself as king. If the whole movie was focused on that and not concerned with the love story or setting up The Avengers, it might have become great. Instead we get a crappy love story crammed between a more interesting one, that makes no sense, with two leads have absolutely zero chemistry.<br/><br/>I never once felt bad for Thor or felt like he was facing a credible threat like I did when watching other films in the Marvel series. Maybe it's me. He always felt a little too cartoony for me to take seriously.<br/><br/>That said the casting on this film was spot on. Anthony Hopkins is great as Odin, and Tom Hiddleston makes an excellent Loki. Although Marvel would redeem itself with its portrayal of Thor in later movies, for a first effort, this was a pretty terrible vehicle to introduce the character."

","You just don't know what part of Thor is good, and not so good. An average feel surrounds the film. Up until now the Marvel universe has kept us within the confines of Earth, but this latest foray into the other 9 realms really does leave it open to opinion....<br/><br/>I love a fantasy type film, and if done right can be a legendary movie. I did not feel the same vibe from this movie, yet felt like saying 'ok, it was a nice try'...magical and mystical powers being condensed through a hammer isn't exactly what a superhero entails for me, but somehow fits in well with the fantasy element of the movie. Again, some of the powers of the frost men and other magical characters are too much, and as my friend Mazza would say...""over the top""<br/><br/>The appearances and characters get a thumbs up though... seeing a Handsome blonde blue eyed muscular man reminded me of myself, and it's always nice to relate to a character like that. The appearance of Natalie Portman is always welcome, and bumps up the review rating. With Shield becoming more of a presence with each Marvel film, the general marvel storyline is coming together nicely.<br/><br/>The back and forth yo-yo effect of the storyline can leave the watcher confused, with me thinking countless times about what actually Thor was trying to achieve, or what the bad guy was trying to achieve?! It makes sense in the end, but could've been done better. Not the worst Marvel movie, but left a little bit wanting

","Chris Hemsworth and Cast and Kenneth Branagh give us a film which I have seen many times over the years. No better recommendation than that. This film is especially enjoyable for it's story telling. The warrior Prince who needs to learn a little compassion and the Shakespearean feel, to me, make it entertaining. I confess I watched this film again today after seeing Avengers:Endgame to refresh my memory as to why I loved this character. And to see Thor grow over 3 films, plus the Avengers movies, was great, until Endgame. In that film we see the boy Thor as a slovenly 1 joke Big Lebowski (Iron Man's name) who was anything but worthy. Chris Hemsworth is a great actor in my opinion and handled the comedy in that film well. But the comedy in this film is well written and comes from the comparison of two cultures and Thor's royal and mythic status. Most of my friends and I particularly love the scene, without giving too much away, where Thor rises to who he really is. Great film."

It is always a funny thing to see someone from a different world attempt to become accustomed to American society, that is most of the humor found in Thor. But it is not a comedy by any means, the main focus of the film is instead the classic hero's story of redemption. The plot of Thor banished because of his insolence and then learning to love and protect those around him before saving his homeland. It hits all of the beats of a good movie and flows nicely until the end."

","Marvel Comics has released a great number of films in the past few years. Some like Iron Man and Spider Man 2 have been downright awesome. Others, like Elektra and The Hulk, have sucked dishwater. Their latest offering, Thor falls somewhere in between, but is closer to a blockbuster than a bomb.<br/><br/>The basic story is that Thor (Chris Hemsworth), heir to the throne of Asgard, is banished to Earth by his father Odin for breaking a truce with the frost giants. Stripped of his powers, he must come to terms with life in the mortal realm, and his own limitations. More importantly, with help from astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) he must find a way home and stop the machinations of his brother Loki (Tom Hiddlesto. The story is mostly faithful to his comic book origin story, although there have been some major simplifications.<br/><br/>Purists may complain about the ease with which the destroyer armor is defeated or the reimagining of Bifrost Bridge, and I'm not sure why they made Hiemdal the gatekeeper black, except that they figured the movie needed a black guy. I also think that Asgard's visual look is too shiny and futuristic. I'd rather see a city of stone towers and battlements, and grand halls and longhouses. This Asgard looks more like the home of space aliens than Norse gods.<br/><br/>More serious is that even with the simplifications that have been made to the storyline, there's still too much material packed into the two-hour running time. An extra half hour, or maybe even an hour should have been added so that the movie didn't feel so rushed, and to provide more time for character development. And while we're on the movie's weaknesses, I must say that I doubt a government agency would free a man who had broken into a secure facility just because a local scientist vouched for him. Then again, this is a thriller, adapted from a comic book, so I should be expecting a fair amount of improbabilities.<br/><br/>What saves the film in large part is its excellent casting. Natalie Portman is charming and intelligent as always, although I felt her character wasn't given enough to do. Hiddleston is highly convincing as the scheming Loki, and I liked Anthony Hopkins as Odin, though I'm sure this was a walk in the park for an actor of his talent. It's Hemsworth who makes the biggest impression though. Thor is the role that he was born to play. Not only does he look the part, with his beard and his bulging muscles, but he perfectly captures Thor's earnestness and vitality, as well as his arrogance and stubbornness.<br/><br/>Which brings me to another of the film's strengths. These days, movies are filled with protagonists who suffer self doubt, or must let loose and trust their emotions. Now 'following your heart' and 'believing in yourself' aren't necessarily bad things, but they've become clichés in contemporary film. Thor has exactly the opposite problem. He far too self assured, and would rather take names and crack heads than step back and look at things rationally. He's cocky, he's reckless, and he gives no thought to the consequences of his actions. He reminds me of some guys I knew on the high-school football team. If he wants to save the people he cares about and claim his birthright, he'll have to learn humility, discretion, and mercy.<br/><br/>Another strong point is comic relief. The opening scene, in which the scientists run into, and tazer Thor, is hysterical. And I loved the part where the local hicks compete to see who can lift his enchanted hammer, while onlookers grill and knock back some brews. The action is also very good, especially the battle with the frost giants. And Stan Lee's obligatory cameo is perfectly timed.
Thor isn't as awesome as it could, and perhaps should, have been, but as a summer adventure flick, it works. I had a good time, and if Thor is any indication, I'm definitely looking forward to next year's Avengers."

No-one want's to see Thor bee a normal human being facing challenges.
I understand why they did that, Thor is a very strong character and they want stakes in the story by making him weaker but that's not how you do it.<br/><br/>CHARACTER
Thor isn't a bad character he is actually pretty good and during the film he grows and develops as a character by learning from his mistakes.
But Jane is pretty bad, she is just this boring bland love interest of Thor.
Erik selvig ain't bad he is not good either he is in the middle and the ""comic relief"" who hangs out with Erik and Jane i don't even remember he name cause she is that forgettable she serves no purpose to the story, if they removed her then nothing would change the story would end up the same the only difference is that there would be less jokes.
We have also the boring uninteresting side character that we are supposed to believe are Thor's best friends.<br/><br/>VILLAIN
Loki is a bad villain in this movie.
I know he could be a really good villain but he is just wasted potential.
His motive to why he want's to kill Thor is because he is jealous of him and that's a lousy motive it would have been less lousy if they would develop the motive.<br/><br/>ACTION
The action is boring, bland and has no creativity behind it.
There isn't a lot of action scenes there are like four i think but all of them where bad.
When you make a good action scene there might be stuff like good choreo or the character finding a creative way to solve his problems but none of that exist in Thor it's just Thor smashing stuff.<br/><br/>VERDICT
Thor is a good but lacking movie which could have been better if it was longer.

","Adding a third superhero to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and expanding it into a fantasy realm, this mediocre Marvel film was one of the first I felt really disappointed with after leaving the theater though I have learned to appreciate parts of it. Astrophysicist Dr. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) waits for an event with her assistant Darcy Lewis (Kat Denning) and fellow scientist Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård) when chaos rains down from the sky and Jane hits a man, Thor (Chris Hemsworth). The film jumps back with a monologue from Odin (Anthony Hopkins) lectures his two son, Thor and Loki (Tom Hiddleston), about the dangers of the frost giants and the wonders of Asgard. Thor is quick to violence while Loki is more crafty but Odin can only promote one to king. He chooses Thor but during his ceremony to receive the crown, the frost giants invade and try to steal a powerful weapon. Odin's security proves too powerful but Thor is angry the Jotunheim even attempted something so brash.<br/><br/>Thor stews but his friends Vostagg (Ray Stevenson), Hogun (Tadanobu Asano), Fandral (Josh Dallas), and Siff (Jaimie Alexander) discouraged him from doing anything. Loki, however, encourages Thor to disobey Odin with trickier and go to Jotunheim. Thor decides to fight back but must use the Bifrost guarded by Heimdall (Idris Elba) who is upset the frost giants were able to sneak by him. The group is transported to Jotunheim where Thor challenges King Laufey (Colm Feore). A battle is almost avoided but Laufey insulted Thor. The friends fight the frost giants including a giant dog beast that Thor flies through the mouth of and out the back of its head. Odin shows up to rescues the group as Frandral is injured but war has been declared. Enraged with Thor's actions, Odin banishes him to Earth and separates him from his hammer.

As this is directed by Kenneth Branagh, there are clear Shakespearean overtones in the story.<br/><br/>Thor ends up getting exiled due to his arrogance and is sent to Earth where he meets a team of wannabe physicists led by Natalie Portman, investigating spatial disturbances caused by Thor's exile to Earth.

It essentially becomes a fish out of water story as Thor tries to readjust himself and learn the culture and etiquette of civilized humans.

","Thor is a light, enjoyable comic book movie. The one word that perfectly encapsulates this movie is ""simple"". Thor's character arc of redemption works. The villain has just enough backstory to make him interesting. The ""fish out of water"" type of humour works. The movie is incredibly silly, yet it embraces its ridiculousness. This makes the movie very easy to get into. Only rarely do you get pulled out due to forced melodrama. The movie achieves nearly everything it sets out to. However, that is the main issue with the film. It isn't exactly ambitious. It does a good job telling a simple superhero origin story, but it does little more than that. Asgard seems to be to be very interesting, but more time spent exploring it would have improved the film. The action sequences are decent, but it could have been much more creative given the character's supernatural abilities. Overall, Thor could have been something great if it was more ambitious and creative. That being said, it achieves its goal of being good."

"fernandoschiavi","7","0","3","5 October 2016"," a good presentation of the character to the audience
","Marvel Studios continues to bring to the screen their great characters so that they can all meet soon in his most ambitious project, The Avengers, adapting the story of God of Thunder, Thor. Unlike superhero films seeking greater realism and connection to the world today, Thor presents a very imaginative story, serving as an introduction the other stories in the Marvel universe.<br/><br/>The script by Ashley Edward Miller, Zack Stentz and Don Payne knew to be true to the comics and the origin of Thor, although not as well traveled, and to include other references, such as a quick scene with Clint Barton, Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner ) and mention of Dr. Bruce Banner, the Hulk, in the scene where Dr. Selvig said he knew a pioneering scientist in gamma radiation. When, finally, the audience accompanies Thor on Earth, everything is done very quickly and ask for their development, without reaching the importance it had for the narrative. Thor is banished to Earth to learn a lesson in humility and in just two days, he learns the lesson and everything is solved, making the whole very unlikely situation. Another fact is about the fascination of the hero with humans. The relationship between Thor and Jane Foster is totally predictable from the first scene and the speed with which she enchants with it's embarrassing.<br/><br/>If the script has its flaws, the director hit the casting. Anthony Hopkins with his deep voice and imposing appearance leaves no doubt about the leadership of Odin, the god of Asgard. Odin has intelligence and compassion worthy of a great king. The actor explores a more theatrical side to the character. Chris Hemsworth, after a long search, was chosen to give life to Thor, and did not disappoint. The rookie who had the most outstanding participation in Star Trek (2009), is a complex operation, ranging from the arrogant self-centered to a man worthy to rule Asgard competently. He is able to show virility, strength, charm and still has strong appeal in the mood, especially in the scenes he comes to Earth. Especially the scene that the great God of Thunder without his powers are defeated by a needle, or when he eats at a diner. It is still great to pass the feelings of the moment you can not remove your floor hammer for not being worthy to do so. Hemsworth has a heroic size, strong voice and great stage presence.<br/><br/>Tom Hiddleston, another newcomer who had made several television credits also convinces as Loki, giving preference to a more restrained, cold and calculating character. Loki is depicted three dimensional. In the beginning, we do not see as a villain, but as a person who really wants to be king for if you feel able to do the best for his people. Gradually we taking science of his actions and could witness its transformation. The newly Oscar winner Natalie Portman lends its beauty and resourcefulness to astrophysicist Jane Foster. Portman said he accepted work in Thor for the chance to work with director Kenneth Branagh, and clearly she has fun on stage. Stellan Skarsgård shows a calm, paternal Dr. Selvig, prominent among human allies of the Thunder God. He has no such function in the plot, but fun in the scene in which rescues Thor SHIELD team saying he would be Dr. Donald Blake and then taking him to drink in a bar. Kat Dennings is the first to be impressed by the beauty of Thor when he sees for the first time and serves as the comic relief as Darcy, Jane's assistant, but it is a character that could be deleted from the script easily. Clark Gregg returns as Agent Phil Coulson, SHIELD and again we see in it the link between the films of the franchise. He leaves the scene in Iron Man 2 and appears precisely to investigate the appearance of the fallen hammer of Thor.<br/><br/>Branagh is happy to portray some action scenes. The first major battle of Asgard army against the Frost Giants log at the beginning is very well directed, as Thor's invasion and his friends in the land of giants years after almost lead to another war between worlds. The visual effects are not only competent in the construction of complex scenarios, but also the strong battle scenes. In these struggles is where we see the first time the real power of the hammer Mjolnir and Thor. Already other sequences are well below what Marvel fans are used in the movies. The passage of Thor against the Destroyer is very weak. Giant movements sent by Loki are very artificial and not give credibility to the threat. As the main battle of the climax of the film it goes too fast and not emotional. The scenes that contain the film in Asgard involving the brothers are best made, but not yet brought strength to a film of this magnitude. The truth is that most of the scenes is well below its real potential and never excite. <br/><br/>Thor is, overall, a good presentation of the character to the public, with some good action scenes and presenting this more intergalactic universe and not only restricted to the earth as in the case of other superheroes. He missed further explore the presented worlds, work better picture of the action scenes and create new ones, and use techniques that showed Thor for a longer time on earth and that his relationship of love for this planet were built more credibly. It is true to the comic, with a post-production done well. The source was counted and the major powers of the illustrated hero, the reality was acclimated and the links with fully established Marvel universe. You can not miss the traditional post-credits scene that directly link the film directly to the Avengers movie."

","So the start - the backstory - was boring. Spent 30 minutes waiting for the movie to start. No need for it. Could have been said in 30 seconds instead of 30 minutes.<br/><br/>The middle part when Thor is on Earth was very good. I enjoyed the character and how he interacted with the humans and how they interacted with him. That was fun to see.<br/><br/>The character story arc was good to this point. Then came then finale which, again, was boring.<br/><br/>So a bad start and a bad finish with a good middle. There is some promise here for a better sequel but this is not a good movie.<br/><br/>Mediocre = not due to idea / character (Thor) but due to plot / storytelling not being up to par."

","I have to admit I have a soft spot for this movie. Thor brings children's bed-time stories to life with an excellent cast and fun set of characters. The flaws in the plot, of which there are several, mitigate themselves with a delightfully refreshing overall story about the growth of the main character, Thor.<br/><br/>If there is anything wrong with Thor, it is with the setup. In particular, Odin (Anthony Hopkins) does not come across as a particularly wise king, when it is obviously clear that Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is way too immature. Another sign of how weak Odin is comes in the form of pretty much every character in Asgard disobeying him for any reason. I point this out because I don't think it was director Kenneth Branagh's idea to depict the all-powerful Odin as so feeble.<br/><br/>I also am a bit confused about some of the magical principles of the film. For instance, the story line of Odin and his power (or lack thereof) has a bit too much deus ex machina in it. That said, I enjoyed Loki and Heimdall (Tom Hiddleston and Idris Elba, both in the running to play the next James Bond ironically). Loki in particular develops into a stronger character as the film progresses.<br/><br/>Finally, Natalie Portman pulls off the enamored scientist role pretty well and she and Hemsworth show quite the sexual tension. Thor gets 3 out of 4 hammers."

","Thor is the fourth MCU movie, coming after Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk and Iron Man 2. It's about gods, so you would think this would be incredibly epic, but it's not really. The story doesn't feel big at all and barely affects anything, so it feels like it only exists to introduce us to the character.<br/><br/>It's not bad, it's enjoyable, it's entertaining, well shot, visually pretty impressive, pretty funny at times and they nailed the casting once again. Chris Hemsworth is a perfect choice for Thor just like Robert Downey Jr. for Iron Man. But the one who really stole the show for me is Tom Hiddleston as his brother Loki. He is the best villain MCU ever had so far and I think it will remain that way. He fits the role perfectly and he also seems to have a lot of fun playing it. Kenneth Branagh is the director this time and this is probably one of the most well directed MCU movies. Also, visually the movie is beautiful, one of the best looking MCU movies. <br/><br/>So, what went wrong? Once again, I'm saying the movie is pretty okay, but this isn't supposed to be just okay. I think they could have done a lot more with the story. It has a good character arc and everything, but it just doesn't feel big. Even tho there were some emotional parts, it still just doesn't help. It remains just kinda okay, but nothing more. And there should have been more. <br/><br/>This way it feels like this movie's only purpose is to introduce us to some new characters and it shouldn't be that way. And while the movie is well done and everything, it's just not as good as it can be."

","After Marvel Studios had great success in bringing Iron Man, a character perceived to be only popular in the comics, to the big screen, they began working on other solo hero projects with the overall aim to produce The Avengers; the first time a movie would be made using multiple characters from individual movies to share one universe<br/><br/>Thor is another one of Marvel's lesser-known characters outside the comic-books, compared to the likes of Spider-Man and Wolverine. Based loosely on the Norse legends, which are referenced in the movie as being inspired by the fictional Asgardian race, which is a nice bit of confusing 'chicken and the egg' theorem. Thor lives in Asgard with his father, Odin and brother, Loki, and acts as protectors of the nine realms across more insidious races such as the Frost Giants, but when the fragile truce between the Asgardians and Frost Giants of Jotunheim is threatened by Thor's strong-minded techniques, the Asgardian prince is banished to Midgard, better known to me and you as Earth.<br/><br/>I was unsure whether I would like the Norse mythology aspects to the story, but the film manages to make it seem convincing by portraying the Asgardians as otherworldly gods that inhabit another 'realm' as opposed to being spiritual. The mixture of magic and technology that is showcased in the frankly stunning CGI city of Asgard helps us identify with the characters and grounds them nicely into our world, explaining that the more primitive humans in the past had to explain their technology away as being Gods, which created our myths and legends.<br/><br/>The action scenes were very entertaining, and there was a healthy sense of humour to the proceedings too, which made the film very enjoyable. The 'fish out of water' scenes with Thor on Earth were handled well, but it was the sequences on Asgard that were the most visually and dramatically stunning. While I understand that the film needed to be set on Earth to both help the audience identify with the storyline, and secondly set up the forthcoming Avengers film, I do wish there had been more sequences in the fantastical Asgardian worlds. Perhaps a sequel would explore this area more, since it is something seldom shown in comic-book movies, which are so determined to set things in 'our universe'.<br/><br/>The cast is really strong, with great performances from Chris Hemsworth (Thor) who manages to start the film as brash and impatient, but evolves into a charming and thoughtful character. I also liked the calculating and sly Loki, played by Tom Middleston, who is so subtle in his performance that those watching the film unaware of the characters histories would not expect him to change allegiances throughout the movie. He also plays Loki much more complicated than I would have expected.<br/><br/>As a relatively novice to Thor (but not to comics), I really enjoyed this and found that it didn't require any prior knowledge from the comics, as it explained all of the characters well, and their relationship with each other. The robotic villain known as The Destroyer was actually quite threatening, despite looking too similar to Iron Man (something that is poked fun at in the dialogue, when The Destroyer first appears) and the Ice Giants didn't look quite as visually interesting as they could have been, so for any sequels, I would appreciate more varied designs for the enemies drawing on the fantastical elements of Thor's mythology once more."

","There are plenty of things wrong with this film, like there are with practically all of the marvel films.I don't like films that lean to heavily on special effects for instance, Thor does. I like a bit of plot and character development in my films, Thor has neither. Although, to be fair. Thor does turn from an arrogant prick into a nice helpful fellow in something like three minutes flat, if that's not character development I don't know what is. To continue: the fights are bonkers, events happen for little apparent reason, Blacks and Asians apparently can be Norse Gods (I don't mean to come across as a racist but I studied Norse mythology for a bit and there are no Blacks or Asians in it) and the one-liners are so cheesy you could catch mice with them.<br/><br/>All in all this film is full of things I hate (not that I hate blacks or Asians, really I don't) but I like it. The acting is solid, the overly-prevalent CGI does look good and the fact that there is no character development to worry about does mean there's plenty of action to keep you entertained.<br/><br/>In a sense films are similar to food. Sometimes you want to go all-out and have a fancy three-course meal at a high-end restaurant and sometimes you just want to have a kebab-roll with unnaturally orange gob leaking out the sides and garlic sauce dripping down your fingers. Thor is like the kebab-roll, it's not intellectual, high-brow or in any way intelligent, but it's likable in the right circumstances, just leave it for a day when you need some light entertainment."
"michael-3204","6","0","1","5 February 2016"," A step up for the MCU
","It would have been easy for the fourth entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe to collapse in a heap of silliness: the elaborate costumes; the extravagant playland that is Asgard (which somewhat resembles the Emerald City); the complicated retelling of Norse mythology. You need actors with the weight and seriousness of Anthony Hopkins and Idris Elba just to bring off the headgear. But this film has everything it needs to hold itself up and extra to boot. Rene Russo, for example, doesn't have nearly enough to do as Thor's mother. Director Kenneth Branagh and his small army of screenplay and story writers structure this as a basic hero's journey, mining culture and legend for little tropes that fit nicely. Thor's gang-of-five recall Robin Hood's Merry Men, except that here one is Jamie Alexander as the fiercely capable Lady Sith. Resonances with some of Shakespeare's history plays are interwoven without being too pointed. Unlike with Marvel's previous two entries, here the characters who remind everyone that ""The Avengers"" is coming aren't distractingly shoehorned in. Mostly, no one forgets to have fun with all this, especially not Chris Hemsworth in the deceptively simple title role. Not only does he look every bit the Man-God he's supposed to be, he hits all the emotional marks the story throws his way with the right mix of humor, arrogance and sincerity, and plays well off the other actors. The film's secret weapon is Tom Hiddleston's Loki, easily Marvel's best villain to date, who connives and deceives with the wit and aplomb you'd expect from a legendary trickster. Hiddleston manages the complicated feat of making Loki both fun to watch and someone to be wary of because of his unpredictability. ""Thor"" doesn't quite reach ""Iron Man""'s heights, but it is a good return to form after two lackluster MCU entries."

","So I gave Thor a try hearing that it was good. First, let me say that I am a big Natalie Portman fan so I definitely went into this with a bit of a bias. The movie opens up with a ""comet"" striking the earth as Portman and her crew investigate its origin. <br/><br/>This is when we are lead to the mythology that is Thor: Thor is a story about two different planets at war one with one another. When the king of the planet, Anthony Hopkins won the war, he temporarily blocked the other planet from being able to enter into the first planet. <br/><br/>He has two children, one of them being Thor. Now we come to know that Thor is very hot headed and is always in need to fight. This lead to the ordination of Thor, which was interrupted by an infiltration by Froze. Thor, in his anger, decides to go against his father and convinced his brother along with his four soldiers to go to Froze planet and destroy them all.<br/><br/>After destroying an army of froze and going back to their own planet, Thor is met by his own father, who in his anger due to the fact that Thor has possibly cause a future war, cast Thor, along with his powerful hammer, into earth where he loses all his power. <br/><br/>Her, Thor meets Natalie who is in search of a new galaxy system and finds Thor to be part of her future discovery. She and her sister decides to help Thor, despite their undeniable confusion towards his actions and behaviors. As the story progresses, you see Natalie and Thor increasingly being attracted to one another. <br/><br/>To his dismay, Thor realizes that he no longer has power to weird the hammer. <br/><br/>During these incidents, his brother found out his true origin as a froze and now plans to overthrow his father to become king. Subsequently, he is reunited with his four fellow soldiers as they fend off the robot sent by their ""new king/brother"" who overtook the throne with force. After regaining his power, Thor decides to travel back to his planet to confront his brother. Now let me beginning with one of the strongest points of the movie: Cinematographer. From the get go you see that the director has an eye for iconic scenes, from the settings of Thor's planet to the contrast he makes between earth and Thor's planet. There were one particular scene that highlights Thor's power with his Hammer that is reminiscent of Peter Jackson's helms deep sequence. The director's use of galactic and astronomical imagery improves the movie's grandeur and epic quality. Backdrops of Thor's planet are nothing sort of breathtaking and reminds you of Lucas' Galactic sequences. <br/><br/>Now, I'm a big believer in that if the special effects does not enhance the story, it should not be used. And to that I think the director did a good job, I felt as if every sequence involving the special effects were used for character development and storytelling purposes as opposed to it be just a show up, which many big budget blockbuster tends to utilize now a days. For example, the action sequences during Froze planet was a foundation for one of the biggest plot points of the movie as it precedes Thor's excommunication. It also serves to give the audience a sense of Thor's tremendous power with his hammer. I find the storytelling aspect of this movie extremely engaging, The parallel story lines between Thor's planets and that of earth adds to the complexity of Thor's character. It highlight's Thor's humanity as he loses his near invincible power. I think Christ hems worth did a great job with Thor, from his bulky, Viking-is behavior, He is able to portray a character that seems fish out of the water most of the time, yet is still humane enough for the audience to care about. there are sequences when he bulks around, or ask for a horse at a pet store, that evoke both hilarity and innocence and becomes great contrasting sequences between Thor' then versus Thor on present day earth. I think Natalie port man plays an impeccable role as the astronomer. She truly cares about what she does and you see how upset she gets when her work is questioned. Her work takes priority and the sense of urgency she has towards it's significance gives her character the appropriate intensity when alongside with Thor. There is a scene where her and Thor got intimate that highlights the thorough character development that adds a much needed human touch to the galactic nature of the film. <br/><br/>Overall, I think along with the cinematographer, the story telling aspect of this movie is what makes it for me. The myth of Thor is fleshed out in the beginning of the movie that adds to the intense conflicts Thor eventually faces on earth. Throughout the various sequences, the Thor myth becomes more and more believable as the characters begin to show their strengths and weaknesses and who they are in the context of both their planet and their presence on earth. The hammer also plays an important part in establishing Thor's tremendous power."
"craig-hopton","6","0","3","21 May 2015"," It was OK
","Thor was OK. It was basically a hugely Americanised modernisation of Norse mythology, with the gods turned into superheroes. What I did like was the way the gods were presented in their home of Asgard. It was a mix of industry, magic and Sci-Fi that seemed to fit the Norse characters well. I also liked the character of Loki, who was positioned quite rightly as the trickster, neither good guy or bad guy who looks out for himself and no one else.<br/><br/>Then there's the perfectly good superhero-type fight scenes. Thor throwing his hammer around, beating up monsters 50 times his size, creating hurricanes, etc. All good.<br/><br/>So shame all of that was secondary to the 'humanised' story of Thor as a man literally brought down to Earth, stripped of his powers because of his arrogance, and sent off to find his humility. All very Americanised and a story that could be told about virtually any character. Not what I was ideally looking to get from a movie about Norse gods."
"CinemaClown","Null","0","1","26 March 2015"," Not As Mighty As Its Titular Character But Definitely A Step-Up For Marvel
","Fantasy isn't really a genre I usually approach with open arms but I can't deny that some of the most dazzling cinematic experiences I've had came from this category of films, from examples like The Lord of the Rings. Now Marvel's Thor isn't even close to that classic nor it aims for that level of grandeur but it still qualifies as a good, if not great, adventure- fantasy that nicely balances its dark & light elements to deliver a entertainment that's pretty satisfiable.<br/><br/>Marking the fourth instalment in Marvel Cinematic Universe, Thor tells the story of its titular character; the crown prince of Asgard & the god of thunder who wields a magical hammer. The plot covers his banishment from his realm to Earth where he forms a relationship with Jane Foster; an astrophysicist who found him, and later tries to get back to his homeland in order to stop his adopted brother Loki from ascending the Asgardian throne.<br/><br/>Directed by Kenneth Branagh, Thor gets many things right from start to finish whether it's properly introducing the Asgardian culture to its audience, fab use of humour blended with cleverly weighed human drama, separate tints for separate realms present in its story, brilliant production design plus a pleasing score by Patrick Doyle but its plot is also too predictable & generic while its visual effects fluctuate in either directions.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Thor features an impressive cast in Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Tom Hiddleston, Stellan Skarsgård & Anthony Hopkins. Not everyone manages to impress here, some are even embarrassing but both Hemsworth & Hiddleston more than make up for what the rest of its cast lacked, as the former proves that he's capable of carrying a larger-than-life character responsibly while the latter chips in with a chameleon- like performance that's equally mischievous.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Thor has its share of flaws & shortcomings but thanks to Hemsworth's magnetic presence, good enough narrative, plenty of spectacles & the way it juggles its dark themes with light-hearted humour, this film is worth a shot. There's one scene where Thor searches reunites with his hammer for the first time after his banishment to Earth but the manner in which that whole sequence plays out, it's hard to not elevate your expectations a bit after watching that. All in all, Thor may not be as memorable as Iron Man but out of the then-four films released by Marvel, this was a sure shot runner-up."

Also gives the origins to a main villain in the marvel cinematic universe, Loki, in a very smart way that might not everyone noticed. Also the score is very good, gives to Thor and his father Odin a Jesus and God-like looking. Also I want to remind the presence of Natalie Portman.

"Horst_In_Translation","6","0","1","10 February 2015"," Another solid Marvel superhero film
","""Thor"" is another directorial effort from Academy Award nominated actor, director and writer Kenneth Branagh. The film features Chris Hemsworth as the hero, Tom Hiddleston as his brother, Anthony Hopkins as their dad and Natalie Portman, Kat Dennings and Stellan Skarsgård as a trio of scientists. Idris Elba plays a minor part too and made the most of it. This was the second or third time I watched this movie and I have to say it really lost most of its charm during rewatch. The one thing that stays in the mind though is the brilliantly looking gigantic rainbow bridge.<br/><br/>There were quite a few negative things about this as well. One big flaw is the sound. The voices are just so silent while the action sequences are way too loud. Hemsworth does a solid job, but Natalie Portman was a bit of a disappointment here. Shortly after her Academy Award win, this must be one of the weakest performances of her career. The ""O M G""-moment was downright cringeworthy and there are two or three more scenes like that. Apart from that, I wonder what Thor saw in her. Dennings' character is far cooler, more interesting, funny and seemingly a great time to be with, if she doesn't attack you with her taser. But of course Portman is the bigger star and the much better scientist in this film, so yeah, they took her as Thor's love interest. Oh and finally Stellan Skarsgård completes the trio. Not much to say here. Solid performance, but not too much to work with. His short scene after the closing credits was probably the most interesting thing about him.<br/><br/>This film had no happy end for Portman's character and Thor, but it's obviously not final. Loki said there is other ways to get to Planet Earth and there is already another Thor movie out and there will be a third and he is also in the Avengers films, so... lots of room left for relationship and character development. What I did like about the film was the hammer storyline that not everybody could pull it out, but I would have preferred if he had actually managed to take it after his transformation instead of the hammer flying right at him, when he fought that strange robot-like creature Loki sent. Said creature was actually a weak point. I'd have this film preferred to stay a bit closer to its Nordic roots than go full superhero movie because so many already do and it could have made for a nice change. Hopkins and Thor's gang also did not do too much for me. I think they could have cut at least 15 minutes from this slightly-under 2-hour film and it would have improved the overall quality.<br/><br/>The frost giants were okay as villains, but not half as interesting as Loki. Tom Hiddleston does a fine job here with portraying Thor's tortured ""brother"" with whom you never know if he is caring, ruthless or just plain evil. Or if he is loyal and if yes, then towards whom. Easily one of the film's highlights and some awards bodies agree. All in all, I recommend this film. It had actually a great opportunity to turn out as a somewhat different creative superhero film, but unfortunately it still stayed fairly generic and (too) close to the genre. That does not mean, however, that it's a bad film. If you enjoy superhero films, you will probably have a good time watching this. If I remember correctly, I gave it even an 8/10 the first time I watched it, but now 6 seems more accurate."

","'Thor', in short, is a decent film that has both pros and cons. I enjoyed it immensely. It had an interesting plot, good pacing, a reasonable amount of action, great actors, and decently written characters. There were, however, two major letdowns: unnecessary, forced, heterosexual romance and rushed character development.<br/><br/>Pros first.<br/><br/>The plot was original and interesting. Thor's arrogance and destructive tendencies get him banished and he has to mature so he can wield Mjolnir again and return to Asgard. This is beautifully interwoven with Loki's secret plots and schemes to rule Asgard and win the favour of his parents. Loki's progression from protagonist to villain is incredibly fascinating, and his realistic motivations and charming exterior make him a memorable one.<br/><br/>Marvel, as always, has great casting directors and Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston played Thor and Loki (respectively) wonderfully. People have joked that 'Marvel grows its actors on trees' and I think this can be applied to 'Thor', in which Hemsworth and Hiddleston portray the brothers' chemistry and rivalry perfectly.<br/><br/>The visuals are beautiful as well. The realm of Asgard is majestic and glorious. The rainbow of the Bifrost and the stars are all displayed to enhance its beauty. Not many films these days have beauty for the sake of beauty, but Thor is one of them. All of this is backed up by a great soundtrack from composer Patrick Doyle, who manages to capture the grandiose nature of Asgard, as well as the intimate emotions of the characters.<br/><br/>Cons now.<br/><br/>'Thor', like so many other films, contains the cliché of unnecessary heterosexual romance. The chemistry between Thor and Jane is incredibly forced and irritating, and seems to be no more a superficial infatuation. Their awkward exchanges left me cringing with secondhand embarrassment. Jane is reduced to a love interest and a plot device for Thor's character development, the unfortunate fate of so many female characters these days.<br/><br/>Thor's development from bullheaded, arrogant idiot to sensible, intelligent hero is too rushed. Played out only over two days, Thor's sudden desire to sacrifice himself for his new-found friends earns him the right to wield Mjolnir again. This is obviously too sudden, and perhaps another half-hour of screen time would have done this film good. Also, self-sacrifice is by no means a determination of maturity and/or humility, so Thor's immediate refusal to destroy the Frost Giants afterwards seems rather stretched and implausible.<br/><br/>Sadly, the cons are both major plot points of the story and have reduced an otherwise good film to a 6/10."

","So we have the next big Marvel hero adaptation on the long highway to 'The Avengers' with 'Iron Man' so far being a surprise decent film, this time its Thor's turn to roll the dice. Again I am pleasantly surprised at how reasonably competent this film is, I thought this would be a hideous mess but actually its not too bad. I'm not gonna get carried away and say its a brilliant film as it isn't, in my opinion 'Iron Man' is better but this is OK despite the silly material. Branagh has done well in his attempt and done half the work in the casting, all players add good realism and gravitas to the cheesy plot allowing the film to just about get by. Hopkins, Hemsworth and Hiddleston are the best contributors of course and were great choices for the roles, they looked right and didn't come across camp in any way.<br/><br/>The effects are decent and not too obvious, a very colourful and vivid film and some good stand out moments like the Rancor type creature on Jotunheim showcasing decent CGI. The Frost Giants looked reasonable but slightly childish for me whilst the giant metallic Destroyer looked rather B-movie-ish and tacky to be honest, a bit like Gort from 'The Day the Earth Stood Still' (1951). Asgard was impressive and colourful looking neat n sharp harking back to cityscape's of the new Star Wars trilogy and just as good.<br/><br/>I'm not up on the whole Thor comicbook plot to be honest but I admit I still found faults with things in the film, obviously Thor and his homeworld are aliens, an alien race (which are exactly the same as humans? hmm) but also somehow manage to have horses ale roast beef pork etc...in their realm too? kinda silly methinks, oh and everyone speaks English it seems. <br/><br/>There is nice humour throughout which is good, Thor getting accustomed to earth has good moments, but The Warriors Three felt way too farcical and lame frankly, they just came across as inept posh talking sidekicks much like C3PO from 'Star Wars', they also looked like characters from a kids cartoon which let down the rest of the quite good costumes.<br/><br/>You never find out about the other realms, there is no real reason for why Odin goes into a coma or sleep and the Frost Giants did seem kinda lame, uninspired and unoriginal (if they were made for the film?) with a silly name. Of course if you know the comicbook all this might be common knowledge but for myself it isn't.<br/><br/>Overall I liked this but lets face it it was pretty hokey really, a modern day Flash Gordon if we're being honest here, it wasn't camp but it was very very gentle and cartoony which I did suspect as Thor is a hard character to put on film I think. Its a valiant attempt but I just think it could of been better or a bit more serious and less like an action figure promotion.<br/><br/>6/10"
"Scott-hind","6","0","1","20 October 2014"," Was never going to be an epic... Has its moments none the less
","I'm no fan of superhero movies. I find them a mind numbing mash of explosions and idiotic dialogue. When watching Thor I thought I was in for the same. The answer... Yes and no. <br/><br/>Let's start with the negative because let be honest their more fun. The plot towards the end is daft. Like most superhero/action/sci-fi movies it starts well then blows everything up with a dull predictable supposed climax. The over theatrical dialogue for asguard can be a little much, almost like its ripping itself off. Laufey is a pretty forgettable villein and some other charatures are under developed. The biggest problem of this film is having a brilliant classical actor, Antony Hopkins, reduced to a grumpy old man.<br/><br/>OK negatives out the way let's move on to the pluses. This has to be the most beautiful superhero movie ever made and I'm not talking about Natalie Portman, (ok maybe a little). Chris Hemsworth gives a fantastically underrated performance as he portrays the change from arrogant hothead to respectable and likable hero. <br/><br/>The saving grace of this movie though is the comedy. This film is fantastically funny. Using juxtaposition to perfection, and brilliant banter.<br/><br/>All in all, not as good as say the dark knight trilogy but an enjoyable film well worth a watch."

","Thor is a visually brilliant movie but it unfortunately is lacking in substance. The character development of the gods is good but they have overlooked the humans. They feel weak and somewhat unnecessary to the story. While a few of the things are lacking the action sequences are very entertaining. They have put a lot of money into the special effects and it shows.<br/><br/>To be honest, Thor is a dick. I'm not sure if it's Chris Hemsworth's portrayal or if that is just the character but he is incredibly unlikeable.

","Highlight: when Idris cracks his icy shell and saves Thors stupid butt. Lowlight: when Loki's dad makes him kill himself (nasty man) Question:why are they all douches? Are we meant to think Thor is a good guy now? Seriously? Fact: Loki is just a misunderstood, out casted and racially abused man who has major daddy issues that could have all been avoided if his dad had opened up more and just said yes. Opinion: too many irrelevant, close ups of Natalie Portman's face during fight scenes in which she was not even involved. Statement: Nothing happens with the rest of the blue people. Thought of the day: If someone looks like they are about to kill themselves don't just say no and leave it at that. Anticipating: Loki's return and the other blue people entering the story and Thor's relationship status explained. Question 2: why did Thor break that bridge anyway? Question 3: why was Idris frozen for so long when he could easily break himself free? Question 4: why did Loki go to earth and tell Thor all those lies when Thor couldn't return anyway? Was that necessary? Question 5: what the hell was wrong with the Dad anyway? He seemed fine by the end! (literally) Question 6: who is Donald and why should he stay away from bars? Question 7: why was Thor so happy after he found out his dad had died and he could never return? Question 8: why did Thor wait so long to get with Natalie Portman? Side note: no idea what Natalie Portman's character was actually called in this film. Summary: Great film, really enjoyed it. V.entertaining. Made no sense whatsoever.

","Thor was arguably the toughest of the Avengers characters to realize in live action. Tony Stark, Steve Rogers and Bruce Banner may be special, but they're also human and their adventures take place here on terra firma. Thor on the other hand is a Norse God from a far flung world that none of us can relate to. Thankfully Marvel and director Kenneth Branagh were up to the task.<br/><br/>While it has a fairly modest scope, 'Thor' benefits greatly from its focus on character. There's a journey here that helps us to connect with the mythic character. I also feel the love story, not hot or passionate, but tender and sweet, really adds a strong element of emotion and helps raise the stakes. It also features the MCU's best villain to date in Loki. A hero is only as good as his villain, and Loki takes 'Thor' to another level.<br/><br/>While not a classic, 'Thor' is a solidly entertaining origin story and a serviceable cog in the Marvel machine."

","When I first heard that Thor was being made with Chris Hemsworth as Thor. I didn't give it much hope. Then I heard Ken Brangh was directing and I said Oh I might check this out after all. and I am Glad I did. It's a solid movie. With a solid cast. Hemsworth comes across as the Arrogant Thor who needs to learn a lesson. Sir Anthony Hopkins steals the show as The all powerful Odin. Natalie Prtman steals hearts as JAne Foster and Tom Huddleson ? It's his movie to lose. His Loki gives us the most compelling bad guy with a personality. He has a reason to feel the anger he does and the hate. While Odin selects Thor to take his place as King of Asgard Loki uncovers a secret that nearly destroys everything. He is not Odin's son. he is in fact the son of the frost giant King. And Loki was taken from a battlefield and raised to be Odin's son. The God of Mischiefwants the throne of Asgard for himself. So he sets a plot in motion to send Thor into Exile and to remove Odin out of his way. Along the way Thor learns his lessons. And Loki decides to take the fight to Earth to get rid of his half brother once and for all. While Thor the Dark World is better in some ways. THOR has the better characterization. It brings Thor very nicely into the MArvel U and helps set up the Avengers in a very nice and very good way. Some claim it's the weakest MArvel movie. Others think it's a insult to the Mrvel U. I tend to think of it as one of the cornerstones of the cinematic Marvel U. Because Without Thor. There would be no Avengers. While not the best marvel movie. It certainly is one of the more watchable ones."

","One of the better action flicks, it had a cohesive story line and good actors that helped bring this tale to life. <br/><br/>I especially liked Chris Hemsworth (as Thor), and Natalie Portman (as Jane Foster), and their earthly relationship. It was interesting to see the Norse gods (future spin) and their tale in the modern world action films. <br/><br/>Thor the son of Odin (Anthony Hopkins), banished from Asgard for disobeying his father's orders. On Earth, he arrives without his powers and learns humility from the earthlings he meets. He falls in love with Jane and helps her regain her research from the government agents trying to steal their discoveries. Back on Asgard, his adopted brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) tries to prove his worth to his father so that he will make him the king. But does this by deceit and betrayal of both his brother and his father. <br/><br/>Thor was directed by Kenneth Branagh, who did a great job bringing theatrical drama to this spectacular action flick.

","I can't say I was a fan of the superhero and his comics before the film, in fact I actually decided to watch this based on the cast (most of whom I am a fan of) and what a pleasant surprise it turned out to be. <br/><br/>So the story begins with scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her crew conducting research in the middle of the desert of New Mexico when their equipment registers a strange astronomical anomaly. They race towards its ground zero to investigate, then suddenly out of nowhere a man appears and is hit by their vehicle. They team stops to see what they hit as soon as they see it's what looks like a man they quickly bundle him up into their vehicle and head for the hospital. Meanwhile, stranger things begin to happen all around them and it isn't long before they discover that their new companion is not of this earth.

","THOR<br/><br/>I know out of all the superhero films that have been released, this one got one of the worst reviews, but to be honest I liked it. It was not the worst one by far... Captain America was terrible.<br/><br/>This movie is about a God who is banished from Asgard to Earth to live among the humans... but when he is here he becomes one of the heroes that protects us.<br/><br/>The action in this film is great. I always thought Thor was quite boring before watching this. But this film soon changed my opinion on him. The fighting scenes were great and full of excitement.<br/><br/>This film is also visually beautiful. The scenes up in Asgard look amazing, especially at the bridge. The effects were brilliant too. The machines and creatures looked brilliant.<br/><br/>The acting was questionably from a couple of people, but the main cast did a good job. The movie stars Chris Hemsworth, Anthony Hopkins, Natalie Portman, Tom Hiddleston, Stellan Skarsgard and Kat Dennings. Another actor that was a supporting cast member but deserves a mention is Idris Elba. That man has been in so much recently and he is great in everything I have seen him in... except that Sky advert. haha. Tom was the star of the movie though. He played his part so well that you didn't realise he was turning into the bad guy of the movie until it was too late.<br/><br/>There are some comedy moments in this film too, but they are places and done so well that it didn't take anything away from the action or the story. It was funny and perfect for the film.<br/><br/>All in all this film was not as bad as everyone else thought it was.

","(see original at http://cobyscomics.blogspot.com/2014/02/thor.html)<br/><br/>As good as Iron Man, Incredible Hulk, and Iron Man 2 were, they were all just prologue. Thor is when the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) really kicks off.<br/><br/>I think I enjoyed Thor more this time than any previous viewing. The first time I watched Thor (on a bootleg DVD in Afghanistan), I was bored with all the Asgard stuff and just wanted to get on with the story that mattered, the one of Thor on Earth interacting with S.H.I.E.L.D. The second time I watched Thor (just before watching Dark World), I found myself wanting more Asgard and less flirting between Thor and Jane. This time, I was able to enjoy the movie for what it was: an outstanding origin story (of sorts) for Thor and his introduction to the MCU.<br/><br/>Thor = Jesus ?<br/><br/>One thing I couldn't help but noticing this time I watched Thor thwas the parallels between Thor and Jesus. I'm not versed enough in Norse mythology to know if these parallels actually exist, or if they just made them up for this movie. Either way, I appreciated them. Once you think about it in this light, they become pretty obvious. Thor is forsaken by his father Odin. Thor dies fighting the Destroyer and then comes back to life and saves everyone. Stuff happens, then he returns to Asgard, promising to one day return.<br/><br/>Loki<br/><br/>Tom Hiddleston's performance during Thor went largely unnoticed the first couple times I watched it. Maybe it was because I have now seen him in three movies, or maybe it was because I've read other people's (far better movie critics than I) opinion of his acting, but wow, it is good.<br/><br/>Frost Giants<br/><br/>Am I the only one who feels sorry for the Frost Giants? I mean, when Thor, Sif, and the Warriors Three first go to Jottenheim, they kill like dozens, if not hundreds, of them (or 76). And then Loki vaporizes Laufey and turns the Bifrost on and attempts to obliterate their entire planet! Are Frost Giants not sentient beings, also? Poor, poor Frost Giants.... It's a good thing Thor was there to save the day by smashing the Rainbow Bridge, else their entire species might've been genocided!<br/><br/>Easter Eggs<br/><br/>I missed the Infinity Gauntlet in Asgard's weapons vault.<br/><br/>But I totally caught that ""Journey into Mystery"" billboard!<br/><br/>I love these little nods Marvel puts in their movies for the comic fans out there.<br/><br/>After the Credits<br/><br/>Talk about a great tease! We see Nick Fury, the Cosmic Cube (err... I meant, Tesseract), and find out Loki didn't die after all! This scene actually got me hyped to watch The Avengers all over again!<br/><br/>Rating<br/><br/>If you'd asked me the previous times I watched Thor, I would've given it a much lower rating, maybe 5 or 6 out of 10. But now, being able to watch it in context with the rest of the MCU, I love it! 9 out of 10!"
"annasuwinski","9","0","1","2 February 2014"," Simply 'Marvelous'
","This movie was for the better lack of words, simply 'Marvelous'(Excuse my pun). I could go on and on about how they had made every detail spot on from the depiction of Asgard to the All Father. What I like to touch on and thought that they had executed brilliantly was the simplicity of the story line. It allowed for the characters to breathe and grow. Where most of Marvel's superhero movies basically is like watching a WWF match. Pretty much staged and dramatised action. In Thor, although you do get action, it played a supporting role to the story line. The whole movie revolved around siblings who just want to impress their father. The fact that anyone could be pushed to the brink just to see the glimmer of acceptance and pride in the eyes of the people that they love, can be related to just about everybody. The emotional journey from a brother who realised what his ignorance has cost him to a brother who struggles to stand alone and be accepted and appreciate, all was played perfectly by Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston. Nothing but praise in that department. Probably one of the most emotional and heartbreaking line:<br/><br/>""I could have done it father. For you, for all of us.""<br/><br/>What came next left me in pieces. The quote symbolises an ending, a beginning and practically sums up the entire movie and character. And it was the line that launched a mighty fandom. Overall, the movie to me scored high marks all around from the visuals, story line and acting to even the score which I must say was one of the best movie scores I have heard in a while. Well done to Patrick Doyle! It brought all the emotions out and evidently lifted the movie to a whole new level."

But that's to be expected of anything Marvel. Obviously there are some plot holes and as a science major, I felt myself mentally shaking my head at certain parts.

","In the pantheon of Marvel Superheroes, from my vantage point, Thor is a second-tier player. Even amongst non-obsessive comic aficionados, such as myself, Thor doesn't quite have the readership draw or the common familiarity in the public that heroes such as Spider-Man, Batman, Superman, etc., have. However, that doesn't mean that Marvel Studios, the filmmaking wing of the company, feel inclined to give the filming adaptation of Thor short shrift. The cinematic entry for this character, titled simply Thor, is among the better of the Marvel adaptations of recent years, mixing a good sense of fun, strong acting, and some Shakespearian level drama that makes for an especially entertaining time at the movies.<br/><br/>Liberally adapting portions of Thor comic book lore to fit in a more modern comic book film reality, Thor introduces us to a centuries old war between the Asgardians, beings that live for long periods of time and can travel through space from their home realm of Asgard to various other worlds, such as Earth, via the Bi-Frost bridge, and the conflict centric Frost Giants, whom the Asgardians conquered some time back. Odin (Anthony Hopkins), ruler of the Asgardians, is preparing to abdicate his throne to his son, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), but on the eve of Thor's inauguration, agents of the Frost Giants infiltrate Asgard and attempt to steal back a device that is the key to their power, which had been taken by Odin at the end of their long struggle. When Thor disagrees with his father's desire to not to retaliate in order to not disturb the peace that currently exists between the Asgardians and the Frost Giants, he takes matters into his own hands, traveling to the Frost Giant's realm with his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), and compatriots Sif (Jaimie Alexander), Volstagg (Ray Stevenson), Hogun (Tadanobu Asano) and Fandral (Josh Dallas) in tow. When the encounter with the Frost Giants ends with tensions re-ignited between the two factions, Odin decides that his son is not prepared to lead his people, and exiles Thor, sans his powers, to Earth.<br/><br/>When he arrives on Earth, he is discovered by astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her associates Professor Selvig (Stellan Skarsgaard) and Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings), who are convinced that he isn't a random homeless vagabond that they found in the middle of the desert. Thor must attempt to locate his power hammer, Mjolnir, from the government agents that have captured it, and attempt to reclaim his place in Asgard. However, he finds that, without his super-human abilities, and surrounded by humans, perhaps some of his previous attitudes were incorrect, especially when he connects romantically with Jane. Meanwhile, Loki, who turns out to have some ulterior motives, seizes control of Asgard following the collapse of Odin from strain, and begins to hatch a grand scheme involving the Frost Giants.<br/><br/>Thor, much like Iron Man before it, proves that, in the right hands, a comic tale that appears silly on the surface can have hidden depths when properly plumbed. Sure, Thor has elements that, on the face of it, may lead a bit to some audience snickers (Thor's ability to pick himself up and fly and defeat attackers with little effort are a bit cheesy at times), but the creative behind Thor, including director Kenneth Branagh, manage to develop a story for Thor that deals with elements of tragedy, pathos, selflessness and, perhaps even more surprisingly, involving character development. Thor is more about the lead characters at its core, again akin to Iron Man, than some other comic book films and this draws the audience into its tale."

","In the realm known as Asgard, ""Thor"" (Chris Hemsworth) is about to be sworn in as the new king by his father ""Odin"" (Anthony Hopkins). Out of jealousy his brother ""Loki"" (Tom Hiddleston) arranges for some Frost Giants to appear which causes the ceremony to be interrupted. While Odin considers the incident as an unfortunate inconvenience, Thor believes it to be a violation of a peace agreement between Asgard and the Frost Giants and decides to venture to Jotunheim to teach them a lesson. Odin commands him not to take matters into his own hands. Thor disobeys and with a few companions ventures to the kingdom of the Frost Giants anyway. This turns out to be a big mistake as Thor and his friends are surrounded and would have been killed had Odin not suddenly appeared to rescue them in the nick of time. Once back in Asgard Odin is furious and casts Thor down to Earth as a mortal human being. Anyway, rather than detail the rest of the story and risk spoiling the film for those who haven't seen it, I will just say that I think that this is one of the best ""comic book"" movies ever made. It has plenty of action but it doesn't go overboard with it. It also has good CGI but doesn't rely too heavily upon it either. It has some nice humor but even more important--it has a good plot. Definitely above average."

","I'm not sure if there is all that much I can say about this superhero movie. Personally I'm not a big fan of superheroes nor am I a big fan of comic books. I prefer prose any day since comic books do seem to take a little more effort to read than does your average novel (okay, I know, I'm nuts, but I guess that is just me).<br/><br/>This movie has more to do with the marvel comic book hero than it does with the Norse god, though the movie does suggest that they are one in the same. It is a part of the marvel story arc that I am told began with Iron Man, though I am unsure where it is completed, though it suggests that it will be the avengers. Captain America comes out shortly, as a new Hulk is also being filmed. As for Spiderman, well I liked the Sam Rami Spiderman movies, but that is probably more to do with Sam Rami than anything else.<br/><br/>Anyway, the movie is set on Asgard, Thor's home, and on Earth. The people of Asgard are at war with the frost giants, but Odin, the king of Asgard, won and stole their magical item that gives them immense power. However, a frost giant sneaks into Asgard and is stopped, however this angers Thor and he travels to the land of the frost giants to declare war on them. This upsets Odin who casts him out of Asgard and to earth where he has been stripped of the hammer that gives him his power.<br/><br/>So, in a nutshell this movie is a sort of fish out of water movie, and this was something that I could tell from the trailers. We have Thor, the superhero without his powers trying to understand an alien world. We have Shield, which is a secret organisation of superheros, who are trying to free his hammer from the rock, and we have the humans who, well, simply tag along because we need humans in this movie to relate too. Of course, there is the love interest between Thor and one of the humans, though I generally get on edge when we have mortals and immortals falling in love. I guess that has a lot to do with my classical and biblical education. However, it is an enjoyable movie, and is a good waste of 2 hours with ones friends."

","I have been dragged through the Marvel milieu by my son. Contrary to my snobbish initial prejudices, I have enjoyed these quite a bit. This one, of course, sets the stage for the appearance of Thor, the hammer-wielding hunk, who is striving top prove himself worthy of becoming king in the upper-world, possibly displacing Anthony Hopkins' Odin at some point. The fly in the ointment (actually there are several) is his sort of half brother, Loki, whose face reminds me of a hybrid of Brent Spiner and Pee Wee Herman. He is really full of the Dickens and totally amoral, especially after finding out a secret which I will not divulge. The strength of this film is that it does a very nice job of storytelling, despite it's ignorance of real Norse mythology. Nobody cares. We understand the powers of the characters, we like the romance between mortal and demi-god, the main character is charming though violent, and the movie has a sense of humor, where we can be allowed to take a breath at times. And there are unanswered questions, which have us waiting for the next adventure. Unfortunately for me, I've seen these things all out of order, so I try to evaluate them on their individual merits.

I can't explain how pleased I was with Hemsworth's acting, he played the arrogant warrior that is Thor perfectly. Now if only Chris Evans can pull of Captain America, I honestly think The Avengers will be the biggest movie of all time. Anthony Hopkins was a great addition but I just wish he would have had more screen time. I believe Natalie Portman is one of the greatest actresses of my generation, she knows how to connect with the audience. But sadly she did not bring her A-game on this one, it might have been the screenplay, but all of Portman's dialogue falls flat.<br/><br/>The first hour of the film flies by in the blink of an eye, and all of it was extremely engaging. Then the film begins to drag when they keep showing how well Thor is adapting to human culture. We get it the first three times, no need to keep forcing it to the audience. I really loved what Kenneth Branagh did with most of this film, and for his first time directing a big Hollywood budget movie he did a damn good job at it.

It ends with an extended trailer for the next THOR Film <br/><br/>Go look THOR up on Wikipedia. The quantity & extent of the commercial exploitation of the whole THOR 'Thing' is extraordinary. The makers lost a lot that should be in THIS film for greed & impatience for other releases. I know there is the tradition in Comic books for each episode to end with leads for the next. But this is a Film not a Comic book. @@@"

","Pretty straightforward adaptation of the comic book from the House of Marvel, Chris Hemsworth is suitably young, dumb and full of bravado as the Mighty Thor and there is a good performance from Tom Hiddlestone as the scheming Loki. Anthony Hopkins is effortlessly god-like as Odin, but Natalie Portman's role is off-the-shelf action heroine - which she could do in her sleep I'm sure. The presence of Stellan Skarsgard is reassuring as is Clark Gregg's return as Agent Couslon, and a brief cameo by Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye, the last two being preludes to great things to come (we hope). There is clunkiness to some passages of dialogue, but there are also many nice touches. Asgard is beautifully rendered; the juxtaposition of the different modes of speech works nicely and Stan the Man makes his habitual Hitchcockian appearance. Kenneth Brannagh makes a great job all round including generating a feeling of great distance between Earth and Asgard. The Earth-bound scenes seem narrow in scope, but that's a minor quibble, in the end it's all good comic book fun and whets the appetite for the main event – 98 days and counting!"

He is cast out of Asgard by Odin. Astrophysicists Dr. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård) with assistant Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings) are tracking spatial anomalies when they find a disoriented Thor.<br/><br/>This is simply setting up for Marvel. They have laid out a series of movie that led to the Avengers and beyond. Kenneth Branagh directs this introduction to Thor. Chris has some work behind him, but this is his international breakout. It lays the groundwork for the world of Asgard and introduces other important characters like Loki. It's not completely compelling. There is a lot of history expositions. The Asgard world is very golden, and the frost giants live on an ice world. The movie goes into a long section in the Alien worlds at the beginning. It's a lot of CGI to slog through. The wonderment of it all wears thin. The love story is rather stiff. Natalie Portman's chemistry with Chris Hemsworth is fair but it could much better.

","3D Blu-Review... Marvel has given us a plethora of great entertainment the last few years leading up to the ""The Avengers"" last summer, part of that was introducing us to Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger the year before that. Both movies are available in 3-D, and the films actually both good as far as movies go, differ in the 3-D arena drastically. Thor tells us the story of the Norse god himself, living in Asgard, a beautiful world ran by Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) father, King Odin (Anthony Hopkins), and protected by Thor, his friends, and Thor's brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston). After a break in to the kingdom by what appears to be their old foes the Frost Giants, Thor and his entourage seek revenge for the invasion. Odin thwarts war just in time, and in turn banishes Thor to Earth, hoping he may learn a thing or two about becoming a King, and earn his rightful place on the throne. In the meantime Loki seems to be responsible for the events and is stirring up trouble behind the scenes, leading to Odin falling into a coma, and Loki taking the throne of Asgard.<br/><br/>On Earth Thor keeps running into a few scientists, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård), and Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings) who were chasing a storm that seemed to include Thor inside. Thor's friends start to smell something foul and question Loki, and try to find their friend on Earth. The climax ramps up and the action is well paced. Director Kenneth Branagh does good with the ""Aquaman"" of the Marvel Universe. I never felt Thor needed his own film, but it works.<br/><br/>What doesn't work so well in this film is the 3-D. It is very difficult to make out anything in any of the darker scenes. Some scenes work, but for the most part the 3-D presentation is lackluster at best. The 2-D version of the film is fine, but unfortunately I cannot recommend this movie in 3-D, a first for me."

","I finally got to watch the movie Thor with Natalie Portman and Chris Hemsworth. While I was never into comic books growing up I do like how the Marvel comics have been brought to life over the last few years. Being a historian and one that likes the different cultures of the ancient world, I liked how the Norse Gods were interpreted in this movie. According to the movie there are nine realms, Earth being one, and Asgard being another. The Norse Gods, as we know them, are protectors, of a sort, several hundred years ago these gods fought a war and won, protecting the other eight realms from Jötunheim, a frozen planet, whose inhabitants want what all evil wants, control. I won't give the whole plot away, IMDb has done that already, all I will say is watch it. It's pretty good. Special effects are great. Anthony Hopkins makes a great Odin. Hemsworth is a great Thor. Can't wait for the sequel to come out this November."
"jackmeat","7","0","1","17 May 2013"," Another fine Marvel film that breaks the superhero mold
","Movie review:OK, slightly behind (I kind of forgot to watch this) but excuses aside, I enjoyed this movie. Yes, I am a comic geek, so may be a tad biased, although admittedly I did not read ""Thor"" so the rating is on movie merits alone. The movie follows the life of a ""G-d"" in the form of Thor(Chris Hemsworth), who is the god of thunder. He is raised in Asgard to become the heir of the throne to a pseudo-Greek mythological type world of people with extraordinary powers. When Thors arrogance to unleash a war upon a race of frost giants that has been ensuing for many years breaks the code of a treaty of peace, Thor is banished from Asgard without his powers and his mighty hammer to the end of the worlds, or as we know it, Earth. Yes there is a side story to all this, but it is weaved between events on Asgard and Earth to tell the hows and whys of the occurrences leading to Thors punishment. Well, now on Earth, without any power and no sense of what being mortal actually is which leads to some humorous scenes, he meets his new friends by being hit by a car containing astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her associates Professor Selvig (Stellan Skarsgaard) and Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings). These lucky folks decide that he isn't some wandering drunk and help him on his plight to retrieve his magical hammer. During the relationship with Jane and back in Asgard, Thors brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is able to seize the throne of king as Odin (Anthony Hopkins) falls ill, but does Loki have some ulterior motives here? The movie moves on with a steady hand of extremely well done character development that being helmed by Kenneth Branagh did not surprise me at all. A master of making you believe in the characters is something no one does much better, and in the unbelievable story material he was given, he scores an A+. The scenes in Asgard look absolutely breathtaking, the scenes in the frost kingdom look so dismal you can almost feel the chill, and earth, well, that is just New Mexico, nothing exciting (but some very good camera-work helps here). Of course, there is going to be some exciting action sequences to tide you over, but this movie is really about the acting and chemistry of the cast which is something to appreciate greatly. I only wish they would've given a bit more time to the romance between Thor and Jane (yes, I did just type that). Their love story seemed to be an afterthought swept under the rug to keep the comic book story going. Ultimately this movie, and Marvel studios, again bring out a quality picture about a superhero, but doesn't just use eye candy action to wow the viewer, but uses real emotions to draw the audience into the trials and turmoils that occur. 6.8/10 IMDb 7.0. Oh, after the credits, there is a bit of more info about the Shield that unfolds which is part of the ongoing story of the Avengers. Enjoy."

","This movie gets better every time you watch it. The first time I saw it in theaters, the effects and the fast pace of the plot drew my attention away from the storyline, which is simple enough to neglect. But what I didn't realize is how well written the characters are. I love how these comic-book movies are being connected now, and how they focus on entertainment, the story and the characters, over serious dialogue or complex messages, the way comics should be (I am pointing fingers, DC). Then there's Natalie Portman who, despite playing the gushing love interest decently enough, tends to slow things down when tensions run high, with less compelling (normal maybe) dialogue in what is otherwise a great, campy, extremely colorful fairytale about gods and monsters in a neat 90 minute, pg13 fantasy action adventure... AND THEN you get 15 minutes of the coolest flipping endcredit sequence of galaxies and wormholes all imploding and exploding in vibrant colors and shapes zooming through the universe in glorious 3D, so trippy and wonderful that the stoner in you cries tears of joy into the last bits of popcorn you forgot about because you were too busy verbally abusing your children from that recliner that has permanently morphed to your body shape from how many hours you waste watching movies and reading IMDb comments..."

","With 'Thor 2: Dark of the World' arriving later this summer, I decided now was the time to visit 'Thor' and all the other Avengers set up films. Released in 2011, a lot depended upon this film as this was really, an Avengers set up film. <br/><br/>The story of Thor is that an arrogant warrior, Thor, who wants to be brave and dangerous much like his father, the king of Asgard. As Thor is about to be crowned king, an event takes place as Asgard's enemies, the Frost Giants, return and begin their war. Thor then heads off to war unaware that his arrogance may prove costly so is put into exile by his father and lands on Earth, powerless and leaderless. During Thor's absence, Asgard is taken over and Thor must find a way to regain his power and prove worthy of the hammer.<br/><br/>Visually and storywise impressing, Thor has a lot to offer in terms of entertainment. The action sequences in this movie is the film's biggest strength, with these sequences being filmed extremely well. That is not all that is good about this film, the characters are written well, especially that of Thor and Loki, his brother. <br/><br/>This movie is generally directed well but suffers in terms of its romance plot, which really is an unrealistic portrayal of a romance between a wanna be scientist girl and a god of lightning. <br/><br/>If anything, the film's biggest weakness is that of Natalie Portman, whose performance at times resembles that of her in the Star Wars prequels. Her acting is very poor considering her Oscar worthy performance in 'Black Swan' a year earlier and her fantastic performance in Leon back in 1994. Her acting and her chemistry with Chris Hemsworth do make the romance plot extremely uncomfortable to watch and extremely unrealistic. <br/><br/>However, 'Thor' is mainly a Sci Fi Action film and that was what I was looking for. In most movies, that offer a sub plot romance, much like the Star Wars prew"

","According to the trivia page, Anthony Hopkins said this when he saw himself and Thor in their costumes. And he nailed it.<br/><br/>This film is nothing but a parade of special effects. The world the producers created is fantastic, but that's just about the only advantage of this film. I love great special effects, but there just needs to be more to a film than that. And Thor fails on every other level.<br/><br/>The story is almost ""by the book"" - an arrogant young prince causes mischief, he is banished from home, learns his lesson and regains his powers. That's it. There's a bit of a romance thrown in, but I couldn't feel any chemistry between the main characters.<br/><br/>The acting is not present - I mean, why even bother acting when the characters are just stereotypes and say the most cliché things you can imagine?

","This movie flew over my head, the first time I saw it. I thought it was just a fun kid's movie. Once I learned a little more about the Eddas, this movie replaced Iron Man as my favorite Marvel movie. I think the point is summed up in the dialogue between Agent Coulson and Foster, when Coulson says ""I'm sorry, Miss Foster, but we're the good guys,"" and Foster responds ""So are we!"" Yeah, they all are. Perhaps that's what made this movie difficult for me, initially, as I'm used to more black and white themes - absolute villains and protagonists.<br/><br/>Suddenly I'm faced with this movie where everyone has flaws and individual perspectives, and I must independently determine who is right or wrong, including who is deceitful or honest. Marvel, why so true to real life? Why all of the parallels? No, those didn't fly over my head, at least not the second time (too many to count). This movie is way past due.<br/><br/>Anyway, the villain has suffered a hard life, and the extent of his villainry depends entirely on the extent of my trust in him. I choose how I see him. The protagonist grew up a bit spoiled, having been favored with gifts by his father, and has only recently learned empathy after being rejected repeatedly by the people he trusted, those who he thought loved him. At this point, both brothers now have something in common. However, Odin is a kind-hearted man, who led an army to protect humans from Frost Giants, and then adopted a Frost Giant in hopes of soothing resulting tensions that arose between them.<br/><br/>Odin is a kind and wise king, unfortunately both traits his biological son lacks, making Thor unworthy of the throne. Instead, Odin must subject his son to a cruel punishment, in hopes of forcing him to grow up quickly, quick enough to inherit the crown from his father and rule the kingdom wisely, as Odin is growing old and weary. Naturally, none of this makes any sense to Loki, the more mature boy who isn't even aware he's adopted.<br/><br/>How can I fault Odin? Perhaps he should have given the hammer and crown to Loki. Then Loki could use both to betray the kingdom once he discovered his true roots. No, I can't fault Odin.<br/><br/>How can I fault Loki? Loki should sit back and accept unfair treatment without rebelling. Hmm, it seems I can't fault Loki.<br/><br/>How can I fault Thor? Thor should passively let the Frost Giants invade Asgard just as he becomes the new king. Gee, perhaps I can't even fault Thor.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the choices that present themselves are tougher than the people making them and, like real life, the people in this movie aren't always rewarded for making the right choices. They can make all of the right choices and still get the wrong results, especially if those results are more logical. All I can do is accept that they are all the good guys, and this is a very complex script."

","I have to admit, I only became interested in seeing Thor because of The Avengers. I remember sitting in the theater thinking ""that Thor guy is kind of hot."" Well, after the movie was over, I knew that I had to see Thor and learn more about the leading actor.<br/><br/>In Thor, the God of Thunder is set to inherit the throne from his father when the castle is attacked by the Frost Giants. In retaliation, Thor and his brother travel to their realm and a fight breaks out. Lives are lost on both sides. As punishment for his actions, Thor's father Odin strips the future king of his title and all honors bestowed on him. He then banishes Thor to Earth.<br/><br/>Thor is now mortal, wandering around Earth but still thinking he is a god. He befriends Jane Foster; a beautiful scientist who is immediately attracted to him. Thor gets into some trouble, but always makes sure to place Jane out of harm's way. When Thor's mischievous brother Loki assumes the throne and lies to Thor about their father's death, Thor sacrifices himself to keep Jane safe during a showdown. This heroic act brings his powers back and Thor returns to Asgard to battle his brother.<br/><br/>Chris Hemsworth stars in the title role. Did I say he was ""kind of"" hot? My mistake. He's incredibly hot. Not only did I enjoy the visual of him, I enjoyed his portrayal of Thor as well. Hemsworth shines as the God of Thunder. He plays him arrogant, self-obsessive and rudethen he changes. We see Thor become sweet and understand that simply killing an entire race just because you want to is wrong. This is brilliantly done as Hemsworth makes Thor likable. <br/><br/>Jane is portrayed by Oscar winner Natalie Portman. Jane is the reason why Thor cares for Earth; he believes there is good on the planet and swears to protect it. Portman shows much emotion as Jane, such as when she thinks Thor has died or when chasing satellites and other scientific things. While her emotions are there, Portman herself has little to do throughout the movie besides running around and drooling over Thor's body. <br/><br/>Tom Hiddleston is Loki, the God of Mischief. One thing that I liked about Hiddleston's portrayal is that he makes Loki sympathetic. I could tell that Loki really did care for his family and wanted his father's approval; he just went about it the wrong way. Hiddleston's descent into madness is brilliantly subtle. You see his change when he realizes he's adopted, then when he takes the throne, then drunk with power. You see even more of that descent into madness in The Avengers. And while he fights his brother, I believed that he would lay his weapon down if Thor would have treated him as his equal. Hiddleston was one of my favorites of this film.<br/><br/>Sir Anthony Hopkins plays the King of Asgard, Odin. This supporting part should have been bigger, but he spends half of it in ""Odin sleep."" However, if he hadn't been in this, Loki would have had no reason to assume the throne. Hopkins is great at trying to convince Loki that he loves him, even though Loki refuses to believe it. And I liked when Odin snapped Thor's ego back into place when he banishes him to Earth.<br/><br/>Darcy Lewis is played by Kat Dennings. While I have no problem with Dennings, I thought Darcy was completely pointless in the film. Her character was a bit annoying and did not move the plot at all. Had Darcy been eliminated, the story would have continued on. She was not a vital part.<br/><br/>The effects in this movie are alone enough of a reason to see it. Practically all of Asgard is computer generated and the Rainbow Bridge is phenomenal. I especially enjoyed the battle between Thor and Loki, seeing the different effects used with the scepter and the hammer and the effect to create multiple Lokis. Another great graphic is the castle itself; it made me believe that gods really lived there.<br/><br/>Thor is not a great movie; it will not win any Oscars. However, it was fun to watch and a great introduction to a character that gets screen time in The Avengers. I have heard that a sequel to Thor is in the works. I hope that the major characters return, but most especially Loki. He deserves another chance to shine."
"elshikh4","6","0","6","3 September 2012"," Sleepwriting !
","I know that you know sleepwalking. Now welcome to a new illness that you can learn about, rather live, through today's Hollywood blockbusters. Eagar to understand? Well, (Thor) gives you a good chance!<br/><br/>There are many fine elements in this movie. The Australian Chris Hemsworth is a powerful newcomer that Hollywood must feel lucky to have. He has the looks and the talent. I hope seeing him in more dramatic roles. Natalie Portman and Anthony Hopkins are always a delight, even if have nothing serious to do (or - as in here - have nothing at all!). The interiors of that spatial Asgard were cleverly designed; I loved the metal floors and walls, instead of Norse usual buildings. Some sequences were very well-made such as Thor's try to retrieve his hammer, Mjolnir, from the S.H.I.E.L.D. facility. The comic sense is there with truly lovable lines. The music moved me. And I was astonished when I knew that the closing credits sequence was based on images from the Hubble Space Telescope and took 18 months to create!<br/><br/>Director Kenneth Branagh, a William Shakespeare's old lover, conceptualized this movie as a Norse/comic-book twist on 2 Shakespeare's plays. Firstly (Henry V), which was about a young king who underwent trials, fighting a war, courting a girl from another land, trying to live up to the example set by his father the king. Secondly (King Lear), where one prince, due to being jealous of his brother, tricks his father for exiling that brother. These Shakespearean echoes distinguished the movie, representing a serious mark that many superhero movies lack.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, that script wasn't all perfect. While it had established logic and Shakespearean skies in the first half, it went dumb, or crazy, in the second half: Thor is an arrogant hot-headed and uproarious, then he's humble wise and calm? How that happened?! Loki invites the kingdom's enemy to kill his father, just to rescue the latter on the nick of time, so he may be close to his father. OK. The thing that isn't remotely OK is that why in God's name Loki goes to destroy the entire human race in no time after that?? Thor is sorry for destroying the bridge that was connecting his world with his love's world, while Loki was traveling from that world to this world, so easily, without needing that bridge! And I have to admit, as someone in IMDb referred before: Thor's 4 friends turned out to be nothing but idiots!<br/><br/>It needed 6 people to be written?? I know truly big epics that didn't need half of that number. And according to their work, it's clear that they were sober at first, then went sleepwriting all along! Actually most of the American blockbusters lately don't have good scriptwriting, or good scriptwriting that lasts till the end. The script, in general, became the hardest, the rarest, or - in best cases - the least taken care of element. So why is that? Do the movie makers think that putting nice looking stars, dazzling images, 3D, speedy pace, and roaring sound effects will make the viewers forget about the story? Is it a Hollywood writers' crisis, where good writing became scarce? Is it hastiness? Or is it frankly a new faith that ""writing"" isn't that important in the first place?!<br/><br/>Over and above, the CGI felt sometimes cheap. The look of Asgard's exteriors didn't impress me at all. The monstrous ""Destroyer"" wasn't scary, maybe funny. The Bifröst bridge came out as something that belongs to a 1970s Disco. And you read that the movie's budget was 150 million dollars? Where did it go?!! Speaking about funny, the Asgard crown was so laughable, especially in the serious parts. Branagh enjoyed the oblique cadres for more than enough. He repeated it with no dramatic intention whatsoever, most probably to seem cool or hip. I suppose he saw it a lot in contemporary music videos, thus decided to shoot many many moments with oblique camera to attract the young viewers. Though I know one thing; while being a young viewer myself, that caused me an oblique head for some time after the viewing!<br/><br/>(Thor) is a mix of fantasy, sci-fi, action, with a bit of comedy and romance. It has unusual atmosphere, potential drama, and good acting that you can't find in late superhero movies like Superman, Spider-man, or Iron Man. For the first half, it runs beautifully, hitting the mark, being entertaining to the max. However, in the second half, things weren't as solid. Again, and again, and again, the script is the treasure box, and the scriptwriter is the one who has the key of it, or has not. Compare the movie's 2 halves, rather the old Hollywood to the recent one, to know that sleepwriting became a new illness, or - in fact - a new vogue in today's Hollywood!"

","I suppose any review of *Thor* ought to begin with the reviewer's expectations—if you're expecting a solid comic book/mythology movie with a strong sense of the comics ethos, a solid leading man who thoroughly inhabits all aspects of his character (from bathos to boorishness), a rather one-dimensional villain, and lots of rock 'em-sock 'em action encased in a simple, mediocre plot—then you will probably be satisfied with *Thor.* If you're expecting anything else, you can pass on this one. The best parts of the movie are Chris Hemsworth as Thor and Tom Hiddleston as Loki, Thor's adopted brother and the villain of this film (he's also the villain in *The Avengers,* a film that displays Hiddleston's acting talents to much greater effect). Ironically, the worst parts of the film are the two Oscar winners who inexplicably find themselves in a comic book movie trying to ACT all over the place. I'm talking about Anthony Hopkins as Odin, Thor's father and the chief god, and Natalie Portman, who is allegedly a scientist/researcher but who turns into a mushy, goofy middle school girl whenever Thor flashes her a smile. Despite these two casting mistakes, the film is an enjoyable diversion, and it works well—as long as you're not expecting it to be something other than what it claims to be."

","I will not attempt to defend this movie as an art film; it does not provide insightful reflection upon the human condition. And it is completely preposterous in every way. However, it is fun from start to finish, true ""escapism."" The characters are thin as some critics have charged, but they serve their archetypal purposes. Thor is a foolish, cocky kid who ""grows up"" fast. Loki, like his namesake in Norse mythology, is evil and pitiful at the same time so in that sense not just ""evil incarnate"" like your average superhero villain. The scientist-Valley Girl lacks credibility as a character, but Natalie Portman lends the role some sincerity and gravitas. Speaking of gravitas, the gate-keeper played by the always splendid Idris Elba worked quite well in that role. Some have complained about the phoniness of the sets in the small town, and I admit at times I kept thinking ""this is a set,"" but it didn't get in the way - it came across more as an homage to cheesy 50s sci fi flicks in which the action always manages to take place in an obscure desert town. Some of the special effects were overdone and hard to follow (i..e who's pounding whom, and with what weapon?) and looked like CGI, but the whole fairy-tale aspect of it meant that if some of the landscapes looked more dream-like than real, that was okay too. The storyline is beside the point - Will Odin survive? will Thor prevail? Will Loki's lies be exposed? Do you even have to ask? You know from the beginning how it turns out but that does not spoil the fun along the way."

","Thor was overall a good movie with fantastic special effects and really good costume design. All the characters looked great. Thor looked like a strong confident hero while the humans just looked human. Thor's red cape and his shinny armor looked real the city of Asgod looked amazing. The special effects blew me away. The frost trolls looked terrifying and the presentation was almost perfect. Thor's friend's costumes looked great and the giant robot that blew things up was cool too. The movie focused more on the story and less on action scenes and blowing stuff up. That was my favorite part.<br/><br/>Thor is one of my favorite superheroes and I loved how the director showed his flaws. He is strong but foolish and the development of the character was done really well. He isn't perfect even though he is a hero. He struggles with being human and he feels guilt that his brother lays upon him. The character of Thor was portrayed really well. A strong hotheaded hero with little wisdom but grows as he goes along. He evolves into a stronger wiser hero by the end.<br/><br/>Thor's relationship with Jane was cute. A little predictable but still necessary but their story made sense and it wasn't exaggerated. I thought the kiss before the final battle was pushing it a little bit. The kiss on the hand and the parting line would have been perfect. Jane as a character was really good for the story. She is smart and she believes in Thor's story and that is important to push the story along. Her superior, the male, his character was also necessary. He obviously shows importance because of the little teaser at the end of the credits. I hated that the movie had to tell us that Thor would return in The Avengers. That was obvious and completely unnecessary. Her other friend, I don't even know her name was completely unnecessary. She played no importance and the movie could have survived without her. Her cheesy one-liners were just silly.<br/><br/>One big problem with the movie was the predictability of Loki. It was obvious that he would be the jealous brother, come up with a plan to banish Thor and take the throne for himself. That's been done many times and made the movie less enjoyable. He was the villain but then did a U-turn and became a hero when he saved his father. Then he turned again and became the villain again and fought Thor and wanted to destroy the race of frost trolls. Then he turns lets go and falls into darkness and looks like a hero and he shows up on Earth after the credits, at least it looked like him. His character is unknown and his motives are not clear. That bugged me and made me a little angry.<br/><br/>Loki as a character was confusing and his motives were not clear. All he had to do was say one thing about Jane and Thor attacked him. That was the wrong thing to say for Thor to attack. Thor met her just a short time prior and I feel something about his home or destiny would have been a better thing to tick him off. <br/><br/>The movie is called Thor but for 80% of the movie he wasn't Thor, he was a human. That was a problem, Thor could have easily still been Thor on Earth, had a few more action scenes, still focus on the relationship, and still be a great movie. I feel making Thor human made the movie have less potential. Overall I give Thor 7 out of 10 for its presentation, action, and story."

","Thor's a great example of a superhero movie - good acting, good action, and all around good fun. I very much enjoyed Thor, and it's my second-favourite ""Avengers prelude"" movie (the first being Iron Man).<br/><br/>Despite being a prelude, however, I think Thor stands on its own with the likes of Spider-Man and Batman Begins. The special effects in this movie are very good, and I really enjoyed seeing Asgard and the Frost Giant world, because they were beautifully created. I thought the lore behind Asgard was all very well done and I was really interested in it.<br/><br/>The action was well-directed, and it really made Thor seem as though he was a powerful warrior. Speaking of Thor, I thought Chris Hemsworth did a great job with his portrayal, as did the other actors and actresses. Tom Hiddleston, especially, stood out as Thor's brother, Loki.<br/><br/>I did have a few minor problems with Thor, which deterred me from giving it a 9/10, and it mainly had to do with the supporting characters. Kat Dennings's character, Darcy Lewis, (who, of course was funny), I felt was pretty much unneeded. It's not like I didn't like her, it just seemed like she was there because of comic relief. Basically, if she was left out of the movie, I don't think it would've been any worse (or better).<br/><br/>Also, I wanted to see more of Thor's friends - the Warrior's Three and Sif. I thought they were really interesting - overall, I wanted to see more of Asgard in general. However, Thor learning how Earth customs work made for some great humour.<br/><br/>So, I would definitely recommend Thor."

","The great and powerful Thor was one of the biggest grossing movies of 2011. The special effects in this film were really some of the best I've ever seen and the star of the film, Chris Hemsworth was amazing, but besides that, this film was extremely overrated. Thor is banished to Earth for disobeying his father, the King, and must live as a mortal. Surprisingly, it doesn't take him very long to adjust, and he falls in love with Natalie Portman during a fifteen minute car ride. Okay, so the plot was weak to begin with, but the special effects could have more than made up for that. What I really didn't like about this film was just how fast everything happened. Thor is going to be in the Avengers trilogy and there is a good possibility there may be a sequel to this film, so what was the point in rushing everything? The character of Thor is a majestic one. He is one of the most powerful superheroes that ever existed. This film should have been the epic classic that was talked about for years, but instead they rushed the story and hid behind some great special effects. It was visually impactful, entertaining, and had a great star, but a side from that, this film is nothing more than a common theme with a weak script."

","I really didn't have any expectations before seeing this movie. A lot of these comic based films are really just a blend of special affects and action. <br/><br/>However, this film was actually really good. The characters and their relationships are complex, including the bad guy, who is very inconsistent in his badness and even inspires pity.<br/><br/>The story is very well written and the acting excellent. This movie even carries a message about pride and being a good leader and a good person. Something that is lacking in many of the shallow action flicks for kids these days.<br/><br/>I also like how the romance in the film stayed innocent yet the love interest added to the plot at the same time, without becoming too overdone.<br/><br/>I liked this film so much that looked forward to seeing ""The Avengers"". Unfortunately ""The Avengers"" was very disappointing for me. For me, that movie was pretty much like watching someone playing a video game. Endless special effects + action, with very little acting or intelligent dialog. I wondered how the Avengers could be so different so I looked up both movies here in IMDb and realized that they had different directors.<br/><br/>The director of Thor, Kenneth Charles Branagh, is also the director of ""Rabbit Proof Fence"" and ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"". Both of those are movies I really like as well. So that makes sense."

I like how it stays true to it's comic book roots despite no Donald Blake, the performances are good and so is the direction from Kenneth Braghn who does a Shakespearian job of bringing a comic character and mythological figure to life. Co-starring Samuel L. Jackson, Rene Russo and Colm Forree, this is one of the best Marvel movies ever and a very enjoyable fantasy story that leads to the biggest Marvel event ever."

","The Marvel Cinematic Universe is one of the coolest and most ambitious ideas in cinema today. That being said, Favreau (Iron Man) and Whedon (The Avengers) can't carry the entire thing on their own. While Kenneth Branagh seemed like the perfect choice for Thor, the final product was less than spectacular. The beginning seems to rush through, and has some over-selling of some parts (like the shot of Mjolnir in the hallway, I mean really who leaves one of their most powerful weapons just lying around?), and Kat Dennings' character seems to be dead weight that's full of irritating writing. But once the story finds it's footing, it's a fun one to watch. Two different but connected plots, one following Thor on earth, learning to live in our culture and in a way, coming of age, another on Asgard, following Loki's revelation and betrayal, come crashing back together at the end of the film, and it's marvelous (excuse the pun) to see how both Thor and his brother have grown as characters. All in all, it's an enjoyable movie, especially to Marvel fans, and it's a great stepping stone on the way to the Avengers."

","From director Kenneth Branagh (Henry V, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Hamlet), I saw a trailer and some clips of this film, but I didn't realise until a little later that the story was based on Marvel comics, so that made me keen to see it. Basically in the outer space past world of Asgard, King Odin (Sir Anthony Hopkins) once waged a war against the Frost Giants of Jotunheim and their King Laufey (Colm Feore) who want to take over the nine realms, starting with Earth, and now his son Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is due to ascend to the throne. This ascending is interrupted when the frost giants attempt to steal the power source known as the Casket of Ancient Winters, and Thor with his arrogance takes his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), childhood friend Sif (Jaimie Alexander) and the Warriors Three: Volstagg (Ray Stevenson), Fandral (Joshua Dallas) and Hogun (Tadanobu Asano) to retrieve it. The battle that ensues causes the end of the truce between the two sides of the war, and Odin punishes Thor by taking his power and banishing him from the kingdom to be mortal on Earth, also sending his power source, the hammer Mjolnir, to be found by the worthy warrior. Landing in the deserts of Mexico he is found by astrophysicist Dr. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), assistant Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings), and mentor Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård), while the hammer is found by local people, and soon surrounded by officials from S.H.I.E.L.D., with Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) in charge. Thor tries to retrieve Mjolnir, but he is unable to lift it from the ground, and he is captured by the agents, but Selvig helps him escape, and seemingly unable to gain his power back he focuses on a romance with Jane. Back in Asgard, Loki has discovered that he is not the real son of Odin, he was abandoned by the snow giants and taken at the end of the original war, so for revenge he forces Odin into a coma, becomes the new king, and offers Laufey the chance to kill Odin and retrieve the Casket, but the Warriors Three and Sif know of this plan. So they convince gatekeeper Heimdall (Idris Elba) to travel to Earth and find Thor, while Loki sends a Destroyer to find and kill his adversary, and after a battle Thor sacrifices himself to save everyone, and this act earns him his hammer and power to return. With his powers restored he defeats the Destroyer, he says a sad goodbye to Jane and the others, he returns to Asgard to confront Loki, who has betrayed and killed Laufey, and he destroys the bridge that allows them to go to Earth, and Loki falls into the abyss below, and he gives up Odin making him king. Also starring Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton / Hawkeye, Rene Russo as Frigga, Idris Elba as Heimdall, Stan Lee as Stan the Man and Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury. Hemsworth proves himself a worthy leading actor as the strong willed and heroic warrior, Portman is sweet as the hero's love interest, Hiddleston does a good job as the nasty villain, and Hopkins in his time brings his usual great seriousness, and director Branagh actually proves a director with good pace and vision. The story is an easy one to follow, and it obviously builds up to Avengers Assemble, just like Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk did, the special effects are fantastic, and there are some great moments of action to catch your eye, an enjoyable fantasy adventure. Good!"

","It was a somewhat entertaining movie. Great CGI, you can really tell Marvel did their best with this one. First off is the characters. Thor is quite funny to watch when he's turned human, as he thinks he's invincible, and ...he's not. Loki was a bit weird. I wasn't sure what they were trying to do with his character. I've seen some down right wacky Loki's over the years, but this one was just bland and boring. It's like they were trying to make a good villain for the movie, but then changed their minds half way through, and making Loki a ""frost giant"" was just pointless. Honestly, there's really not much as far as villains go in this movie. Sure there's the frost giants, but they're just there. They want to conquer Asgard,but then there's the big ""Why?"" because someone like Thor can just go Rambo and kill their entire species. Moving on to Jane. She's your basic stereo-type female scientist, not much to say. She's completely average as far as characters go. Thor's merry men were no better. There's the samurai- looking guy, Xena the warrior princess, a guy that looks like a tall dwarf from the Lord of the Rings, and a blond guy. They're as pointless as the frost giants. Overall, the movie has beautiful CGI, and not much else. Also, I have to add, Thor is just too powerful to really work as an effective hero. Hercules, for example, was a human with god-like strength. Thor is a god, with god-like strength. It doesn't really work, since he doesn't have any krytonite or any weaknesses like that. The worst a villain can do is threaten or kill his loved ones. I'm eager to see how Marvel will try to balance Thor in The Avengers movie."

","For those of you that don't know, Thor is a member of the mega assemble that is The Avengers. Later this year The Avengers hits screens globally and will show several big named superheroes such as Iron Man, Captain America and The Incredible Hulk. Another one of these is Thor and that is the reason I believe this film was made, as an over long trailer for The Avengers movie. Thor's story just does not seem good enough to warrant an entire movie. The film is just hinting at the Avengers throughout and if you are not aware of The Avengers than you may struggle to really understand what is going on. To be fair nothing really happens so you may find it an easy follow.<br/><br/>It starts in a completely different realm. The realm that is Asgaard. A place lead by Odin (Hopkins) with two sons, Thor (Hemsworth) and Loki (Hiddleston). Throughout time Asgaard has been at war with the Frost Giants and when it is finally resolved Thor stupidly heads back to fight once again, taking his team of warriors and brother with him. This causes uproar with his Father who deems him unworthy of being the next King and of his power, so he casts him out and Thor ends up down on Earth.<br/><br/>He arrives on Earth as three scientist are out in the dessert looking for a scientific light. Instead what they do is hit a random man in the middle of a tornado with their van. This man is Thor. As well as Thor landing on Earth so does his power, the power of his hammer. Aided by Jane (Porter), one of the scientists, he heads to the location of the hammer, which is now surrounded by S.H.I.E.L.D agents (This is an Avengers nod). Thor breaks in but can't move the hammer, his power is no more. From there he must adapt to human life but a threat on Earth causes him to defend its honour. This comes about all too easily.<br/><br/>Back up on Asgaard, Odin falls ill and is on the verge of death meaning a devious Loki takes command and decides that to become King he needs to kill Thor. This means destroying parts of what Thor has now become to love, Earth.<br/><br/>The story is weak, I'll give you that. Don't see this if you expect twists and turns cause you won't get them. Instead you get a typical jealous family member, a typical love story and a lot of poor humour and cheesy lines. Such a step back from Iron Man which is fantastic, especially compared to this.<br/><br/>The film feels too short. It's nearly two hours but something about it just doesn't make it feel very long. Maybe it's because nothing ever really happens. The second act is very dull and a lot of unbelievable change seems to take place. The film is rushed and I was surprised when I saw it was nearly two hours long. <br/><br/>The opening war on Asgaard is far too long. If they cut it down they could have made room for considerable character development as I have to say there is none what so ever. Thor is arrogant, selfish and irresponsible but over night changes his entire outlook. So much so that he goes from fighting federal agents to drinking beer (do they do this in other realms) and then cooking breakfast the next morning with a tea towel over his shoulder. What the....? Natalie Portman's character must fall in love with every guy she meets. No development took place upon Thor and Jane's new found love but all of a sudden it just happened and this was supposed to be the catalyst into Thor's decision to defend Earth. It is so unbelievable, no development in their relationship what so ever. Also the other scientists might as well not be there as they do nothing for the plot, especially Kat Dennings who brings a few pointless lines. Loki is also not developed, he seems a wimp at the beginning but, again, overnight manages to become fearless. He already looks sleazy when we meet him, so it is obvious he will cause some sort of deception. Despite slating Loki, Hiddleston does play the part well and it isn't his fault the character just changes, he does manage to play both attitudes very well. Not a lot can be said with the rest of the acting however, which isn't great. Hemsworth is OK but Portman is poor. To go from Oscar Winner for Black Swan to this is a huge mistake. She may look good in a cheesy, slow motion shot of her running to aid her beloved Thor, but it does not mean it is a good casting choice.<br/><br/>In fact most of this film is poor and makes very little sense as to why they even bothered. Branagh is not the right choice of director for this kind of film but he does manage to produce some great effects. The effects in Asgaard are great but the story on Earth is much more intriguing. See this if you like Marvel or special effects. Avoid if you enjoy though provoking film.<br/><br/>2 / 5<br/><br/>More reviews at: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com"

","Thor was alright. If you want a mindless action movie with a comic hero believably coming to life, you will enjoy it.<br/><br/>It started off a bit ridiculous but I gave the movie leeway and suspended disbelief a little further, this is a comic after all - completely forget the Norse Mythology aspect. Once I did that, it had a certain charm. Then Thor is sent to Earth and it started to veer off the tracks and kept straying further and further. Thor's brash arrogance could've played out really adorably on Earth but that part was really short lived. Then Thor has a turn around in a matter of minutes - this transformation could've had its own laughs as we struggle to learn with him. Thor was always good but arrogant to completely noble in 60 seconds? Then the love angle, I am not sure what Thor would see in the Natalie Portman character or vice versa. There is little given here to make their 24 hour romance believable and trust me, I wasn't asking for a lot. Thor's friends show up on Earth for about a minute to then go back. The entire movie was just skimming along. There were also some unbelievable plot twists like the FBI just letting Thor go. Lastly, the cheese factor - again, extra disbelief suspended and so cheese and cliché go with the territory but about half way through, the cheese started spilling over and I couldn't take it any more.<br/><br/>It actually exceeded my expectations as I thought it would be truly dreadful but it wasn't. The plot just needed more flesh. The opening sequence is so long and drawn out that it really could've been trimmed down as it was only the set-up and then the plot could have gotten a little more loving."

","I had high expectations because the director was Kenneth Branagh, but what a let down. The script and dialog were pitiful, with little credible character development (apparently because the script was written by a ""committee""). With such a fantasy/mythology-based superhero, the movie should have been a lot more fun and memorable. Talented actors like Natalie Portman were totally, pitifully wasted. The initial 5 to 10 minutes, with flashbacks, were confusing: for example, not enough ground work was laid for the viewers to know why and how Jane Forster's team were able to be at that particular spot and time to expect the appearance of a ""worm hole"". The only good things about this movie is that it laid the foundation for inclusion of Thor in future Avengers movies, and that Chris Hemsworth is an engaging hunk."

","Thor has a genetic advantage over many other superheroes. He wasn't bitten by a 'carrier', exposed to radiation or bitten by a radioactive spider (whew they went the full combo on that one!), Thor is a God.<br/><br/>Not THE God, just A God. In this case the son of Odin and a resident of the distant citadel of Asgard, who it turns out saved Earth a millennia or so ago, slapped their hands together and said 'well our work is done', and buggered off into space to watch our progress from afar, taking all the miscellaneous Gods with them to build a floating city strongly reminiscent of the space sequences in Watchmen, only with a distinct hint of Flash Gordon thrown in for good measure.<br/><br/>We meet Thor and brother Loki as children, in a scene which seems to set up a lengthy (and usually tedious) 'sibling rivalry through the years' montage. Thankfully though any thought of a long drawn out yawn fest is immediately cut short as we cut straight to a ceremony with proud Dad Odin (Anthony Hopkins) bestowing the King's crown to the cocksure and arrogant Thor (Chris Hemsworth) with thousands of citizens bearing witness, including grown up (pasty) Loki. Only the coronation is cut short by an incursion by the sworn enemy of the Gods – the Frost Giants – who as the name suggests are basically tall, cold guys who unfortunately all look exactly alike.<br/><br/>Despite the rude interruption Odin decides not to seek retribution by following the Frost Giants to their icy abode but Thor and his *ahem* Fellowship of mighty warriors of disparate origin, weapons and abilities second guess their orders and rush in blindly, putting Asgard on the brink of war.<br/><br/>And with this one poor decision, Odin decides that he has no alternative but to cast his own Son from paradise down to Earth, which sort of suggests that Earth must be a sh*thole to them if you think about it.<br/><br/>On Earth Thor is merely a tall hugely muscled man with lustrous locks of blond hair, though still surly and aggressive. Now a mortal, gone are his superpowers and his mighty hammer, which was also cast to Earth separately.<br/><br/>Thor immediately runs into Team Science, Jane (Natalie Portman), Eric (Stellan Skarsgaard) and sarcastic comic relief Darcy (Kat Dennings), though it would be more accurate to say they run into him – twice. Team Science have been researching phenomena that well I don't really know it was never explicitly stated – but suffice to say they find a huge man who arrived in a massive surge of energy quite interesting, Jane particularly seems to like the cut of his job, what with all of the muscles and golden locks and such.<br/><br/>The remainder of the film has Thor fanging around being obviously out of place desperately trying to regain his 'super', starting with his hammer which the government has already tracked down and are guarding zealously, and Team Science (never really called that but they should've) providing a taxi service for his travels, a sounding board for his thoughts, and Jane an inspiration for his loins And all the while all is not running smoothly on Asgard.<br/><br/>The movie suffers with the need to switch back and forth between the Asgard-in-space setting and Earth, with neither realm getting to host any scenes of great significance, and it warrants mention that for 90% of this superhero movie Thor is mortal and therefore decidedly non-super. Jeremy Renner and Rene Russo have blink and you'll miss them roles, Renner's being particularly baffling unless he is to pop up again in The Avengers or is such a Thor fan that he was willing to take any role just to be in the film. The Fellowship members are all quite forgettable and essentially rendered wallflowers for much of the film, and Anthony Hopkins as Odin has little to do aside from remain dignified and paternal throughout, though he does get the chance to challenge Morgan Freeman for the 'guy with the most voiceovers' crown.<br/><br/>Despite its flaws Thor is shiny and well made; it skips any real violence and there is no sex and profanity, obviously catering to the PG crowd. While that often results in bigger box office from the 'just happy to be at the movies' teens it normally spells doom for any real entertainment value. But while Thor lacks the edge to elevate it above merely worthwhile this is one notable exception where PG can still mean Pretty Good.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 6 / 10. Without the violence of Blade 2 or the charisma of Iron Man/Tony Stark Thor was never really going to challenge for the All-Time comic book movie title, but even though for most of the movie neither Thor nor his film are super, you won't be thorry you thaw Thor. ."

I almost had forgotten this movie just two week earlier.<br/><br/>Otherwise almost all the stuff is great; the actors did pretty decent jobs for their role.

Then what the h..! is Thor's identity? Some's gonna say it's JUST BASED ON or INSPIRED thing but you know it's way beyond those kinds. Then what? Sort of Homage thing ? Yea possible, but Marvel and his company have hardly mentioned about the original on either official ads & reports or non-official comments. Instead, Marvel's kept saying he's got a bit INSPIRED ONLY and Thor is totally different from Mr India or something like that. Besides, more importantly, while shamelessly copying scenes-by-scenes from Mr India, Marvel intentionally missed the KEY-POINT of Mr India's story for his own audiences' taste, for COMMERCIAL PURPOSE in other words. Then how can we call it Homage anyway ? My conclusion is : Thor is not only a copy crap, it's rather A CRIME, LITERALLY.

Yes, Chris Hemsworth is hot. But he can also act, and I really felt sympathy for his character when he failed to retrieve the hammer at first (is that a spoiler to anyone still?) And the emotion about losing his father and family was believable. And I also enjoyed the portrayal of bratty 3 yr old type behavior as well... :-) So the transition when Thor finally learns his lesson was effective for me.

The main theme of the movie is supposed to be about Thor being stripped of his powers and being sent to Earth to learn humility by living as a human. Once he understands the human condition he then regains his powers through his hammer Mjolnir. Instead in this movie Thor somehow manages to learn humility overnight. The introduction of the Warriors Three, the Odinsleep and the Destroyer all meant that the storyline wasn't given justice and we were not able to truly savour the special effects.

","This is a film that moves at lightning speed, (PUN INTENDED) egged on by Ken Branagh's bold direction. Thor takes its energy from character development and conflict. The well paced action and conflict scenes are like nothing you've ever seen before and that's saying something in this day and age.<br/><br/>Thor has real emotional depth way beyond what you would expect. It also has action and special effects second to none. After a while and because of the turn in story, you don't really think about those amazing effects, and that's a good thing. Instead, you're pulled into a story about people and that's a great thing.<br/><br/>I like this comicbook anti-hero fallen god. He's gritty, primal, vain yet noble and somehow more real. The film does a great job of showing us how an arrogant son can come to grips with who and what he truly is. The movie draws the audience in with its confidence and it never lets you go. There's no doubt that Natalie Portman was an important piece of casting because she brings the story down to earth. Thor meets Portman's Jane Foster after he is banished from the home of the gods to live among mortals. The audience can relate to what Jane is experiencing and it grounds the film perfectly. That makes the action seem more real and that's a tough balancing act. There are plenty of scenes that you have to see to believe! This movie actually has a heart and a soul and a brain and I couldn't have asked for anything more.<br/><br/>I'd rather a movie be too cerebral then too dumb. This film succeeds on a basic level. It jumps the boundaries of its genre to pull in viewers with originality and inventiveness. Calling it a standard action film doesn't do it justice. It's surprisingly deep and takes the time to set itself up. A complete movie that really doesn't belong in the summer with the likes of the brainless films."

","I am not a comic book fan, let alone an aficionado, so I have nothing to compare this adaptation of The Mighty Thor with, beyond all the literature and legend I am aware of from which this movie derives its characters. Derive is the operative word here in this entirely predictable, rather dull script.<br/><br/>There are some excellent things about Kenneth Branagh's movie Thor. The artistic vision and f/x for the 'gods' planet Asgard are evocative and beautiful, reminding me, however, of the computer game Diablo, Lord of Destruction and other computer art I've seen. Nothing wrong with that, this is just a movie for mindless entertainment and the more visual distractions the better. Especially since the script is so utterly banal and dully acted, for the most part.<br/><br/>It's all very professional and Hollywood, aimed at 13 year old boys. The love interest, for the 13 year old girls, in the body of Natalie Portman's Jane, is pretty much of a flop as she and Thor, Chris Hemsworth, have absolutely not a single shred of erotic chemistry between them. But then I've never understood the popularity and admiration for Natalie Portman who strikes me as a singularly mediocre talent.<br/><br/>Hemsworth is good, however, as Thor. He looks terrific and he's an effective actor, but lacks that last ounce of cosmic charisma that I expected to see in this role. He is completely overshadowed by Tom Hiddleston as his brother Loki. Hiddleston is also better looking in a very sensuous way and his scenes were by far the most interesting and well-acted. The other outstanding actor here, or character I should say, is that of the Gate Keeper on Asgard, played by Idris Elba. The ubiquitous and seemingly ageless Anthony Hopkins is also good as Odin, but he has too little to do, spending most of the movie in a coma. Renée Russo is wasted as Frigga, Odin's wife. None of the other gods are very interesting which was disappointing as I loved Ray Stevenson in Rome. He does not translate well to the big screen, and his character is anonymous, leaving him little to develop, and he IS a good actor, within his limits.<br/><br/>The music is nondescript action stuff, nothing memorable. The technical aspects are all first rate, but the entire effort is hobbled by the comic-book caliber script. <br/><br/>So if you are a fan of the comics you'll probably feel right at home here, but if you are more interested in the Norse legends from which these characters are mined I recommend you buy a set of Richard Wagner's Ring cycle and start listening to those. THEY are truly epic and deeply moving experiences. Thor isn't a major part in that, appearing only in Das Rheingold as Donner, the god of thunder, but Wotan (Odin) is there and those four operas are some of the towering masterpieces in human creativity. The ultimate comic book adventure."

Thor is a character that is larger than life, but Branagh's attempts to squeeze in plot between big effects scenes leave the viewer unsatisfied. We get a good chemistry between Odin and Thor, but Thor's relationship with every other character in the movie is so trite or compressed that you simply don't care about them or the plot. You never buy into his close friendship with Volstagg and company, and his love affair with Jane Foster is cut so short that they should have been shaking hands at the end of the movie, not kissing and swearing to find each other again. Their chemistry is friendly at best, dull at worst. <br/><br/>Perhaps a bit ironically, this film suffers from some of the same issues as another film Portman starred in - Attack of the Clones. The dialog is stiff, and you can't get emotionally attached to any of the characters. You leave feeling like you got cheated, and feeling that a lot of potential was wasted.<br/><br/>If you love great VFX and epic fights, you're have a few treats, but don't expect to fill up on this one."

Like others, I don't know how they possibly roped Natalie Portman from her excellent role in Black Swan to this the awful role she had in Thor.<br/><br/>Character interactions were extremely flat and not developed. Thor's change in attitude is sudden, unexpected, and completely against all his character development up to that point in the film. Loki's change in attitude is confusing and not developed, with the 'twists' in the film being completely nonsensical, and his story has more loose ends than a bowl of spaghetti.<br/><br/>All the other characters are completely undeveloped, with Heimdal, Thor's friends, and the other 'Earthlings' having no remotely worthwhile lines. The interactions between Thor and SHIELD do not even remotely make sense, and fall apart upon the simplest of questions, again with enough plot holes and loose ends to make your head spin.<br/><br/>The costume designs were awful—the armor looked like cheap, overly-shiny plastic that is intended solely to sell merchandise to children. The sets in Asgard were CGI and not even very well done, as well as completely un-interactive (the characters spent like 80% of the film in Asgard sitting on the rainbow bridge or in Heimdal's rainbow building).<br/><br/>I did not find anything redeeming about this film except that I got to look at Natalie Portman, but then I had to cringe every time she has a line so bad that it could fit into Star Wars: Episode II (which was about half her lines). The 'romance' with Thor was ridiculous and completely lacking any spark or realistic dialogue, again just like Episode II.<br/><br/>The ice giants story that the film was supposedly revolving around seemed like a minor footnote, with a preachy ending that doesn't make any sense for either one of the characters' actions.

At the end of the incredible hulk, tony stark asks hulk if he wants to be apart of the avengers team and i haven't yet seen Captin America. but all in all I think this movie is really meant for children and Adults who don't see many movies."

","Let me start by first saying, I am not a comic book reader, nor am I entirely familiar with the character of Thor (inside the Marvel Universe that is) so this review will not be based on how closely it follows the comic book etc. it will be based, purely, on whether or not it was a good film.<br/><br/>Well, you can rest easy because not only is ""Thor"" a good film, it's probably one of Marvel's best (behind ""Spider-Man 2"" and ""Iron Man""). When I went into the theatre to watch the film, I was honestly expecting to hate it after having been disappointed by ""Iron Man 2"" (and if you read above you can see how much I loved the first ""Iron Man""), I thought to myself ""how can they possibly explain the different realms, the magic, the Gods and still make a fun and entertaining film?"" well Kenneth Branagh did it (I don't know how he did it, but he did it). This is, for me, the first Marvel Cinematic Universe film (""Iron Man"", ""The Incredible Hulk"", ""Iron Man 2"") where I have genuinely had any feeling towards the characters. In the scene where Thor is presumed dead (although I know he couldn't possibly be, right?) the way it was shot, the lighting, the music and a fantastic performance by Natalie Portman made my eyes a little wet. <br/><br/>I don't want to get into too much detail on the plot, characters etc. just know that the stand out performance for me was Tom Hiddleston as the jealous brother Loki. Hemsworth was also amazing, but Hiddleston definitely stole the show. Anthony Hopkins was great as always, Natalie Portman was surprisingly good and all the supporting characters (Sif, the Warriors Three) all helped to create what, in my opinion, is one of Marvel's best films. 9.5/10 - I can't really flaw the film (some of the humour was a little distracting at times, but it's not worth an entire star). <br/><br/>Please Note: This review was written before the viewing of ""Captain America: The First Avenger""."

","So, next up from the Marvel Comics pantheon is Thor, or the Mighty Thor as he was known to fans (or Goldilocks, as he was to Ben Grimm). Here, we have a tale of Norse gods filtered through a lens of superheroes. Thor is the arrogant son of Odin, ruler of Asgard, and the time has come for him to take the throne. At his side is his brother (half brother in mythology, bit more complicated here) Loki, the trickster god. Everything looks hunky-dory, until a commando team of frost giants enters Asgard to try to take back their power source (we get a Lord of the Rings-style history lesson into the Asgardians and the frost giants, as well as the relation to myth). Thor, defying his father (and with a bit of easy prodding by Loki) goes of looking for answers as to why the FG's have broken the truce; or, more precisely, to kick some ice. Thor and his buddies indulge in a bit of mayhem and are rescued when the frost hits the fan, and a lecture from pop. Dad is so mad he grounds Thor, literally, exiling him to our world (if our world had armored billionaires, green-skinned monsters, and we fought HYDRA in World War II). There, we indulge in some fish-out-of-water hijinks, a bit of puppy love, some violence, and we're off to the races.<br/><br/>Kenneth Brannagh proves to be the correct director for something as grandiose as Thor. Marvel's Thor, as shaped by Jack Kirby, was a world of hyperbole, a kind of Hell's Kitchen version of Wagner, with Stan Lee's pseudo-Shakesperean dialogue. Brannagh knows how to handle the real Bard and keeps things from getting too silly, drawing theatrical performances from the Asgardians, while keeping the mortals grounded. He treads a fine line but keeps it believable. These things are all about action and plot, but Brannagh keeps the focus on characters and relationships, so the film doesn't devolve into a video game, like films featured in the previews on my DVD.<br/><br/>The cast is good, with Chris Hemmsworth making for a fine Thor, but Tom Hiddleston (a colleague of Brannagh's, from the Wallander series) shines as the devious Loki, giving real emotions to the trickster, not making him a cackling cliché. The mortals serve their purpose, but Natalie Portman has about as much meat here as she does in the Star Wars films and seems a bit wasted. Kat Dennings adds some nice comic touches, while Stellan Skarsgard provides the Scandanavian angle, though he gets a couple of good scenes. The Warriors Three get a bit lost, since they don't really get a chance to build their characters, though they get some quick action against the Destroyer.<br/><br/>As is fitting for a Marvel character, the film cribbs from other sources, most notably, Superman II, with the Destroyer scenes (one can almost hear Terence Stamp calling the place Planet Houston), though Thor himself cribbed liberally from Superman and Captain Marvel, back in the Silver Age. There's plenty of nods to the Lord of the Rings, itself a byproduct of the Norse Eddas and a bit of Wagner. There is nothing earthshattering her, but its all handled in a pleasant and entertaining manner, which befits a film drawn from light entertainment.<br/><br/>I can quibble with many minor things, like the relative lack of Thor's trademark helmet (which here looks more like Mike Grell's Warlord than Kirby's Thor), or that the ""romance"" seems to evolve rather quickly (gods are busy beings); but, not enough to dislike the film. It isn't high art but ""low art"" has its place in the world (and often has greater impact, without all of the snobbery) and so does this. If you want to see how bad this could have been, just check out Dolph Lundgren in He-Man, which swiped wholesale from the works of Kirby.<br/><br/>Fans will be happy to see the characters, the easter eggs (Cosmic Cube and other objects, nods to Hulk and Iron Man, etc...), the cameos (Stan Lee and writer Joe Straczynski, but no Walt Simonson, alas...) and the general tone of things. Non-fans get some thrills and entertainment, without needing to read 40+ years worth of comics or a graduate course in mythology.<br/><br/>In the end, Thor is a fun film, with a mostly satisfying conclusion, despite the need to set up Captain America and the Avengers. There is a nice James Bond touch in the credits, which shows that Marvel is using the right template for light action movies, and a nice nod to some of the creators of Thor (including Walt and Weesie Simonson, who handled the character best, even taking into account the King). Those who want to find fault with the casting or story can't see the film for what it is. Marvel's Thor is not Norse mythology (despite the names and some of the trappings), nor is it the Ring of the Niebelung. It's a blond guy swinging a hammer around, while his brother plots against him. That's more than enough."

","I'm really trying to figure out why this movie is currently rated at 7.2. I mean...it's OK. Even as comic book movies go, this is just silly. I think what floors me the most is that Natalie Portman signed on to do this. Not that she's above making questionable movies, I typically see her as a more serious actress. And it's directed by Kenneth Branagh? Anyone who's seen a Shakespeare movie in the last 20 years has likely seen Branagh's work, so to see him stoop to this level is pretty disappointing.<br/><br/>While the movie is a bit of fun, I just can't see the point to the whole thing. Yes, I know they have to make it so they can put an Avengers movie together eventually. But the movie just essentially puts Thor on Earth with no powers and...well...that's it. He just sort of hangs out while the main story plays out in Asgard (in what appears to be a giant pipe organ). Worst of all, instead of the movie providing any type of satisfactory ending and giving you the setup for the aforementioned Avengers movie, it sets up a clear sequel. And that to me is just a waste of time since nothing happened here. I don't know...it's a bit of fun in some cases, but overall it's just over the top, silly, and kind of pointless."

","It's passable. I'll start with that. <br/><br/>You always, sort-of know what you're gonna get with a Marvel movie. Usually the formula works well enough that it can make a fortune look great. <br/><br/>I was initially surprised about how Thor seemed more unique, slightly different from the rest. It's a little refreshing. <br/><br/>Only a little, because you'll see things coming a mile away. One look into a character's face will tell you what role they play and which archetype they represent. Annoying, but this is a film based (tenuously) in mythology so perhaps it's only fitting that things play out as they do.<br/><br/>Some cool effects, for sure. I almost thought I was watching the inevitable Avengers movie at one point, where the heroes fly through the air, capes flowing. The Asgard effects were really cool too. <br/><br/>The SHIELD agent has gotten a good deal out of things, I think. Natalie Portman and Anthony Hopkins did a good enough job, but I found that every time they popped up, I was asking ""Hey, what are you doing here?"" <br/><br/>It was a fun watch. Nothing unexpected. The twists and the lines had been done before. There's a few meta-references, some po-mo humour. I digged the jokes about Robin Hood et al. but felt assured that they must have dropped a ""Gimli"" reference due to copyright. <br/><br/>Was it worth £10? Sure.

Thor became worthy of becoming the king of Asgard overnight. No character development whatsoever. Makes no sense at all.

"LloydBayer","Null","0","1","3 September 2011"," Wasted Potential
","Pop Quiz: What do Hugh Jackman, Sam Worthington and Chris Hemsworth have in common? Aside from their Australian origins, these are the front men currently preferred in mega Hollywood action movies. While Jackman and Worthington have gone on to vindicate their casting power, I still feel Hemsworth has a lot of work to do as an actor, not only in playing a leading role, but also convincing the audience that he is the right person for that role. As the titled character, I seriously doubt Hemsworth has justified his role. But I don't blame him entirely. There are various areas where this film had potential but fails to deliver.<br/><br/>From my perspective, I am still trying to figure out what all the hype is about, both pre and post release. Yes, box office returns indicate that this film is not a flop. Secondly, comparing to 2010's ""Clash of the Titans"" (Sam Worthington), this film appears to be on par in terms of box office performance. But then again, should one be fooled into watching a movie just because it seems to have done well in cinemas? For this reviewer, the main failure starts with the non-engaging plot. Having defeated the Frost Giants from conquering the Nine Realms, including Earth, King Odin (Anthony Hopkins) prepares to bestow the crown of Asgard to his eldest son, Thor. During his ascension to the throne, Asgard is attacked by Frost Giants in an attempt to retrieve the source of their power, the Casket of Ancient Winters. Although they easily overpower the Frost Giants, Thor, his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and their childhood warrior friends travel to the Frost Giant's lair to defeat their leader Laufey (Colm Feore). On returning to Asgard, Thor faces the wrath of his father and King for his arrogance and insubordination, and is exhaled to Earth. As a mortal on Earth, Thor is found by an astrophysics team led by Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård), Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her assistant Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings). Together, they arrive at a closely guarded facility where a shadow organization holds the source of Thor's power, his war hammer. Meanwhile, Asgard is under siege as Odin is pronounced dead even as Loki proclaims himself king after revealing a deep, dark secret.<br/><br/>For a comic book adaption, ""Thor"" fails to build and maintain the unique atmosphere found within the Marvel universe. On the other hand, the plot is also void of even a remote sensation of the epics found in Norse mythologies. This here is my main disappointment, as I cant seem to find enough homage to either Marvel or ancient mythologies Thor is based on. Instead, director Kenneth Branagh focuses a lot on action and CGI induced visual effects, suffocating scattered remnants of the film's original ideologies. Another disappointment is the plastic looking costumes that looks like something made for a Halloween party. Props also have a very amateur feel to it, strongly suggesting that miniatures were used. Most big budget films do use miniatures, but the trick is in not making it so obvious to the viewer. Coming from a person who has successfully adapted quite a few Shakespearean plays, Branagh has made a mess of what could have easily been an epic film.<br/><br/>So considering all the should, would and could haves, I can't blame Hemsworth for not trying. But at the end of it all, he is just not convincing as an ancient God. Worse, his exile to Earth fails to evoke awe amongst mortal humans and is the dullest part of the movie. Again, this probably has to do with the script, but his supposed love interest with Portman's character has absolutely no on-screen chemistry. Portman on the other hand is a waste of talent in this movie and along with Skarsgård, are both underused. It a shame really, considering Portman won the Oscar for Best Actress in 2010's ""Black Swan"".<br/><br/>Spilt milk and all, what's done is done. As Thor, Hemsworth has one chance at redemption and that will be when he teams up with a plethora of superheroes (and Hollywood A-listers) in the highly anticipated 2012 release of ""The Avengers"". Now THIS sounds more like it. Go marvel! Go Marvel!"

","When I was a kid, I was never into Thor type of comics (or any superhero, for that matter). I guess I was waiting for the movies (like Batman, Spiderman, Iron Man, Hulk and others, including this one). It is quite surprising how a teenage ""stimulus for imagination"" can be turned in such fun and entertaining movies for virtually every generation, subtly avoiding the dangers of banality. Thor is almost an excellent movie: non- pretentious, well directed (good job, Mr. Branagh) and carried out in every aspect. The casting is also not bad but it really doesn't matter here. Any combination of actors could do. When you put a good story in good hands (and have a lot of money and enthusiasts to support it), nothing can go wrong. And it didn't. This is what most of the movies should be about: entertainment. Every once in a while such a bulls-eye pops out. And is very well worth watching. Can't wait for the ""part II"".

Or Skarsgaard to partake in that mannerism that characterizes both, and alleviate the comic character when in-jokes happen concerning his Scandinavian character?

Wow the movie starts with the Bang, the director doesn't shy away from throwing Thor right into our faces. Though, Thor is not The most popular Comic Book Icon and Chris Hemsworth is a complete newcomer. The director Kenneth Branagh presented the Asgard world with so much conviction that it didn't look strange at all. Thor with his giant Hammer is something to watch.

Tom Hiddleston did a fantastic job in playing Loki. I was completely stunned by his honest emotional and devious portray. Natalie Portman is delightful; it feels good to see a girl in a movie. Who you really adore, that totally boosts up the screen. After winning an Oscar, Natalie Portman is on heights. And this role added an additional Blockbuster in to her lap. I hope she returns for Thor 2, because only then it will be more convincing to see Thor coming back for Jane. Though apparently, Thor will return to earth in ""The Avengers"" with all other Marvel Heroes. So, it'll be interesting to see how it all set up together. Kat Denning did make me laugh with her on liners. Besides them Jaimie Alexander did stood out as she looked Stunning as Sif. Anthony Hopkins, Stellan Skarsgård, Jean Russo, Idris Alba, Clark Gregg and Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye are really good. With all perfect casting, performances, CGI, the only thing lacking in the end was Big Earthly Action Sequence. The town looked too small and fake to be real. There were barley few people when they though Loki send a Robotic thing to destroy them, it was little unconvincing. So, overall, Thor almost Lives up to expectation and I can't wait to see Thor 2 and Thor in ""The Avengers"" movie."

The realm of Asgard is created in astonishing detail, with art, grandeur and power. The architecture is an amazing combination of detail and perspective, where all the elements combine into a stunning ensemble. The interiors are equally out of this world, they are big, large, massive yet cozy and familiar. They have a certain roundness that makes them... comfortable.<br/><br/>The costumes, armor, weapons and makeup are fantastic. They are beautifully built, with much care and attention. They look and they feel right (except for the shoes, maybe. I can't see anyone fighting in those heels).<br/><br/>The acting is very good. Chris Hemsworth is very convincing, Anthony Hopkins is absolutely brilliant, and Tom Hiddleston has the intensity and the passion required. The rest of the cast is very good, although their roles are more or less decorative.<br/><br/>The script is good, and it has good rhythm and pace. On the down side, however, there are some parts that could have been done better. For example, there is (almost) nothing that really shows how good ""Lady Sif and the Warriors Three"" are, and we kinda have to take their word for it. Also the part of the movie that takes place on Earth is not really that exciting. There is one scene that I really enjoyed, though: the redneck hammer pulling contest. It was hilarious.<br/><br/>The directing is good, and Kenneth Branagh tells the story well. The camera moves, the editing is good and the lighting and the colors are fantastic. There could have been a little more detail added into it here and there, to really complete the experience, but it was very good as it was. One drawback was that they really skimped on the fight scenes, having them take place under the cover of darkness. Not much to see there.<br/><br/>Thor.

","I am not overly a fan of superhero movies, but ""Thor"" wasn't too bad actually.<br/><br/>Certainly, the storyline was suffering a bit from being made from a weak broth, because there could have been so much more added to the movie to give it depth and a fuller meaning. It is like the movie just superficially delves into the the different aspects of the story that it is setting out to tell. So it is a bit of a tame, shallow experience.<br/><br/>But what the movie lacks in meaningful storytelling it more than makes up for with CGI and effects. Wow! Especially Asgard, now that place looked amazing. There were so many awesome effects and details here, it was pure eye-candy.<br/><br/>One thing did puzzle me, though. Taking hold in the Norse mythology, why is there a Japanese guy running around amongst these immortals? That just didn't make any sense at all.<br/><br/>The cast in the movie was quite good. Chris Hemsworth (playing Thor) did a good job, and I believe this is the first time I have seen him in a movie. Anthony Hopkins (playing Odin), delivered a good performance, as usual, though he wasn't much on the screen. Now, the two guys that impressed me the most in ""Thor"" was Stellan Skarsgård (playing Erik Selvig) and Idris Elba (playing Heimdall).<br/><br/>The costumes and outfits in the movie were off the chart. I loved the Asgardian outfits and suits of armor. They looks awesome and had lots of detail to them.<br/><br/>So all in all, ""Thor"" does provide a good evenings worth of entertainment, because there is action from start till end.

","When I first heard of this film, I was honestly surprised to hear its director was Kenneth Branagh; somehow, the name just didn't fit with the genre. However, I must admit: as far as making a blockbuster goes, Branagh didn't disappoint.<br/><br/>Like every movie, 'Thor' has its pluses and minuses. Being a big fan of special effects, an element which (to me) greatly contributes to the joys of watching a blockbuster, I was genuinely impressed with this movie. Somehow, the visuals were both believable and completely preternatural at the same time. So, if you're a CGI freak like me, you'll definitely enjoy this eye-candy. I particularly enjoyed the portrayal of Asgard. As for the action sequences, they were very entertaining and there were also a few priceless comical moments.<br/><br/>Then there were the things I didn't like. For one, I feel that too much time was spent on building the back story while the climax and ending were somewhat rushed and entirely predictable. Then, there's Natalie Portman's character. Now, I've never read the Thor comic, so my judgment here may be harsh. However, I had fallen in love with Natalie on the silver screen with her performance in ""V for Vendetta"". While Vendetta's Evey was a highly realistic and relatable character, her portrayal of Jane in 'Thor' was, to me, disappointing. Maybe it's the way her character was written, but I found Jane so stereotypical and boring that I actually kept forgetting that her character even existed and when she did show up, I impatiently wished for the scene to just end already. In extenso, I can't say anything more positive about the relationship between Thor and Jane - to me it seemed forced; just another rather lame attempt to chuck in a bit of romance in a movie which in my opinion didn't really need it. Again I stress: I've never read the comics and their relationship may actually be an integral part of the plot... But I just don't see it and frankly, it had me rolling my eyes in annoyance.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast and their performance were generally more favorable. Anthony Hopkins did a great job as always and was entirely believable in the role of Odin, the God King. Chris Hemsworth also did a nice job in portraying Thor - I could actually feel the character grow and mature as the movie progressed. So, kudos from me! All in all, if you're looking for a bit of fun, a blockbuster with great effects and, in general, a really good acting cast, you will not be disappointed with 'Thor'. But, don't expect an enticing and consuming story, because this movie won't deliver in that aspect - still, that's fine, because 'Thor' never advertised itself as such a film. I give it a 6 out of 10 and if you are looking for some good entertainment, then 'Thor' will certainly give you a couple of hours of pure visual fun."

","I never read the comics, but Thor is a great character in the old Norse folklore and seeing him as an alien in this film was just as entertaining as the old Scandinavians must have found him entertaining in the good old days when they still spat on Christianity. It is great to see also all the other elements of the Norse myth being revamped and kinda scientific explained to make sense of all this ancient magic. The plot of the film never bored me for one minute and it had all the stuff it needed. To bad he didn't speak Icelandic or some other Norse language, but if the movie is made in America it just has to be in America then.<br/><br/>All in all a good movie and I am looking forward seeing Thor plus entourage in The Avengers. 8/10"

","Thor, the name says it all. He has always been one of my favorite comic characters. Even putting comics aside he is one bad ass Norse god. The actor playing him was well chosen but that's about where it stops for the goods.<br/><br/>The story to this was as expected, granted you know the whole Marvel Thor mythos. But the Loki character and all other aspects of this film fails to deliver any real thunder. Being one of the most powerful comic characters ever you would imagine some epic fights and abilities but no. All in all I was really disappointed, I was hoping for so much more but got something so lame I simply can't look at Thor the same again. Again, so much action was lacking and Thor should be a movie of action. I hate to say it but maybe Micheal Bay should have headed this one? It felt more then obvious that this was a tossed together film to get us ready for the Avengers movie. Which is also making me wonder if Avengers will be able to wade through all the crap thrown together to give us some Marvel gold finally."

","A god, Thor is exiled from Asgard to Earth. However, he must find a way of returning to stop his brother Loki becoming the new king of Asgard.<br/><br/>Chris Hemsworth as Thor is very good portraying his arrogance and later insecurity perfectly. Tom Hiddleston is notable as Loki and plays it less maniacal with range. Hopkins picks up his pay cheque but in his defence there's not much he can do with Odin's dialogue and costume. Both Stellan Skarsgård and Natalie Portman are sadly wasted but actors playing the Warriors Three; Volstagg, Fandral and Hogun are endearingly fun.<br/><br/>Despite being directed by successful thespian Kenneth Branagh Thor at times feels like souped up CGI Supergirl (1984) and Superman 2 (1980). It's not as much fun as Iron Man but despite some alterations captures the Thor comic book spirit arguably more successfully than the last 3 Spiderman movies.<br/><br/>Naturally Thor is effects driven and the story has a little more depth than most recent comic book adaptations but the earth bound periods are rather uninspiring while the enjoyment comes from the action on Asgard.<br/><br/>It's good entertainment especially if you are a fan of Thor, but all the special effects add up to something very forgettable and feels like a vehicle simply for The Avengers film.<br/><br/>Overall, it ultimately depends on what your idea of what a comic-book superhero movie should be."
"touristonlinereporter","4","0","2","23 July 2011"," Thor, a Victory in Box Office, a Failure for a Director
","The most important motive of an epic story is the conflict between protagonists or heroes. Particularly when the story is related to the ancient gods, we are sure that there should be a big conflict between the two sides of challenge; good and evil. As Thor begins, Frost Giants attack earth and transform men to frozen statues, but men are not alone. Odin a major god and the ruler of Asgard comes to earth and defeats Frost Giants. By here, we are watching a movie that its main conflict is between gods and Frost Giants. Of course due to taking the main source of Frost Giants by Odin, one side of conflict seems too weak and the story should find another motivation. Thor and Loki are two sons of Odin. Thor is strong and brave, but Loki is slim and smart. As the movie goes on, we get sure that the conflict will move to brothers' competition for kingdom and very soon it shows us that Thor is the hero and Loki, the villain. The problem is the inequality of their capabilities. Thor is a strong handsome mythic warrior and Loki looks like a gay guy of modern era. So we can't believe their competition for the kingdom. Then Odin exiles Thor to earth and divests all his powers to be a simple man. Odin goes into some kind of coma and Loki gets the kingdom. But the brothers are not still equal in our minds and they are in two different world. We hope to see a conflict like the one between Commodus and Maximus in Gladiator (Ridley Scott); where the two challengers look equal by their positions, powers and limitations. Troy (Wolfgang Petersen) is another movie we can compare it to Thor. In Troy, a supernatural hero like Achilles has a human character. He can love, he can hate and so when he sacrifices himself for his loved one, we believe and feel it. But when Thor is on earth, we see just a handsome wrestler who has no idea of what he is going to do. He tells nothing to us about his feelings and we feel no sympathy for him. He has a constant character and even his sacrifice is due to his nature as a god who should help human kinds. What happens on the earth is more disappointing. Thor is neither an alien from another planet, nor a confused lost man. He adapts the new circumstances very fast and before we know these men and women around him, he falls in love with one of them. That is not a sweet love as we saw in ""Meet Joe Black"", when Brad Pitt played as death and made love with Claire Forlani. In the same way, when Thor sacrifices himself to save his human friends, it doesn't hurt us. Even Natalie Portman can't save this scene of the movie, when a ridiculous iron giant nearly kills Thor. I think all of these failures refer to the story and screenplay, where there is no characterization for heroes, villains and men. The movie spends a lot of time for action scenes, so it doesn't have enough time to pay to the characters. Thor is a god that his behaviors are predictable, as Odin. Jane, her father and friend are just some shadows around Thor. We know nothing about them, even about their researches. Worse than all, are the governmental guys who have just cars and cloths of secret agents, but their actions are just like cops in animations. Anyway, the Norse Gods, Frost Giants and the story are just some elements for making an action movie. But the strangest thing in the movie is the name of Kenneth Branagh as the director; a veteran Shakespearian who has been nominated in Oscar for his magnificent works in Henry V (1989) and Hamlet (1996). Thor could be made by a director like Zack Snyder who doesn't know anything about the myth and history, not by Branagh who is famous to be loyal to plays or creative in adaptations of them to movies. Thor may be a victory in box office, but surely it is a failure for the director."

","through and through this was a movie for every one. there where some mildly scary scenes for some children but all around it was safe for the comic book loving kids. Thor played well for the long fans of the comic such as me. I will come out and say it now i'm a girl and the one thing that didn't sit well for me tho hence the 8 out of 10 instead of a strait 10 out of 10. is that in the middle of the film it felt like a chick flick between Thor and Jane. they are meant to fall in love i understand that but it became a main focus instead of the betrayal of Loki to his Brother. <br/><br/>Loki's story takes a back seat to Jane and Thor. and Loki is very much apart of what makes Thor in to what he is. He has to over come the fact that his beloved brother dose this. these two before this were like two peas in a pod and the betrayal Hit Thor hard. Loki is the key to Thor turning into the Hero he is.<br/><br/>The Fact that it takes a back seat to Jane and Thor. we lose the reason that Loki is pushed to what he is. He Finds out that he isn't in fact born of the gods but of the Ice Giants Leading to what he does in so many ways. and losing that i feel hurt the film some.<br/><br/>The Actors however did fantastic. Chris Hemsworth i was worried seeing is past work that he could be the arrogant Thor and the Humble one. but he was able to pull it off quite well. And, then his Leading Lady Nately Portman. she was a strong woman to hold her self up with him and all of his arrogant. She was able to be the woman that turn him in to what he needs to be to be a worthy hero. the there is Kat Denning as much as i love this girl i could have lived with out her in the film. she is mainly comic relief. Her main lines deal with the fact that her first encounter with Thor had to do with a Taser. we also have Stallen Skarsgard he was superb as then mentor of Jane and father figure. he also held well with the cast as some one who belonged. and help familiarize others with the mythology behind the comic.<br/><br/>I was blown away by Tom Heddleston I had only seen his work in a Jane Austen biopic that was by far no where near what Loki was meant to be. And at the Very core of what Loki is He still very much loves his brother but the fact that so much was kept from him. and he knew he could never truly reach the throne pushed him to what he becomes. and through out the film we could still see that he loved his brother to the end no matter what he did to him. and Tom was able to hold both sides strongly. <br/><br/>and for fans of the avengers like all of the ones leading up to the Avengers there are some wonderful treats. like the appearance of Hawkeye one of my personal favorite avengers. and mentions of the other team members such as stark. <br/><br/>all and all i give this Adaptation of Thor a Thumps up and then some"

However as of late there have been some great Marvel Films and Thor is one of them.<br/><br/>Thor is to be the ruler of Asgard but has himself banished to Earth without his powers due to him going behind his fathers back and starting a war. His mighty Hammer is also sent to Earth and only he can ever possess the ability to use it again some day, but first must prove himself to his father Oden. Thors brother Loki plots to rule Asgard himself after learning secrets about his past.<br/><br/>A major reason for this film being so good is the acting. The cast is phenomenal. Chris Hemsworth plays a very good Thor, I really bought his performance as the God of Thunder. Natalie Portman is great as always and Anthony Hopkins is always legendary, one of the best actors ever in my opinion.<br/><br/>The story was also good. It starts with a flashback explanation on how Thor got to where he was. Very well done. Also there was a lot of funny parts that I found entertaining. NOthing too lame or anything so that was good.<br/><br/>I also really liked the Villain, Loki. He was also well portrayed for his screen adaptation. And Destroyer was also really cool, even if the effects for his laser were really loud.<br/><br/>Action was pretty good, Thor could have battled more when he was actually in control of his god like powers. However I am sure he will get to do more in his next films.<br/><br/>This was very good film. I recommend it."

","The only reason this movie got 4 out of 10 from me is because the first 30mins. were brilliant. The CGI effects and fight scenes were a promising build up to an awesome movie with a great story. Sadley as the movie progressed the storyline became worse. The fight scenes became fewer. And to be honest that is one of the only reasons you would go see such a movie or any kind of superhero movie. To see stuff get blown up and to see bad guys get punched. However there were comical parts in the movie. The constant reference in movies to Facebook etc. is getting rather old.

"onepotato2","7","0","3","2 July 2011"," Hercules ...meets Dune ...via Albert Speer
","I liked this. It's fantasy mixed with mythology mixed with a superhero; which turns out to be better than anyone should expect. The most interesting aspects are drawn from the fact that this superhero has a full family, and they're pretty much gods. The scenes with the banished, cheerful, humanized Thor are very charming; and serve to reacquaint viewers with nobility in the male gender (pretty much absent in 2011), much like in the awful Kate and Leopold. I didn't care that it lacked great action setpieces per se, but the climax is a bit too underscaled. Still, I was very moved at least twice; when the King realizes that he must regrettably teach his beloved but ignorant son a whopper of a lesson; and when Thor failed at retrieving his hammer (of all things). Heimdall, the bridge guard, reminds a viewer that old school qualities suffice beautifully in producing a figure of admiration. He's unflinching in his devotion, he's 'steady'. The plot is slightly familiar (The central idea of The Sword in the Stone is lifted shamelessly), but the acting is good, and it's better with language than most movies; which I suspect can be credited to Kenneth Branagh. Kat Dennings as Natalie Portman's assistant earns some laughs with her dry line readings.<br/><br/>Thor's home realm (Asgard) looks like the Emerald City as designed by Santiago Calatrava, Albert Speer and Hans Poelig. Not since Bespin (city of pepper mills) has a design aesthetic looked so thoroughly scale-less, unconvincing and cheeseball. The denizens wear things they seem to have bought at Cher's garage sale (although Thor's outfit is pretty great). And the town in New Mexico has 'We GOTTA slash the budget somewhere!!' written all over it. About half an hour of the movie is average or worse, but that not a bad ratio compared to movies that are terrible from start to finish these days (refer to Green Lantern)."

","This is a pretty good superhero movie, but I just didn't think it was amazing like a lot of critics were claiming. Just from watching the trailer I knew what I am going to get out of this movie, which really wasn't a super high expectation. And I got basically the exact amount of it, the direction of the movie is alright and has a bit of the comic book feel to it. And although when I first heard the announcement for this movie I thought it was going to suck. Mainly because I didn't expect a movie about a marvel hero that didn't really stand out all that much and didn't have enough in his character to make a movie out of and actually be good. But overall it did a pretty good job and the movie was entertaining with some good CGI fight sequences. The comic relief part seemed slightly forced but that isn't really anything to complain about and for the most part it works. The chemistry in this movie seemed to work but there wasn't enough development in the characters. The plot isn't anything special either nor did it really grab my attention or had anything really gripping or even exciting. This is far from being a bad superhero movie and has some good aspects to it, even if it has it's flaws it had some entertaining parts.<br/><br/>7.3/10"

","I saw ""Thor"" on Monday, May 16, 2011 and I was generally pleased. Consequently, I should forget filing a future Mensa membership application. So be it. The movie probably lacks that precious moralistic profundity the Academy Award Committee purports to seek in its cinematic viewings. Nevertheless, I found it intelligent, competent, engrossing, AND respectful of its source material - namely Stan Lee's interpretation of Norse Mythology.<br/><br/>""Thor"" is not a mindless fantasy romp. It addresses various themes such as simmering sibling rivalry, filial fealty, overweening presumption and haughtiness that comes with power, resentment, self-sacrifice, and the wisdom of self-restraint. The overbearing, overreaching warrior Thor is thrust upon the road to humble self-redemption, and what better place to do so than upon an unassuming New Mexico hamlet on Midgard. Perhaps a tad too quickly (but that's all right), he learns of a warrior's, a god's, a being's true worth - forgiveness (of Loki's tortured treachery) and self-sacrifice (to protect Jane, her friends, and the New Mexico town) from the Destroyer juggernaut. In short, I found ""Thor"" ultimately uplifting.<br/><br/>Flaws do exist. Occasionally the luscious, staggering Asgardian and cosmic backgrounds seemed like scale-model work. Thor becomes acclimated to Midgard customs a bit too easily; more ""Man from Mars"" encounters would have rectified this. Some of the S.H.I.E.L.D. security personnels' behavior was implausibly lenient. Nevertheless, ""Thor"" serves as a more than adequate introduction to the God of Thunder and Lightning, the devious but surprisingly conflicted God of Mischief and Evil Loki, the imperious but circumspect Asgardian lord Odin, the Asgardian plane (NOT planet) and the richness of Norse mythology. It takes itself seriously enough, but not too seriously, because it's a rollicking, energetic adventure, too.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the very last end credit whetted my appetite for ""The Avengers"" movie. Overall, ""Thor"" is a quite satisfactory accomplishment."

Michael Straczynski, you might expect something a lot better, especially since Natalie Portman and Anthony Hopkins star in it.<br/><br/>However, if you know nothing about the Thor comic books and you think that some guy with a hammer will fight crime while spouting viking bull crap, then you will enjoy the movie, because it is nothing of the sort.<br/><br/>The design of the Viking and Frost Giant worlds was nice, the acting was decent and Chris Hemsworth steals all the ""aaaahs"" of the female viewers. And I personally enjoyed the movie. However, I can't help but hate the clichés that jut their ugly heads, to the detriment of everything. I really rooted for Loki after all the idiocy exhibited by the people of Valhalla, so they had to make him look like an emotional idiot at the end. Why can't we love and understand both sides? Is it too complicated for the viewers?<br/><br/>Bottom line: Check in your brain and you will enjoy it. The 3D aspects of the movie are irrelevant. It is just a normal 2D film with a bit of perspective added to it. The roles are that of Thor and Loki, with a bunch of supporting actors that have nothing to do."

","I was surprised by how good Thor actually is! As this is (to my knowledge) the 1st time Thor has made an appearance on the big screen I knew little about him. He starts the film as an arrogant narrow minded meat head basically with more muscle then sense. He thinks he is unstoppable and can do what ever he wants without consequence. But as the film progresses he matures and becomes the man he needs to be in order to take his fathers place. So we have a coming of age film in a way as well as a super hero movie where he must defend against the big bad guy. So in many ways this is marvels most mature film to date. Add in some stunning scenery and fantastic acting and you have a great film! One thing letting it down is the fact that the bad guys are not really that threatening. All in all a must see!"

","Marvel has rummaged in it's cupboard full of superheroes and dusted off another lesser known character, ""Thor"" the Norse superbeing with colossal powers party attributed to his trusty Hammer ""Mjollnir"".<br/><br/>The film opens with a neat car versus person interface, followed by some witty one-liners from Rick (Skellan Skaarsgard), Darcy (Kat Dennings) and Jane (Natalie Portman). The three offbeat scientists, discovering Thor (Chris Hemsworth) by accident, following a tornado like weather event. The story then backtracks to find out where the stranger arrived from, surely he cannot just fall out of the sky? <br/><br/>An extended period of exposition details the other world struggle between two fantastical realms lead by King Odin (Anthony Hopkins) in Asgardand the Bi Frost people lead by the very cold, in every sense, King Laufey (Colm Feore). Despite being groomed to be King, Thor is reckless, arrogant and keen to fight at any and every opportunity. Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has always played second fiddle to his brother and without a cool hammer to his name, stays firmly in the background.<br/><br/>Events transpire that cause the wise King to excommunicate his chosen son to earth, stripped of his powers and only able to use the hammer, sent with him, if he becomes worthy.<br/><br/>Returning the story to Earth, the scientists find the newly arrived impostor entertaining but weird, speaking in a strange ""old English"" accent and smashing cups on the floor when another drink is required, all standard Norse superbeing type behaviour. These classic fish out of water scenes, are the strongest part of the film. Portman is new to the comic book universe but does well with the limited screen time available. Hemsworth is surprisingly good, buff, entertaining and more than willing to make fun of himself, essential attributes in any comic book film adaptation.<br/><br/>Of course on earth S.H.I.E.L.D gets involved, any opportunity for men in black suits, sunglasses and black vans is never missed. Marvel, as most readers will know, are attempting to tie all the characters together for the upcoming Marvel ""Avengers"" movie, to maximize the synergy (i.e. Comic book geek fanbase) that exists between all the characters.<br/><br/>Cutting between the real world and Asgar, it is clear that Loki with only a rather boring staff to his name, will make mischief whilst his brother is away. Anthony Hopkins as Odin, is the Anthony Hopkins we know and mostly love to watch, although his wife ""Frigg"" (Rene Russo) all but ending up on the cutting room floor.<br/><br/>There are many sweeping CGI shots of gleaming cities, large scale battles with the Bi Frost people, think deep freezers in human form. Monstrous beasts awakened and slain in short order, whilst trusty watchman Heimdall (Idris Elba) guards the bridge to other dimensions. Unfortunately, Lord of The Rings has done many of these sequences better and with more gravitas. Thor's comrades at arms are essentially the Fellowship in barely disguised form and on occasion, the huge sites, throne rooms, outfits with elaborate shoulder pads and capes, are difficult to accept with a straight face.<br/><br/>The stand out sequence in the small town between the ""Destroyer"" and the merry band is entertaining, as the medieval knight like automaton, dispatches obstacles in it's path with a rather nifty heat lamp hidden behind it's mask.<br/><br/>The film, bizarrely although competently directed by Kenneth Branagh is wise enough to laugh at itself and puncture the pompous nature of this mythical tale at every opportunity. More focus on the actors and their interaction, with less cityscape CGI would make for a better film but this is certainly not as bad as you might have feared.<br/><br/>Clearly the producers are looking ahead with an ending begging for a continuation. Box office suggests that audiences have room for yet another superhero. Why such stories should be so popular in these straitened times may not be so hard to ascertain.<br/><br/>Summary <br/><br/>Yet another comic book character to get to know, whilst fun and self knowing enough, the extended CGI sequences on occasion ruin the good work on offer when the characters are earthbound.<br/><br/>Lightly recommended <br/><br/>http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.com/"

So this movie is worth watching it with your girl friend as well.<br/><br/>I very much like Kenneth Branagh's kind of staging. It's so outstandingly personal even when scenes become crowded. You immediately identify with all the characters.<br/><br/>Great acting performed by all actors in the movie. I particularly liked Idris Elba who played Heimdall in the movie.<br/><br/>Not to mention the good work of other arts like camera, light, cut.<br/><br/>The story was very exciting. However, it sometimes wasn't conclusive: It's very hard to believe that an unarmed man can easily walk into a place guarded and monitored by a number or armed forces men. And it's also hard to believe that just an agent has this much power of decision.<br/><br/>Moreover, there were a few other things I didn't like:<br/><br/>* The musical score was low of emotion and ambition. In my view it wasn't able to properly augment many scenes appropriately, fighting scenes in particular. From the assignment of instruments used and from composing complexity it becomes apparent that the composer very much lacks classic composing education. The result is far below the result a composer like John Williams would have achieved.<br/><br/>* CGI characters were rather clumsy. Mass scenes at Asgard looked like they had been shot with loads of mannequins. Ice people, too, were rather lifeless. Not to mention the Destroyer, whose movements were not too ""metally"".<br/><br/>* In the German version the term ""destroyer"" had not been translated. That very much pulled me out of it. Correctly translating it to ""Zerstörer"" would have been much more frowning. It's a very well known term from World War II. To me, ""destroyer"" is much more of a term known from movies like Toy Story."

","Marvel again kicks off the summer movie season, this year with the sometimes entertaining, but often flawed Thor. Director Kenneth Branagh, who is known for making movies with dopey dialogue and abundant overacting, reigns in the excesses of his self indulgent projects for this blockbuster, but the movie is still just so cheesy.<br/><br/>The film spends a lot of time in Asgard, the planet/dimension/afterlife that Thor lives in. Here he is about to become king, but the castle is almost invaded by the bad guys with the very original name of ""Ice Giants"". The king decides to let this go, but Thor takes his friends—a group of Gimli and Robin Hood lookalikes—into the ice giants' world to fight. For his foolish actions, Thor is banished to earth and stripped of his power. But he can get it back if he is redeemedor something.<br/><br/>For the rest of the movie, Thor is trying to get back home, while his brother—who just-so-happens to be an adopted Ice Giant—takes control of the kingdom and starts being evil. Not that any of his friends ever gave him a chance to be anything else. The problem with this movie is that the plot is painfully formulaic, and the ""twists"" they throw in are so predictable it is insulting. The fight scenes are always cool, but of course the final battle goes on for too long, complete with every cliché in the book. The only thing that keeps this from being a total train wreck are the actors and the computer animation.<br/><br/>Chris Hemsworth is wonderful as Thor, the arrogant being from another realm. Anthony Hopkins seems to at least be having fun as the worn down, but wise king. And of course, Natalie Portman does a wonderful job. The other actors are all fine, with one exception; Kat Dennings as Darcy is practically insufferable, cracking one humorless, flat joke after another. Luckily, she isn't in the movie that much.<br/><br/>The animation is the best this reviewer has seen in a long time. Thor's home world of Asgard is remarkable, especially during the night scenes. Not to mention the beautiful backgrounds of stars and space.<br/><br/>The movie tries to work in references to the other marvel movies, in order to try and make some sort of continuity for the upcoming Avengers, but in Thor, the references are only half thought out and as a result, awkward. They probably would be better if the other Marvel movies had starting doing it back when they were good, but it's the thought that counts.<br/><br/>Although the movie has some large flaws, including a poor plot and bloated fight scenes, it has good acting and characters; and if the day is hot enough, the theater dark enough, a movie like this will do alright.<br/><br/>http://thatguythatlikesmovies.blogspot.com"

","Epic. Outstanding. Absolutely breathtaking. At long last, a superhero film that keeps things simple, coherent and cohesive. Technically brilliant. Pulse-pounding action with heart, that's not simply there for the sake of being there. Such words would probably resemble my rough draft of a one-paragraph review of Spider-Man 2.<br/><br/>That landmark film still stands (or rather swings) as a testament to superhero movies, to action movies, to movies. Faithful to its source material, faithful to cinemaniacs, Marvel's masterpiece was everything that Thor, directed by Kenneth Brannagh and distributed by Paramount Pictures, has failed to become, like so many of its recent brethren.<br/><br/>The latest comic book caper is a bundle of fantastical jargon. It features its titular Norse god, an arrogant war-monger who wants his home of Asgard to go to war with its long-time natural enemy, the Frost Giants, who occupy the frozen wastes of Jotunheim. Big Papa Odin soon intervenes, disapproves of his son's reckless actions, strips him of his powers and exiles him to Earth. Meanwhile, the mischievous Loki is already planning his cliché coup against the incapacitated king, who for whatever reason is engaged in some sort of cryosleep for the rest of the film – I sort of dozed off around this point. So, thirty minutes into the movie, we've got Thor, Odin, Loki, Asgard, Jotunheim, the Frost Giants. A cluster of names that mean little else than we're in fantasy territory.<br/><br/>Then, Thor pulls a U-turn, with a fair fraction of the film's focus on the hammer-wielding hero's exile on Earth. Now a mere muscular mortal, Thor's as stupidly stubborn as ever. We've seen this kind of plot before. He meets a girl, she teaches him social interaction, and by movie's end, our hero has matured. Well, forget all that, because the said maturity that would normally encompass two hours seems to encompass no more than two minutes. To save words, the character development sucks.<br/><br/>Here's my biggest problem. Thor has no idea what it's trying to be it's all over the place. We started with a fantasy film, and now we've got a human tale, a personal story between a mythological man and cinema's classic love interest who, believe me, is not so classic here. Natalie Portman plays the astrophysicist who encounters him, and she's about as useful to the plot as a pair of bricks are to a silky dress, only serving two purposes: to blanket our ears with techno-babble, and to look incredibly horny every time Chris Hemsworth is on-screen doubly so if he has his shirt off. But there's not even enough time for the romance to bloom, as Brannagh keeps taking us back to Asgard (or was it Jotunheim heck if I know or care), where Loki has taken control. It's the definition of disjointed as, in the end, we get several plots which all feel incomplete.<br/><br/>I've never been a proponent of CGI, mainly because it's been abused way too often by lazy filmmakers. Action is only as exhilarating as its established characters and story then the effects become truly special. Again Spider-Man 2. In Thor, it's nothing special. There's CGI explosions, CGI battles yawn. Flashy but tiring, there's no substance behind the gloss.<br/><br/>Whether you're a die-hard comic book fan, or whether you're just a cinemaniac, it's hard to recommend the routine and redundant. Thor is an action-packed, effect-laden, infantile insult to superhero fans and a mess of a movie sure, it's fun, it's entertaining, you'll have a few kicks But great films aren't about having a few kicks. They're about lasting value. Great superhero films have always involved a human story, a personal struggle that we can relate to – Spider-Man 2, Dark Knight, Iron Man etc. – but Thor's sole personal struggle is our own, sitting in a theatre with glasses we tempt to chuck at the protruding images in front of us. The love interest is undeveloped and pointless, the main hero is an obnoxious jerk who achieves personal growth with no visible challenges to his self, and half the picture is just CGI and fantasy lore that lack any sort of heart or reason for you to care. My advice: save your money and wait for Marvel's X-Men First Class and Avenger. I dare say, knowing Marvel's standards, they can do little worse."
"howard_Patrick","8","0","2","31 May 2011"," Thor starts the summer of 2011 off with a bang!
","This year is turning out to be a powerhouse of Marvel comic movies. Starting with the Green Hornet in January, then most recently Thor, Priest; X-Men: First Class, Green Lantern in June and then Captain America and Cowboys and Aliens in July. My first review from this summer popcorn movie bunch is ""Thor"" adapted from the Marvel comic and based off of the old Norse hammer wielding god of Thunder. This movie doesn't fail to deliver to the fans a rough and tumble action packed and visually outstanding movie that can be placed right up there with ""Iron Man"". It also gives a surprisingly good lesson about the Norse gods and goddesses of myth and legend.<br/><br/>The movie is set around Thor god of thunder, played by Chris Hemsworth (Star Trek) and as you get to know him you find out that he's really full of himself and thinks that he doesn't have to listen to his father, Odin, played by Sir Anthony Hopkins (Silence of the Lambs) king of Asgard, Thor's home in the heavens. When Thor disobeys his father's wishes and travels to the realm of Joturheim, home of the Frost Giants, where he destroys the giant's home land into a pile of rubble. Due to his disobedience, Odin takes away Thor's power and banishes him to Earth in order to learn how to be rational and selfless before he can return to his home. While on Earth he encounters and a young and beautiful scientist named, Jane Foster, played by Natalie Portman (Black Swan).<br/><br/>Back on Asgard, Oden, due to stress of an inevitable war against the frost giants, no thanks to Thor of course, falls under ""Oden's Sleep"" (or a coma in layman's terms). His youngest son, Loki, god of mischief, played by Tom Hiddleston (Archipeligo) is crowned as king and then as the film progresses the audience discovers that he is planning a devilish and sly plan that would end up destroying Asgard forever. After discovering this Thor must discover what it means to be a true hero in order to regain his power and stop Loki from destroying the very home that he was banished from.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised and pleased at how the film's director, Kenneth Branagh (Henry V) distinguishes the three realms; Earth, Asgard and Joturherm with dialogue, lighting, mood and visuals. Branagh is well experienced in the feel of Shakespearian atmosphere like his movies, Henry V and Hamlet. It was great to watch and listen to the formal and complementary dialogue this is delivered by Odin and the other gods of Asgard. I felt those scenes could work on stage. With the other two worlds: Jotunherm is very cold, isolated, dark and eerie and Earth is as contemporary, new and modern. All of these descriptions are created by the visuals, lines and their delivery.<br/><br/>The only problem I really had with the movie was that Natalie Portman's character was really underused and only seemed to serve the purpose of the hot and lonely love interest. Also, once Thor is on earth, it's basically a ""fish out of water"" story for those scenes that demonstrate awkward fitting in moments and unfamiliar sayings. I also believe that the film could do without the slow-mo shots of Hemsworth walking into shots. I know that it's supposed to emphasize that he's this gorgeous man with rippling muscles and chiseled body. The audience and I already got those hints without the slow-mo shots. It just simply wasn't necessary, but I'm sure that horny teenage girls would strongly disagree with me on that notion.<br/><br/>This movie starts the year off with a BANG! It kicks the popcorn movie craze into high gear for 2011 as it will hopefully lead to even more successful comic book hero movies. If you are looking to have a great weekend, then go check out Thor. You won't be disappointed! I give this movie three and a half out of four popcorn bags."

","Thor was one of the most anticipated superhero flicks of the 2011 summer right alongside Captain America: The First Avenger and Green Lantern. I honestly thought that Thor was going to exceed all expectations of what superhero movies can do. It was to be an epic movie with a colorful cast. Well it did have a colorful cast with a not so colorful story. I believe Thor is the best argument one can use against the fanboys to say: ""The original story can't always be as rigid as the comics."" To me, it felt like there was not a whole lot of life in the movie. Asgard felt like an empty shell only harboring a handful of characters. Where was the Asgardian civilization? Where was the turmoil in the streets when the Frost Giants attacked? That's my argument on the Asgardian side of things. On the Earth side of things. Why on earth (no pun intended) did Thor have to be cast down into New Mexico? which brings me to my next question: why did he stay in New Mexico? I mean, SHIELD agents are supposed to be on top of things, they should have taken Thor to New York to the SHIELD head quarters where the Destroyer could have come and caused panic in the streets which would have been true mischief worthy of Loki God of Mischief.<br/><br/>However, on the entertainment side of things, it was colorful, funny, and very clean. This would make a great movie for family watching. But it is by no means an ""Iron Man"" or ""Batman Begins"".<br/><br/>If you want my opinion, just turn your mind off and enjoy the eye-candy, it's the only way to really enjoy the movie."

So unless the name ""James Cameron"" appears in the credits, don't expect my extra $4 for a ticket.<br/><br/>Thor is a competently made comic book movie, a la Daredevil or Elektra. There are 4 or 5 funny lines in the workmanlike script. And none of the actors, who include 2 Oscar winners, embarrasses themselves. But despite the fact it made a lot of money, I doubt if we'll see a sequel. There's simply nothing very interesting going on here to warrant one. Thor is a one-shot view for people trying to fill in their Marvel Comics movie list."

","I really enjoyed this movie because of the story and the acting of the ""god"" characters. Chris Hemsworth does a great job as Thor and he really develops the character properly throughout the film. The action was great, the scenery was beautiful, and the sets were appropriate. <br/><br/>There was some bad language (no ""F"" word), everyone was appropriately dressed and especially modest, considering Hollywood standards, but there is a significant amount of bloodless violence. All thumbs up in my book.<br/><br/>A few critiques: 1. It was a little predictable... enjoy it! It's fun.<br/><br/>2. I didn't like Natalie Portman's swooning. Yeah, Thor's a good looking guy, but I guess I didn't get the connection. (I'm a guy, but I've rarely seen girls swoon that much for eye candy.) <br/><br/>3. They tried to do too much science. Sure they threw around some theories, and it might get some kids to look up those topics. But the topics are highly theoretical and out of reach for most of us.

","I watched this film with absolutely no foreknowledge of what it was about other than the viking god of thunder. What I got was something I could have sworn was directed by Michael Bey in the lack of quality storytelling, character development or acting. There was a great deal of CGI and very little else. The only thing which nearly held the film together was a halfway decent story written (at least in part) by J. Michael Straczynski (BABYLON 5) but his writing was ruined by poor directing, poor character development and poor acting. Yep, just another CGI demo reel like 99% of everything else that has been shat out of Hollywood."

","Heathen message groups have been buzzing about the Thor movie since it began filming. Every casting decision announcement was endlessly ripped apart, and some people proposed organizing protests. In the end the consensus was that even if it s*cked it would be good in that it might cause people to read about the real mythology. And that what sets us apart from other religions is that we have a sense of humor, so we should give it a chance and see it before deciding to be offended. So it was with some trepidation that I went to see it. These are our gods, after all. Can you imagine Hollywood making a similar movie about Mohamed, in which God casts him out of heaven and he ends up being restrained and drugged in a mental ward of a hospital, and his abs are displayed as eye candy for the ladies? Heads would roll. But I'm pleased to say the movie didn't s&ck. Although there were a few cringe-worthy moments, especially when the film attempted humor, and the whole premise that beings who don't age might still have a human-style tradition of sons succeeding fathers to kingship is a little silly, overall it was enjoyable and a positive depiction of our gods. I think Thor is pleased that America has honored him with a movie, and that little children are calling his name, and that is why he has blessed us this year with so much rain.<br/><br/>review by gythia Erin Lale, author of Asatru For Beginners"

The biggest thing that bugged me was the love interest they plugged in for absolutely no reason....her character(portman) just annoyed me and there romance seemed forced and unbelievable.

","Having been a reader of Marvel comics back in their 60's golden age it's nice, as it was with Tolkien's books, to see them finally coming to life on the screen. This is a serviceable entry in the growing Marvel catalog. Casting is always a strong point in Marvel pics, this being no exception with the well-sculptured Thor, Hopkins as Odin and Loki masterfully underplayed, as well as the impressive Heimdall, guardian of the Rainbow Bridge. There is one scene where we get to look from behind Heimdall on his view of the universe that was just SPECTACULAR, they should have found an excuse to drag it out longer even if it won't transfer to the smaller screen. Now for the complaints - when they do these computerized battles, I find it hard to follow what it is they're showing me - can we slow it down a little, or would that expose the magic? I found the plot muddled. Without spoiling anything, it was a little hard to figure out what Loki was doing and why he was doing it, plus the wrap was a little hard to grasp. But I would say a decent start, if it follows Iron Man II doomed to a disappointing sequel. Hey, when do we get Dr. Strange??"
"yoshi_indo","6","0","2","23 May 2011"," A comic book movie that is entertaining but far from satisfying...
","Having read / watched several reviews for this movie I went in with great hopes for this movie. What I was given was satisfactory but did not sate the expectations I had for this movie. <br/><br/>The Plot: Thor, son of Odin (king of a race of gods called the Aesir). Is sent to earth to learn a lesson on humility, for causing a possible breach on an already brittle relationship between the Aesir and the Frost Giants.<br/><br/>The Writing: I thought this was a weaker part of the movie. The portrayal of Thor was good but asides Odin and Heimdall the rest of the Aesir were something left to be desired. They managed to change quite possibly one of the most campy characters from the Marvel universe to a remedially serious one. However the whole movie has a twist that completely hinges on your knowledge of Norse mythology (I have read bull finches mythology book) and the whole movie seemed kind of pointless and kind of silly if one knows about the positions of the Aesir. Do not read the next bracket if you do not want a weak twist to be spoiled (Loki is the God of mischief and trickery). I thought they were unable to give the full breadth of Thor's powers as I felt ambiguously about the strength of Thor, this also applied to Heimdall as everyone seem to treat him with reverence but we do not really see why.There were also some plot holes that were never explained e.g. What is the Odin's sleep? (I know, but others who are not familiar with Norse mythology may find it hard to accept).The character Kat Dennings played also seemed to have no place in the plot and the deadpan humor she attempted to convey seemed to fall flat for me due to weak writing. What the movie does succeed in is turning a relatively enraging plot (putting an ""alien"" into our society and see him interact with it) to an entertaining spectacle. The director also made the dialogue believable and some of the quotes spoken by Anthony Hopkins warrants the viewing of this movie. (2/5)<br/><br/>The Acting: Most of the actors portray their characters very well in this movie and convey the right amount of charisma and or subtlety for their respective characters. Chris Hemsworth, Anthony Hopkins, Stellan Sarsgard, and Idris Elba give a great energy to this movie but it is Idris Elba's subtle yet commanding Heimdall that really caught my eye. (4/5) <br/><br/>The Cinematography: This one was a relatively mixed bag, the scenes during the battle with the Frost Giants were very weak and lazily edited having all the Aesir and Frost Gaint (asides Odin) copy pasted several thousand times with a very lackluster set (that continuous in this set throughout the movie) of the Frost Giant's home world. Thor's abilities and the Rainbow Bridge were done very well and really brought a spectacle to be watched. The monsters were relatively mixed, some being detailed others being lazily edited. (3/5)<br/><br/>The Score: Nothing special, some scenes in the Aesir's world were filled with some dramatic and energetic music. (3/5) <br/><br/>Thor to the average person is quite enjoyable and I would definitely recommend on a lazy afternoon, but with if you are searching a movie that is remotely edifying you will not find anything of substance here. <br/><br/>Final Score = 6/10"
"ayoreinf","8","0","2","23 May 2011"," An intelligent teaser for the Avengers
","It's a well done movie with proper acting (and even better by some) though I can honestly say that Rene Russo is being wasted here. It doesn't really need 3D apart from the Asgard Scenes. And it corresponds nicely with the Marvel original including some nice Donald Blake jokes. But I kept on feeling it was stoping short of its full potential, as if all it was here for is setting the ground for the big Avengers movie - and the movie had its fair share of hints aimed at that specific future production. It was nice but could have been so much better that eventually I'm a bit disappointed. So much more room for dramatic development that was left untapped it's simply a shame."
"TheXeroXone","6","0","2","22 May 2011"," A couple of bad casting decisions aside, not bad.
","Thor is an interesting film, but I'm not sure whether to say its worth seeing or not. There is a lot that is good about this film and a lot that sank to the bottom of the barrel. The special effects are decent for the most part except that the Frost Giants' facial make-up looks like ass and the multiple Loki illusion scene looks like it was thrown together with a bad video editor at the last minute.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around Thor being banished to Earth in order to teach him humility and self-control in the face of conflict. The best parts of the film are those that derive themselves from the whole ""alien in a strange land"" motif that lends itself from '3rd Rock from the Sun' and 'Mork and Mindy'. Unfortunately the film lacks any kind of serious introspection that the aforementioned series each had that would bring about this kind of change that Thor needed. Instead we get emotional conflict and bonding that varies consistently between totally forced and half-assed.<br/><br/>The most solid performance in this film is the role of Heimdall, played by Idris Elba, because he's the only Asgardian who isn't treated like a happy-go-lucky dork. Volstagg is the only one who should really stand out as a happy-go-lucky dork because that's who he is. Loki wasn't bad either, but it was difficult to follow his emotional turmoil as his goals and manipulations change throughout the film.<br/><br/>Worst performance easily goes to Natalie Portman, who has absolutely NO chemistry with Chris Hemsworth and whose character does just mind-bogglingly stupid things throughout the film (think Lois Lane without the journalistic integrity). Another odd choice was Anthony Hopkins as Odin. Not that he didn't do his job relatively well, but only a few times, while watching Odin on screen, did I think to myself that I was watching a character other than Anthony Hopkins (in truth, his staff commanded more presence on screen).<br/><br/>Overall Grade: C+"
"tomimt","7","0","2","22 May 2011"," Pretty good introduction movie
","Surprisingly enough Thor isn't a disaster of a movie it could have been. It actually is a pretty strong fantasy/sci-fi tale of one of the more outlandish Marvel characters. The strongest parts of the movie happen outside the Earth, in where the movie treats the audience with poetic and majestic imagery of Asgard and frosty Jotunheim.<br/><br/>There was a genuine change, that Thor would have turned out ridiculous piece of crap. It has all the element, which in wrong hands would deliver a movie full of campy comedy gold. But instead of that, a seasoned filmer of Shakespeare Kenneth Branagh treats the more fantastical story elements with necessary seriousness and lightness, thus managing to turn the movie into an interesting, yet a bit flawed, introduction of Marvels version of an ancient Nordic deity.<br/><br/>As I said before, the most interesting parts of the tale are told outside our fair planet, which serves as a scene of punishment, when Thor is cast away from Asgard, stripped from his powers. The people Thor meets there serve little more else than a path to bring god of Thunder back to Earth in the future Avengers movie. though the banishing of Thor itself is good story.<br/><br/>I'd also give a nod to the cast, as the relatively new leads playing Thor (Hemsworth) and Loki (Hiddleston) manage to out stage more seasoned Hopkins, who plays their father, Odin. But then again, Earth based characters, such as Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) are left very shallow and ultimately uninteresting. <br/><br/>On a final note, I saw Thor in 3D and found that to be utterly unnecessary, as while it didn't take anything away, it added very little as well. So if you can, I'd suggest you to see it in regular 2D."

","*** out of (****)<br/><br/>After the critical and financial success of 2008's iconic ""Iron Man"" and its inevitable follow-up in 2009, I knew I could count on Marvel to bring us full circle with ""Thor"", another line up with their summer blockbusters. Adding Portman and Hopkins to the mix certainly didn't hurt one bit. However, the post-converted 3D detracted from some of my hopes. Fortunately, ""Thor"" is a strong summer opener, and hopefully more blockbusters pave the way. It goes to show that you don't have to make another sequel or re-boot to ensure greatness. A solid comic adaptation with something new brought to the table is just as sufficient. <br/><br/>""Thor"" revolves around the namesake protagonist (Hemsworth) who is the God of Thunder, who waves his hammer around with great pride. However, Thor's father thinks he is morally irresponsible for such actions, and thinks his son takes pride in the gratuity of his works, not for the overall message. So, he confiscates his son's artillery choice until Thor is fully capable and understanding of his actions. <br/><br/>First of all, the script just works. The dialogue is well-written, the characters are developed to an extent, and the overall premise is an efficient one. I personally think the six writers knew what they were doing. Furthermore, the leads are pretty likable and charismatic in their own ways. Portman is just a pleasure to the eye, but every scene she's in, she makes it worthwhile. Hemsworth obviously portrays a great and aspiring character. Dennings, while not extraordinary, does her job and makes the audience laugh here and there. <br/><br/>Also, the action in this movie is just killer. It's very well choreographed, and the special effects are stunning. However, there were a few problems I had with this movie. For one, the film takes a while to get going. The first act starts out very cliché-ridden and reminded me heavily of ""Clash of the Titans"", except less cheesier. And also, I know this has been mentioned before, but if your 3D is converted or serves no purpose to the story, don't use it. Period. It almost makes the film suffer, and just really agitates the viewer for squeezing out a few more dollars.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Thor"" lives up to its hype. With charismatic performances and a well-written story, this film worked. Not to mention the action doesn't disappoint, and doesn't detract from the film. If you're going to see ""Thor"", which I wholeheartedly recommend, please skip the 3D viewing. It is completely useless and serves absolutely no purpose hence being post- converted. I think maybe the only time post-conversion 3D has worked is with ""The Green Hornet"", and even then, it wasn't anything of brilliance."

","As we left the theatre after seeing THOR, my dad remarked 'Gee, Anthony Hopkins must have really needed the work.' It was really the script that needed work. It ought to be a federal offense to cast a heavy-hitter like Anthony Hopkins and not give him the material to display his special magic – the nuance, depth and subtlety of which he is so capable (think 'Fracture' and 'Proof'), and which keeps him in my Top Ten list of all-time best actors. Just goes to show you that not even brilliant actors can save a mediocre script, although Hopkins (as Odin), Tom Hiddleston (as Loki), Idris Elba (as Heimdall the Gatekeeper), and Kat Dennings (as Darcy Lewis) excelled in their own roles. Chris Hemsworth's brash and testosterone-pickled Thor was kind of one-dimensional for the first hour (and when things got a little bogged down he took off his shirt, which helped with the tedium!), but his character gained momentum in the second half where the script finally allowed him to get some depth and emotion besides the football/caveman/kill da wabbit outlook, and he rose to the challenge very well. (Now, if we could see him do this kind of interesting acting without his shirt too, whew!). Unfortunately, just as Thor's character was becoming interesting, he got streamlined into a very predictable and ho-hum love story with Natalie Portman's Jane Foster; another underutilized talent, as was Rene Russo's Queen Frigga. All very talented actors who just didn't have enough material to make it fly. While I usually love director Kenneth Branagh's quirky, grandiose, no-holds-barred creative genius, for this film the multitude of dimensions, worlds and historical scope proved too much for one feature-length, and the stellar special effects were not enough to fill in the blanks of this story and keep it from fragmenting into tedium. Despite some very good performances, the whole was lesser than the sum of its parts."

","The movie Thor presents the superhero on a spectacular scale worthy of the comic book stories and does not disappoint its regular readers or newcomers to this important Marvel comics character. The story and the purpose behind Odin the All Father's decisions and Thor the Thunder God's calamities are pretty well handled and explained. I liked Thor's determined, but just as virtuous, display in Asgard and down on Earth (Midgard) convincingly showing us that Thor is a god of a colorful mythology. The other Asgardian gods and inhabitants are depicted as being pretty impressive also. In this movie, actress Natalie Portman and the Earthlings thrill the audience equally well from the mortal side of life on Earth and give the audience fine acting too. All together it sets the stage for meaningful interaction between the two groups. The movie has plenty of fun special effects also so as to measure up to such a good story line. I enjoyed the depth of characterization given Loki and some of the rest of the cast. The movie has a very upbeat ending and leaves the audience in a good mood when Thor triumphs in his battles despite the many changes that happen during his visit to Earth (Midgard). Other character tie-ins (the Avengers) are appropriately mentioned here and there which gives the character Thor some great potential to be connected to other superhero movies as well.

","I had my doubts when it seemed Marvel studios was going to follow up its successful and critically acclaimed Iron Man with the rest of the cast of the Avengers all getting their own movie culminating ultimately in the Avengers movie which will, of course, totally fail to live up to the buildup. Don't get me wrong, I want it to be a great movie, but I'm afraid I've been deluded and jaded by things like the 1979 Captain America, the two abysmal Fantastic Four movies, and a depressingly long list of incredibly bad movies done solely for the purposes of grabbing the rights to Marvel characters.<br/><br/>So, yes, I'm not expecting Shakespeare here, and it's a good thing, too.<br/><br/>Thor's not bad. Grading Marvel on a scale it easily falls closer to the 'good' spectrum, i.e. Iron Man, and a lot farther form the 'bad' spectrum, say, Spider Man 3. Here's the thing, Marvel has finally gotten the idea that 1. You can make money on a good movie just as well as you can on a bad, and 2. Making a good movie can actually make you MORE money. Just look at the difference between X-Men and X-Men Origins: Wolverine. You'd think they existed in completely different universes by how vast the gulf of stupid is between the competently told X-Men and... the other one. And box office returns reflect this.<br/><br/>I'm ranting. Fine. To the point: Thor is a competently told story of the Thunder God falling to Earth only to rise again through self-sacrifice and a shoehorned in romance with a clearly pregnant and hiding it Natalie Portman. It's fun. But more importantly, it is visually stunning. I don't even just mean in 3D, I mean entirely. The digital effects are (mostly) perfectly believable. The visuals of Asgard are breathtaking.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are... well, they're okay. Honestly, I'd rather have had a more clearly visible fight choreography, but I understand that when you're story is about Thor, God of Thunder, it's going to be very CG heavy.<br/><br/>SHIELD shows up an awful lot in this one, as the main driving force of the plot on Earth, though I'm still a little fuzzy on how exactly SHIELD has any idea that a weapon of the Gods has fallen to Earth suddenly, much less how they can get there so quickly to retrieve it.<br/><br/>The somewhat mangled love story is... well, it's a mangled love story because Hollywood doesn't understand how to make a movie that appeals to both sexes without cramming in a pointless romance. Can't we just see Thor hurling lightning at monsters? Does it have to be ruined by Natalie 'I'm not preggo, I just like to wear a big jacket in the desert' Portman staring at the hunky English Norseman with moony eyes? Okay, I unfairly picked on Nat there. Mea Culpa.<br/><br/>And speaking of inexplicably English Norsemen, what the living balls was Cary Elwes doing in this movie? Besides sporting a fake goatee and dancing around with a rapier? And the Asian Norseman? And the black Norseman? Not that I have a problem with diversity, and they all played their parts well. Maybe I just don't know the Thor mythos that well.<br/><br/>I nitpick, but ultimately, Thor is a fairly fun ride. It's a summer CG action movie that could have been better but in the end isn't really that bad at all. I recommend seeing it because we all know the new Pirates movie is going to be balls."

","Thor Where do I start with this overly hyped messy Marvel hero story. Well he is one of the lesser known Marvel characters for the non fan boy geeks out there. But for most comic fans he is well known but mostly loved when part of the ensemble Avengers or Ultimates comic line. His own comic line of Thor (standalone) never sold well and was never really resonating well in the Marvel Universe on his own simply because we're talking about a super being with God like powers. The thing people love about the Marvel Universe especially comic fans and young kids is the believability factor. Spiderman walks the streets of New York, he's a teenage boy with problems other teenage boys can relate too. Iron man is a cocky business man with millions of dollars in wealth like a flash Bill gates & Steve Jobs rolled into one ! Even the far out characters in the Xmen you can relate with because they are treated differently due to their difference all be it massively magical mutations. But with Thor you need a Marvel loving audience to relate with viking costumes, Asgard & Yodenheim and the 9 realms. Make any sense? I bet not! I'm sorry but this sounds more like a cross between a bad Star Trek story and Lord of the Rings gone wrong! The best thing about Thor is when he is on Earth. I know we all have to learn about the origins of these characters. But the in this film we learn about Thor's world, Asgard, his relationship with his brother & father and the main realm they have a beef with, Yoddenheim. Most if it is unnecessary. They could have just continued the story from the point that Thor is banished to Earth for defying his father. Instead just as you get comfortable with Thor being like a fish out of water on earth and start enjoying the jokes of his clumsy mannerisms with the human people they take him back to Asgard where he becomes trapped ! BORING !! The best bits for me in this movie were the mentions of Bruce Banner, Tony Stark. Appearance of Hawkeye and the post credits scene with Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson again). I know I sound like a crazy angry fan boy geek gone mad. I understand all these movies like Iron Man 1 & 2 & Incredible Hulk and the soon to be released Captain America are there to setup The Avengers movie next year. But this movie could and should have been so more..massive disappointment due to the story being central to the world of Asgaard. Watch it if you don't know much about Thor and ain't expecting anything but some action and a fantastically other world storyline + its definitely not for 3D so save yourself some money by just watching in 2D it was never made for 3D - Although the Captain America Trail in 3D looked amazing! HURRY UP AVENGERS !!!!"
"Bunuel1976","7","0","2","18 May 2011"," THOR {3-D} (Kenneth Branagh, 2011) ***
","This is as solid a Marvel Comics superhero flick as we have come to expect. While I cannot say to have been much enthused when it was first announced (in view of my unfamiliarity with lead Chris Hemsworth), I kept the faith given the involvement of director Branagh – which is not too surprising since he treats the larger-than-life proceedings as if they were a Shakespearean tragedy (which made his reputation to begin with) and, in any case, he had already dabbled in fantasy with the interesting if overblown MARY SHELLEY'S FRANKENSTEIN (1994). In hindsight, this proved almost as refreshing as IRON MAN (2008) where, similarly, the human element had emerged in spite of the predictable barrage of action (notably a battle sequence early on) and special effects (the look of Asgard is impressive alright, yet the 3-D is – as ever – sparingly adopted throughout, thus not justifying the ticket-price increase!).<br/><br/>Though the lead looks nothing like the cartoon character I used to watch as a kid, he manages most of the aspects pertaining to this legendary Scandinavian deity – his pride, his passion, his confidence, his charm and, of course, his strength (augmented by Hemsworth's physically-fit appearance). Thor's family circle includes Anthony Hopkins as Odin, his father (who can always be relied upon for such grandiose types, especially since he plays through much of this one-eyed), Rene Russo as the latter's wife (who, however, has precious little to do) and Tom Hiddleston as Thor's brother Loki who, discovering to be something other than what he had been led to believe, eventually becomes the hero's sworn enemy (even if his horn-fitted head-gear was, in itself, a giveaway to his true nature!). Also on hand are Thor's warrior companions (a mixed bunch of sexes, ethnicities and personalities, with the girl among them obviously having a yen for our hero!) who even follow the protagonist to Earth when Odin banishes him (stripped of his powers!) for disobeying his orders of keeping the peace with a neighboring (and, effectively made-up, vaguely monstrous) tribe.<br/><br/>On Earth, we get the usual initial misunderstanding and clash of cultures, as Thor's fall from the heavens coincides with heroine Natalie Portman and crew's study of an atmospheric phenomena – they even run him over twice with their van (the comedy relief, especially as delivered by Portman's brainy-but-cute pal Kat Dennings, is quite endearing)! Before long, romance blossoms (believably), bureaucracy intervenes (in the form of SHIELD, the Superhero league which has been appearing intermittently throughout the Marvel Comics adaptations, getting its most sizeable part so far here – with not only a cameo by Jeremy Renner but the by-now-trademark appearance from Samuel L. Jackson, meeting up with Portman's elder associate Stellan Skarsgard, in the post-credits teaser: this one is quite intriguing and there is even an announcement that ""Thor will return in THE AVENGERS""!), while Loki usurps the throne and visits Thor to tell him their father is dead (which he is not, but this only increases the protagonist's guilt complex!).<br/><br/>Anyway, Thor learns the truth from his friends and also sees Loki for what he really is. The hulking but wise Guardian of the passage between the two worlds also gets in on the action, though he is obviously no match for Loki; later, we also get a robot being sent to Earth to cause havoc (another fine set-piece) but, just then, Odin sees that Thor has learned his lesson and gives him back his powers (incidentally, he could not even dislodge his mighty hammer from where it fell and which had been appropriated by SHIELD along with Portman's personal notes!). In the end, Thor assures Portman he will returnbut the afore-mentioned bridge has to be destroyed during his showdown back home with Loki, in order to eradicate the latter, so Thor cannot keep his promise after all (though the scriptwriters are sure to find a way to resolve this issue and get them together again by the time the inevitable sequel comes along!)."

","Thor starts out with terrific action, brief background set-up, and spectacular special effects,but after Thor's(Chris Hemsworth) banishment to Earth , the story gets weak,the action slows down, and there are more set-ups than you can imagine. Although the pacing is good, more Thor action is demanded and necessary.<br/><br/>Odin is recovering and incapacitated from betrayal by step-son Loki. Thor is on Earth , and Loki seizes the opportunity to become King,which had originally to have been Thors birthright.<br/><br/>Kenneth Branagh directs, and does a good job ,treating Thor as Henry V, many trials and tribulations. This helps give the character depth and realism. Jane Foster(Natalie Portman) is fine as the earthly love interest . In this version of Marvel comics she is a scientific explorer . Finally toward the end of the film , Thor recovers his powers,though a totally unselfish act, and the storyline picks up.<br/><br/>One thing of note, MANY artists built the Marvel Franchise, not just the few given credit. As always, Stan Lee gets top billing , but this should not confuse the issue that the Artists drove the comics, not the stories. While Stan Lee may think he is Odin, I can guarantee you he is not. When Jack Kirby couldn't get health insurance due to costs, it was time to say goodbye. Joe Sinnott , another EXTREMELY talented artist was COMPLETELY snubbed by Marvel, and they will never get another dime out of me. I have had enough of their partisan, selfish views, and Stan Lee can rot in Hell., Marvel hell to be sure. 8 out of 10 stars, for showing the world that special effects and a comic-book storyline can drive a film, but it was created by the sweat off of the backs of the ORIGINAL artists. Nuff' said."
"arj117","8","0","3","16 May 2011"," Awesome action, great acting...then got lazy at the end
","OK, so let me start by saying that the ultimate reason I go to blockbuster movies like this is to be entertained...Overall the movie was thoroughly entertaining...so here's a brief breakdown. THERE ARE NO SPECIFIC SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW...JUST A VERY GENERIC PLOT ANALYSIS Action Sequences: Easily the best part of the movie - and I'm not just talking about the CGI. There was just enough CGI to be cool, but not too over the top, and plenty of ""human hand-to-hand"" combat that I like. and it definitely was worth the extra $ to see it in 3D.<br/><br/>Acting: Actually pretty good! Im a HUGE Natalie Portman fan, and now also a Chris Hemsworth fan (he's not too hard on the eyes either). Anthony Hopkins & Stellan Skarsgard also did famously in their supporting roles. The rest of the supporting cast was also solid in their roles...except for maybe Thor's ""crew""...which I felt either needed to be better developed or given no special attention whatsoever.<br/><br/>Story: Ahh the story. The first 75% was AWESOME. It spent just enough time setting up the back story & Thor's character arc. But then sadly the last 25% left me EXTREMELY underwhelmed. I think most of this was because the film lacked a really GOOD and DEVELOPED villain - The Frost Giants weren't given enough screen time to be developed, and Loki ended up being nothing more than a coward. This left the movie void of an epic final battle between good & evil, which is the part I always look forward to.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I still enjoyed watching it, and I haven't given up hope on the God-Avenger."
"colinrgeorge","Null","0","2","12 May 2011"," Snor
","""Thor"" operates under the mistaken assumption that Thor is cool. Marvel's unsolicited film adaptation makes no attempt to entice an audience that may yet be unfamiliar with this benchwarmer hero. Peter Parker was a dweeb; Bruce Wayne lost his parents; Clark Kent was abandoned at birth; great comic heroes have compelling origin stories. Our introduction to Thor is as a spoiled warmonger about to ascend to kinghood. Why are we rooting for this guy, again?<br/><br/>Pitting your audience against the protagonist is something a filmmaker the caliber of a P.T. Anderson can pull off, but I'm pretty sure we're supposed to like Thor. Maybe we're supposed to sympathize when daddy takes away his mallet, but once the eponymous meathead is booted from his cushy Asgardian throne, he crash lands on Earth as a colossal buffoon. See Thor get tased. See Thor smash a coffee mug while a glib teenager uploads a photo to Facebook and you'll have an idea just how low the comedy here is flying. Watch your heads.<br/><br/>""Thor"" treats Thor with such undeserved adulation that reducing the thunder god to a punch line in the second act comes like a bolt from the blue. Following a foundation of pretentious melodrama set in a Seussian CGI metropolis, even the more successful attempts at humor later on play foreign and weird. And just to keep the audience on its toes, the tone wobbles wildly to and fro like a pair of burly Norsemen on a teeter-totter.<br/><br/>I've got nothing against flawed heroes. Thor's arrogance might have helped make his story worth telling. Instead, the filmmakers (with credit to no less than five writers) waste two hours attempting to redeem him in the audience's eyes. Still, the real problem is that the character is uninteresting. It's more than possible some of the nuance of the comic books has been lost in translation, but I can't think of a single trait that makes Thor (Chris Hemsworth) appealing.<br/><br/>The same goes for the rest of the cast. Natalie Portman plays a scientist who ought to be studying the mysteries of her missing personality, and Stellan Skarsgård plays her mentor, an equally pale placeholder character. Rounding out their misfit team is Kat Dennings, whose character description might as well read: ""Social media junkie; loves her iPod, and whatever else those damned teenagers are into nowadays.""<br/><br/>The aesthetic of ""Thor"" is as bland as its players. Director Kenneth Branagh, best known for his Shakespearean endeavors, takes a 'broken tripod' approach to directing this summer tent pole. He has cinematographer Haris Zambarloukos frame half his shots diagonally in lieu of investing in a coherent visual style. Branagh is elsewhere absent as the shepherd of his cast — otherwise proved performers mumble their way through the movie.<br/><br/>As if Thor didn't have enough shame to contend with as a D-list superhero, his big screen debut is similarly underwhelming. Instead of making a case for the character, Branagh and a gaggle of screenwriters cement his lame duck status in this bludgeoningly boring popcorn flick. Even undiscerning cinema-goers looking for little more than a two-hour refuge from the summer sun have better choices available to them. Comic book aficionados likewise have no shortage of spandex to look forward to in the coming weeks.<br/><br/>After years of warming the bench, Thor finally got called into the big game, only to slip up and sustain a career-ending injury on his first play. That's gotta hurt."

","Great movie in so many ways. The only thing that my GF and I did not like was the quality of some of the 3D in the movie. It looks like it was added later and since the movie was very busy visually the 3D distracted from enjoying some of the really spectacular scenes. Still a very cool movie. (I really don't like that we are forced to fill 10 lines which forces many into filling a reviews with fluff. Being forced to fill the review with fluff also may get you black listed.

","Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is an arrogant and headstrong son of god Odin (Anthony Hopkins). His other son Loki (Tom Hiddleston) acts like he's the complete opposite of Thor. After a huge mistake Thor is stripped of his powers and sent to Earth. He's found there by a scientist studying the universe named Jane Foster (Natalie Portman). She wants to help him but SHIELD (a secret government agency) wants him too.<br/><br/>This movie is just a set-up to the Avengers movie that's going to come out in 2012 (in fact after the credits they say that Thor WILL return in The Avengers). For what it is (a comic book movie) it works. It's fast and full of action and violence (within a PG-13 rating of course). The script is kind of lame and totally predictable but I still liked it. It all leads up to an ending that basically screams to you that there WILL be a sequel.<br/><br/>Surprisingly the acting in this is good. Portman is as good as she can be as Jane Foster and Hiddleston is excellent as Loki showing the evil beneath his exterior before it breaks free. Best of all is Hemsworth. He's young, incredibly handsome and in fantastic shape (he has one shirtless scene which is FUN to watch:)). Physical attributes aside he's very good in his role. He's not always dead serious and acts just like you would expect a god to act. The only debit was he occasionally used words and phrases that NO god would use--or know! Is this is a great movie? No. But it IS a good summer movie to kick back and enjoy. I give it an 8."
"ferguson-6","6","0","1","15 May 2011"," Hammertime
","Greetings again from the darkness. Upfront admission: I am not a Thor comic book expert. Many people are and I fully appreciate their take on this film will be much different from mine. I can only judge this movie on the basic background knowledge I have and the final product on the screen.<br/><br/>Let's start with the good stuff. Chris Hemsworth makes a terrific Thor. If I had his looks and build, I would certainly consider myself a Nordic God. Heck, I might even carry around a hammer just for fun! Thor, son of Odin, is all set to be named King of Asgard until his quick-temper and love of battle cause a break in the peace accord with the Frost Giants. His dad, Odin, played by Sir Anthony Hopkins is none too pleased with his hot-headed son. Not only does he renege on the promise to name him King, but he strips his power and casts him down to Earth ... specifically New Mexico. For some reason, all alien portals lead to New Mexico. You can tell it's a been a bad day for Thor because he lands in the middle of nowhere and is promptly run over by a science lab van driven by Natalie Portman.<br/><br/>Other good stuff: Idris Elba as Heimdall, the gatekeeper, is excellent; there is a cameo by Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye - a teaser for The Avengers movie next year; Jamie Alexander shows some chops as Sif; Clark Gregg is back as Agent Coulson; some of the special effects are pretty cool ... the Frost Giants are very detailed and The Destroyer looks like Iron Man on metallic steroids; and lastly, Kat Dennings has a couple of sharp lines as Portman's assistant. Ms. Dennings was superb in ""Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist"".<br/><br/>OK, the not so good stuff: I am beginning to despise 3-D (it adds nothing, while diminishing the brightness of colors); Jotunheim (land of the Frost Giants) is just plain, gray and boring; Natalie Portman, fresh off an Oscar is just terrible as an astro-physicist with a teenage crush on Thor; Tom Hiddleston as Loki is one of the weakest villains I have ever seen in a super-hero/comic book movie; Rene Russo must not have read the script prior to accepting her role - she has about 3 lines and is totally wasted.<br/><br/>Despite the weaknesses, I found the movie to be entertaining enough thanks to the scenes with Thor and Odin. The ambitious son being shown tough love by his father is a missing element in much of society today. Guess it takes a Nordic God to show us how. The scenes with Portman are painful to watch, but I believe there is enough to keep the comic book fans and just about anyone else entertained.<br/><br/>Directed by Kenneth Branagh, who is best known for his Shakespeare and stage work, the movie does have a little different look and feel from the average superhero movie. Still, I wouldn't put it in the class of Batman, Spider-man, or Iron Man. We do get the expected Stan Lee cameo and the end-of-the-credits appearance of Samuel L Jackson. Up next, Captain America!"
"josef-6","7","0","2","15 May 2011"," Good but Could have Followed Comic Books Better
","The movie was entertaining and my 11-year-old sons enjoyed it but I thought it could have been longer since it only took Thor about ten minutes to discover humility after an eternity of arrogance. Natalie Portman was fine as his love interest despite garbage-head reviews (professional reviewers have their heads so full of pseudo-intellectual tripe they are unable to enjoy a good shoot 'em up.) to the contrary and the supporting cast was really excellent. My sons rated it up there with Skyline, Battle for L.A. and Priest. We are a Sci-Fi family. My wife and I are Trekkers, and my sons are Star Warriors. We know Sci-Fi and this is a good shoot 'em up."

","Do you have an intellectual, yuppie friend with no imagination who can't understand why anyone above the age of 13 would see a comic book movie? Is she a woman? Does she look like Natalie Portman? If you said yes then you probably have a good idea what this movie is about. The movie does have some amazing special effects, artwork and sets, but it moves from one scene to the next, vacillating between amazing heroic scenes on Thor's planet of Asgard vs scenes of complete dorkiness with Natalie Portman. Will you like this movie? I guess that depends on how much dorkiness you can take with your Thor. Personally I couldn't make it past the final scene."

I liked the only real action scene in the movie, which was where Thor gets into the fight with the Big metal dude. Other than that, there was very little real action.

","Thor<br/><br/>This film is mildly recommended.<br/><br/>"" If I had a hammer, I'd hammer in the morning / I'd hammer in the evening / All over this land / I'd hammer out danger / I'd hammer out a warning...<br/><br/><ul><li>Lyrics from The Hammer Song by Pete Seeger &amp; Lee Hays</li></ul><br/><br/>Yes, the gods are angry again! And no, we mere mortals have not caused that reaction. It is an inside job this time. The gods have cast out Thor, son of Odin and the latest Marvel superhero to reach a movie theater near you. They have sent him crashing to Earth to learn a few lessons along the way. Now one might think that his mission is to hammer out justice to those who dare to cross his path, and although that may be somewhat true, his real mission is to reel in mucho dollars for Paramount Studio ( and indeed he will ). Yes, Thor, the first of the summer blockbusters, has finally arrived! Sit back and enjoy the ride!<br/><br/>Shakespearean actor/ director Kenneth Branagh goes all Shakespeare on us with the film's plot and character development. He takes a tried and true formula as his blueprint: Tragedy + Comedy = Thor, and most of the time he succeeds in his vision. With this comic book tale, he amps up the Norse / Marvel mythology aspects and treats his film with a solid pedigree of opulence and pageantry that is usually not seen in this genre. Branagh still provides plenty of action sequences to please the built-in audience of fanboys everywhere. But he wisely throws in some Henry V, some King Lear, some Hamlet into the mix while juggling the lighter comic element that made the original Ironman such a successful enterprise. However, he does make some missteps along the way.<br/><br/>Banished from Asgard due to his recklessness and arrogance and forced to live with us humans, Thor becomes a fish out of water as he time travels to the 21st century and tries to adapt to our planet's customs. It is here that he meets Jane Foster who will, of course, become his love interest and help him become a better man-god and it is here that the film excels in its charming and comic tone, if not in its originality.<br/><br/>In fact, the film constantly shifts its vision ( and also its strengths and weaknesses ) with varying results jumping to scenes from modern day Earth, the Disneylike inspired Tomorrowland known as Asgard, and Jotunheim, the ice planet of Frost Giants. <br/><br/>The modern day sequences work best due to the strong chemistry between the leads: Chris Hemsworth, in a breakout performance as the God of Thunder, displays a nice comic timing while also displaying a even more defined godlike torso. ( Let's face it, he looks and acts the part to perfection. As gods go, he's an 11! ); Natalie Portman is adorable and completely likable as his astrophysicist girlfriend, but it really doesn't tax her acting prowess. ( Let's face it, she looks and acts this throwaway part to silly perfection. But as astrophysicists go, she's an 5 at best! ). Stellan Skaragard and Kat Dennings as Jane's scientific crew provide able support to the proceedings. Also impressive are the battle sequences on the subzero Jotunheim with the villainous Frost Giants. This portion of the film is quite effective and makes for rousing fantasy entertainment. The visual effects and makeup are first rate and Colm Feore as King Laufey elicits the right menace necessary for all the Dark Forces to converge on our hero and his fateful allies.<br/><br/>But it is on Asgard where I had serious problems was with the film's lack of inventiveness in its production values and familiar comic book storyline. ( This is the Shakespearian ""realm"".) After all, it is 965 A.D. when our story begins. Yet the illogical futuristic costumes are distracting ( helmets worn as ostentatious headdresses and tacky gladiator armor reminiscent of Hollywood's Cleopatra era ) and the laughable art direction is even worse. The setting is so overwrought with grandiose Art Deco style and Celtic inspired patterns that one wonders if the gods may have time traveled to future centuries and taken too many courses in art history and fashion design for such pretentious surroundings. ( At times, I thought I was at the Crystal Cathedral Ministries or some 1964 World's Fair pavilion with all the excessive gold leaf and gaudy crystal. ) Also caught in this world are Anthony Hopkins as Odin ( his best acting in years ), Tom Hiddleston as Thor's jealous sibling, Loki, and Idris Elba as Heimdall, Odin's loyal servant and gatekeeper to the realm. The actors go about their paces, don't look to ridiculous in all the gaudy trappings, and are able to extract fine performances from the insubstantial material they are given.<br/><br/>Another misstep: the clash of the titans' duel between Thor and a cyborg rip-off. There is an awkward moment, a recycled formulaic similarity of robotic invaders from past films, from the animated Iron Giant to 1951's Gort (from The Day the Earth Stood Still ) to Ironman itself. And while there is nice CGI to enjoy, there is also a nagging sense of déjà in this sequence, a vision completely lacking any imaginative thought of its own.<br/><br/>Still, Thor is a mighty sci-fi fantasy tale of redemption that is sure to be a real crowd- pleasing franchise even though it's a bit inconsequential. The action moves along at a brisk clip, the film thoroughly holds your attention, and it is what it is. As big summer blockbusters go, it will make a godlike ton of money and keep the Hollywood gods and moguls happy, that is, until the next superhero comes along ( which should be in about 2 weeks, I would guess.)

"bjones","7","0","1","14 May 2011"," Entertaining, BUT ...
","Thor is the Norse god of thunder, among other things, and is still revered as such in some places. But this is not about religion although most of the story's framework is drawn from it.<br/><br/>I first learned about the God Thor reading about him in the pages of my parent's encyclopedia late at night by flashlight. I think I was about 10. To me, Norse mythology was just more interesting than the Greek or Roman. Among the things I learned, Thor also represented fertility and was the protector of mankind. Not altogether bad things for a movie hero. So, I was hoping this film would turn into one of those guilty pleasures, not in least part because I can also remember reading the comic book when I was a kid.<br/><br/>The title character is played by Chris Hemsworth, who has a modern day comic book physique to fit the part. He's actually best when he's more serious. He doesn't do the comedic parts of the film nearly as convincingly. Writing him in as completely clueless about human culture on Earth doesn't fit well for the part of a God.<br/><br/>Thor's love interest is amply provided by the stunning Natalie Portman as Jane Foster. Portman, for her part, adds a lot to the film both with her excellent characterization and just by beautifying the screen. She is just one of those people you have a hard time taking your eyes off of. I liked the comic elements she was in, her's is the kind of face you like to see happy.<br/><br/>The supporting players, Anthony Hopkins (as Odin), Rene Russo (subtly underplaying Frigga, wife of Odin and Queen of Asgard), Stellan Skarsgård and Tom Hiddleston are all terrific. I am struck at the range I've seen in the performances of Stellan Skarsgård. Is this the same guy who played the palpably evil Cerdic in ""King Arthur""? Of course it is. It's also the same guy who sang and danced in Moma Mia as Bill. That's some wide range of talent. I think he's one of my favorite people to see on screen. He's always doing something interesting and he ads subtle touches here that provide some connectivity and explanation. Tom Hiddleston added something great as one of the film's villains. He didn't over do it either. Thank you for that.<br/><br/>But one of the best new actresses around, Kat Denning added marvelous relief as Portman's quirky and funny assistant. I am looking forward to seeing her do a lot of great things in the future. I hope the filmmakers also see that she's not just funny, but can be really sexy too.<br/><br/>Overall, however, the film left me wanting more. I tried to understand why I felt that way. I think the most disappointing element was the story. It wasn't bad, really it wasn't, just disappointing. I was hoping against hope that it would more closely follow the original Marvel comic I remember so well. In those, Thor was sent on a mission to Earth by his father, Odin. He lived life on Earth as a disabled doctor, Dr. Donald Blake, who then became the superhero when he was needed by tapping his cane on the ground. Then his cane became the magic hammer Mjolnir and he was magically transformed into Thor to do battle against evil.<br/><br/>Well, that's not the plot of the movie. The plot of the movie is considerably weaker and it seems the lighter, comedic elements were an afterthought to prop it up. The comedy, perhaps, saved the story from becoming trite. There's nothing wrong with some comic relief, but it shouldn't feel like it was NEEDED.<br/><br/>In the film, Thor is cast out of Asgard, presumably to learn a lesson. He must become worthy to return, but the film's Asgard is overwrought, hardly seeming like the kind of place a playful young pagan God would care to go back to (How much more entertaining would have been the participation there of Freya, goddess of love, beauty, fertility and war).<br/><br/>The makers of the film (including the director Kenneth Branagh) might have taken some council from the old movie, The Vikings (1958) and the celebratory banquet hall in it, presided over by the obviously hedonistic Earnest Borgnine. That setting seemed a far more desirable candidate for a Viking Asgard than the stark sterility of this film's sets. Borgnine's version seems like more the place a warrior would like to be swept into Valhalla by scantily clad Valkyries. The injection of the other kind of reality would have been far more entertaining than all the CGI nonsense here. It just wasn't interesting at all.<br/><br/>While we're there, the use of 3D in this film was my second big 3D disappointment recently. It would have been nice to see it well used but it goes by without hardly any notice. It made me feel cheated out of the extra admission price.<br/><br/>Some of the other CGI effects were very good and much more original than some other recent offerings. The film's use of color and space was fairly stunning. But I'd like to send a note here to the film makers, Gods should not need any kind of mechanical apparatus to wield their power. That would be more impressive than what was done here.<br/><br/>In the final analysis, it's worth the trip to the theater, you'd definitely benefit from seeing this on a really big screen. However, you won't really miss anything if you opt for the digital version and skip the 3D.<br/><br/>By Bruce L. Jones http://webpages.charter.net/bruce.jones1/"

","It was a chance to watch another movie in 3D and what better choice than a legend action ""Thor"". It was not disappointing at all, in fact I loved the cinematography of the stars, galaxies, kingdoms and simple action. This for me was the winner and oh yes the very sexy Chris Hemsworth! He is so young but perfect as Thor and Anthony Hopkins as his father was good too. I am only wondering how he wore the full armor and delivered the lines, he must be real fit at this age. Natalie Portman was a delight and when she kissed him, well girl way to go! It was a brilliant legend from Marvel Comics and nicely done on big screen, I am looking forward to the next one. My favorite scene is Thor having coffee and breakfast at the diner. That will suffice for now."

","So I saw Thor in 3d and released in 2011. So did I like it. Well before I answer that let me say I am not opposed to watching the odd popcorn big budget bonanza, but as my blog states, I shoot more for quality overall than just great special effects. So my girl had free tickets and that is why we went. So did I like it? Well if you don't take it seriously it is kind of funny, something I hoped legendary Kenneth Branagh (who directed this film) intended. Oddly he was a perfect choice for this film considering the Thor planet parts with Sir Anthony Hopkins play more like Shakespeare. Is it really good, no. Is it worth it to see it in 3d, no. Some movies like avatar are meant to be seen in 3d, where it is much more than a gimmick. This movie if you see it in the theaters, save the cash see it in 2d you won't be missing anything. Otherwise the special effects are great, and the acting is not horrible. I kind of thought of it as a modern day ""flash gordon."" It is a little cheesy, a little over the top, but if you find it funny it is enjoyable, just don't tell anyone I said that. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/"
"warwinrules","7","0","1","13 May 2011"," Thor - the coolest part is just after the ending!! :)
","Wait till after the movie closing credits finish – that's the coolest thing about Thor!!!<br/><br/>The biggest thing that everybody misses in Thor is the ending – and by ending, I mean after all the closing credits are rolled out. Remember to stay EVEN after the credits are done. Trust me, that's what everybody misses!!! And that adds an element of intrigue, ""WOW"" and a sense of still more to come to the movie.<br/><br/>This is not the first time a Marvel Comics movie had a similarly unexpected ending. I simply loved Iron Man. Tony Stark defied the superhero stereotype by being a womanizing, arrogant and wealthy prick, who lived life king size. And what made the whole movie work is the choice of the charming n charismatic Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark. Unlike other superhero movies like Spiderman and Batman where we always used to wait for the scenes where the superhero showed up, in Iron Man, I was just waiting for more scenes with Tony Stark. But one of the coolest Tony Stark scenes is actually not in Iron Man – it's in the ending of another movie, the Hulk.<br/><br/>Marvel Comics has been shuffling superhero presences across their various offerings. Not many people noticed, but after the closing credits of Iron Man 2, the movie actually ends with a scene where the SHIELD agent, Agent Coulson, calls up his boss and says, ""Sir, We found it "" and then the movie ends with an image of Thor's hammer!!! (sure, go ahead n check it out :)).<br/><br/>The news is that Marvel has one more movie coming out in July this year in Captain America, after which you'll see all the four, i.e, Iron Man, the Hulk, Thor and Captain America coming together next year in The Avengers. Thor is an extension of Marvel's strategy to build superhero property out of its comics and monetize them.<br/><br/>Thor is the story of a warrior god, who is arrogant and too ballsy for his own good, who gets tamed to then become the King. Interspersed in this story is a hint of love (with Oscar winner Natalie Portman), sibling rivalry between Thor and his god brother Loki, his rocky relation with his father (Antony Hopkins) and all this with some great special effects.<br/><br/>An interesting thing about Thor is that even the Gods above agree that life on Earth is hell – so the God King, Thor's father, sends his son god to exile as punishment - to Earth! Thor's scenes on earth where he interacts with humans do provide some comic moments.<br/><br/>It's a good movie nevertheless. The way the Heavens have been created with the visuals and costumes is very commendable. The story, even though kinda corny, has been adapted very well to screen. Chris Hemsworth is just right as Thor – the dude has got a body to kill for and in the scene where he tries to lift the hammer from the mud, he looks almost believable as a god. The Oscar winners did a decent job with their parts with Antony Hopkins having more meat to his role. See the ending after credits to know which character really scores.<br/><br/>But at the end of the day, Thor is just too goody goody a movie – it's just another regular good movie. Even the finale fights were found wanting. Bottom line is: It's a good movie but it doesn't have the uber coolness of Iron Man or the depth of The Dark Knight.<br/><br/>But great fare for the summer. So just get the pop corn and sit back to enjoy!!!<br/><br/>And don't forget to stay after the credits!!<br/><br/>:)"
"bigcalkenobi","8","0","2","13 May 2011"," Thor offers up a good adaption and a good, but not great movie
","Thor is Marvel's next film in their ongoing Marvel film Universe that so far consists of Iron Man, Iron Man 2, and The Incredible Hulk. What makes Thor different is that more than half of the movie doesn't even take place on earth, but in Asgard or on one of the other planes. Along with that Thor has a young cast(lead by Chris Hemsworth; Tom Hiddleston)and director(Kenneth Branagh) who has made his career out of doing Shakespearean films. Thor also has the task of introducing the audience to Asgard; a world that is a combination of magic and technology. Can Thor overcome all of these shortcomings and make Thor yet another building block to the Marvel Avengers universe or will it fall flat and give audiences another lukewarm movie to start the summer (looking at you Iron Man 2)?<br/><br/>Check out the rest on my film blog http://mastersfilmreview.wordpress.com/2011/05/13/thor-review/"
"RealtorMatthew","7","0","1","12 May 2011"," A Modern Day Nordic Tale?
","THOR was a thrill-ride for me. I left the theater drawing comparisons with Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure, Superman, Terminator (a reversed version), 13th Warrior, and Lord of the Rings, as well as the story of Jesus Christ. It's definitely a stylized version of Nordic/Norse Viking mythology.<br/><br/>Sounds strange huh? Let me tell you this: Kenneth Branagh pulls it off, being the brilliant director that he is.<br/><br/>I was expecting another Hollywood action flick with some macho guy raising hell and no substance. I was only half right.<br/><br/>Let's recap the story: Before he becomes king, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is banished from his home in the fantasy world of Asgard for his acts of arrogance in directly confronting and causing the deaths several members of the Frost Giant army, who are the enemy.<br/><br/>Thor is stripped of his superpowers by his father and is transported through a wormhole to earth. Much of the comic side of the movie comes from Thor's portrayal as an average person who still thinks he has superpowers (is subdued by a vaccination). Another point of humor is his adjustment to things on earth (he walks into a pet store asking for a horse).<br/><br/>Thor's exile is so difficult on his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) that he goes into a coma. While in this state his son Loki (Tom Hiddleston) assumes control of the throne, making choices that neither his brother or father would agree with and exerting his revenge for being the 2nd best child all his life. Loki is committed to exterminating the Frost Giant race, even though they have been at peace for some time.<br/><br/>While on earth Thor's attitude changes as he comes to care for Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), a researcher of galaxies from beyond, who he meets when transported to earth. As their relationship develops and Thor finds a way to get back to Asgard, he has to make a tough choice as it relates to seeing Jane again.<br/><br/>Before going back to Asgard, Thor must defeat ""The Destroyer"", a large robot-like being, that looks impenetrable.<br/><br/>The ending works for the movie and the events that lead us there are credible. They even leave it open for a sequel, but you have to stay after the credits.<br/><br/>So what are my thoughts on the film? Some of the CGI used in the movie is a little hokey, but I say overall it was well done.<br/><br/>It was obvious that Thor's body was, shall we say, ""fabricated""? The costumes were first-rate, very cool.<br/><br/>Loved the use of wormholes to transport to other worlds.<br/><br/>The visuals were brilliant and we could feel the characters being transported through. Also noteworthy visuals: the weather disturbance/storm at the very beginning of the movie and the destruction scene towards the end. Definitely big-budget there The fight scenes were amazing, some of the best I've ever seen. How Thor's army goes up against the Frost Giants is dazzling and the ice that grows from the arms of the enemy used as attack-weapons was also eye-popping.<br/><br/>Best acting performance is given by Tom Hiddleston/Loki, as we see the torment he experiences finding out his true identity and displaying a good deal of rage over that and his jealousy towards his brother Thor.<br/><br/>There were a few lulls/slow spots during the first half of the movie.<br/><br/>To summarize I enjoyed THOR more than I thought I would going in, but I also expected that since friends who's opinions I valued said it was a very good film. I vacillated between 7 and 8 stars, so I give THOR: 7.5 out of 10 stars"
"ysricharan","8","0","1","11 May 2011"," A good fun filled super hero movie
","I've always been a fan of fantasy films and this one met all my requirements. Marvel pictures has made another good super hero film which has almost all the elements. Chris Hemsworth was absolutely fantastic as a pride young prince who wishes to display his strength with a lot of aggression. Natalie was good too, but was a little weird because of her role as a research scientist. Though her role was short, she did her part well. Anthony Hopkins had a small little role but was apt for the role of Odin. Loved the short little comedy role of Kat Dennings. She did a great job in making the crowd laugh once in a while making sure the movie-script wasn't too serious. Perhaps, the storyline was the only weak link in the movie. Good direction, good acting and on a whole, a good movie."

"ryanpseudo","7","0","2","10 May 2011"," Good acting, awful writing
","I'll do my best to not spoil anything in the rather weak plot.<br/><br/>Thor wants to kill the bad guys. He's exiled, and then for no evident or explained reason undergoes an overnight change from arrogant, angry, defiant, rude brute to a kind, wise, peaceful theologian. <br/><br/>His brother, who at this point has exactly what he wants, does something that could serve no purpose but to jeopardize what he already has. He serves to gain nothing, but he's mucking up what he has. He's SUPPOSED to be the clever trickster, not Hitler. But then he goes off trying to kill the bad guys.<br/><br/>Thor takes it personally that his brother is doing exactly what he wanted to do the day before, and sets out to stop him.<br/><br/>At the end a piece of MACHINERY is destroyed, and apparently no one in this advanced civilization that ages gracefully over 2000 years can rebuild one. <br/><br/>The friends of Thor, both mortal and immortal are never humanized enough to care about them, in fact you'll only remember the name of natalie portman. The rest of the characters are all real ""that one guy"" sorta people. The only characters with any development are thor, loki, and oden, but only oden's makes sense. Thor just snaps into good-guy mode, and loki goes on a 5-yr old tantrum when he finds out who he is. Nothing is explained about whether they're immortal by relics, or born immortal, or how they live forever and have strength. Are they just humans with relics? <br/><br/>Shield plays the antagonist for half the movie. They're not playing the secretive in- and-out, we don't exist, POOF guys. They're just the FBI bumbling around. I think I saw mulder and skully. They're stealing stuff in broad daylight and throwing their name around like they're accepting applicants. They don't seem to know whats going on at all, or care, they just want to steal one scientists data for some reason never clearly explained. They then give it back, and with one line of dialogue, are friends with thor. Well thank goodness.<br/><br/>The graphics are 2 years ago, and the backdrops look 5 years ago. Rather akin to the new star wars backdrops that are just too pristine to be real. No grit or texture. <br/><br/>Overall, the movie was made to introduce thor for the avengers movie. I'm concerned Green Lantern will go the same way. There are several name drops of other characters in the Marvel universe, and after the credits they show a clip from some upcoming marvel movie. The movie is a lead in, not it's own real entity. Save your money, watch it at a friends place sometime, no rush."

","This movie completely exceeded my expectations. I was questioning whether or not they could pull this one off walking in, but in this rare case I was really pleasantly surprised by the outcome. The performances by Hemsworth, Hiddleston and Hopkins were outstanding. The plot was surprisingly well written and delivered. The action was nearly non stop and the visual effects were stunning. Do yourself a favor however and try to catch the movie in Digital format. Both 2D and and 3D(a common occurrence during this 3D mania) were sub par from what I understand but I saw it in Digital format and it was spectacular. I was very surprised by the quality of production and direction in this movie and rank it among the best of its super-hero genre. Personally I believe in certain respects it excelled the Iron-Man, X-Men, and Spiderman films. Its not quite Christopher Nolans Batman trilogy, but it comes as close as any can to that level of success. The only action-adventure epic that could best this achievement this summer may be the upcoming Green Lantern film, but that remains to be seen... Oh and a special shout out to Idris Elba for an outstanding supporting role performance."
"movieexplosion","8","0","2","10 May 2011"," Entertaining Superhero Escapism
","Kenneth Branagh directed this badboy and some may know him for his more Shakespearian fare but this is mainstream cinema through and through. This story begins with a man falling to Earth and being found by Jane Foster(Natalie Portman) an ambitious scientist and her co-scientists Erik Selvig(Stellan Skarsgård) & Darcy Lewis(Kat Dennings). We then go back in time to find out how this event came about as we are transported to the wonderful looking world of Asgard, a realm in space where super beings live and who were once honoured as gods by us mere humans. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) dishonours his father Odin(Anthony Hopkins) by breaking the fragile peace that is held with an old enemy through his ignorance, pride and thirst for a fight. He is then banished to Earth without his powers.<br/><br/>The beings from Asgard live what we would describe as a more traditional ancient life with appropriate customs and the clash of these realities creates several humorous results which is part of the charm of this film. A solid cast with a script that isn't overcomplicated and provides some laughs combined with acting that could have easily been overdone and some amazingly lavish special affects notably the realm of Asgard create a movie that will keep you entertained for it's duration. What we got here is a beautiful leading man and leading lady so eye candy is provided here for all plus an entertaining and visually rich film. This is by no means unmissable fare but seriously how many movies really are?"
"iReviewFilms","7","0","1","10 May 2011"," Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: Thor
","Another Marvel comic book creation is unleashed into the movie world which is growing desperately thin on new and original pieces of work. In recent years Marvel (Spider-Man, X-Men, Fantastic Four, Iron Man) has given us from average to good but never great with the best of them tending to arrive from the first movie of the series with the new superhero (Hulk is emphatically excluded from this sweeping generalisation). Thor, as the first of many summer superhero movies (including the next Marvel adaptation- Captain America: The First Avenger) could have headed either way.<br/><br/>Thor is about, if you haven't already gathered from the title, Thor (Chris Hemsworth)- the god of thunder. After an ancient war against the Frost Giants of Jotunheim, Odin (Anthony Hopkins), king of the Aesir forges a truce between the two races which last until the day Thor is due to be crowned King. During the coronation ceremony, several Frost Giants break into Asgard. In retribution Thor goes against his father's will and leads an assault on them bringing about a war in the process. Odin banishes Thor to Earth stripping him of his powers opening the door for his brother Leki to take control.<br/><br/>Arriving on Earth, Thor soon runs into astrophysicist Jane (Natalie Portman) and her colleagues who are unbeknownst to them studying the effects that Thor has caused in the sky. Without his super powers and trusty hammer Thor must learn to adapt to his new surroundings and try to discover a way to return home.<br/><br/>As in most of the Marvel movies, comedy is woven into the plot to keep the movie going and Thor achieves this well. Most of this is derived from Thor as he copes with his new surroundings a makes for some funny moments. Portman, the love interest, is smitten from the first time she sees Thor which she creates excellently right from the off.<br/><br/>In keeping with the swords and hammers over guns, I liked when the modern day sniper was called into the action and instead of picking up his trusty rifle opted of a compound bow. For those less aware of the Marvel world, that character is Hawkeye and a subtle nudge in the direction of The Avengers film due for release next spring. Along with a Stark and S.H.I.E.L.D reference the movie keeps in line with other Marvel productions by intertwining them together but in a subtle and refined way. Hopefully The Avengers can live up to the expectations they are building! I found Thor to be better than I though it was going to be with good acting performances especially from newcomer Hemsworth and a good balance between action, comedy and drama to keep me entertained for the whole 2 hours. If you do go and see this at the cinema, which I would recommend, then make sure to stay until after the credits have finished rolling for some bonus footage.<br/><br/>For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com"
"ShootingShark","6","0","1","10 May 2011"," Spectacular And Enjoyable Marvel Comics Blockbuster Of Norse God Banished To Earth
","Thor, the Norse God of Thunder, is banished to Earth when he defies his father Odin and makes war on the Frost Giants of Jotunheim. Abandoned, alone and stripped of his power, he is befriended by Jane Foster, an astrophysicist. Can he redeem himself, get back home and prevent a treacherous plan to usurp Odin's rule ?<br/><br/>Branagh is oddly the correct choice to adapt Marvel Comics' Norse superhero to the screen - his flamboyant visual flair and Shakespearean background turn it into an intergalactic King Lear, and he plays it admirably straight. For all its dazzling backdrops and crazy fights, it's really just a simple story of a young man learning humility and responsibility, and age-old family problems. What makes it very enjoyable for me is the cast, particularly Hemsworth in the lead - he looks the business, has a big time movie star swagger which belies his inexperience, is funny and sweet, and paces the character brilliantly. He starts off as a noisy, bombastic twit, but gradually matures into a real hero, touchingly encapsulated by the scene where he faces the Destroyer alone for his friends' sake despite the fact he knows he cannot win. Hiddleston, Hopkins and Skarsgård (whose Scandinavian origins add a strange authenticity) are all great in support as the sneaky brother, troubled Dad and a nice guy scientist respectively, and Elba is terrific as Heimdall the watchful gatekeeper, who is in equal parts noble, amusing and cunning. The women don't fare as well - Portman doesn't have much to do except giggle at Hemsworth, and Alexander as warrior Sif doesn't really get to strut her stuff. The visual effects, especially the realisation of Asgard, are first-rate throughout; there's an eye-popping ice-caves battle at the start, the faceless Destroyer is a terrific robot monster (although it does remind me of Gort from The Day The Earth Stood Still), and the Bifrost Bridge, which the Gods use to literally shoot themselves around the universe, is fantastic. There's also great production design by Bo Welch and a nice overblown score by Patrick Doyle, both of which create a suitably epic feel - I saw this on the largest screen in my local cineplex and the big experience really adds to the movie's sweep. The only downside for me is the story editing, which constantly flips back and forth between Asgard and Earth. I guess this is necessary for the plotting and intrigue, but for me it breaks up the tone too much; as soon as Thor and Jane start developing their friendship we're back in Asgard for more special effects, and it keeps cross-cutting throughout. I would have much preferred an hour on Earth bookended by sequences in Asgard. Minor gripes aside though, this is great head-bashing family comic book entertainment, with plenty of action (the second unit director was talented veteran stuntman/filmmaker Vic Armstrong) and a great Star Turn by Hemsworth, whose infectious grin alone is worth catching it for. Trivia - the uber-secret government agency Shield who bust up the party also appear in Marvel's recent Iron Man series of films (with Gregg here reprising his role as the cynical operative Coulson). Based on the 1962 comic by Stan Lee, Larry Leiber and Jack Kirby; Lee also has a funny walk-on as the unfortunate pick-up driver trying unsuccessfully to pull Thor's mighty hammer Mjolnir out of the ground."

","'THOR': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>The fourth Marvel comics 'Avengers' film (following two 'IRON MAN' films and an 'INCREDIBLE HULK' flick, all leading up to the 2012 ensemble piece based on the combined team of the 'Avengers'). This one focuses on the popular comic book superhero version of the mythical Germanic paganism God known as Thor who first appeared in Marvel comics in the 60's. In this film he's played by Chris Hemsworth (probably most well known for playing James T. Kirk's dad George in the 2009 'STAR TREK' redo film). The film co-stars Natalie Portman, Tom Hiddleston, Stellan Skarsgard, Anthony Hopkins, Kat Dennings and Clark Gregg (reprising his role from the other 'Avengers' films as Agent Coulson). It's written by Ashley Miller, Zack Stentz, Don Payne, J. Michael Straczynski and Mark Protosevich and directed by none other than Kenneth Branagh. I never read the comic regularly (or much at all for that matter) but I've heard the film is a pretty faithful adaptation. As far as pure cinema goes it's grade A classic popcorn fare all around, what the big screen was made for.<br/><br/>The film takes place on modern day Earth after Thor is banished there by his father King Odin (Hopkins). He was set to take over the throne of Asgard when creatures known as Frost Giants broke into their kingdom and attempted to steal back the Casket of Ancient Winters which Odin took from them in battle in 965 A.D.. Thor believed Asgard must retaliate, against his father's wishes, and broke the long standing truce with the Frost Giants by attacking them in their homeland. For his arrogance Odin exiled Thor to Earth and sent his magical hammer with him, placing a spell on it so that only someone worthy of it's powers could use it. Thor lands in New Mexico where he's found by three scientists including Jane Foster (Portman). The S.H.I.E.L.D. agency finds his hammer, which no one is able to remove from the ground where it lands. Thor finds himself stranded in this land while his mischievous brother Loki (Hiddleston) plots to take over the kingdom of Asgard back home.<br/><br/>The 'Thor' comic character has been said to be the most trickiest of the 'Avengers' to adapt to the big screen, by many, and prior to seeing the film I would have agreed but after watching it I actually disagree. The story is somewhat timeless and the themes involving brother rivalry and fatherly approval are classic as well. The legend of 'Thor' and the comic story actually lend themselves to cinema form very easily and that's why the film really works. It's thrilling big spectacle entertainment and at the same time it never takes itself too seriously; it has fun with itself and plays out somewhat tongue in cheek at times. The 'fish out of water' material is played to it's ultimate comic effect and at the same time never over done. Branagh's directing is perfectly fitting and despite the number of writers used the script is well written and beautifully timed. Hemsworth is probably about as fitting an actor as the filmmakers could have found to play the title character and although his performance is nothing close to anything award worthy it's just what the film needed. The supporting cast is all more than adequate as well, especially Portman who's once again doing material that is far beneath her talents but still gives it all she's got and it's kind of fun seeing her play such a sweet giddy character with a big schoolgirl crush on the film's hero (which is pretty against type for her as of late). The movie just hits all the right notes and plays out exactly like a movie of it's type should. The perfect summer comic book action movie blockbuster, not the best of it's type but it's definitely among them.<br/><br/>Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7A8qHI10rk"

","Went to see Thor because the trailers made it look interesting. I will start with the look of the film which really was very good. The Asgardian planet was impressive and the effects were mostly believable (except for one particular scene on a bridge). The beginning sequence offered a lot of promise as it was pretty quick to get going and quick to set up the concept and the characters place in the story. Maybe it was too quick because the rest of the film seemed to take that quickness lead much to the detriment of the last portion of the film. I have to say the dialog was snappy and the humor was not over the top or silly. What turned out to look silly were some of the more dramatic parts; the dialog there failed in a lot of the most important scenes. Also I agree with a lot of the critics that Thor's transformation into egoless, humble guy was way too quick. Again this speaks to the rush the movie was in to get to the next fight scene or special effect. All in all it was worth seeing once but not multiple times. 7/10"

Like Thor can't get any girl..) and all that superficial crap. Overall a 7,5. I had foreseen a different ending, with Loki doing a great job and the spoilt Thor getting a feel on reality- maybe aligning with some evil to get back at his old kingdom. But the start was really excellent, the action scenes nicely done. The 3d was kind of worthless though, the effects were not as strong as in some other movies that I saw.

However, as my boy-friend is a Marvel fan and at the same time wanted to see a non-existentialist film for a change, I held my breath and thought that I could always sleep during the movie, as a last resource. That's to say I had no hopes for this film whatsoever, and knew nothing about it beforehand as well.<br/><br/>The thing is, I have to admit that I sort of liked Thor. At least, I enjoyed some details, like some of the design, the textures used and even the choice of colour in some of the fantasy scenes; there's evidence of some good taste here and there. Of course the 3D almost ruined everything, as usual.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the screenplay was much too puerile, even for its genre. Despite some good jokes, evidently this film didn't take itself too seriously in this aspect. Too bad it didn't, because the film could be like a pearl lost in the mainstream space otherwise.<br/><br/>Just in the end I got to know it was directed by Kenneth Branagh.

","I have to confess that I do not now, nor have I ever, had much knowledge about the legend of Thor. I don't know his legacy either in Nordic mythology nor from the pages of Marvel Comics. I can't really say why exactly, but my knowledge of all ancient mythologies doesn't extend beyond the borders of Clash of the Titans. Therefore, Kenneth Branaugh's new adaptation of the Marvel Comic superhero is my introduction to the whole enterprise and, by that introduction, I can say that while it is an enjoyable movie, it didn't make me want to do any further reading.<br/><br/>The Thor presented in this movie is played by hunky Australian actor Chris Hemsworth, tall, blonde, buffed with good hair and pretty teeth. He lives in the far off Heavenly kingdom of Asgard, a place ruled by his God-like father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) who will someday - as these things always go - cease to rule his kingdom and toss his first born the keys. But - as these things always go - there's a stumbling block between hero and birthright. Thor's younger brother Loki is waiting in the wings for his opportunity to rule and he. sets a plan in motion to knock brother off the roster of rulers so that he can take the old man's place for himself.<br/><br/>Loki knows that Thor has an anger management problem which he puts to good use against a race of Ice Giants from another dimension who fail in their plan to steal a precious magical artifact from Asgard. Thor uses an inter-dimensional bridge to travel to the ice dimension where he picks a fight with the giants using the strength of his mighty magical hammer. When his father finds out, he robs Thor of his strength and banishes him and his hammer to a tiny green and blue planet somewhere in the Milky Way galaxy.<br/><br/>He lands in New Mexico where he is discovered by a trio of scientists (Natalie Portman, Stallen Sarsgaard and Kat Dennings) who want to understand him. Meanwhile, he is hunted by a shadow or organization called S.H.I.E.L.D for reasons that I'm sure are waiting for the upcoming Avengers movie.<br/><br/>What happens to Thor here on Earth is standard issue fish-out-of-water stuff. In fact, the scenes in New Mexico grind the movie to a halt because the movie never takes full advantage of having a Norse God here on earth. There are some jokes about his eating habits, his fighting ability but the movie never really explores those scenes.<br/><br/>Where Thor finds its magic is in the Kingdom of Asgard. Asgard is one of those great, grand movie spaces where you are pleased to just sit back and behold the visual look. The landscape is made of abstract designs and smooth surfaces. The skies are a beauty multi-colored clouds with stars visible behind. Odin's palace is a wonder of pipes that rise into the sky like an enormous pipe organ. The inter-dimensional bridge is made of glass and light. The interiors are browns intricate designs lit by ornate torches. Nothing here is subtle. The production design is by Bo Welch who also designed the look for Men in Black, Edward Scissorhands, Batman Returns, Beetlejuice and that bizarre miserable factory in Joe Versus the Volcano. Here he goes wild, creating a grand far-off kingdom.<br/><br/>What disappoints me is that the movie doesn't have much else. There are a lot of standard fights in the movie. A hint of a love affair between Thor and the Natalie Portman character. And a potential for a father and son relationship between Odin and Thor, but they are all brushed aside in a movie that sometimes seems too busy trying to get to the next fight. No one is really given a character to build on, they just go through the motions.<br/><br/>I think the movie should have stayed in Asgard. Those scenes create something really new and exciting. There are great things happening there, there are a hundred sights to see, but I think the movie short-changes itself. Director Kenneth Branaugh has some brilliant ideas and has made a sufficiently entertaining movie but he never really reaches for all that the movie could have been.<br/><br/>Rating: **1/2 (of four)"
"alxfdrmn","6","0","3","8 May 2011"," Fun Superhero Movie, But Not Quite There
","In many ways, my thoughts on this movie can be summed up as ""Expectations vs. Reality."" It certainly wasn't the best superhero movie ever, but I liked it for what it was. It seemed like the writers and Kenneth Branagh made it about ¾ of the way to having a really good movie on their hands, but there's definitely something missing.<br/><br/>My expectations from seeing all the trailers for Thor led me to think ""It looks like it'll look good, but it'll be kind of corny."" I went to see it hoping for a visual spectacle and a fun superhero movie. Just as a side note, I knew only a moderate amount about Thor in the comics before I saw the movie (and I'm more of a DC comics fan, but that'll have no bearing on this review).<br/><br/>Thor definitely succeeded with the whole look of the movie. Creating entirely new fantasy worlds in addition to the scenes taking place on Earth is tough, but the CGI was all really well done and convincing. I guess it's easier to make things look better if you have free reign to come up with new worlds that nobody has seen before. The production design and artwork matched the epic scale of the comics, and a surprising amount of practical effects (the frost giants, the real sets in Odin's palace) helped anchor the fantastical to the real. My only complaint is that by the end of the movie, some effects that started out looking cool seemed over-repeated (rainbow bridge cyclones, flyovers of Asgard).<br/><br/>But despite the achievement of creating a new variety of mythology, the film failed to provide any deep connection to the characters. The script wasn't too corny, but just kind of bland and a hodgepodge of clichés. Natalie Portman's character was so stupid. All she did was swoon over Thor, give him a ride, and say ""Oh My God"" and complain about SHIELD taking her research (I don't think this is her fault, the script didn't give her much to work with). Her ""relationship"" with Thor was totally contrived and out of nowhere. Kat Dennings' character was the stereotypical sidekick, and Stellan Skarsgard did a good job with what he had to work with. The Warriors Three and Heimdall all were supporting characters with very one-note personalities. Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Anthony Hopkins as Odin, and Tom Hiddleston as Loki all did their best, but the father-sons relationship between them never had much emotional connection or development.<br/><br/>There's definitely a bit of overacting involved, and I think that is due to Kenneth Branagh. I just don't think he understands subtlety that well, and preferring to stick to more broader, Shakespearean comedy and emotional moments. I remember watching him in Hamlet and laughing at the scene where he starts hitting a rock with his sword because he's angry. Well, I felt the same way a couple times during Thor.<br/><br/>And of course, there was no real suspense. Thor obviously can't die, he has to go be in The Avengers! None of the other characters really felt like they were in much danger. With such a shallow script, you could argue that much of the mythology was toned down because the writers feared that the general public wouldn't be able to follow anything complicated. They tried to root the mythological arcs in emotional conflicts, but none of the emotional conflicts are strong enough for us to care.<br/><br/>But the filmmakers honestly did a good job paying attention to details. The cinematography was pretty interesting for a superhero movie, with plenty of dutch angles and wide, sweeping shots. The fight scenes are all pretty cool, and I liked how the different warriors all had unique fighting styles. The costume design made ridiculous outfits and helmets seem natural. I liked the way they incorporated S.H.I.E.L.D. (and a special Avengers guest star) into the plot, which was much more natural than in Iron Man 2. And even though there's definitely going to be sequels, I think the ending to this movie had a good finality that doesn't make you feel like you only saw Part 1 of a three part movie.<br/><br/>In the Marvel movie pantheon, I would place this above Iron Man 2, but lower than The Incredible Hulk (my favorite Marvel movie), the first two Spidermans, and maybe the first Iron Man. It's worth seeing, as it's not your typical superhero movie, but I would wait until it comes out on DVD/Blu-Ray (and it's definitely not worth seeing in 3D). Thor is almost an experiment: Can audiences accept a lighter, mythological-based superhero movie? It certainly has the beginnings of greatness, but still has a lot to improve on."

","This movie is not as good as the comic but that is the case for almost every comic book based movie that I have ever seen. The main problem I have is with the main battle sequence that should have been the highlight of the whole movie and I guess it was but it really should have been a lot bigger and better, in the comic it was just mindblowing but it did not translate it to the big screen very well, it was not as action packed or mind blowing. The acting was pretty good for a movie like this. A lot of people thought it was stupid but I think this movie is intended more for fans of the comic like me, if you aren't familiar with the comic you will probably just think it is stupid, but why go see it if you think Thor is stupid anyway?"
"mccormick632","3","0","3","8 May 2011"," Little Disappointing
","Thor is one of those movies that, while not bad, are not that good either. It has great special effects, its occasionally funny, and when there is an action scene, it's not bad. The problem is that there are few action scenes, only three if I remember correctly. Thor is also just, well, boring. Like I said, when there is action going on, it's entertaining, and the writing is also pretty funny as well. But for a film that seems to be advertised as an action film, to be more of a superhero comedy than a superhero action film is a bad sign.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with this movie is the general lack of action scenes. As I said before, there were maybe only three action scenes in the whole movie. I don't want it to be non-stop action but the last two fights in the movie are pretty anti-climactic. At best the last two action scenes are only a couple minutes long. Even the final fight of Thor versus Loki (yeah, who else would have been the villain) only lasts a couple minutes and even then it's still a bit of a bore. I wished there would be more action scenes because the first action scene was actually pretty good and was a good four to five minute run time.<br/><br/>The story also has some problems in it that I found to be irritating. I already revealed that Loki is the villain, anyone who is familiar with Norse mythology would likely conclude that Loki is the villain. But his motivation doesn't make that much sense. It is said that maybe he is jealous of Thor but then he becomes king when Odin spontaneously goes into a deep sleep for some reason. He then plans to destroy their enemies home world which everyone opposes for some reason. I know mass genocide is frowned upon but he's doing what they wanted to have done! Thor wanted to go to war with these creatures, so when they are being destroyed why does he feel compelled to defend them? Loki is also inconsistent when he is deciding on what side to be on. First he is a villain, then he is an ally, then a villain again, then an ally again, just pick already! I also felt that the romance between Natalie Portman and Thor was forced and cliché. You know from the first minute they talk to each other how it will end up, no surprises at all.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, Thor is a mildly entertaining superhero flick. If they spent more time tightening up the script and improving on the lackluster action scenes, it would have been much better than it already is. If you're interested in seeing it there is no harm, just don't see it in 3D, because there is no 3D."
"christmas-10","6","0","2","8 May 2011"," Great Action Flic, BUT...
","This movie is really good on a lot of levels, from the buff, good-looking Hemsworth to the charming Portman. The Audience is transported to another world to see where Odin lives and it's believable. But I was looking for a little more depth of character from the God of thunder. We know as the hero, he is supposed to save the day, but his concern and instant love for all humanity almost seem to come from nowhere as he transitions from the headstrong reckless God of war, to a hero who suddenly loves the entire planet.<br/><br/>Portman's portrayal of Jane is good, but I believe she didn't have much to work with by way of script and much of their interaction seemed rushed. Though we are left looking forward to a sequel in the Avengers, I still wished we could have seen, just a little more depth to the people involved here before moving on to the avengers."

","WARNING! This review comes with spoilers......<br/><br/>Where are these reviews saying that Thor was AMAZING coming from??? Thor was good, but not amazing. Maybe you have to know the comics for it to be absolutely amazing, but without previous knowledge of the marvel comics, the storyline was very choppy, with many weak points. I found the entire storyline to be shaky at best and a lot of things weren't explained well. They should have put the extra half hour or hour in to explain a few more small details like who SHIELD is, since the after- credits scene seemed to prelude to them being important or to get to know the characters better so you could actually get attached to them. As well, the extra time would've slowed the movie down. I felt like I was in the theatre for only 30 minutes, and I never truly got into the movie since it was so choppy and moved so quickly. I have a decent knowledge of Norse mythology but it was difficult to distinguish characters since they weren't outright named right away. I didn't learn Siv's name till the end and I don't know the names of any of her warriors. As well, situations seemed pretty weak and unrealistic such as the SHIELD agent suddenly releasing Jane's stuff at Thor's request when they made it clear earlier that SHIELD makes things disappear. The first fight scenes were pretty good with tons of action and drama, but the Earth battle was a flop to me. Nothing clever or spectacular happened. It was all VERY predictable. The acting in this movie however was amazing and definitely made this movie good. All the characters were well built and seemed pretty realistic. The cg was pretty amazing too. The verdict? This isn't a must see movie, but it's still a good movie that you'll enjoy."

","I am a big fan of all the Marvel comics and the Marvel movies. I was very excited to go see this movie. It wasn't horrible but I wanted more from it. I didn't like how basically the first half of the movie all takes place in Asgard. I wish they would have had more of the movie on Earth. It did a good job of developing Loki in the movie, but not really developing Thor. He kind of just changed over night, nothing really happened to provoke that change. I also wish we would have seen Hawkeye in costume, most people probably didn't even know that Jeremy Rener is Hawkeye in the film and I would have liked to have seen him for more then 2 mins. Overall it was a pretty decent movie, I thought Chris Hemsworth was a good Thor but it needed something else. I blame it on the director."

","Thor is exactly what a comic-book movie ought to be – it's packed with action and great effects, it's true to its source material, it gives us characters we actually care about, and it's a tense melodrama with connections to Shakespeare. The entire cast is engaging – and some very nice to look at, depending on your persuasion – and all in all it's a well-told glorious spectacle.<br/><br/>Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is an Asgardian prince, son of King Odin (check your Norse mythology). Hot-headed, impetuous, prone to violence, and quite full of himself, he is nonetheless next in line for the throne. Just before his coronation is complete, however, intruders from Jotunheimm infiltrate Asgard; although they're quickly dispatched, Thor demands revenge, and against his father's explicit orders, he and his friends (including his brother, Loki) travel to Jotunheim to seek answers – and kick butt, if necessary and possible. Odin finds out and saves them, but he strips Thor of his powers – including his great hammer, Mjolnir, and banishes him to Earth to teach him a lesson in humility.<br/><br/>This banishment serves to open the door for treachery in Asgard, allowing the Frost Giants of Jotunheim to wage war against the Asgardians. Meanwhile, some of that trouble is spilled toward Earth, where Thor has fallen under the romantic spell of Jane Foster (Natalie Portman). Suffice to say that bad things come at the populace of a small town in New Mexico, with only a now-mortal Thor able to help them.<br/><br/>But this movie is about more than just bad guys plotting to take over the universe; it's about father-son relationships and the rivalry between a favored son and ""the other brother."" There's a lot of Henry V and King Lear afoot, and this is due in no small part to the movie's director, the great Kenneth Branagh. Branagh is not the first person you'd think of to direct a movie based on a comic book, but he manages here to not only keep the expected characterizations and plot fresh but also to instill a sense of classicism and wonderment.<br/><br/>The CGI is pretty well utilized (although some of the early scenes in Jotunheim made me realize they WERE computer generated, which is almost the opposite of what you'd want), and what's more it doesn't seem to distract from the plot. In some movies, effects serve as noise to prevent the audience from discovering that the story doesn't make much sense. Branagh isn't subtle in his use of technology, but this isn't a movie that really should be subtle. Thor himself certainly isn't.<br/><br/>Hemsworth, a newcomer to the States from Australia, is solid in the title role, much better than, say, Sam Worthington would have been. Hemsworth is sturdy and ripped, so he fits Thor's physical description, but he can also do a little bit of the acting as well. Portman, you may recall, is now an Oscar winner, and she's a delight here in a role similar to Liv Tyler's and Jennifer Connelly's in the two recent Hulk films; the smart femme fatale. In fact, her character reminded me quite a bit of Jodie Foster's character in Contact – a determined, resolved, super-smart researcher determined to find out what in Sam Hill is going on around here.<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins plays Odin as you'd expect Anthony Hopkins to play a king: regally, with a weary toughness. Idris Elba, Kat Denning, Stellan Skarsgard, Tom Hiddleston, Ray Stevenson, and a couple of uncredited cameos are also well cast.<br/><br/>You can expect to see more of Thor and his stories – his Thories? – in the coming years. This movie is a product of Marvel Studios, and upcoming releases will focus on other Marvel Comics' characters, such as Captain America and The Avengers. Plus there are to be reboots of Spider-Man and (maybe) The Hulk. And they'll all tie together, along with Iron Man.<br/><br/>So Thor is every bit as entertaining as I thought it'd be. It's classy without being out of reach for the rest of us; it's not some highfalutin Royal Theater production, but neither is it a simple slam-bang cacophony of senseless violence."

","In the distant realm of Asgard, a group of warriors wage war against the Frost Giants of Jotunheim—a tyrannical group determined to conquer all of the Nine Realms. Meanwhile, the most powerful of Asgard's warriors—Thor—prepares to ascend to the throne of his father Odin. When Thor refuses to be diplomatic, and his arrogant nature rears its ugly head, he's stripped of his power and banished to the realm of Earth. Once there, he inadvertently befriends a group of scientists and sets out to reclaim what was once his. Norse mythology set against the backdrop of the Marvel Cinematic Universe delivers with awesome, otherworldly special effects, epic battle scenes, intense hand-to-hand combat, a compelling story, and a surprising sense of humor. Some key subplots never quite resonate the way they should, but once it gets going you probably won't mind. Relative newcomer Hemsworth is a forceful presence in the titular role, and has great help from veterans Portman and especially Hopkins. ***"

","The God of Thunder storms into theaters, starting off the 2011 Summer with some action, but not very much substance. In Thor, up and coming star, Chris Hemsworth portrays the title character as an arrogant young man, who still has much to learn before he can become king of Asgard (the realm of the Gods, where his father Odin, resides over the throne). When Thor decides to fight the evil Frost Giants, against his father's wishes, Thor is banished to Earth, and he must embark upon a quest to reclaim his mystical hammer in order to return to Asgard and stop his evil brother, Loki, who manipulated all of the events so that he could take Thor's place and become the next king of Asgard.<br/><br/>Hemsworth is charming in the role, and really shines in the Earthbound sequences when he plays everything straight while still acting as if he is a God amongst Men, even though he is just flesh-and-blood. However, Thor lacks any real substance. The characters are never given time to fully develop, and it is partly because the movie is constantly switching back and forth between Earth, and what is happening on Asgard.<br/><br/>We spend the first thirty minutes in Asgard, then Thor spends about thirty minutes on Earth with Jane Foster (played by Natalie Portman), and then about thirty minutes dealing with S.H.I.E.L.D., then he returns to Asgard for the finale to fight with Loki. The movie just had too many irons in the fire for any single character to be developed, so when director Kenneth Branagh tries to cash in and show a romance between Foster and Thor, it just does not ring true, seeing as how Thor acted like a psycho for most of the time they were together, which was ultimately just one Earth day! Not enough time to develop a star-crossed romance.<br/><br/>Regardless, the actors do their best and give it their all. Anthony Hopkins adds a sheen of sophistication as Odin, and Tom Hiddleston knocks Loki out of the park (even if his character is never given the time to develop fully, as it should). As well, the movie is full of Marvel Easter Eggs, such as the Cosmic Cube, and an early appearance of Hawkeye in an action sequence near the middle of the movie. Speaking of which, the action is extremely well done, and definitely scratches that itch that only a Summer movie can, but what previous Summers have proved, is that a Summer movie nowadays cannot rely on action alone and must also have a fantastic story to go along with it, and Thor often slips in that area.<br/><br/>It feels like a sculpture that has rough edges and still needs to be smoothed out. The story does not flow as freely as it should, with myself wondering if the story would have been better served if the entirety of the film had taken place on Earth and save Asgard for a sequel, or perhaps simply save Asgard for the finale, rather than jumping back and forth as they do. The film lacks character development and relationship development, but it manages to still tell a story that makes sense, though it doesn't necessarily feel like a smooth ride.<br/><br/>I give Thor a 6 out of 10!"

","I will hand it to Kenneth Branagh, he knows how to put energy into a film. I was able to stay engaged for most of the action pieces, despite the horrific and clunky Earth scenes. A ragtag trio of scientists befriend the misplaced Thor, and nothing special happens as they seem to be stuck in a fake looking movie set that is supposed to resemble a small town in New Mexico. <br/><br/>Spoiler Alert:<br/><br/>It is no surprise the small town is destroyed in the big climax, cars flip through the air Michael Bay style, and buildings explode.<br/><br/>End Spoiler Alert. <br/><br/>Credit the producers for keeping this film in the tent pole mold, delivering the goods for a lesser hero than the other bigger comic book icons. However, for the Asgard world, there were some large crowd scenes, and rainbow bridge effects shots that looked blurred as though to cover how unfinished they looked. <br/><br/>I do not know the comic books, and judge this upon what new aspect this incarnation can bring to the screen. The cast is well versed, and the hero, Chris Hemsworth fits the uniform convincingly. The Earth scenes once again take a turn into B-movie territory, finding absolutely stupid material to waste time on. The story gets points for not getting too cliché, but loses major points for lapses in logic and unrealistic actions taken by major characters. Say for instance the government agent from SHIELD. He seems to have little security or authority to control anything. Nothing the government is doing, or Natalie Portman's physics experiment for that matter, is adequately explained. <br/><br/>Almost as if the Earth portion of the film was made by a different director, all the story and logic makes much more sense in Asgard land. Although there are character twists, there are few double or triple twists that spin out of control in other tent pole films. In fact, there is some resolution with the mythic characters that resonate with the audience. Credit that as well to the music soundtrack, fulfilling a much needed role in wall-to-wall operatic drama. But then there is the editing. It is sometimes a little too frantic, perhaps needing to take a breath more often. <br/><br/>There is a ""Lord of the Rings"" type battle that opens the movie and shows the different tricks the big hammer weapon can do. Alas, no other action scenes in the movie top this big battle, leaving me almost let down, but not actually feeling disappointed. But the fun hammer moves we are teased with in the first act, only briefly return in the third act, and it feels too little too late.<br/><br/>Despite the minor missteps in the premier of yet another possible superhero franchise, one must applaud the correct performances elicited by Branagh to pull off the mythical world. One only wishes Branagh was equally adept at eliciting down-to-Earth performances as well."

","I went into Thor with high expectations, and i thought it was an enjoyable movie and a decent start to this summer movie lineup, however, Thor could have been much much better. It was sort of a mixed bag, a mishmash of positives and negatives. the acting for one was not perfect by most of the cast, apart from Anthony Hopkins who plays his role to perfection. the rest of the cast including Natalie Portman were average at best. I was specially surprised at Natalie Portman's character, which was very shallow and had no strong or solid presence on the plot or on screen.<br/><br/>speaking of Natalie Portman, i thought her romance with Thor was rushed and did not sink in for me, i really did not feel the passion. the relationship between them was clichéd and typical. Did they really just add her to the cast for marketing purposes ? shame, shame !! Most characters did not develop enough, probably there were too many characters to go through in the movie's short running time, all felt rushed. I specially did not feel any emotions towards Thor friends, they were like strangers to me !!!<br/><br/>the plot was simple, and moved in a some what good pace, though i did feel it dragged a bit midway, probably felt more during those supposedly romantic moments between Portman and Thor.<br/><br/>the movie started with a big Roar, some very awesome action scenes with amazing special effects and sound effects, which made me think that i was in for an amazing ride for the rest of the movie, which was a false thought. but i gotta say, i was very impressed with that opening action sequence.<br/><br/>I won't say too much about the ending, let's just say, it did not satisfy me, it lacked the big climax feelings and in action. the whole movie felt lacking in action, i mean other than that opening action sequence, action was minimal. which really made me feel like the movie was missing something, like it was a bit empty.<br/><br/>So overall, it was worth the admission ticket for sure, some decent performances and decent plot, mixed with some very enjoyable moments and top notch special effects and big budget sets and CGI. but lacked in character development and had it's share of some cliché moments. watch it and judge yourself, but don't expect a perfect movie or a master piece."

","I'll be honest, I'm part & partial to Marvel Comics, & never really respected Thor as a character. DC played with Gods in their universe, Marvel's genius was always in men. That being said, Thor still had feet of clay. You can't really complain about the movie, just like you couldn't complain about the Hulk. Both are exactly what you'd expect to walk into if you ever took the time to pick up and read the comic books. The X-Men, or rather Chris Claremont's books were the soap opera's with the strong characters & solid, sweeping, plot lines. With Spiderman you expect laughs, people hamming it up with a strict morality as a plot device.<br/><br/>Thor isn't one of those titles. The Hulk wasn't either. You can't really bash a movie for staying true to the type of story arcs it published for decades. That being said, it's probably not a title for everyone, but it does deliver exactly what it promises for those that read the title. Part's of it feel like a set-up for the Avengers movie, and it probably is, but Marvel fans have been itching for a good cross-over film.<br/><br/>Don't watch it if you want a Dark Knight, or an X2, it never promised to be that type of film & Thor readers would be disappointed if it turned out to be so. You get exactly the type of movie you expected if you actually read the comic, and a much stronger film the ""GhostRider."""

","Thor is a powerful entry into summer comic book fantasy as director Kenneth Branagh infuses enough humanity into the CGI inter-dimensional portal travel to make a reasonable story of love and coming of age to offset the large number of combat scenes replete with exotic explosions. <br/><br/>Having been banished to earth from the Utopian Asgard, Thor must mature from the hothead warrior to wise leader in order to win back his father's respect and qualify to replace him as king.

I thought this superhero movie especially appeals to those who are always complaining that superhero movies always end the same, guy gets girl and beats bad guy(thor is little different). <br/><br/>The only bad segment in my head was the involvement of Natalie Portman, aside from the fact that she can't act, Thor and Jane bonding felt a little too rushed. It would have been better to either give them more time or just have a general ""falling in love with people concept"" to replace it. <br/><br/>Overall its a fun movie, that I would probably recommend."
"blackmambamark","7","0","2","6 May 2011"," A few years ago, i thought this movie couldn't be pulled off.....i was just proved wrong
","When word first broke that they were creating an 'Avengers' movie, my initial thought was ""impossible"". And the reasoning behind this though revolved around one central hero, and that is Thor. Granted i have only read a few of the Thor comics, and in my honest opinion, they were a little too boring for my taste. But that's not what concerned me. What concerned me, was how in the world they were going to sell this character on screen. I mean, the guy is the freakin god of thunder. How can you introduce that element and have it revolve around other likable hero's such as Hulk and IronMan? Well, judging from the previews i've seen, they seem to know exactly what they're doing.<br/><br/>For starters, the intro is bloody brilliant. It does a great job of establishing the main characters, and immediately encompasses a cloud of likability around Thor. Needless to say, they quickly establish the limitless bounds of his actual power, which is always fun to watch because you have never really seen that in a superhero movie. It always escalates upward to them gaining their power.<br/><br/>After this somewhat of an epic start, the movie maintains a pretty good pace. I honestly could have done without the love interest between Thor and Natalie Portman. Yes, i understand that in this case it was necessary. But it felt really weak to me. And it's nothing to blame on the writing or the acting. It felt weak because there were so many awesome things going on, that the love story was really the least of my concerns on screen. It kept jumping back and forth between two and sometimes three different worlds, and incorporate that with battling awesome creatures, who would want to pay attention to any romance the film has to offer? But the main point is that it doesn't take anything away from the character development, it just felt somewhat un-necessary.<br/><br/>Now comes the end, which left me slightly disappointed. You have this awesome beginning where Thor is just going crazy with his hammer, you would expect something even more epic for the finale' right? Well, they give you a pretty good finale'......but it didn't burn the eyes out of my skull like i wanted it to. Was it bad?....No.......but it could have been slightly better in my opinion.<br/><br/>Bottom Line.......they did a great job of making it fit right in with the other Marvel hero's, which is something that i thought to be 'impossible' a few years ago. It promises a good time, and it gave me just that. Some work could have been in the middle and maybe towards the end, but overall i left the theater feeling very satisfied. Thor has easily established himself as a major badass, and this does nothing but build a bigger bridge towards the Avengers. So, in the realm of Marvel superhero movies, where does this one rank? Well, let's break it down........I didn't like it more than ""IronMan"", but i liked it more than ""Incredible Hulk"" and especially ""Wolverine"". I would rank it up there with maybe the first ""Spiderman"", which isn't bad at all. In fact, i liked it more than the first Spiderman....but that's just me. Even if you disagree with me on that front, you still wont be able to deny that it was a pretty damn fun ride."

","At first... when my boyfriends asked me to go to see this movie, both of us though ''I think is just another action, special effects and so on movie, but at least, it'd be entertaining''. Then, our theory broke down... I mean the sightseeing of Asgard it's not just effects, it's WOW! Then the story starts... normally, with a ''supposly to be'' hero, his kingdom, then he's taken to Earth... and you think is just a strange guy on a strange place... but is not just like that. We have a lot of funny things here, the guy is not just ''bad and arrogant and period'', he's more complex, like a person is. This is what a lot of heroes movie don't have. The bad guy is not only bad, and is not only a matter of revenge what takes him out of control. There's a lot of facts that makes him do what he does. CHARACTERS: 7 So... the characters are deeper than any hero character, and they have more than 1 simple and chic-heed explanation to do everything the do, and to feel everything they feel. EFFECTS: 9 So impressive, gorgeous, outstanding...!! I won't spoil it for you... it has no sense if you don't see it... STORYLINE: 7 Quite good for a hero standard movie, deep characters, good fight scenes, action, fluent relation lazes... believable story. Magic and imagination... epic love... tension... MUSIC: 6 It doesn't have enough identity for the movie, but it's really nice, and powerful!! It goes perfectly with the action that is happening!"
"neenahhh","8","0","2","5 May 2011"," Full of thunderous riveting action scenes
","""Thor"" was a great Marvel film. Although not on the same level as ""Spider-Man"", it was still good and highly enjoyable. I wasn't expecting to enjoy this film as much as I had, which was a pretty pleasant experience for me.<br/><br/>Thor is a powerful warrior in the realm of Asgard. He was set to become next in line for King, but was banished from his homeland and was sent to Earth after one of his thoughtless actions.<br/><br/>The plot seems very 'normal' and/or 'cliche' for science-fiction movies, but ""Thor"" proved that even a mediocre and often-used plot could be turned great. The mythological additions to the movie were wonderfully done. It made the film more interesting.<br/><br/>The fighting scenes were all really intense and my eyes were really glued to the screen. I can't even choose a favorite action sequence! They were all just really good. Another great thing about this movie was the humor. Believe me, there are many one-liners that will most likely get you to chuckle.<br/><br/>I loved the twist in the plot, too. I was honestly surprised by it. That was funny because I thought I had the story and the characters all figured out. It turns out that I didn't. (SPOILERS:) It only made me love Loki more. From the beginning, I had this thought that he'd turn out to be the villain (I mean, hello! Dead-like eyes?), and I was right. I wasn't expecting him to be a double-crosser! That was a big, but pleasant, surprise for me. I was sad that he chose to ""die"" in the end. I wanted him to rule the land of Asgard with Thor. Oh well. (/SPOILERS)<br/><br/>I didn't care for the romance that ""Thor"" had. Natalie Portman and the rest of her family didn't actually do anything for this film. Except for add to the humor of the movie. (SPOILERS:) I was glad the movie ended the way it did. Unlike the standard that mythology action-romance films seem to have, where when the god falls in love with a mortal, he gives up his god-like status in the end to be with the girl and etc. I'm so glad that ""Thor"" didn't go down that worn-out road. (/SPOILER)<br/><br/>The only bad thing about this movie was the 3D. While everything did seem to have that 3D effect, the colors were very drained out. It didn't help that the movie already had dark hues to begin with. It was hard to see, especially during the start of the film. But other than that, it was good! Save your money and enjoy this riveting film the classic way: good 'ol 2D style.<br/><br/>Viewed on: May 5, 2011"
"jurandyrsf","8","0","2","4 May 2011"," Mixed Feelings About This Movie
","1) Chris Hemsworth DOES deliver. Perfect performance. Charisma, physical attributes, acting, character immersion. He IS Thor. 10 from start to end.<br/><br/>2) Sir Hopkins is great as usual, but fame and age makes it a bit difficult to forget the actor in favor of Odin. Not his fault, of course.<br/><br/>3) Gorgeous concept and outstanding rendition of Asgaard, the city of Odin and his people, and the heavenly night sky above them.<br/><br/>4) The rainbow passage is used excessively in the movie. It looks like a metro station. This vulgarizes the concept and diverts much of story's focus to the passage and its not-so-reliable Asgaardian guardian. Also, one can't avoid but compare the interplanetary shuttle device to a gigantic, upside down ice cream ball and its cornet.<br/><br/>5) Action on planet Earth pales in time allocation and intensity when compared to those developed on the other worlds. Original Thor comic books are about defending earthlings and Earth against outstanding threats.<br/><br/>6) Compared to Thor, his semi-god friends seem a bit weak...<br/><br/>7) A few scenes are a bit longer or a bit slower than adequate for this movie genre.<br/><br/>8) Finally, Natalie Portman... Plain and clear exploitation of her name and fame. She doesn't look like trying to immerse in her character. She's just Natalie, that's all. Very dull most of the time, very exaggerated in other occasions. Or just poorly directed, or a poorly developed script for her.<br/><br/>9) No! I almost forgot it: What is Rene Russo doing in this movie?playing the mute mom of Thor? Were they two or three lines she said the entire movie?<br/><br/>Notwithstanding the shortcomings, I'll certainly watch this beautiful movie of supernatural wonders in Bluray, or when it becomes syndicated."
"geoff_rowley159","9","0","2","4 May 2011"," Great film. Few Complaints. If you like Iron Man go see Thor!
","As a fan of Marvel Comics I was really looking forward to hear that they were making a Thor movie although the cast and director left me feeling a bit skeptical of the quality of the finished movie.<br/><br/>After watching the film I am pleased to say that even the ""Home & Away"" actor gave a convincing and admirable performance. Loki was perfectly manipulative while Anthony Hopkins fitted the role of Odin extremely well. The visuals were stunning and diverse and the costume design for the Asgardians looked damn cool. The sound effects were also very interesting, especially the beam from the destroyer warrior which really rattled my ears.<br/><br/>All in all I would give this film 10 stars however one thing that bugged me throughout was that Thor was sent to Earth to gain a sense of mortality in order to appreciate the power of the Gods. Although Thor may be a quick learner I found it hard to believe that his whole personality and ideals could change over a couple of days. The lesson was meant to be a challenge and, for the most part, seemed to play no part in most of Thor's time on Earth. Pretty much overnight Thor became worthy enough to wield Mjolnir and return to Asgard. I would of thought the seriousness of Odin's banishment and the hidden lesson within it would have taken a lot longer for Thor to overcome. Also the relationship between Thor and Jane could have been less one sided. Thor only seemed 'interested' just before the kiss...was all the polite talk just Asgardian flirting? Who knows! <br/><br/>Anywhooo the fight scenes were great and seeing the Frost Giants getting a beat down was pretty awesome. This movie gives something back to the fans of the comics as well as the mass audience which is a balance many of the previous superhero films have struggled with (Spider-Man, Hulk(2003)). Since the release of Hulk(2008), Iron Man and Batman Begins, comic book films have really advanced from the lame cheese that was there before (Fantastic Four, Spider-Man 3!!) which is a great step forward. The bonus scenes after the credits are another nice touch although the Thor credit short wasn't as exciting as previous ones. Nevertheless I am still very excited for Captain America and the Avengers and Thor really has just added to the excitement. Go watch!"
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","8","0","2","2 May 2011"," Where *did* this come from?
","Because of his being too headstrong, Thor, the god of thunder, is banished to the worst place imaginable... Earth. He is stripped of his powers, immortality and Mjolnir. And when the mischievous Loki(a surprisingly deep role, and played to perfection with manipulation) learns a secret, more trouble comes his way. The evil Ice Giants of Jotunheim, who have had dealings with the duo's father Odin, are part of it. Perhaps I should make it clear that I'm not a fan of the comics, although I love the Norse myth. It was strange to hear that Branagh was going to make this, and I suppose what happened is really what we should all have realized would. He tried to do it as Shakespeare(hey, if it ain't broke, don't fix it), and some will be surprised to find that it works out really well. The focus is on the family drama between the three aforementioned and the father/son conflict, and it's incredibly easy to relate to. In addition, this is a classic adventure tale, the young, brash boy who has to get by in the outside world before he can return home and claim his father's place. Note that we don't see a lot of the titular deity using his abilities(and thankfully he doesn't don that silly helmet much) in this, and he is mortal for the majority of it. This does a magnificent job of setting up the strength of these beings, and still making us feel scared for them. The action tends to be great(apart from the all-human martial arts, that are awkwardly shot and edited for some reason... maybe to hide the stunt performer, I don't know), if the very best of it is at the very start. You also have to wonder why we see less than a dozen Asgardians... well, no, the answer is of course that they had to juggle the two worlds(and it does well, we never lose track), and ours is the grounding factor. On that note, their realm is indeed awe-inspiring, beautifully animated and captured, and the 3D only adds to the epic scope of it(worth the price of admission in my book). Bifrost is nice, even if it is evidently made from the same material as the sidewalk from Billie Jean. While the love story is not the strongest aspect, it works OK(Hemsworth is sufficiently charming). The acting is fine, with a few standout performances(Hiddle and Hopkins, especially). We get some ""fish out of water"" stuff, and it's adequately balanced to not be annoying. The Marvel-verse cameos are cool. This tries to be funny *a lot*, and thankfully, it does tend to work(it is forced at other times). The script has a few hiccups, and the characters aren't as memorable as they could be. Stay after the credits, for your own sake(if you're at all into these). Since we see it really early on, I can comment on the Destroyer... it's as bland as its name(also, The Day The Earth Stood Still called, it wants Gort back), honestly, you have this cornucopia of fascinating creatures and you come up with a shiny robot with halitosis? All in all, definitely a fun ride, largely satisfying and it works well. I recommend this to anyone who likes the titular ruiner of Summer days, regardless of where you know him from. 8/10"

","I went to see Thor without having read a single critic or even seen a trailer. I went in expecting to see a boring movie but I came out having really enjoyed myself... but then again I am not Norwegian! If you have a very basic knowledge of Scandinavian mythology, then you will probably miss all the twisted parts of the mythology here and you will just enjoy a very enjoyable film for what it is... nicely fast paced, visually impressive and enjoyable.<br/><br/>I suppose I feel about this film like I felt about Percy Jackson... I couldn't enjoy the film because as a Greek I was SO annoyed by all the inaccuracies and twists of a mythology I grew up with and know well. I guess the Norwegian feel the same way...<br/><br/>I gave it a ten because I really liked it! It had everything, action, adventure, romance and a good pinch of comedy, we all laughed quite a few times.<br/><br/>** Here come the spoilers ** Thor, the son of Odin lives with his brother Loki in Asgard and he is to succeed his father to the throne. He is brave but a bit of a hot head so when their biggest enemy, the Frost Giants, find a way into Asgard on his big day, he of course wants to go after them. Odin forbids it but he goes off anyway which earns his banishment...into 2011 Earth!! Stripped of his powers and his beloved Mjolnir, his hammer of the Gods, he must grow as a person first, put others before himself and prove himself if he is ever to be a god again and be allowed to return to Asgard and the throne.<br/><br/>There he meets the sweet and slightly awkward astrophysicist Jane (Portman) and we have quite a few funny scenes and quite a bit of sparks flying off between them. When S.H.I.E.L.D (remember then from Iron Man?) find out about the Mjolnir which is in the desert of New Mexico and nobody can lift it, they take over ... and the fun begins..<br/><br/>Nice story with quite a few twists, likable characters (even if a bit one-dimensional but this is a fantasy fast paced adventure, so we don't care much!), lovely visual effects and big names delivering as expected... and not really too scary even for 10 year olds!!"
"ced_yuen","Null","0","2","30 April 2011"," A good film, although an extended cut would make it great
","The final pieces of Marvel's master plan are falling into place. Developing their key characters one film at a time and sowing the seeds of hype with post-credit teases, Marvel have prepared for 'The Avengers' with military precision. Next up is Thor – lesser known, but no less entertaining.<br/><br/>Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is a prince of the mystical realm of Asgard. He is vain and impetuous, and his actions cause King Odin (Anthony Hopkins) to banish him to Earth to learn the meaning of humility. His jealous brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), next in line to the throne, starts causing trouble in Asgard, and Thor must find a way back before it is too late.<br/><br/>This was always going to be the tricky one. The protagonist is a god, and his story split between Earth and a supernatural realm. 'Thor' avoids the 'Clash Of The Titans' approach of making everything out of light and clouds, instead taking the graphic novels at face value, recreating the source material in all its straight-faced silliness.<br/><br/>There are impractically tall gleaming golden towers, portals to different realms and a bridge made out of rainbows – Asgard may not be realistic but it is beautifully realised. Add to this the warriors of different powers, all clad in armour and capes - and you have more than enough camp epic-ness to rival 'The Lord Of The Rings'.<br/><br/>Despite all its pomp, 'Thor' doesn't really feel like a traditional superhero film. There is no discovery process, no trial and error montage. Most of the time Thor doesn't even have powers. The point of his character is that he is the opposite of the traditional superhero. Thor begins with god-status, but he must learn what it is to be a man.<br/><br/>'Thor' is a Shakespearean tale at heart, with themes of power struggle, sibling rivalry and lessons in morality – making Kenneth Branagh an appropriate choice for director. He tells a very human story about gods, striking a balance between the film's two settings: epic melodrama for the lords of Asgard and endearing naivety for the mortals of Earth.<br/><br/>Thor's adjustment to life on Earth presents huge potential for comedy. Infrequent slapstick is used to great effect, but the main highlight is the fish-out-of-water humour, which is hilarious. Handled with restraint, the comedy is never embarrassing. It is perfect way to frame Thor's development, which is where the film shines.<br/><br/>Chris Hemsworth makes a fantastic Thor. He starts off with a confident swagger, a booming voice, and a cocky smile that shows he's in control. As the movie progresses and he finds humility, he tones it down appropriately. Hemsworth's performance is natural and convincing, genuinely coming across as an arrogant god learning a lesson.<br/><br/>The film's strength in character is let down by the action. There's not enough of it, Thor's hammer is underused, and the set pieces are less epic than you would expect from a god of thunder. There are instances of jaw-dropping spectacle, but the rest is forgettable, poorly shot and poorly edited.<br/><br/>The editing doesn't just dampen a couple of scenes. Too much has been taken out of the film, which makes the development seem somewhat rushed. Some relationships feel a little forced, like the budding romance between Thor and Natalie Portman's character. It feels like when you skip a chapter on a DVD – not disastrous but not complete.<br/><br/>Overall, 'Thor' is everything a comic book movie should be. It is balanced between its fidelity to source material and its accessibility to newcomers, between over-the-top seriousness and light-hearted fun. This is a good film, although an extended cut would make it great."

","I was waiting for this movie for a long time. Had very vague idea about THOR, only read in mythology about him and then knew that there is comic strip about him. So, I was very much excited and eager for this movie.<br/><br/>3D: It was in 3D and that sucks. Most of the close-ups have not 3D effect. I know because I watched half of the movie without the 3D specs! It might be my cinema hall or the movie, but at the same theater I had watched ""Megamind"" which had some average 3D. Thor is bad 3D. Watch it in 2D medium only. Would cost you less and would not have to keep the heavy glass on your nose for 2 hours.<br/><br/>Story: I had a faint idea about story. Its the beginning of Thor,so more explanation and less action. I did not come across one movie which handled a superhero beginning movie with balanced story and action; SpiderMan1 and Batman begins are such perfect movies to name. IN short Thor is long, and story is hurried.<br/><br/>Direction and acting: Well he had nothing to do exceptional. Not much emotional scene. Only one scene of conflict with Loki and Odin, where Odin said nothing and Tom Hiddleston as Loki did good. Natalie Portman...obviously she signed this movie before ""Black Swan"" else she would have never accepted it. Has a hairline role, half of the time she is shouting to SHIELD personnel or her colleagues. Rest of the crew was average, nothing much to do apart from gasping...something landed(Thor)!!!...something landed again(hammer)!!!somethings(Thor's friends) landed again....something(that robot) landed again... see lotsa moments for gasping!!! That too I've not mentioned about when they launch to sky...<br/><br/>Action: I'm disappointed here. A superhero movie to me is full of action and demise of villain. Isn't that the only reason we have superheroes?!!! Am I asking too much? To beat some police personnel we have Statham here who always becomes a baddie and beats the sh1t out of police guys in all his movies. If u bring a hero, give him a worthy opponent, else his greatness is shadowed...<br/><br/>Editing: The length is too much and actions are far between. Should have been short. How long? Well, its 114 min and has less action than ""Iron Man 2"" Dialog: Few witty and funny lines and most of corny and clichéd lines.<br/><br/>Summary: Watch it in 2D and have patience."
