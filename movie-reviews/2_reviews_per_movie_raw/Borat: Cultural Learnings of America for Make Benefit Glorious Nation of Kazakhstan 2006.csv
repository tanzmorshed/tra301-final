","Sacha Baron Cohen comes to America in the guise of Borat Sagdiyev and wreaks his own brand of Kazakhi havoc in this very very funny film.<br/><br/>In our age of uber-political correctness, ""Borat"" comes sweeping through like a brisk and refreshing wind, completely bounding over every cultural taboo we've erected around ourselves. Thus, no one is safe: Borat takes on Jews, blacks, gays, feminists, middle-Americans, religious fanatics, frat boys. The only weapon against the bumbling Borat is a sense of humour, which this movie shows most Americans painfully lack. Indeed, if there is any message to be had from ""Borat"" (and I'm not sure there is much of one, beyond its fascinating cultural experiments), it's that everyone needs to lighten up and not take themselves so seriously.<br/><br/>The image of Americans projected in this film varies from the heartwarming to the downright frightening. New Yorkers threaten Borat with physical violence when he approaches them on a subway. Feminists walk out on him when they find his views on women too much to tolerate. Folks out in the heartland commiserate with him over his hatred of gays and Jews; a gun shop owner even helps him pick out the best weapon for shooting Jewish people. A sweet Jewish couple give him a place to sleep, and bring him a homey meal (that is, before they turn into invading cockroaches). A group of manic Pentecosts help him find Jesus. An RV full of frat boys make complete asses of themselves by espousing their hopelessly ill-informed views on minorities in our country and the need to revert to slavery. The majority of people treat Borat in the condescending way of those who want to think of themselves as being culturally aware without really knowing anything at all about other cultures. These people become rude the second Borat offends their sense of propriety. On the other hand, the disenfranchised of America greet Borat with open arms, and we see a group of gays and a group of blacks interacting with him as if no cultural boundaries existed at all. The film's sweetest (and most unexpectedly so) moments come from Borat's befriending of a black prostitute.<br/><br/>Of course, this is a carefully crafted work of fiction, and Cohen only lets his audience see what he wants them to see. I would probably react much the same as many of the people in this film if this crazy-looking and sounding man appeared out of nowhere and began to antagonize me. But the movie does make Americans look like a bunch of awfully self-important, uptight stiffs, and I've been to enough places in this country and met enough people to realize that the way events play out in this film (even if they are manipulated or staged) probably come very close to the real thing.<br/><br/>Thank God for movies like ""Borat."" If nothing else, they remind us that our cultural boundaries only matter as much as we let them, and that all of the fears that govern political correctness are mostly ungrounded. After all, virtually every person in this film was offended at one point or another, and as far as I can tell, all of them lived to tell about it.<br/><br/>Grade: A"
"rorosuperro","10","114","145","18 June 2007"," Borat: A laugh out loud movie
","Before I go on and recommend EVERYONE to see this movie I want to remind you of one thing. This movie is satire and if you don't understand that then there's absolutely no point in watching.<br/><br/>Much like Spike Lee's ""Bamboozled"" it is made very clear that this movie is a satirical piece. Their lampooning, spoofing, however you want to put it there just kidding around take that in account before you go mad because Borat makes jibes at women and Jews.<br/><br/>Cohen has once again had me in tears with laughter as he examines the American way of life. If you haven't seen any of Cohen's TV material then you will definitely be shocked by what you see.<br/><br/>Cohen manages to create genuine laugh out loud moments. Yes they are often at the expense of others but so what?!? No one was harmed during the making of this movie and if they didn't want to be involved they didn't have to sign the release forms. But beyond the laughter Cohen does hit a political nerve whether you like it or not. The footage of a Texan talking about Gays and immigrants is both humorous and extremely alarming. As is the conversation between three frat boys (who clearly have the social intelligence of a two year old combined). It's a stark realisation to see the backwards world we are still living in.<br/><br/>If satire eludes you then this movie isn't for you but if you can sit back, relax and really take in whats going on and have the cop on to realise that Cohen isn't Borat (Cohen comes from a strict Jewish background) then you will be able to take this movie at face value.<br/><br/>Remember ITS SATIRE! Rent it now and just sit back and enjoy the ride!"
"MichaelMargetis","Null","121","159","23 February 2007"," ""He insist we not fly in case the Jews repeated their attack of 9/11. "" - Borat
","Many people have practically no idea who Sacha Baren Cohen is, besides his small role as the gay French Nascar driver in 'Talladega Nights'. This is because the show he had, Da Ali G Show, was a very unpopular show. Mainly because it was on HBO and late hours of the night. Unfortunately, many people never watched the show not because they didn't like it, but because they didn't know it existed. Da Ali G Show was an incredibly original variety/reality show featuring Cohen in three roles including Borat (whom is the main character of the movie). Cohen, posing as these different characters would interview politicians and such who were unaware the interview was a joke. The reactions Cohen would get out of people including one politician telling him to 'go f*ck himself', were priceless. Going into the one-month early sneak-preview of 'Borat', I was expecting a funny movie, but was skeptical on how funny the movie would be. Usually film adaptations of short five minute skits don't work so well, examples include 'Superstar', 'Night at the Roxbury', 'The Ladies Man' and 'Coneheads'. All are pretty much loser movies with a few funny scenes but not much more. However, when the ending credits started to roll and I walked out of the 'Borat' screening I was sore from laughing so hard. To be honest, I never laughed so hard during a movie in my entire life.<br/><br/>There is not much I can tell you about this without spoiling it for you. Basically the plot is a Kazakhstan news reporter taking a trip to the United States to win the love of Baywatch's Pamela Andersen, whom he thinks is a virgin. HA! All I will tell you is that Borat travels across the country from New York to L.A. doing such crazy stunts as taking a dump in front of the Trump Towers, publicly masturbating in front of a NYC Victoria's Secret store, singing an Anti-American Kazakhstan National Anthem at a rodeo in Nebraska, buying weapons to protect himself against 'the jews' (whom he believes were responsible for 9/11 Terror attacks) and trying to kiss just about every guy he sees, which brings about homophobia in many of the real people featured in the movie who don't know it's a movie. Some may call 'Borat' the funniest film ever made, and that's not and understatement.'Borat' is without a doubt one of the most original and ingenious comedy in the last three years, and maybe, just maybe, the funniest film ever made. Grade: A- (screened at Harkins Arrowhead 18, Glendale, AZ, 9/04/06)"
"kjaney","10","143","196","1 November 2007"," One of the best films I have ever seen
","In terms of pure unadulterated cringe-worthiness, this film just about outshines them all. It is brilliant, horrific, hilarious, sad, outrageous, revealing, and incredibly clever. It shows up people's narrow-mindedness, their racism, their inability to accept or understand different cultures. It makes me scared for the future of the world, and delighted that someone actually sees most people for what they really are - blinkered and uneducated.<br/><br/>Go and rent it, and enjoy. It will make you want to be a better person, make you laugh until you almost cry, and undoubtedly make you hide behind a cushion at times.<br/><br/>Sacha Baron-Cohen is a genius. A definite 10 out of 10."

","how many of us can't take the truth. the viewers who rated this film disgusting and a waste of time choose to not see the forest for the trees. are they as duped as the unsuspecting participants in the film? <br/><br/>that's the problem: too many of us Americans take things at face value. we either don't make time to see the truth or choose to throw their hands up and deny they are part of a culture that in some places still fosters racism and hatred. ultimately, Cohen isn't even targeting Americans. he's targeting cultures past and present, Europeans and Americans alike who feel superior to others. sure- his style is brutal and offensive at times. but so is the truth.<br/><br/>this film is art. it was gut splitting humor as well, but it was relaying a critical message. it's a piece of work that reflects our culture's place in time politically and socially. <br/><br/>if you want a mindless laugh, watch an adam sandler film. they are always sympathetic to the viewer and never evoke too much thought about ourselves."
"epibee","10","218","325","16 June 2007"," Its a classic, if you do not expect a funny movie
","This movie is more deep than it appears to the general crowd expecting a laugh on a Sunday. Most people will go to watch it as a funny movie, but it is not a funny movie in that sense. It is a Satire about how people in many parts of the world still feel about homosexuality, equality of women, need for a woman's consent to a marriage, prostitution as a profession, racism, and so on. It also portrays how even some westerners feel about religion and Jesus. The scene may seriously bother you if you are too much into Jesus (It is supposed to bother you, if you really get it).<br/><br/>People who say this movie is disgusting, just do not get it at all! If this is disgusting, then Charles Chaplin's ""The Great Dictator"" was disgusting, ""because it glorified Adolf Hitler, and expressed hatred against the Jews"".<br/><br/>If you want to feel sad about how stupid, clumsy and ignorant still many people are in the corners of the world, you should watch this movie to open your eyes. But if you are too classy to understand how people live, think and get used to sufferings in backward countries, you may call it ""disgusting"". <br/><br/>Watch it with a true open mind."
"josh-1084","10","35","47","31 October 2007"," Brilliant
","Hysterically funny - and tragic in it's exposing of ignorance and deep seated bigotries. For all of you who cry that America is better than portrayed - grow up and face the fact that ignorance and prejudice live everywhere. More importantly, learn to laugh at it if you are so offended by it. Ignorance is the worst and most dangerous situation for all human beings - it deserves only ridicule and repair. The current chic of political correctness is almost more damaging than ignorance itself. Bigots and fools have been forced back into the closet - and people still do and feel the same awful things while they make sure that the use the politically correct terminology to cover their hypocrisy. Learn to laugh at yourself, and get a life. This movie is funny."

","And I mean the actual definition of ""literally."" I was lucky enough to catch an advanced screening and I wish I could see it 100 more times.<br/><br/>It's hilarious. It's offensive. It's actually pretty smart as well. Sacha Cohen is so ridiculously consistent and never seems to break character, even when he turns an entire rodeo against him in less than 5 minutes.<br/><br/>I really don't want to speak anymore of the film, because part of the beauty of it is being surprised by what you see on the screen. I only hope they don't edit the hell out of it, because it really was a joy to see as it was."
"Flagrant-Baronessa","9","479","821","4 November 2006"," Borat was a terrible film ...NOT!
","Borat proves to be the Python of our generation. <br/><br/>I say this as a die-hard Monty Python fan  not because the humour is on the same level or follows the same guidelines (in fact, the common ground is here is that it follows no guidelines)  but because both comedy teams mask their sketches in a feature film, passing them off as a story when it becomes glaringly clear that the latter is an elaborate pretext under which to have outrageous, absurdist and side-splittingly fun in a series of genius gags.<br/><br/>Yet for all of Borat's subsequent disorganisation and warped narrative, we are first served a gorgeously condensed introduction to our character in his village in Kazakhstan. This segment was possibly the biggest crowd-pleaser in my theatre and perhaps rightly so, for I would call it the film's goldmine in terms of sheer laugh-out-loud humour. Here we are introduced to Borat's sister (""She is number-four prostitute in whole of Kazakhstan.""), whom he kisses on the mouth, his main interests (ping-pong, sunbathing and ""watch ladies make toilet"") as well as a wide variety of hilarious native Kazakhs. Undoubtedly the success of the introduction stems from a combination of novelty and a culture shock.<br/><br/>Once the sprawling surge of Kazakhstani culture subsides, Borat flies to New York City to make a movie-film about the glorious US and A. The booming Russian ethnic score melts into Harry Nilsson's ""Everybody's Talking' At Me"" and the film gets ambitious: it spoofs Jon Voight's incongruous cowboy character walking down Manhattan in Midnight Cowboy (1969). This I found a pleasant surprise, but the referential spoofs end here and the rest is all Sascha Baron Cohen  and we couldn't be happier.<br/><br/>The second half of Borat is arguably less compelling. It is hard to tell why, for the humour remains consistently good and there is an almost exponential stupidity with our Borat character as the sets out to go to California to marry Pamela Anderson. I would not go as far as to say the novelty ""wears off"", but we are a little more settled now and Borat has found his safe footing. Next, however, the film totally floors whatever safeness you may have with one of the most unspeakably graphic hotel room scenes I have ever seen. I won't give anything away, but rest assured that some viewers (*males*) will watch in horrified silence while others will literally cramp up from laughing so violently. I belong more to the latter category.<br/><br/>As Borat travels through America, there is a wealth of juxtapositions to be found when he interacts with the people  members of the white house, television broadcasters, etiquette teachers, Christian fundamentalists and Jews  all offers layered hilarity and a consistent cloud of laughter kept hovering in the air. Sadly, it was not always directed toward Borat (but most of the time) but toward some truly idiotic hick Americans. When I was informed the film used many candid takes, I can only hope the unreasonably creepy Jesus convention was *not* one of them.<br/><br/>In conclusion, ""Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (2006)"" is a towering comedy achievement. It is apparent that Sascha Baron Cohen has done something truly cool here and has created an anti-semitic, misogynist and bigoted character that aptly embodies all racy taboos. As an actor he is unmistakably brave and uninhibited, which makes it easy for the film to lose itself in a tornado of gags, spoofs, bizarre one-liners and graphic jokes. The most fun I've had in a theatre since...forever!!!<br/><br/>9 out of 10"
"mjstellman","7","163","271","3 March 2007"," An Appalling Masterpiece
","The laughter is genuine even when I was appalled at what I was laughing at. Is Sacha Baron Cohen a genius of sorts or the biggest smart ass to hit the screens in a long, very long time? He makes John Waters appear like an (old) Disney product. The nastiness works because it is immediately recognizable and his targets live next door if not with me between my four walls. It is a social-horror-documentary. The three guys talking about women between beer and beer was so horribly real that I wanted to leave the theater laughing and screaming at the same time. Borat is not tender about his own background either. He is an equal opportunity offender if I ever saw one. The world is a cesspool and nobody is immune. Even his innocence is corrupt. I've been considering seeing it again, as the whole thing in one single disgusting lump was too much to take but I'm not sure I want to. I'll wait for the DVD where I'll be able to select and discard. My only question is now, what will Sacha Baron Cohen do for an encore."
"sepej-1","10","34","51","3 November 2007"," Funniest movie ever !!!!
","I have to start out by saying that this is the funniest movie I have ever seen. From the start to the end I was on the floor laughing. I have watched this movie five times already and every time I watch it I am hysterical.He is a great actor to pull off what he did in this movie. I really can't even think if a funniest scene in this movie just because every scene was great. You have to have a good sense of humor to watch this movie.... If not then don't even bother wasting your time. If you think that there is a funnier movie out than this than please let me know I would love to see it.

"Author_Poet_Aberjhani","10","26","38","20 January 2008"," The World through the Eyes of ""Borat"" and Sacha Baron Cohen
","Chances are this poet was pulling double duty when the English comic Sacha Baron Cohen shot footage of his character 'Borat'� in my hometown of Savannah, Georgia. At the time, several years ago, I was completing the ""Encyclopedia of the Harlem Renaissance"" while also serving as a caregiver. What do you suppose Mr. Cohen was busy doing? Basically he was serving up his unique brand of cultural satire by walking fully suited, with cameraman in tow, into a shower room full of totally unclothed Savannah Gnats baseball team members. That particular footage wound up on Cohen's 'Da Ali G Show'� DVD, featuring his portrayal of the wanna-be Jamaican Londoner gangsta rapper: Ali G. Since I missed greeting Cohen when he visited my fair city (as well as Atlanta, Charleston, and other southern venues) writing a review of his outrageously iconoclastic movie, 'BORAT, Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan,'� seems like a southerly hospitable thing to do to make up for it.<br/><br/>As I watched 'BORAT, Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan,'� I squirmed with discomfort, scowled in outrage, and laughed my western civilized butt off. What I didn't understand was why. The answer came later just as I was drifting off to sleep and the following thought popped into my head: Sacha Baron Cohen, as Borat, only appears on the surface to ridicule Women, Jews, and African Americans''and also seems to make light of such serious issues as incest, homophobia, and extreme social retardation. Beneath that hilarious surface he is actually lampooning the real-world bigotry, ignorance, and hypocrisy that pushed the global village into the state of chaos it occupies today. (Please note that Cohen himself is Jewish and often uses his grandmother's praise of his humor as defense for his crude and brazen style of satire.) It is Cohen's gift as a performer that he can project, at the same time, both a relatable sense of vulnerability and an excruciating sense of offensiveness. We can call that genius but we can also call it true to life.<br/><br/>At its ground zero level, this movie is satire of the highest and most deadly kind because it does more than simply exploit subconscious fears and social taboos. It smashes them right in the viewer's face, such as when Borat excuses himself from the dinner table of his genteel white South Carolina hosts only to return with his refuse in a bag. As if that is not enough to freak out this good-old-boy family, he invites a black prostitute (played by the beautiful Luenell) to join them and is promptly evicted from the house along with her.<br/><br/>Or take for an equally scandalous example the now infamous naked wrestling scene with Borat and Azamot (courageously played by Ken Davitian). It would have been enough for most viewers to see the two knock each other out and then watch the movie fade to another scene. But that would have restricted the nude battle royal to the hotel room and our naked clowns would not have been able to literally show their asses in public''as some people tend to do with their clothes on.<br/><br/>Like Monty Python, Peter Sellers, Saturday Night Live alumni, and Richard Pryor before him, Cohen is a master satirist who takes no prisoners. 'Borat'� the character may be an innocent Kazakhstanian abroad in America, but Sacha Baron Cohen the man is clearly a critical observer of humanity intent on exposing the laughable and the painful absurdities of what is supposed to be our civilized technologically-enhanced modern life.<br/><br/>As a writer, one has to admire Cohen's ability to create fascinating characters and build entire movies around them. Borat is only one of three cultural types that he has unleashed utilizing the machinery of Hollywood hype running at full throttle. Although often annoying to the extreme, his Ali G character was appealing enough to help pave the way for the movie Borat to gross some $259 million dollars to date. With that kind of box office power, what's the reaction likely to be when his gay Austrian fashion-critic character of Bruno takes over the big screen? Before answering too quickly, it might be worth considering that Cohen reportedly has already signed a $42.5 million deal with Universal Pictures for the film. Like him or hate him, Cohen has proved himself a committed artist with no intention either of starving or being ignored.<br/><br/>by Aberjhani,author of ""Encyclopedia of the Harlem Renaissance"""
"onefish1976","7","60","99","5 November 2006"," Good offensive content, physical humor...and not much more
","I must make these disclaimers--I may be one of a few people who have never seen Da Ali G, or known much more about Borat than a couple of TV trailers. But I do have a keen sense of taste for offensiveness as well as critical commentary. I can say that this film is great in terms of pure and blatant offensiveness. Fair game is made of all people, ""retards"", blacks, whites, Jews, evangelicals, Southerners...I know I'm forgetting a few others. But, frankly, this approach is nothing new, and is in many ways only a repeat or an extension of comic territory that Sarah Silverman has owned on the stand-up circuit. Admittedly, Cohen delivers well, with explosively offensive and entertaining work.<br/><br/>The plot, while covered by other viewers, is simple and needs little explanation--Borat--the tongue-in-cheek government representative from Kazakhstan, comes to America for the promotion of economic development, and goes along embarrassing himself and everyone he meets. He catches eye of Pamela Anderson on TV, gets smitten, and convinced to marry her, he travels to California to find her--and he does. The rest just has to be seen, as you will see, plot is not critical to understanding or enjoying (or disliking) this movie.<br/><br/>But beyond that, the movie does not deliver any substantive critical commentary, and has an equivalent social value as Jackass (I or II). At points, Cohen extracts ignorant (and sometimes drunken) statements from citizens that are racist, sexist, and so on. Those comments, if anything, do not expose any ""dark underbelly"" of America--they are soundbites from the socially dimmest (or drunkest)...They cast no more light on the underbelly as the Mel Gibson statements to the cops. We already know this is there and I can hardly think that the small bits of reel on these parts give any significantly deep form to this film's ambition.<br/><br/>Instead, you have what you have...an obnoxious and offensive loon acting out. Overall, I was entertained, but because this movie does not really conquer any real new ground other than providing ample male nudity (a rarity here in the States), the movie delivers only some yuks. The collateral damage provoked by this movie really warrants that the movie deliver something more than just laughs. If I were to rate this movie any higher, I would have to rate Jackass a 9 or a 10. Instead, they should be about the same."
"farsi3001","9","336","620","3 February 2006"," Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius
","I, too, caught this early screening in Marina Del Rey. Thought the film was great... the ending could have had more kick to it and been a bit more drawn out, but I was laughing so hard throughout that I barely noticed. Unlike the other comments I read, the nude scenes and the naked wrestling repulsed me. But there were so many other scenes where I felt like I was going to pass out from the pure ridiculousness of it all. Again, Cohen cleverly draws out the ignorance of so many people from the ""U.S. and A."" and we're left shocked, humbled, more aware, and having stomach pains from the hilarity of how he does it. He again proves what people will do for the camera and how people's true colors shine when they meet someone with more radical beliefs than their own. I left the theater saying ""wow wow wee waaaaa""!!!"

"DonFishies","7","85","152","25 March 2007"," Totally imperfect, but packing one of the best character performances ever
","For months, I could not go anywhere, see or read anything without hearing something about Borat: Cultural Learnings of American for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan. It was being hailed as groundbreaking, and hilarious beyond anyone's wildest dreams. Everyone I knew wanted to see it, and I just stood back and could not understand what the big fuss was about. Yeah, it looked fairly amusing, but nothing more than that. Sacha Baron Cohen's Da Ali G Show never impressed me when I watched random episodes, so I was not in belief that this film would.<br/><br/>But with all of the hype, it made me want to see it opening weekend. Unfortunately, I never managed to. I caught it a few weeks later without the benefit of a huge audience watching it with me. And for the most part, I think my original assumption was correct.<br/><br/>Basically for the two people who have zero clue what the movie is about (despite it now being on DVD), Borat Sagdiyev (Cohen) is a Kazak journalist sent to the United States to observe the American way of life. He brings his TV crew with him every step of the way, and begins to explore the country. But because of his origin, he is outrageously obnoxious in his behaviour. But for some reason, it only becomes more tolerated as he continues on, allowing for many surprising responses from the people he comes across.<br/><br/>The satirical idea for the film is simply brilliant. The character of Borat is racist, misogynist, raunchy, and just downright vile in the way he acts. And the Americans he talks to either do not realize what is going on, or actually agree with him. The tour he takes across the United States involves a plethora of random, everyday citizens being duped in this fashion. The fact that the film was marketed so well in the US, and then further made millions, attests to the idea that this may just be the greatest practical joke every played.<br/><br/>But unfortunately, it is a one-note joke. The film loses steam after thirty minutes, and can barely pick up afterwards. It strikes a pretty solid barrier, and just cannot recover no matter how hard it tries. Yes, the proceeding minutes had their share of laughs and shocks, but nowhere near as much as the first little bit. It just sets itself up far too well, and fails to live up to its original design. Its nifty idea and execution really should have told people from the start that it would not work for a ninety minute long film, but I guess they had more faith in the picture than I did.<br/><br/>Another upsetting thing about the film was the grand amount of preplanning. It was continually being sold to the audience as being spur-of-the-moment, and very uncoordinated. But as the film progresses, you can tell that some moments are actually being filmed this way, and that some reek of being rehearsed. It takes away from the satire the film had built up for itself, and really brings down the genuine enjoyment for the film. I know it had barely anywhere to go from the start, but making it almost so that it was written unnaturally before hand, just takes away from the genuine impact that the film has. The fact that the writing was nominated at the Oscars also does an effective amount of damage to the final moments of the film, which otherwise would have been drop dead funny instead of just amusing.<br/><br/>The film-making techniques on the other hand, are just magical. You really get a sense of the gritty and grungy documentary look the filmmakers wanted from the minute the film starts, right up until its finale. The hand-held camera works beautifully in every sequence, and the very personal diary feel that the film gains during the second act works very well. Just trying to keep up with Cohen in certain scenes seemed to have been a test of endurance on its own. The film is very low budget, and it shows in how unique the film looks. If it had not been so heavily publicized, I think I actually would have had trouble deferring whether or not it was an actual documentary if I saw it while flipping through TV channels.<br/><br/>There are no proper words to describe Cohen and his schtick. It really is a sight to marvel all on its own. His dedication and perfection in this role is nearly unheralded in my mind. He goes beyond transcending himself into the character. Every moral fibre of this character is ingrained in Cohen's performance. You do not see Cohen, and you do not see an actor. You see a rude and ignorant Kazak journalist. He never lets up for a second, and is always acting in character. This fictional character is brought to life with so much energy, that he actually forms into a real life person. The line between reality and fiction is just so thin here, that it really begs the question of how far an actor will go for his character. And he is absolutely hysterical to watch.<br/><br/>Ken Davitian, who plays Borat's producer and sidekick Azamat, is also very good in his performance. He is almost always watching, and is so subtle. He never breaks a smile, and he is just so serious that he complements how perfect Cohen's character is. He is obviously not as strong an actor (and is barely understandable), but his valiant efforts do go rewarded.<br/><br/>Even with its flaws, Borat is an experience everyone should take. Some may find it funnier than others, and some may not find it funny at all. There is a bit of a middle ground, but not much. And in the process of watching, everyone will be able to marvel at one of the greatest character performances ever committed to celluloid.<br/><br/>7.5/10."

"Boba_Fett1138","7","75","136","19 March 2007"," America through the eyes of a Kazakh.
","This movie was probably most and the highest criticized from Kazahkstan itself. Unrigthfully so. The movie doesn't make fun of Kazahkstan, it makes fun of Americans, in a criticizing way. Kazahkstan is merely used as a platform to show the (of course exaggerated) contrasts between the advanced and 'civilized' America and the simplistic Kazakhstan and how a simplistic man, from such a simplistic place, such as Borat Sagdiyev (Sacha Baron Cohen) is capable of pinching right through the advanced and civilized Americans and puts his finger right on the spot. The movie is about Borat learning from America and Americans. for the benefits of his country Kazakhstan but the question raises; Shouldn't America and Americans also learn from simplistic countries such as Kazakhstan, for their own good and benefits?<br/><br/>Just like in Michael Moore movies often is the case, Borat knows to put his finger on the right place and manages to show America how it really is. An uptight, patriotic, homophobic, God fearing, anti-social country, in which minorities still have a hard time and not all rights are considered equal to some. It's funny, in the interviews it often is not Borat who says the most offensive things, it are the interviewees who do so, such as the rodeo-guy and the frat boys.<br/><br/>But no, the movie is not all criticism. For most part it's just a fun and often also hilarious people about making fun of ignorant people.<br/><br/>In all honesty it's hard to tell how much of the movie was actually improvised and how much of it was real. Obviously some sequences were scripted such as all the scene's in Kazakhstan and some other sequences will make you really doubt. Some of obviously planned the camera-positions are often too coincidental and also the fact that the movie had an actual professional director attached to it, makes you really wonder. It also is hard to imaging that all those people actually took this silly talking and looking character so seriously as they did in this movie all the time. When a person who wears his underwear above his pants and is talking slang is entering your hotel with a camera-crew following him, wouldn't you crack up, realizing that this just can't be for real? The movie is also edited in such a way that the emotions and reactions get exaggerated. It's also are the reasons why you can't really call this movie a fake documentary or mockumentary.<br/><br/>What I loved about the ""Da Ali G Show"", in which Borat often made an appearance, was that it was improvised, real, often had no point and was all about the responses of the other person on the Sacha Baron Cohen characters. It was fun to see the peoples reactions and how they did respond to the character and its outrageous and often also offensive questions. This movie is overwritten in my opinion. The movie has a main plot line in in, in which Borat falls for non other than Pamela Anderson and makes it his personal mission to find her and marry her. In my opinion the improvising way of traveling through the USA and meeting and interviewing people would had worked way better, in both terms of criticism and humor. Now some parts in the movie feel planned and acted, which is definitely not Borat's strongest point. It also again raises the question of how much of the movie is actually improvised and how much of it was planned, though I definitely believe that most of the interviews and Borat with other people were for real. Ironic, since it was the screenplay that was actually being nominated for an Academy Award.<br/><br/>But all this criticism aside, this is a very fun and also often hilarious movie to watch. Some of the situations Borat gets himself into are priceless and the reactions from the ignorant persons are even more hilarious. They often don't know how to cope with this odd talking and looking character from the far away and insignificant country of Kazakhstan.<br/><br/>There are a couple of especially memorable sequences, such as when Borat and Azamat wrestle naked in their hotel room, after Azamat's 'hand-feast' and then start running naked through the hotel, elevators and eventually ending up wrestling naked in a convention room with hundreds of people in it. There are a couple of more hilarious and memorable sequences but no one really matches up to that moment, that totally catches you completely off guard.<br/><br/>It's all fast paced, which makes sure that you'll probably laugh your way non-stop trough this movie.<br/><br/>A perfectly fun and amusing movie that also has some striking criticism, that could had used some less story and perhaps should had been more like the show.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","R for pervasive, strong, crude and sexual content, including graphic nudity, and language.<br/><br/>With his wide-eyed, pasted-on grin, thick mustache and loping Groucho Marx gait, Borat is a profane innocent with a will of steel, as earnest as he is devious, someone who is so much a product of his stridently politically incorrect culture that his actions are intended to make us question aspects of our own.<br/><br/>I was very disappointed with the movie. I had a few laughs, but it was not worth the money and i would never watch it again. I like him better just on ""T.V."".<br/><br/>Most of ""Borat"" involves the man's journey to ""the U.S. and A."" with his producer, Azamat Bagatov (Ken Davitian).

Entertaining at times, but growing old quickly. There's nothing groundbreaking here.<br/><br/>You don't ""challenge"" political correctness by making fun of rednecks and Christians. Southerners, republicans, and Christianity have always been perfectly acceptable targets. The only thing in this movie that might offend the tolerance police is the scene depicting Kazakhstan. Borat's phony racism and misogyny are obviously just tools used to get reactions from his victims.<br/><br/>One could travel across any region as big as the United States and find loads of ignorant morons, especially when you get to cherry pick the worst. The world is full of idiots--soccer hooligans in England, rampaging neo-Nazis in Germany, extremists who think drawing a cartoon picture of Mohammed warrants the death penalty.

Calling Jews cockroaches and monsters that lay eggs, and making fun of rape victims. Showing some naked obese guy humping Borat's face, and showing a close up of his sons dick, is taking it too far. This was a waste of film. If this had been rated higher it would have made more sense, but it was 14A, so little kids can see this. i know some people for whatever reason thought this was great, and will probably reply by telling me I'm taking it too seriously, but i think parents should be warned before they let their kids watch this."

"Danusha_Goska","1","570","1153","5 November 2006"," Honk If You Hated Borat
","Sacha Baron Cohen's film ""Borat"" is being used as a litmus test. If you like the film, you are hip, cool, and part of the new in-crowd immune to the silly dictates of common decency and Political Correctness.<br/><br/>If you don't like ""Borat,"" you are an old fuddy-duddy or spinster schoolmarm.<br/><br/>I laugh at dead baby jokes. I was a nurse's aid and then a Peace Corps volunteer, and I learned to laugh at death, bodily fluids, pus-filled sores, and intestinal parasites.<br/><br/>I cannot tell you how much I hated ""Borat."" I would have walked out, but I had to keep watching because of my field of study.<br/><br/>Based on reviews, I expected a penetrating, edgy critique of Political Correctness that would make me laugh out loud. I did not laugh once. (Full disclosure: others in the theater did.) I'd like to offer you samples of what passes for humor in ""Borat,"" but if I did so, this site would not run my review. That's because just about every joke - - not just some of them but just about every one - - is made at the intrusively graphic expense of women or homosexuals, and/or it involves bodily excretions.<br/><br/>An example. Baron Cohen is a guest at the home of a genuinely charming woman. After defecating, he hands her his fecal matter. That's a big joke. If you are laughing now, this movie is for you.<br/><br/>In another scene, Baron Cohen, without any clothing on at all, wrestles with another undressed man who is grotesquely obese. During this wrestling match, they assume poses for activities I can't name; if I did, this site would not run this review. If jokes at the expense of fat homosexual men are your cup of tea, this movie is for you.<br/><br/>I've never seen such a hateful movie in a mainstream theater. Again, I know full well that I sound like a schoolmarm when I say that. Sacha Baron Cohen, I would have to guess, based on this movie, hates the human race, including you, the ticket buyer. He is willing to exploit everyone he encounters, to humiliate them on camera, to get you, the ticket buyer, someone he also hates, to laugh at others' suffering. Once you do that, he can laugh at you. If watching decent people doing their best to deal with an obnoxious creep is your cup of tea, then this movie is for you.<br/><br/>I feel like repeating over and over: I laughed at Todd Solondz's ""Happiness."" I laugh at politically incorrect humor. And I hated this movie.<br/><br/>There's more going on here, and I know I'm risking a lot by pointing this out.<br/><br/>Borat speaks Polish. Only speakers of Polish will get that. He says ""Dzien Dobry,"" ""jak sie masz,"" ""dziekuje"" and other Polish phrases. The film's opening and closing scenes were shot in a real Eastern European village. Real Eastern European folk music is played on the soundtrack.<br/><br/>With ""Ali G,"" Baron Cohen exploited vicious stereotypes of Blacks. With ""Borat"" Baron Cohen is not targeting Kazaks. He's exploiting a centuries-old, contemptuous and hateful stereotype of Eastern European peasants that can be found in various Western cultures - witness the American ""Polak joke"" - - and is common in one thread of Jewish culture. In this stereotype, Poles, and, by extension, Eastern European Christian peasants, are, like Borat, ignorant, bestial, and disgusting. A good précis of the stereotype can be found in a famous passage in Isaac Bashevis Singer's ""The Slave."" It can be found in the ""Golem"" article on my website.<br/><br/>In fact, ""Borat"" has a lot in common with Marian Marzynski's controversial film ""Shtetl."" In both, cameras invade an impoverished Eastern European peasant village. Villagers who are not sophisticated or worldly are conned into appearing on camera to perform for us as if they were trained monkeys. We laugh at them, or feel disgust at them, because they are dirty, because they are poor, and because they keep pigs. In any case, gazing at these lesser peasants, we know that we are superior. Perhaps Baron Cohen will try this technique next in a Darfur refugee camp or a homeless shelter. Poor, unsophisticated people can be so amusing.<br/><br/>Baron Cohen speaks of women as if they were less than dirt. Don't misunderstand him. He's not mocking misogyny. He's milking misogyny. The things Baron Cohen says about women in this movie are grotesque; they are brutal. He makes fun of mentally retarded people. He makes fun of white, Christian Southerners, a group everyone feels safe mocking.<br/><br/>Reviews, and no doubt many viewers, are telling you that ""Borat"" is a fearless laugh riot that punctures political correctness and makes you laugh till you cry. It's that very description that made me want to see it. I thought I'd be getting something like the Colbert Report.<br/><br/>I've gotta think I'm not the only one, though, who found looking at Baron Cohen's hatred for an hour and a half to be an icky, profoundly unfunny experience."

","Take all your expectations about what is crude here in America and quadruple it. Prepare yourself for scenes of naked men wrestling each other into suggestive pornographic positions. In short, the 3 or 4 genuinely funny scenes in this movie aren't worth the other disturbing parts.<br/><br/>During the movie Borat asks what is appropriate and funny here in America. I think we must ask the same question. Is seeing Borat show off a family photo of his teenage son's penis really funny? Or does his advice to the town rapist about ""sticking to humans only"" really merit a laugh?<br/><br/>The audience left the theater dismayed. And my last thought wasn't about a particularly humorous scene but rather about whether this movie was really funny at all. <br/><br/>I HIGHLY don't recommend this movie! Don't waste your time, money or energy on this one.<br/><br/>The most surprising thing about that film is that it was only rated R. The MPAA website defines an NC-17 rating as one that ""most parents would consider too strong in inexcessive violence, sex, aberrational behavior, drug abuse or any other elements and therefore off- limits for viewing by their children."" What parent would take their kids to this movie?!? I certainly didn't see anyone bring their children unless they're children were adults. What keeps this movie from being called pornographic is no doubt the legal process that's required."
"T-Rex-2001","7","28","46","26 February 2007"," Borat ... funny
","I saw this movie on DVD. All I can say is that it was very funny. Sacha Baron Cohen deserves some sort of acting award, because many of the scenes were done live, no rehearsal, no script, and Cohen stays perfectly in character throughout. His sense of comedy and timing is very good. I won't divulge many details because that might lessen the fun.<br/><br/>Yes, it is a little mean-spirited at times. The insulting of a pastor's wife is discomfiting. But most of the time what we are watching is Borat the boob and the hilariously incorrect things that he does. It reminded me of ""National Lampoon's Vacation,"" with Chevy Chase. Borat is the same kind of clown, who always manages to say the wrong thing at the wrong time to the wrong people. There are a lot of decent laughs in the movie and a few for which Borat should be spanked.<br/><br/>I would recommend buying the DVD if you've got some money to spare."

","While even I have to admit there were moments where I laughed out loud at the idiocy of some of the people ""Borat"" meets in his cross-country journey, this movie was just too much. It goes too far, is too crass, and while the idea is beautifully crafted politically, it loses its focus. You will surely enjoy his portrayal of the idiotic American (everything from bigot hick to religious fanatic to drunken frat boy), but the ""glorious nation of Kazakhstan"" doesn't stop there. I could even put up with the defamation of our National Anthem and the constant barrage of sexual situations, but it goes even further than that! I don't consider myself a prude when it comes to movies, but I'm warning you now, Borat will have you leaving the theater in discomfort and confused as to where your 9 dollars went. The racist and sexist stuff I can take with a grain of salt, but it was the excessive (and pointless: the movie could have been terrific without it) nudity that finally pushed it over the top for me.

It attempts in a very childish way to extract some laughs, that's all. Any 7 year old can make fun of people this way.<br/><br/>I cannot comprehend why the North American public likes this low and childish humor, other than to think that most regular citizen born on this continent live within some boundaries and clichés that make them narrow minded. Perhaps the people in this society that collectively attributed such a high rating to this movie have not been exposed enough to hardship and tragedy in order to be able to use real humor to laugh at itself other than using gross jokes.<br/><br/>I was upset, angry and frustrated after seeing this movie and I profoundly regret every penny I spent on the ticket and if there was any way to recover them I would be first in line.

","Many would probably agree... this film has the potential to either be amazing or absolutely awful. Last night I attended the first ever screening in Marina Del Ray. ""Borat"" is not only the hardest I've laughed in a theater since ""Wedding Crashers"", it may be the hardest I've laughed EVER. It it expertly handled, fusing fiction with non fiction and constantly testing the boundaries of taste and decency in the best, most socially revealing ways. In many ways, it is like a meeting of ""Breaking The Waves"" and ""Jackass"". It uses confrontational non-fiction set ups to create massive discomfort, and in the process, revealing both the light and dark of it's subjects. <br/><br/>In fact, I found myself having a tough time labeling it. Although it is a definite step in the direction of ""Jackass"", it holds some of the same relevance as a Michael Moore documentary. Sasha Baren Cohen tears us apart with laughs, and in doing so, holds a mirror up to America in ways twice as revealing as any Michael Moore voice over ever could.<br/><br/>This film, if Fox has the guts to really give it the push it deserves, could signal a dramatic shift and appeal to a very wide 20-30 yr old, left wing, educated demographic.<br/><br/>This film is truly an incredible thing to witness.

A few of the attempts at humor were based on a ""look at the unattractive naked people"" approach, but most was more of a ""I said something that's meant to be very offensive. Isn't it funny?"" technique or a ""Watch me make these people uncomfortable"" approach. I'm pretty difficult to offend, and I can't say that any of the movie really offended me. It was far too stupid to be offensive. The problem was that the movie just didn't entertain me at all. I held out hope that at some point, we'd get to see someone snap and really go after Borat/Cohen.

I hope the final version includes the racier scenes and the MPAA doesn't pressure them to edit it (but they would surely be included on the DVD release). Basically it is a two hour journey following Borat across the U.S while he meets and greets all sorts of characters along the way. I don't want to give anything away but it manages to capture the hilarity of Borat from Da Ali G Show and hold it for the entire film. I was worried before I saw it because movies have a way of destroying all expectations brought forth from another medium but this film lives up to the challenge. Anyone who is a fan of the show will find themselves on the edge of their seats, trying not to spray urine on those close to them.

Seeing an actual amputee in a poor Romanian Gypsy village with a gay rubber fist taped to his forearm - has exactly the same humor, as making a joke of the starving people of Nigeria.<br/><br/>What we see in this film is that Cohen shows how much he hates Eastern Europeans, including Polish people, Romanians, Gypsies, and how much he hates Southern people, republicans, and Christianity, and virtually all American people. Only two positive characters exist in the film: the two orthodox Jews in the bread&breakfast scene. Cohen defended Borat as being a satire of how ignorant Americans are of other countries and their cultures, and even don't know where Kazakhstan is. I think this film is only shows how that he is very ignorant for all other cultures, including the American culture.<br/><br/>What we see in this film, is the orthodox Jewish hatred, and Jewish racism. He thinks that he is superior, and while he hates every nation, he wants to condemn others, who don't like him. Furthermore he cannot demonstrate, or prove anything that he wants. In the gun shop for example it is just Cohen, who speaks loudly about killing the Jews, while the salesman doesn't say anything. Who were so daring to comment anything when a madman is shouting in the gun shop, about killing somebody in the presence of some cameras? The hatred is in Cohen's mind."

It got cheep laughs by tricking real people into embarrassing situations and didn't show any real film-making skill.<br/><br/>The film always chose to get the easy laugh rather than try to say something meaningful or help the viewer to see the world from the perspective of another person. It was pure exploitation and its unfortunate that others will try to copy its formula before we all get sick of this kind of film-making. Comedy can be a powerful tool for good, but this film probably left most people feeling guilty they contributed to its huge economic success and probably assured a sequel.<br/><br/>We would only see a film like this in a free speech world, but it takes the right to make a movie like this as more important than the value of a movie like this. Sasha should be ashamed of himself for creating a film that so clearly is based on hate of every culture including his own.

It's not a subtle humour, it's a ""ha-ha-ha""-kind of humour. Some of my favourites: the social behaviour trainer, the feminist group, the car salesman, the rodeo ride; The victims of his jokes are the ethnic and social minorities, who have to fight hard against prejudices in every day life. There has been kind of a big controversy going on, when ""Borat"" first hit the screens. The question is: Does Sacha Baron Cohen really uncover prejudices and moral double standards in the people he talks to, or is he only using and treating them the same way he seems to be criticizing, the treatment of the ""uncivilized"" by the seemingly ""civilized and intelligent""?

","I watched this movie for two reasons: 1) I was on a movie watching spree and when I arrived at Loews this Friday, it was the only movie I hadn't seen AND 2) Everybody seemed to think it was a great movie. It was rated in the top 150 on IMDb at one point. The trailers looked completely idiotic and senseless. I knew I was going to watch it to figure out what the hype was all about but I was delaying the inevitable. The lack of new releases on Friday night did it for me and I bought a ticket to Borat. My intuition was absolutely right. Borat is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. I was watching it with two of my good friends, one of whom I literally forced in. The other was genuinely excited to see the movie. When we left the movie theater, not only did we share our dislike of the movie, we were also left wondering how anyone who left the theater with us could have possibly enjoyed this movie. Granted the movie did have some funny moments, but nothing made me or anyone around me crack up. This could be due to the ever present disgust that accompanied the Borat humor. I don't see how people can find two completely naked guys wrestling for 10 minutes straight funny. Mentally scarring is a better way to describe such 'humor'."

That is all that can be said positively about this movie.<br/><br/>I find movies like Super Troopers, and even deliberate gross-out movies like Date Movie, quite funny. This, however, was so patently offensive, I only stayed because I refuse to walk out on any movie. The nudity was bad enough, but the unrelenting mediocrity and lack of style was far worse. Perhaps you have to see the show first, but I simply found it to be awful.<br/><br/>If it was meant to be a social commentary, it is an incredibly crude one - intelligent analysis should be the standard, not shock value. If it was supposed to be a comedy, it was still a failure - deadpan delivery works for a short time, but if used continuously, it loses the ability to surprise.

Hopefully you will find it funny even if you aren't. Tonight was the first public screening and the majority of the packed audience seemed to eat it up. I haven't laughed like that in a movie for quite some time. It is extremely crude with multiple full frontal male nudity shots which add to the humor of the film. I don't mean to say that it is inappropriate though. Those who take it for what it is will find it absolutely hilarious. I was surprised that so much antisemitism was included since it was a feature film. If a person didn't know that he is Jewish in real life I'm sure they would be truly offended. As for the format of the film, it is a blend between narrative and real footage. However it's very difficult to tell which parts are real and which are not and I will be very curious to find out if several of the bits were real or staged. There were times when I thought that I was watching something real and unscripted only for something to happen that seemed all too convenient for fitting into the plot thus prompting my curiosity.

","Being a huge Borat fan, I went into the cinema with the highest of expectations. I was actually expecting to be let down by this feature film, but luckily Cohen kept the repetitions from his TV show on a very short leash - even avid admirers of his stunts will have a hard time not laughing, as he easily tops his previous endearments. As a matter of fact, the first hour is a non-stop laugh-fest: I have yet to see another movie that manages to blend slapstick & toilet humor as well as social criticism of the more degenerated states of America into a funny experience as this. Given, this movie doesn't even try to be PC, and part of the German audience was wincing during some of the stronger anti-Jewish jokes. But Borat, being Jewish himself, has no trouble at all with that - he generally just seems to promenade through the inadequacies and embarrassments of the North American societies. I cannot imagine the person that does not find this movie funny. I would go as far as to declare anyone not laughing at least thrice during the first half hour of the movie devoid of any humour.

"oneloveall","7","19","31","22 February 2007"," Excellent synthesis of controversial character is nevertheless starting to show wear and tear
","Although worthy of nearly all the praise it has received, I must still confess that a torrential downpour of critical and public applause garnered with Borat's feature film debut left me asking where all the actual belly laughs were. Granted, being a fan of Sacha Baron Cohen's earlier HBO show does not help, as so much of the material Cohen uses, while admirably delivered and always uncomfortably topical, often recycles itself, usually to a point that fans of the comedic giant's past work would immediately recognize many of the lines uttered throughout this depraved travelogue.<br/><br/>What separates the film incarnation from so many well delivered Ali G episodes does however justify a distinct appreciation. The well executed method finds loosely scripted, fictionalized plot setup running side-by-side with real world outings in which our Kazakh hero traverses the American landscape, brutally and unabashedly holding up reflections of ignorance for a general viewing public to revel in. These shocking, tension filled improvisational spats Borat engages in with all facets of the American public make for the most substantial segments, although in all honesty I was hoping for more subtle awkwardness then brash vulgarity. For too much of the films brief length, Cohen tries to shock viewers into contributing to the whirlwind of controversy the movie became, and by and large the excessive graphic nudity detracted from the flights of brilliance; what could have became one of modern film's most offbeat and unusual fight scenes became a cheap and blatant attempt at gross out theatrics.<br/><br/>Though the pseudo-documentary may play the cheap cards a little too often considering Mr. Cohen's immense comedic talent, the foolish emotional arc that drove this tiny plot added a needed angle to Borat's film incarnation, helping flesh out much of the one-dimensionality. Strict fans may be a little disappointed with constant references from previous jokes, but the rest of the nation should continue to echo the praise this movie has garnered for being one of the most daring, relevant comedies to challenge society in years."

Halfway through I found myself looking at my watch, wishing I would have spent my $10 and two hours on something, anything (well, almost!) else. ""Borat"" is the same joke over and over and over again -- the same set-up with slightly different people. Yes, Mr. Cohen, I see how Americans can be racist, sexist, ignorant, homophobic ""ass hole."" I see how by pretending to be an anti-semitic, naive, uneducated reporter from a backwards country whose name most Americans can't even pronounce, you induce your interview subjects to reveal their own prejudices.<br/><br/>So what?<br/><br/>The fact is, I've seen this done many times before -- to much greater effect and without the blatant mean-spiritedness demonstrated in almost every frame of the film. Mel Brooks' ""Blazing Saddles,"" Steve Martin's ""The Jerk,"" almost any Monty Python flick, and the real documentaries ""Bowling for Columbine"" and ""Roger & Me"" -- all of these comedies attack the same serious social issues with blunt-force trauma. All of them ""make fun"" of prejudice, thereby forcing the audience to recognize their own prejudices. All of the above-mentioned films artfully and interestingly expose the underbelly of American society. Borat, however, is a second-rate Latka from ""Taxi"" -- an unfunny, repetitive Tony Clifton with a funny accent. We've seen it before, Mr. Cohen, and we've seen it better. If you're going to tackle such important subject matter, have something interesting to say about the subject."
"Chrysanthepop","Null","8","11","12 December 2008"," A Funny American Adventure But Poor Kazakhstan!
","'Borat' is both a comical and offensive movie that tackles the 'American' way of thinking with a touch of humour. The title character's take on pretty much every sensitive issue such as Judaism, homosexuality, feminism, prostitution, racism, fanaticism and ignorance. The film balances its portrayal of Americans quite well: There are the kind hearted who treat Borat with kindness (The Jewish Couple), there are those who threaten to use violence when he attempts to hug them (The New Yorkers), those who look down upon him (The Texans), those who in a split second turn against him (the rednecks)... But, Borat's interaction is conducted with a sense of comedy. The humour is crude, explicit, disgusting and even brutal at times but there are a number of sequences that had me laughing out loud such as Borat's experience with the 'gypsy', the feminist group, the well-meaning Jewish couple, the bear... The Borat-Luenell track is among the sweetest moments. I think what the film tries to remind us is that people should lighten up and not take everything too seriously. While I enjoyed most of the American adventure, I did not like how poor Kazakhstan was 'torn to shreds'. A make-belief country could have easily been done with instead of having to offend an already existing country. As stated earlier, some of the 'comic' tracks are a bit too far fetched till the point of being revolting like the hotel nude fight between Borat and Azmat. Thus, this brings the film down a notch in my view."

Good humor would rather see some jackass getting the blunt end of Borat's disgusting habits (crap in a bag and bring it to the table) rather than a church pastor.<br/><br/>As a resolve to the movie, they show Borat's country executing a Jew on the cross and poking him like they did in Jesus' crucifixion. What sort of movie resolves with a distasteful hatred against anyone? So what if the Arab nations hate Israel, movies shouldn't be horribly stereotypical, much less visually show it.<br/><br/>All of the trailers are very misleading. I imagined this movie was full of slapstick and situational comedy, but to play on racism, sexism, stereotypes of the church, and a bad taste in who participates in the situations was absolutely terrible. This is not worth true comedy's time."

The scenes between the 2 men was disgusting as it went on for a few minutes. The plot with Pamela Anderson was stupid as were all the sexual references. Any moments of genuine humor were forgotten as viewers were forced to watch and listen to things that seemed more pornographic than R rated. It's easy to see why Kazahks were offended by Cohen portraying them as boorish, sex-crazed idiots. <br/><br/>Very disappointing and I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who still has a sense of moral decency.

I've been reading sites such as rottentomatoes.com and IMDb.com (especially IMDb) for many years, and i have yet to find anything disturbing enough to get me to actually make a comment, until now. There are many movies which seem to please a great many people that simply strike me as being, well, bad. Most people aren't very smart and don't know good writing when they see it, so how could they notice bad writing? But seriously, it seems as though people have reached an all-time low with Borat. It's genuinely depressing. Others have already pretty much captured the essence of its awfulness. I only wanted to let others know that there is at least one more person who realizes how awful this movie is. It appeals to what could only be described as degenerates.<br/><br/>Studios have identified the lowest common denominator and are ultimately in it for the money, so it looks as though things are only going to be getting worse. One only has to look at the other movies that have come out recently to see that this is true. Case in point: Casino Royale. Easily the worst bond yet. But look at the ratings? And a movie that came out recently that is actually quite the reverse of these titles, ""stranger than fiction,"" being both intelligent AND inspired, receives generally poor ratings. <br/><br/>Proof that we are devolving."

","Ever wonder why Paris Hilton is famous? Has she ever done anything meaningful with her life? Is she brilliant and talented? Is she funny or principled? Is she even modestly attractive? The answer is of course, no, on all counts. But Hilton is famous because somewhere, at sometime, some idiot in a PR firm created the image of Paris Hilton, Hollywood skank and party girl. Like Hilton, Borat is an embarrassing monstrosity of a movie (the worst I've seen in MANY YEARS) that has gained in popularity not because it is good, has a message, or is even slightly funny, but simply because it caters to the lowest common denominator- idiot teenagers. I have never walked out on a movie before in my life, even after seeing some true garbage, but I finally did in Borat (with about 20 minutes to go in the movie). Anyone who finds this mindless, tasteless, low brow, stinking, festering, corrupt, and offensive drivel funny really needs to seek the aid of a professional psychologist. Now, to be fair there are about 15-20 minutes of MILDLY humorous bits in the movie. The rest of the movie is just scatological and homoerotic gibberish devoid of any real meaning or message. One reason I went to see this rubbish was its billing as a political satire  well, it's not in any way, shape or form. The political messages, where they exist at all, are obvious and clumsily handled (for example, the war of terror bit at the rodeo). The movie is totally devoid of social satire, mistaking mean spirited and deceptive pranks for insight into the human condition. The movie is often blatantly offensive, racist, and just plain stupid. Finally, though rated R, this film really needs an NC17 rating- the MPAA must have been asleep at the screening of the movie and any producers out there that have the NC17 label slapped on their movie should be able to point to this train wreck as a prime example of how their rating system is fundamentally flawed. Especially egregious are the close-up photographs of the genitals of an (apparently) under aged male (ha!, that's so funny!). Finally, I'd like to close with saying that Larry Charles and Sacha Cohen are talent less hacks and dolts. With any luck at all these two blathering idiots will sink into total oblivion never to be heard from again to the betterment of the world as a whole (and take their mindless fans with them)."
"bob the moo","Null","20","36","23 November 2006"," It is funny but lets not pretend it is clever or has any wider social importance than providing some laughs
","In Kazakhstan one of the leading television personalities is reporter Borat Sagdiyev, who has covered the leading events in his wonderful country. However with many backward ways in their land, the Ministry of Information decide to send Borat to America with producer Azamat and a film crew. Their aim is to learn lessons from the US in order to return to make benefit Kazakhstan. However when Borat sees the television show Baywatch in his hotel room he becomes transfixed with CJ, aka Pamela Anderson and convinces Azamat that the documentary should be a road trip across the US, thus allowing him to get to California and find his love.<br/><br/>Hyped to the point of hysteria, I joined a packed Saturday night cinema to see this film, wondering what all the fuss was about. Before I continue it is important to note that I'm not trying to be part of a backlash or anything here, because I did actually find the film quite funny at times. However, while some professional reviewers have praised this for being a wonderfully intelligent commentary on society and so on, I struggled to see anything going on here past Jackass-style humour and lots of easy targets. To this end the film is at its funniest when we are simply laughing at what an outsider Borat is. Whether it is the imaginative ways that his narrow-minded ways manifest themselves (throwing money at bugs thinking they are shape-shifting Jews for example) or the looks on the faces of those people shocked by his behaviour, viewers not easily offended will find something to laugh about here.<br/><br/>And to me that is where the whole show begins and ends. Viewers keen to find it will claim that Cohen is using Borat to bring out the small-mindedness of others by using Borat as a trap to draw them out. However this only actually happens twice; once is a redneck with homophobic and anti-Muslim views (a redneck, what a surprise) and the other is a group of drunk students  neither very difficult targets and neither groups that I would expect much of in this regard. Conversely most people show how civil they are by being polite for as long as they can before eventually decided that they can take it no more  the crowd at the rodeo is one example but I could also cite the dinner party, the feminists and so on. With this the case I did wonder what the point was and concluded that there isn't one  there is no intelligent commentary to be made here and those seeing it are seeing it perhaps to justify laughing at racist etc humour. Because lets be honest, that what is so funny right? That Borat is so out of touch and shocking in his views and the way he is. I know that was what made me laugh many of the times, not because it was racist etc but mostly because he is imaginative with how he is. Of course this is not to say that the humour is still not racist, homophobic, anti-Semitic and so on, because it is and I know that some sections of any audience will be laughing at it because of this. Likewise I know some will be uncomfortable with the humour and not care that it is done in an ironic, knowing sort of way. I fell somewhere in the middle; it was funny but I wish it had been a damn sight cleverer to justify the material.<br/><br/>Overall then this is a funny film but it really has very little beyond the Jackass approach of basically doing pranks (in this case Borat himself is the prank) on ""unsuspecting"" people. It did draw laughs from me on this level but I was disappointed that it went for such easy targets and really didn't get much from any of them (some contributions are mere seconds). God only knows why it is so highly rated by my fellow users here but then that is why I give little or no credence to the top 250 list!"

","Borat is sent to America with producer Azamat Bagatov to brush with American culture and help Kazakhstan move forward in the 21st Century. While there, he goes renegade and tries to hunt down Pamela Anderson for a quick marriage (with his 'wedding sack') after his wife Oksana is killed by a bear while walking his retarded brother Bilo.<br/><br/>I will admit that this film is frequently hilarious, but it's not as good as I thought it could be. Sacha Baron Cohen recycles a lot of jokes and situations from the TV show. I've seen every Borat sketch that has been made available to the public and the easy targets are beginning to not be as shocking or entertaining as they once were. He aims all of his material at the idiots who fall for it or who have not seen him on TV. Bringing a (fake) hooker to a snooty High Society dinner, boozing with moronic college frat-boys or jive-talking to a stuck-up concierge is not intelligent comedy anymore. His method of exposing bigots, hypocrites and narrow-minded idiots with his special blend of Socratic irony and entrapment has been used to great effect in the past but it's getting old. Since this movie is probably the last we will see of Borat it's a shame he didn't come up with a new edge.<br/><br/>Sacha Baron Cohen must have the biggest balls in the whole world to do what he does though. I could never keep a straight face while pretending to interrogate a yard sale lady/gypsy over a Barbie doll/woman she has shrunk. Nor could I deliberately, over-exaggerate a massive fall into priceless antiques in a store and not pay for it.<br/><br/>There is one particular scene that pushes the boundaries of taste so far back that it could circle Pluto several times over. I will mention nothing of the content of this scene but I have to warn you, it is insane, teeth-grindingly funny and absolutely disgusting. You need to see it to believe it.<br/><br/>Obviously there are some parts to this film that are totally staged but if you try to figure it out, Sacha Baron Cohen has to tried to make it as little-faked as possible and you'll realize how it's all done. Of particular note is the surprisingly emotional musical score to the film which really stood out and made an impression. Strange considering the type of film that it is. I must hunt down the CD.<br/><br/>No one will fall for Borat's schtick anymore. This movie will make him too popular. He goes out with a predictable BANG instead of KABOOM!"

I found it really funny and my wife thought it hysterical, at one point (the naked fight sequence) being in danger of stopping breathing.<br/><br/>British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen has a huge success here with his portrayal of a Kazakhstan television presenter making a documentary on his examination of American culture and his search for Pamela Anderson. Kazakhstan has no reason to object to this sending up of the nation which can only increase tourism and is as nothing compared to the exposure of the prejudice and hypocrisy of so many sections of American society ranging from fraternity houses to evangelical Christians.<br/><br/>Footnote: Cohen - who is of course Jewish - seemingly makes a whole succession of anti-Semitic jokes while in reality exposing the ridiculous nature of ant-Jewish prejudice and (I am reliably informed by a Jewish friend), along the way, frequently spouts fluent Hebrew."

Particularly to the poor people of those regions.<br/><br/>This movie exposes a lot of bigotry, both intentionally and unintentionally. From the film, I have learned that some Americans are insensitive to ridicule aimed at Jewish people. And from the reaction to the film, I have learned that almost all Americans are insensitive to ridicule targeting the Third World. But maybe it's all good. Maybe we all just need to lighten up, right? You make fun of me, I make fun of you, we make our jokes as offensive and hurtful as possible, laugh and move on. No harm done.

"mstomaso","5","8","12","6 May 2007"," Borat (the film and the character) reaches for a star and comes up short.
","Sasha Baren Cohen is making a career out of humor which makes most intelligent and sensitive people somewhat uncomfortable. This is not necessarily a bad thing if the humor has a good purpose. However, the whole business has achieved, with this movie, the status of an inside-joke. If you haven't seen the Ali G show, you won't get some of this film, and it may come off simply as a painful and offensive exploitation film (which it is, to an extent). The commercial success of Borat is best explained by the market sector it appealed to - fans of Sasha Cohen and the crowd who appreciates the new wave of dumbed-down low-brow humor. Put together, that's a pretty big market.<br/><br/>The recent trend of dumbed-down comedy (Anything starring Will Farrell, etc) is only slightly improved by Borat. The film is cleverly plotted and exploits every opportunity to poke fun at stereotypes (both American and Eastern European), but, unlike many successful attacks on stereotypes, Borat does not offer any solution nor a clear statement against them. Instead, the abject stupidity of the lead character (which is vaguely disguised as cross-cultural confusion) is used as an excuse to create a variety of absurd situations which, though sometimes amusing, are so firmly anchored in stereotypes themselves that the film's critique of stereotypes ends up doing the exact same thing as the lead character - trying very hard to do something good, but doing the exact opposite instead.<br/><br/>Borat (Sasha Cohen) is a native of Kazakhstan (which is a real place - 9th largest country in the world - landlocked and nestled between Asia and Europe). He comes to America with a morbidly obese TV producer to create an ethnographic documentary for native county. The geography of Kazakhstan appears to be the excuse for incorporating many stereotypes about eastern Europeans and Middle-easterners. But the film has absolutely nothing to do with Kazakhstan - which is, in fact, one of the most economically self-sufficient, politically sophisticated and progressive of the former soviet republics, and has a long and interesting cultural history completely unrelated to ANYTHING shown in this film. So much for that grain of truth.<br/><br/>Borat makes a series of amusing errors as he travels across the USA encountering every major American stereotype along the way. Borat and his producer are completely unprepared for most of what they find in America. They do not understand what toilets are, think they can rape any woman they see, and believe that Jewish people are shape-shifting, murderous thieving monsters. Borat believes that Pamela Anderson will marry him when he reaches California. I think you can see where this is headed. As many have stated before me, the film really is like a series of strung-together Jackass skits. To this simple formula, however, is added a pseudo-ethnographic component - making it just a little more edgy than the juvenile antics of the Jackass team.<br/><br/>It's hard for me to write a bottom line recommendation for this film. The film does have some genuinely funny moments, and does sometimes make its audience think positively about cultural difference. But it's inconsistent in terms of humor, philosophy and a great deal more.<br/><br/>If you like Cohen, you'll love it. If you liked Anchorman and Talladega Nights you might like it. If you enjoy Jackass, you might like it.<br/><br/>Anthropologists, Sociologists, historians, people who did not vote for George Bush, middle easterners and eastern Europeans will probably want to avoid this film. Also, those easily offended by purely comedic antisemitism, stereotypes about the people of the American south, homophobia and racism, should avoid this."

Also well made are the introduction and the final parts of 'Borat', with its liberal use of Cyrillic characters and cuts from old Soviet-era propaganda films.<br/><br/>Given the subject material, invariably it will offend a lot of viewers, just like - say - Monty Python's 'Life of Brian' did (which literally was banned in many parts of England). Considering some of the numerous angry reactions to 'Borat', one may wonder if the offendees saw it just to get offended, or if they even saw it at all. Not everyone seriously upset with Salman Rushdie read 'The satanic Verses' either...<br/><br/>People who take themselves as well as their views very, very, VERY seriously, will miss this film's jokes, which is too bad. But then that is the nature of satire: Somebody will get made fun of, and the closer to the line of what is acceptable one gets, the funnier it is (and when the line is crossed, all hell breaks loose). In this case just about everyone got aimed at: The Glorious Nation of Kazakstan, it's people, Borat's neighbor, his largish wife, homophobes, anti-Semites, New Yorkers, American patriots, drunk teenagers - you-name-it. Borat is an equal opportunity hard time, and is so with a vengeance.<br/><br/>So please see 'Borat' not like a real documentary, but as a comedy. And if you're the least bit likely to get offended by politically incorrect humor, don't spend your hard-earned money renting 'Borat', but go for something less risky. If, however, you can accept the movie in its proper context, it'll be a nice way to spend a few hours one evening."
"zoda12321","1","42","86","15 November 2006"," Not the least bit interesting
","The problem with Borat was not that it was offensive or that it inspired prejudice, it was clearly making fun of prejudice in a round about way. That's not what made this movie so bad.<br/><br/>I personally find nothing at all wrong with getting a good laugh out of something which holds some truth, offensive or not. Personally I didn't find this movie very offensive though ti did have its share of non-politically correct humor. Borat wasn't a bad movie because it was rude, it was just a bad movie because it wasn't funny or thought out.<br/><br/>With the exception of a few scenes, Borat just wasn't interesting. I felt like anyone over the age of 7 could have thought up a much more clever plot. Borat's character was an attempt to impersonate middle easterners while pointing out some of some of the flaws in their culture such as sexism. While there may be flaws in these societies, there is much more ignorance about their practices. <br/><br/>Throughout the movie Borat attempts to to understand and become Amercian. The comedy is based around how Borat is an unethical middle-eastern man. The funniest part of the movie is that most Americans (admittedly including myself) couldn't tell Borat from a real Kazakhstani or anyone else from the mid-east.<br/><br/>The same reaction of laughter would probably come from a Kazakhstani who was watching a French man dressed up like Micheal Jordan impersonating a Kazakhstani. The character could go around Kazakhstan eating Hot dogs and wearing a turban (or maybe wearing a towel) over a cowboy hat while running around in an army suit doing a horrible fake accent.. Wouldn't that movie be hilarious? Well the only difference is that we're watching an English man impersonating a Kazakhstani impersonating an American.<br/><br/>The humor in this movie is based around the fear and misunderstanding Americans have over Middle Eastern, what we can't understand we fear or make fun of. It's the same mentality of bully's in school yards. <br/><br/>The amount of praise this movie is getting makes me ashamed to be American. It could have been funny if done right, but it wasn't. I doubt that people in other countries would find this movie funny. Nor would anyone 15 years from now. It's timely and regional humor that is unfortunately very telling of America's current frame of mind -fear."

","As far as a movie is concerned, it has no point. Exaggeration is important in a comedy, but it is supposed to be based on real stuff, not bluffing. Most of the description about Kazakhstan is evidently untrue, which makes it a tacky political satire. And the film is also absolutely not about culture collision, which I thought it would be before I saw it. I don't see anything but the idea of ""we are civilized people, these are barbarians, so let's look how zanily they behave!"" <br/><br/>By the way, it's neither decent nor hilarious making fun of people who happen to be isolated from the entire modern world. Their ignorance is not their own fault. Sarcasm on them is just like laughing at retards and cripples.<br/><br/>I cannot believe the script is created by a Cambridge graduate and this movie is rated 8 here."
"Robert_duder","7","19","35","2 March 2007"," Honestly...what is to be said about Borat...it's exactly what it claims to be...and it is FUNNY!!
","Borat is now probably cinema legend. Crude...through the roof...offensive...yep definitely...silly, yeah plenty of that, but somehow...in some sick twisted way Borat manages to be funny, possibly one of the funniest crude films I've ever seen and I'm not a big fan of comedies let alone crude comedies. It just seems to work for Borat and part of that is because I insist on believing that there was some sort of social message that the film maker was trying to make with this over the top, rendition of a newcomer to America. I think he was trying to show us exactly how foolish we looked when presented with very taboo situations like homosexuality, religion, war, violence, American way of life...and he pulled that off flawlessly which made it all the more funny. If anyone ever thought you could have crude, disgusting humor with a point...Sacha Baron Cohen actually pulls it off and I'll give him credit for that.<br/><br/>Sacha Baron Cohen is Borat. He completely embodies his infamous character and makes him an actual person to us. He travels to America from his own country of Kazakhstan to document American way of life and in the process discovers the love of his life in Pamela Anderson and treks across the country to find her stopping and carrying on wild interviews and situations with 'real' people and Americans. I insist that some of it had to have been set up but the reality of Cohen doing this to real people made it downright hilarious and gave Borat it's heart. In most ways Borat is disgusting, uncivilized, under educated and yet you feel compassion for him because this is his way of life and he doesn't understand what other people do. Then on the flip side anyone who knows the story behind this film knows that Cohen is tricking these people and that's really the way you see Borat. I don't think anyone who knows and understands this film actually sees Borat as a character or anyone remotely real. Ken Davitian is Borat's partner in crime and fellow Kazakhstani Azamat Bagatov who follows him as his producer through his exploits. Davitian basically uses his physical appearance as comedy for the most part and plays as Cohen's straight man but does a decent job doing that. Basically the rest of the film for the most part is 'real' unsuspecting victims of Cohen's comedy bit and parts of it seem real and then you wonder how they could be duped by such an overdone character. Pamela Anderson also makes an appearance as herself but it's generally considered fact that her scenes were planned and staged.<br/><br/>Weak of stomach or heart and easily offended should stay 100 miles from this film because it does have it's share of down right raunchy comedy, disgusting moments, and really harsh racism and sexual opinions. It's not that I am not offended but I look at it differently and actually found many of the scenes amusing but from a perspective of Cohen setting them up. Borat is mercifully short, less than an hour and a half because I don't believe anyone could take any more of Borat than that but the deleted scenes on the DVD are well worth seeing as well because there is even more interactions with real people. Those who like disgusting comedy will find Borat roll in the aisles funny but I think even people who can see the film as more of a spoof and trying to make a point might get a good laugh out of it as well. I would never say the film is brilliant or worth seeing twice but the film is worth seeing to get a smile out of the tough skinned individuals out there. 7/10"
"denn_2003","1","28","55","8 January 2007"," Lame Humor
","The success of this movie just shows how hypocrite people get excited by watching racial, female, and non-American bashing. When people don't understand other cultures, they make fun of them, implying that their own culture is far more superior than of those they make fun of. If all the fun is made on the expense of one nation (and its not sarcasm like Simpsons, and its not US), then gee I wonder why the world hates us.<br/><br/>Borat is an idiot from Khazakistan, and he makes sure that he gets the worst out of people by acting crazy in front of them. Where it may seem funny at points, it really isn't movie material, its the kinda stuff you want to watch on hidden camera shows, and that too for half an hour with commercial breaks, thats about it."
"Galina_movie_fan","1","28","55","2 January 2007"," Disappointed...
","A lot of people love the movie including respected critics and Larry David who laughed so hard that he was afraid to have a heart attack. One of my IMDb friends who is known as ironic and rather sarcastic critic, called ""Borat"" a brilliant satire. I don't know - maybe I just don't get the brilliance. I did laugh couple of times but mostly I was disgusted - it is not that brave or outrageous and as a movie it has next to none redeeming values. It hang somewhere in the middle and became simply boring which is the worst crime for a comedy and even with the running time only 84 minutes, ""Borat"" more than overstayed its welcome. Baron played it safe - it does not take too much courage right now to criticize Bush or to make Jewish jokes or to make fun of the poor uneducated village people. No matter what message he (Baron or Borat) is putting in/out there, the movie is sophomoric and the grandest case of the Emperor with No Clothes (in more way than one) I've witnessed. It is forgettable and mediocre at its best."
"kylopod","9","28","55","28 November 2006"," A revolutionary comedy
","Many years ago scientists created a robotic bee that got accepted into a real hive. The experiment raises a basic question: What was more notable? The device itself, or the fact that real bees accepted it as one of their own?<br/><br/>That's the sort of question that crossed my mind when I watched ""Borat."" Even though Sacha Baron Cohen dresses up as a fictional character, he takes this character out into the real world and films the reactions of people who assume he is for real. Part of the humor comes from the character himself, but equally important is the way that innocent bystanders are taken in by his antics. Out of this footage and some staged material, he spins a fictional story about Borat, a Kazakhstani journalist filming a documentary while traveling across the United States.<br/><br/>At first, I had trouble formulating an opinion about the film, for the simple reason that it was so unlike anything I'd ever seen before that I had no point of comparison. Sure I laughed a lot, sometimes to the point of tears (the rodeo scene is tops for me). But usually when I'm watching a movie, I measure the experience by comparing it to other films. Here, my mind came up blank, because ""Borat"" is one of the few truly unique comedies I've seen. Not only is it one of the funniest movies in years, containing some of the most intriguing satire about racism since ""All in the Family,"" it takes comedy to an entirely new plane.<br/><br/>I admit that I was slow to become a fan of Cohen's show. That's partly because his Ali G character was just a variant on something we've all seen many times before, even if the ""Candid Camera"" element offered a fresh twist on the material. Borat, however, is a highly original creation. If this character were to appear in a conventional movie, he would still be strange. At the same time, there's little doubt that his routines wouldn't be half as interesting if they didn't involve the general public.<br/><br/>Borat is, to put it nicely, an ignorant buffoon. He has no social manner, thinking it acceptable to talk in graphic detail about sex and bodily functions no matter what the occasion. He's also a first-class bigot, putting down Jews, blacks, and women. Of all of Borat's traits, his garden-variety anti-Semitism has gotten the most press, because Cohen is in fact Jewish, and it's fascinating the way he gets people to accept his character and then to say things they wouldn't normally say to a reporter. In one of the more memorable bits from his show, Borat went into a redneck bar in Arizona and sang a song called ""Throw the Jew Down the Well."" How did the customers react? Why, by the third verse they were all clapping and whooping and singing along, making horn symbols with their hands on their foreheads. Is this comedy or investigative journalism?<br/><br/>In the movie, Borat continues these sorts of shenanigans. Because the approach is so unique, even the familiar gags have a certain freshness. For example, we're all familiar with the cliché where a character eats a seemingly innocent food and then is told it's something gross. But I bet you've never seen a film where the star actually pulls the prank--for real--on an unsuspecting politician.<br/><br/>Looking back on the movie now, I realize that there are some principles of comedy at work. One is that if you create a disgusting, vulgar character, you shouldn't try to soften him at the end. That's a principle that many Hollywood movies neglect (""Bad Santa"" comes to mind). Maybe it's because Cohen is British, not American, that he understands this principle. British comedy has long had a better grasp at how to handle unpleasant characters. Instead of half-apologizing for the material as American comedies tend to do, the British know how to take such material to its limits. One of Cohen's conceits is that his characters are static, never for a moment realizing their own idiocy. That's comedy.<br/><br/>Perhaps what makes the offensive material easier to stomach is that Borat never shows any malice or ill intent. The man behind the character may be cruel, but the character himself is cheerful, friendly, and completely oblivious to the havoc he causes. He has horrible attitudes, but only because he doesn't know any better. The movie's purpose in springing this character on the public is to unmask the veneer of sophistication that so many Americans wear, to reveal the little prejudices we try so hard to cover up.<br/><br/>There's a danger of something like this becoming a one-joke routine. ""Borat"" avoids that fate because the character is so multifaceted, finding so many creative ways to offend, shock, irritate, or just weird people out. And the movie spares no one. It isn't just an exposure of redneck bigotry. It also targets urbane, condescending liberals. One of the most hilariously revealing moments occurs when Borat sabotages an etiquette coach, who proceeds to shrug off his dirty, uncouth behavior as due to ""cultural differences.""<br/><br/>Underlying the comedy are themes that some viewers might miss. Take the way that Borat is anti-gay but doesn't recognize his own homosexual behavior. He seems to oppose the idea of things without having a clue about their reality. He doesn't even recognize a guy wearing a yarmulke as Jewish. Only after the man's wife identifies as Jewish does he go berserk. (And not in a mean way: Borat is scared for his life!)<br/><br/>Don't worry about the ""plot,"" in which Borat travels across the country with the intent of marrying Pamela Anderson (who I'm sure was in on the joke). It's mostly just a string-line for the gags, but along the way it satirizes various movie conventions, and the manner in which it incorporates the real-life ""stunts"" into the mix is rather brilliant. Comedy will never be the same again."

","I'm not American, Kazakh, Jew, Gypsy, Christian or whatever else in order to have a relationship with the movie, therefore I think I can be pretty much impartial First of all, the Borat character should not be taken seriously. He does not speak like a Kazakh, accent is nowhere near a Kazakh's English (It's a very thick East European accent which you can catch from miles away). He's way off being a Kazakh. So Kazakhstan need not worry about Borat humiliating Kazakh people. The only offending image was the image of the car when the Kazakh anthem was bragging about Kazakhstan's superior industry.<br/><br/>I'm not easily offended by explicit language and harsh jokes or male nudity. There are indeed some funny moments though, here and there. The humor is not for everyone, although I believe this is kind of sense of humor we used to have when we were 8 year old naughty boys. The elevator scene was funny, but two naked guys fighting in bed was not funny at all.<br/><br/>I don't care about the Antisemitism or whatever there is in the movie to supposedly offense the audience in order to create oppositions and attract attention. But I find it remarkable how durable the political correctness of an average American is, easily dissolving after a two minute chat with a bizarre Kazakh guy. Like right after Borat asks ""which one do you recommend to shoot a Jew?"". and the guy selling guns going ""a 9 mm or a 45."" without any hesitation.<br/><br/>The movie has no plot to talk about, had no remarkable moments, and is washed all over with crude pranks. The only thing to talk about is ""were these guys really in the game, or are their reactions genuine"". My vote is 2/10."

It was as if someone pieced together scraps of a junky's family video. It showed flagrant disregard for the kindness and patience of his victims. Nobody deserves to be treated like that, but it is passed off as humor.

Dark comedy can be cruel when the writing is acerbically witty and smart. What BORAT seems to have done is costume and scene change a standup comedy routine bent on grossing out its audience and choosing a demeaning manner instead of a parody to lash out at the multiple groups it attacks, be those the people of Kazakhstan, Pentacostal Holiness churches, drunk sexist/racist teenagers, feminists, businessmen, actors, Jews, homosexuals, rodeo folks, genteel Southerners, TV talk show hosts/weathermen, etc.<br/><br/>Production wise the filming is crude, the storyline is plotted to look as though it were spontaneous candid camera takes (yet credits a long list of writers including Cohen), and the flatline character of Borat is as predictable as the potty mouth humor it accompanies.

Under a different guise, these people were opening their lives up to someone--in their minds, helping someone fit in, and they were rewarded by someone insulting them as being unattractive, having feces presented to them at the dinner table, and having what they believe is a prostitute show up on their doorstep. The antiques dealer has his merchandise destroyed in front of him, and women on an elevator are the target of what boils down to as indecent exposure. Why is it that Pamela Anderson can be totally in the loop on what's going down, but, other people are totally lied to? When I found out that the villagers in the opening scene weren't completely in the know, that was sort of the straw breaking the camel's back for me.<br/><br/>If this is what ""the next generation"" believes to be cutting edge humor, then, our society is in worse trouble then I thought. It goes well beyond crass humor. I'm as liberal and open minded as can be, and I am a firm believer in freedom of speech and supporting the arts, but, ""Borat"" just seemed like a yuck fest that centered around little more than picking on the slow kid. I don't want to ever think that sort of comedy is funny."

Cohen (who, by the way is a Jew himself) is obviously m a k i n g f u n o f anti semitism, or at least he is trying to... he wants to show how unreasonable the hate or fear of the Jews is... I agree with that, cause i don't have anything against Jews or Americans or kazakhs or anyone for all that matters. But i do think that Cohen should leave this job for someone who is not a Jew, (so it would be less of a propaganda) or at least, for someone with the basic sense of humor...i don't think that the view of Borat making a fool of himself(at most times) or making fool of others(at some times), with gags based on ,e.g, the nudity of his over sized partner is funny in any way... how much did this movie cost, i wonder? ten bucks? a hundred? a million? i do not know. all i know is how much better would this world be if all this money could be invested on something else, like the help of hungry, sick , orphan kids dying every day around the world, instead of being wasted in the making of such garbage..."

","Those reviews that call this sophomoric toilet humor are blind to its biting satire.<br/><br/>This is a wicked and devastatingly ingenious comical rewind of the 1969 ""Easy Rider."" Borat's wacky adventure puts him in touch with the real Americana.<br/><br/>In doing so it paints a grotesque ""Picture of Dorian Gray"" portrait of the frivolous, discomfortingly and ugly side of America.<br/><br/>Unlike in ""Easy Rider,"" Borat doesn't reserve this for the easiest targets: narrow minded and provincial southerners. He starts with New Yorker feminists and winds up on Los Angeles' Sunset Strip. In between we get an unvarnished look at frat boys, evangelicals, and bigots.<br/><br/>The American anthem vignette at the rodeo is both devastating funny and frightening.

","Sacha Baron Cohen brings his best creationthe Eastern European TV presenter Boratto the big screen in 'Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan', a movie which follows the (somehow) likable Jew-hater (accompanied by his friend Azamat Bagatov) as he makes his revealing documentary about life in the USA.<br/><br/>Cohen cleverly (and rather bravely) uses his naive, racist and sexist Kazakhstani character to expose the bigots and idiots that often give the US a bad name, whilst simultaneously delivering some of the funniest cinematic moments in recent memory.<br/><br/>Whether it is an average Joe on a subway train, a group of frat boys on a road-trip, or a room-full of people at a seminar, absolutely no-one is safe from Borat as he reveals a country brimming with hatred, distrust, and intolerance: it's a sad moment for the human race when Borat politely introduces himself to a stranger, only to be met with threats of violence.<br/><br/>Of course, Borat's style of comedy is not going to be to everybody's taste: the more conservative of viewers may balk at the toilet humour and bad taste gags; rednecks and religious extremists will more than likely froth at the mouth at particular moments; and many Eastern Europeans probably won't like Cohen's portrayal of one of their own. The rest of us, however, should have a whale of a time.<br/><br/>Some of Cohen's schtick might seem a little old hat to those familiar with Borat from UK TV, and, occasionally, the film has the tendency to feel somewhat staged (the Pamela Anderson segment is rumoured to have been set-up), but the movie's outrageous highlights more than make up for these minor quibbles.<br/><br/>And if you're intending to watch this film on DVD, make sure to catch the hilarious deleted scenesone word: cheese."

","Over the years the Oscar award has been given to an actor or an actress who embodies their role, who become a character and have us convinced in their portrayal. Last year Philip Hoffman had me in complete awe with his mesmerizing portrayal of Capote, his voice, mannerisms, eyes, everything about him was convincing and whats more he held that for the entire film consistently. Other past movie characters that have done the same include Marlon Brando's portrayal of Don Corleone, Al Pacino's Tony Montana and Anothony Hopkin's Hanibal Lector. But what one needs to understand is that these characters were in a controlled environment, not to take away anything from them, but what would happen next and what they would say next was right there for them... and they completely hit it out of the park!! Sacha Cohens character of Borat, one needs to understand, isn't simply a ""prankster"" or a ""funnyman"". Sacha Cohen considered a PhD before starting his show, he is cold and calculated in his writing and approach. This is pure satirism, he is, thru Borat, trying to get at the underbelly of the US and pull out a quivering pile of ignorance to show to the world. We laugh at him, we laugh at the jokes he makes, but we question through our laughter. We question the mentality of the American people, and by extension..almost all people.<br/><br/>Holding the character of Borat is a HUGE feat!! the accent, mannerisms, Borat's walk, everything is extremely convincing, so much so that many many many people have fallen victim to him, put down their guards and said some fairly outlandish stuff.<br/><br/>This is wonderful acting, and i pray it is recognized. i know many may not agree with his bashing of the Jewish population (although Cohen is himself Jewish) but we need to understand that he bashes the Jewish population to get a certain reaction, to create a certain familiarity with the people he is with, and that familiarity is shocking...can people actually...agree with Borat? I pray the best actor Oscar goes to Cohen, someone who has so dedicated himself and is so convincing in the role of Borat that we forget that underneath Borat is a British intellectual trying to figure out whats wrong with peoples thinking!! - Harpinder Soomal"

","Sacha Baron Cohen defecates on the heads of U.S. (and other) audiences and many of them love it! This excrement-loaded exercise in moronic humor sets a new low point in the ""epater le bourgeois"" genre. ""Borat"" is so palpably dishonest that no sensible observer can give any credence to its manufactured ""exposures"" of U.S. bigotry and bloodthirstiness. Any competent documentarian would have little difficulty filming AUTHENTIC versions of the film's counterfeit ""candid camera"" diatribes against Muslims, Jews, blacks, women and Iraqis and packaging these in an edifying vehicle. The actual exposure of U.S. depravity is not provided by ""Borat"" but, rather, by the adulatory utterances of the professional (i.e. jaded, sold-out) film ""critics."" Those who found this film ""uproariously funny"" or ""superbly satirical"" damned themselves for their abysmal judgment and taste.<br/><br/>There's nothing really new here, of course.

Most people don't even know the third character Cohen plays named Bruno. I find the show freaking hilarious because it is completely unscripted and is just Cohen at his finest. Here we have half scripted, half unscripted. I just thought the whole back story concept was actually pretty lame, considering the show is not at all in this format.<br/><br/>All in all, I was disappointed in this show, being an Ali G Show purist. If you truly enjoy the show, just stick to it and forget this piece of garbage film. If you want to act all cool and ""fit in"", please see it. You will probably like it. Im just hoping we don't see a Bruno movie.

Although I could criticize about its appalling graphics or its use of inappropriate jokes. But honestly this makes the movie a hell of a lot funnier. Sacha Baron Cohen does a fantastic job at playing Borat and making the character and the whole movie absolutely hilarious.

","Borat meets former Congressman Bob Barr and serves him cheese, saying it's a traditional gift in Kazakhstan. Barr swallows it then Borat tells him it's made from his wife's breast milk. Ha ha ha. You see, Barr is ridiculed because he accepted a friendship offering from Borat when everyone knows smart people always know to first ask if cheese they're given is made of the giver's wife's breast milk or not. Is that funny? Then, with Alan Keyes, he describes how he and a gay had sex with a plastic fist in a shower. Yeah, funny stuff.<br/><br/>Debbie Schlussel says the movie should really be called ""Sascha's Big Fart on Middle America."" Midwesterners at a rodeo are depicted as anti-Muslim racists, bigots, and dummies. They're supposed to be the bad ones for booing Borat when he purposely perverts the American National Anthem and says ""We support your War OF Terror."" A Southern Evangelical Church finds a down-and-out-on-his-luck Borat asleep in the sidewalk in front. They kindly take him in and even give him a bus ride on his way to California. Despite their kindness, he ridicules them, showing them speaking in tongues and trying to make them look bad. Uproarious. Kind, generous people are so gullible! Equally disturbing was Borat's sojourn to a Southern mansion where he is invited to dinner. First, he meets with an etiquette teacher. He shows her a picture of his alleged son. Most of the picture is of the son's large penis. That's funny? Maybe, if you're five or a drunk at the frat house. When he goes to dinner, Borat intimates to one of the husbands at the dinner table that his wife is ugly. After using the bathroom, he brings a white bag filled with his feces to the dinner table. Ha ha ha.<br/><br/>Racism against Blacks is funny so Borat uses a fat, Black prostitute (overflowing out of her skimpy sequined tube top), whom Cohen invites to the home while the dinner is going on. She's, by the way, the major Black person in the movie (there are brief scene with Keyes and some inner city Black kids).<br/><br/>""Borat"" hitches a ride with some Southern frat boys, who make indefensible anti-Semitic comments. They're hardly representative of America, where anti-Semitism is at one of the world's lowest levels, but the film implies they are. In Cohen's own native Britain, anti-Semitism is practically the national theology (second to Islamism).<br/><br/>Much has been made of Borat's attacks on Jews. But we laugh at those because it's implicit that comedian Cohen is making fun of the anti-Semite he's playing. That's not the problem. It's that he celebrates attacking Americans.<br/><br/>Cohen--who proudly proclaims that he's a Jew--has no problem savaging American Christians, Southerners, rodeo fans, and others who are kind and generous to this odd foreigner they believe is truly in need of help.<br/><br/>If that causes anyone be anti-Semitic, who could blame them...<br/><br/>Borat's a piece of garbge."

The antics are funny but to create a great MOVIE there needs to be an underlying structure with more strength than the current script that appears thrown together in 5 minutes. Look at some of the best comedies (e.g., The Great Dictator, The Incredibles, Mony Python, Dumb and Dumber) -- they all have crazy antics that make them laugh out funny - BUT they also have some pretty solid writing behind them.

","Story:The movie has raised much ado about nothing, causing people to discuss their likes and dislikes about other nationalities. Well...that theme is as old as the world itself. Interracial, inter-cultural and other ethnic conflicts have existed long before they were even registered in chronicles. There are many hot spots on the political map nowadays. I believe there is no need to create anymore: Kazakhs/Uzbeks. Kazakhs/Jews. There was no conflicts between them. However, as Sasha Baron(?) Cohen is a Jew himself...and many of my countrymen are sick and tired of him...i am not sure what 's gonna happen next. Acting: I would rate acting skills of Sasha Cohen as extremely poor - as it does not take much to act as a retard and speak with a fake polish accent. Visuals: unrealistic, fake, the first part of the movie filmed in Romania - what does it have in common with Kazakhstan?? Outcome:My friends' daughter is facing a lot of problems right now in one of the high schools in USA, she is being called a prostitute, urine drinker etc. etc. etc. only because she happened to live in the times of Boratomania and at the very climax of peoples' intolerance towards each other. Many people say Borat has put Kazakhstan on the map...I would be more happy if he did not. I don't mind if young people around the world don't know anything about Kazakhstan rather than being misinformed they develop a constant biased attitude towards kazakhs. Real comment: I am not a humourless person at all. and i can share a great deal of jokes about my country with my people. However i will never allow somebody to make jokes bout my culture and my country under my national symbols and using the name of my capital city. One of the rules of correctness in ethnical humor that the jokes are usually cultivated inside the ethnos.E.g.jokes on gabrov people in Bulgaria,Scottish people in UK, and others - all were born inside the cultural areal. one afro-American can call another ""*****"" , but he will not let me do it. and i will understand him. Conclusion: we all can be famous and rich by making other people look stupid, however it is not what we believe is appropriate for us. We are above all this.

While I did laugh at some parts (the reaction of the naked men running in the hotel was a low-brow high point), most of it was somewhat banal. Most of the comedy is suppose to be derived out of Borat making Americans look like unfriendly new-yorkers or backwards southern hicks. U.S.-hating liberals and world-inexperienced college kids will love it. What I didn't understand was how many people in the audience were laughing at the jokes that had already been in the trailers. If you seen the trailer you've seen about 1/3 of the movie (it's very short at 84 minutes). Also, the movie also contains the same jokes that ""Borat"" has used in his several hundred interviews for the movie release. How many times you can hear ""My sister is prostitute"" and still find it funny, I'm not sure. Once was enough for me.

It takes a lot for me to leave in the middle of the movie but in this case leaving the theater was similar to leaving a really dirty restroom  you really glad when you can breathe air that has not sh1t flavor to it. I never knew that I have a low tolerance for bodily humor but jokes about sh1t or ur1ne provided entertainment for the audience every five minutes or so. Someone sh1ts in front of building in New York, someone sh1ts in the car, someone washes face in a toilet, someone ur1nates in river while other person washes face in it, someone gets a plastic bag with sh1t to a diner table and asks a host to wipe his behind. Countless jokes about child molestation, for example ""when I got my wife she had assho1e like 7 years old, but now she is 15 and she is not like she used to be"". After each scene with sh1t or child molestation or incest, movie provide justification such as main character hate Jews. By the middle of the movie I clearly understood that anti-Semitic people are extremely poor, sh1t everywhere, molest children, speak bad English, drink from a toilet, enjoy incest, encourage relatives to be prostitute, rape women and small animals. What I don't understand is why do I have watch all this. To hate immigrants? To hate anti-Semitic people? To laugh at poor? If poverty is so funny why don't you make great comedy about Africa?

","I am writing my opinion in order to honor my friends' family. They were exiled from Poland to Siberia in 1941. In the same period, many other Polish families were exiled to Kazakhstan to ""lagers"". Only the highest educated people from eastern part of Poland occupied that time by the Soviet Union were persecuted this way by the then communist regime. Many of them died there. Whoever read the book ""The Gulag Archipelago"" by Alexander Solzhenitsyn, will understand what these people went through. It is unlikely, that a person from Poland could behave like Borat, because Polish people in Kazakhstan were the people with high culture, intellect and dignity. I doubt, that Polish people do not know who Jesus is or that they favor prostitution. One can ponder whether an exile can cause degeneration of nationality. It was sad, to watch this painful part of the history turned into a subject of comedy."

"whytlaith","1","18","38","6 November 2006"," Spoiler Warning - Stay Away From This Movie
","I have never walked out of a movie in my life, until I saw Sasha Cohen's ""Borat"", a tribute to the primeval slime that humanity came from eons ago. As a human being who is proud of how far our species has come, despite all the uncivilized behavior that goes on in the world, I think there needs to be a minimum level of decency maintained between people. Otherwise, we might as well go back to living in caves and clubbing each other on the head.<br/><br/>I am going to definitely spoil the movie for you in this review but the truth is I would only be doing you a favor. There is very little of redeeming quality in this movie. Right from the start, I do have a problem with having Kazak's shown as primitive imbeciles that engage in incest and bestiality. I have nothing against Kazakhstan and its people and I don't find it funny that they're portrayed in such negative ways when they've done nothing wrong to me. But I looked past that because people whose opinions I value told me it was a funny movie.<br/><br/>To be fair, the movie has a few moments I could appreciate. For one thing it exposed how unfriendly American culture has become. There's a scene early on in the movie when Cohen, recently arrived in the US for the first time in his life, tries to greet random Americans on the street in what is portrayed as the Kazak way. Although it would have been strange to see Cohen coming towards you to shake your hand and kiss you on the cheek, there was clearly something wrong in the way many of the American people reacted. The men usually reacted with anger and threats of violence. It was actually nice that the movie chose to contrast that reaction with those of men at a gay parade. At the parade, no one found it threatening or offensive that Cohen got too personal with them. I can tell you that if a strange looking man like Cohen were to go up to random people in a third world country, they would look at him as if he was insane, but they would at least either greet him or move away and laugh. Not in America apparently.<br/><br/>There's another interesting scene where Cohen is at a rodeo in Georgia, right in the middle of redneck America, where pure ignorance and racism are passed through breast milk. One of the kind gentlemen at the rodeo tells Cohen that he should shave his mustache so that he wouldn't look like the bad guys, you know Muslims. The ones you're not sure whether they have a bomb strapped to their bodies. Because you know how many of them have strapped explosives to themselves and blown up rodeos. I hope that man watches this movie so that he can see how ridiculous, bigoted, evil and stupid he looks talking the way he does about people he's never seen in real life. As for the rest of the scene, let's just say it was a very disappointing look at the blood lust in the hearts of those who claim to be the most devout of Christ's followers.<br/><br/>However, that's where all the few interesting moments end. The rest of the movie is focused on insulting people on screen for cheap laughs. I was ready to walk out in a scene where Cohen goes to a bed and breakfast where he discovers that the owners are Jews. However, he didn't end up insulting them, but rather act out a reasonably funny scene that exposed the stupidity of people who would hate others to the point of believing such stupid lies about them  such as being able to shape shift.<br/><br/>The worst scene in movie history is set at a dinner table where a number of older couples were trying to help Cohen learn etiquette by playing host to him. I will not dwell on the scene too much but I will say this; it involves a piece of feces and a hooker. It was at this point that I left the theater and it's at this point that I truly saw the evil that Cohen has unleashed on a world only too happy to accept it. And one more thing, what the hell is wrong with those people at the dinner. They're so eager to be hospitable and politically correct that they were willing to put up with all the gross acts of a disgusting man when any sane person would have beaten him senseless and thrown him on his ass by the side of the road.<br/><br/>What more can I say, this was the worst movie I have ever seen."

"wricketts","1","11","21","26 July 2007"," Get this man a psychiatrist
","Every year, a near infinity of bad movies is churned out by people who think they're artists or who can raise a lot of money or (what is so much worse) both; so it would hardly be sufficient to pan this rancid piece of putrescent offal on the simple basis that it is bad  although it is agonizingly, oppressively, relentlessly bad. What lands this movie, instead, smack dab in the category of the justifiably censurable and eminently burnable is that Sacha Baron Cohen deploys his so-called humor to express what I can only imagine is a virtually bottomless wellspring of hatred and hostilitytoward himself, but especially toward anyone unlucky enough to share the planet with him. More than that, he's the kind of ""comedian"" who considers himself exempt from all the normal rules of human decency simply because he's a comedian; he can ""say anything,"" because his ""art"" liberates him (or so he would no doubt tell you). He'd tell you that because he's too neurotically immature to admit the truth: He chose comedy so he could ""say anything"" without paying the consequences that the rest of us must. His ""humor"" masks a form of psychological illness and shouldn't be mistaken for a profession. It is a truism, in fact (though it also happens to be true), that one of humor's main engines is hostility, and Cohen is a classic perpetrator. For Cohen, ""just kidding"" is all the excuse he would need after he'd run your pet dog over with the lawn mower or dropped your infant child over the balcony. (And what a giggle, that look on your face!) For him, the excuse of ""humor"" excuses, well, everything. It's precisely the kind of shield that bullieseven skinny, unattractive bullieshave used since speech was invented to lacerate others. If you object, if you take offense, then you just ""don't get it,"" you're a bore, you're a poor sport. When, in point of fact, you are none of those things. When what you are, instead, is someone who can perceive when another person is calling you an idiot (and not even with great subtlety). The antics that Cohen got up to in making this filmand of which, thus, the film itself is the documentary evidenceare one example after another of his loathing and malice toward all. He finds stupid people and makes them say stupid things; this is ""funny."" He finds sincere, honest people and he treats them so abominably that they lose their cool; this is ""funny."" He finds warm-hearted, helpful people and he embarrasses them horribly; this is ""funny."" He creates unnatural situations in which people can only react unnaturally; this is ""funny."" Cohen's rationalebecause tyrants always have a rationaleis that he's ""exposing"" hypocrisy or letting us see the ""underbelly"" of society. No, he's actually not. What he's actually doing is fully and happily participating in that underbelly; he's perpetuating hypocrisy (using the fictional character of Borat, Cohen literally lies to get people to talk to him). He's inviting you to give him money to see him say ""FU"" to people who don't deserve it (and a few who perhaps do), and then he says ""FU"" to you for being stupid enough to want to watch. He is, in short, a jerk. An angry, hostile, misanthropic, nasty-minded, obnoxious jerk. _Borat_ is for people who don't have the guts to launch their own insults. It's symptomatic of an international ""I'm OK; you're a worthless piece of s***"" malaise--the malaise that Cohen would like you to believe he's exposing but which, instead, he's working as hard as he can to foster."

","The humor in this movie reminded me of the first 30 minutes of Saving Private Ryan: I started to cringe as I wondered who was about to be destroyed next. Sacha Cohen absolutely screws with very real and very decent people, and he does so in the most disgusting ways possible. For example, his helpless foreigner character attends a social gathering and dinner with a group of Christians, including a church Pastor and his wife, when he asks to be excused to go to the bathroom. When he returns he brings a plastic bag of his own feces back to the dinner table with him and asks what to do with it (under the guise that he is a helpless foreigner). These decent people are shocked but try to forgive his naiveté in the matter, and one woman even tries to give the poor foreigner lessons on using an American bathroom. These same decent people again try to be flexible when a prostitute shows up at their house for dinner (that Sacha Cohen has called while off at the restroom), but then snap and tell him to leave, yelling at him on his way out and calling the cops. These were real people he did this to, not movie characters. He took advantage of their trust and decency and screwed with them based on that fact. This is just one example of many that are essentially the same. Many of the scenes are so obtuse that he seems to be screwing with his movie audience as well. Also, I was SO BORED with much of it that I actually considered leaving early, but I wanted to see if anything better might occur. Unfortunately, nothing ever did. I would have to guess that all these other people who are giving this sack-of-trash film fantastic reviews are the same ones who like to act just as obnoxiously themselves. I could never claim to be above anyone in this world, and so I won't pretend to be outraged. But I know that I would never waste my time watching this Borat character again. In fact, I'd like my money back for the movie ticket. Sacha Cohen, there were a few funny things in this film, but YOU SUCK for what you did to all those people."

The misanthropy, misogyny, xenophobia, racism, bigotry and more, are palpable. Cohen and Co. seem to forget that it is, indeed, in humanity's job description to be fallible, stupid and cruel: we are a product of our environment. However social mores preclude the sane majority among us from acting out our foibles in public. I don't even want to know the ugly place from whence come the sad auteurs of this waste. Is that where they acquired their taste for coprophagia? The puerile filmmakers would do well to consider the profound difference between laughing at vs. laughing with one's audience.

"Ricky_Roma__","Null","7","12","5 August 2007"," A very funny movie film
","I like the fact that so many people tried to get themselves removed from the Borat film. Look, you got caught being a sexist, or a racist, or a gigantic pussy  just live with it; that's the whole point of Borat, to expose people's prejudices and idiocy with a sly wink of complicity. Sure Sacha Baron Cohen helped put the noose round your neck, but you chose to hang yourself.<br/><br/>The scene that makes me laugh the most in Borat is the dinner scene where the Kazakh reporter is invited to a posh Southern dinner party. At first he embarrasses himself in a minor way by asking whether one of the guests is a retard and by questioning the attractiveness of one of the women, but despite this the hostess is still optimistic. When Borat excuses himself to go to the toilet, she confidently states that it wouldn't take much to civilise this uncouth individual  he could be Americanised in no time. But then Borat returns with a pile of poo in a bag  his poo. This causes red faces aplenty, but still the hostess tries to muddle through. She even shows Borat how to defecate properly. But it's only when a black prostitute comes a knocking at the door that the hostility begins. Somehow defecating in a bag, calling someone a retard and calling a guest ugly is acceptable (albeit in an exasperating kind of way), but the presence of a black person in this Southern haven is beyond the pale. Nothing is more offensive than this.<br/><br/>Another scene that jabs at America's dark underbelly is the rodeo sequence. Yeah, Borat's cries of jingoistic encouragement are amusing, but it's the exchange between Borat and the cowboy that's more revealing. This fool spouts nonsense about killing all the Iraqis and then suggests that all of America's homosexuals should be removed too. He even says something along the lines that 'they' (he takes it upon himself to speak for the country) should all be strung up. And this is what makes Borat such a great character. By acting like such an idiot he puts everyone at their ease. And it's only when people are comfortable that the truth comes spilling from their mouths.<br/><br/>Another painful truth is the misogyny that is present in certain sections of American society. The frat boys, for instance, spout nonsense about men being better than women. Indeed, after the tearful revelation that Pamela Anderson is not a virgin, they tell a distraught Borat that he's better than any female. For all the progress that Western society has made, it still hasn't really got that far. And also in the frat boy sequence, the drunken idiots claim that the minorities have the most power. What the hell have they been smoking? Doubtless, later in life, when their marriages fall apart and their careers go nowhere, they'll blame the Jews, the gays and the blacks for their failures. They'll do anything but take a hard look at themselves.<br/><br/>A less insightful sequence that had me chuckling was the one on the New York subway. I just love how willing New Yorkers are to tell someone to go f*** themselves. Here in London, Borat's acts would only be greeted by looks of bemusement and the odd muttered insult. New Yorkers, though, are perfectly happy to get in someone's face. And there's an even funnier bit on the streets where a New Yorker, backed into a corner by Borat, tells the Kazakh to get out of his face, that he'll pop him in the balls if he doesn't back away (?!?). Quite why this individual would chose to pop Borat in the balls, I'm not sure (there are so many easier places to pop), but the humourless 'get out of my face' aggression that is particular to New York never fails to put a smile on my lips.<br/><br/>Something else that put a smile on my lips was the naked wrestling scene. There are few things less joyous in life than two men fighting in the buff ('my moustache still tastes of your testes', says Borat later on). And I love the way that Borat's penis is obscured by a massive black letterbox. You just know that Borat has been in the editing room, trying to make himself look as good as possible. But although the homoerotic grappling garners laughs aplenty, there's a wonderful little moment that is easy to miss. The fight spills out into the hotel and they even get into a lift. But while most of the people run out in horror, one man remains  he stares passively forward, desperately trying not to lose his dignity.<br/><br/>But although the film points its finger at the numerous freaks and idiots it encounters along the way, it also points its finger at the audience. Just how willing are we to buy into this myth of Kazakhstan  a place where old ladies are 34, where cattle live in houses with their owners and where men snog their sisters (and who are also prostitutes). Few things give us greater pleasure than a false sense of superiority. Our lives may be rubbish, we think, but at least we don't have it this bad. Therefore you can't help but ask yourself why you're laughing at some of these jokes  am I really that far removed from the homophobic cowboy or the misogynistic frat boys? My excuse is that I'm a jerk. What's yours?"

The movie fails when Baron Cohen plays both the fool and the satirist acting as a fool.<br/><br/>The journey across country in an ice cream truck is one of the few elements of wit without being offensive. Of course these days offensive sells."

","This movie had a very good concept to it and hearing it made me think it would be great. The only truly funny parts were the people he was talking to: the redneck at the rodeo was obviously ignorant and some of the people(like the one girl at the house) actually showed genuine caring and was probably hurt to see that it was a practical joke on her. The fight scene where they were both naked went way too far and sadly that was representative of this movie. It was a horrible let down and for the few(and right minded) people who dislike jackass do not see this movie.

There is a lot of really funny parts, a couple really stupid parts, then some parts that make you go ""if this wasn't planned ahead of time, they never would have gotten out of jail"".<br/><br/>The reason I say it is an example of American stupidity, is that so many people IN the movie just didn't catch on. Once they did though, they were either angry, or too confused to do anything but go along with it. The fact that some of the people tried to sue Fox or any of the actors/writers just baffles me.

","There is no doubt that the movie is extremely funny, largely due to extraordinary performance of the protagonist and of several supporting actors. But it lacks the depth, the insight, and the critical strength of truly great comedies. Rather than exploring the plausible (and potentially comical) conflicts arising from Borat's contact with the United States, the authors' humor aims at ridiculing the Other (the poor, uneducated, and misbehaved Kazakhi) for the benefit of audiences who will identify themselves with the comfortable, proper, and wealthy Self (i.e., the United States of America).<br/><br/>Ultimately, this is a trivial and vulgar attempt at establishing the ostensible superiority of American culture, society, and lifestyle over a country that is depicted in unrealistic and unnecessarily derogatory tones.

Imagine how hard must be to make a movie when people calls the cops 91 times? Or to be hit by so many bodyguards?

"looneyfarm","3","5","8","16 July 2007"," Plainly repulsive
","To my understanding, the merits of Borat are supposed to be two-fold: 1) despite his outlandish personality, the character Borat is based on a real, existing person, and 2) Borat's racism and sexism is supposed to reveal parallel attitudes in USA.<br/><br/>The movie Borat fails on both counts. I don't care if Borat was inspired by an actual person, or if Sacha Baron Cohen is, despite Borat's oft-voiced Antisemitism, Jewish. I am saying this because Baron Cohen has fabricated an entire Kazakh national identity similar to the repulsive character, and it isn't funny, because the way Kazakhs are shown is not true to life. You're not given a chance to look at these people and say, 'It's funny, because that's how it really is there,' because it simply is not a truthful picture of any Eastern European folks. The filmmakers merely rely on the outrageousness of the situations. Moreover, it enforces existing small-minded attitudes towards foreign peoples and it's really a shame.<br/><br/>As said, this disgusting protagonist, what the filmmakers seem to see as the stereotypical Eastern European guy is supposed to be in unison with the underlying attitudes of Americans. Problem is, only a few racist or sexist Americans are to be found in the movie. Most Americans seen are more than willing to accept Borat and his sidekick, and want to show what hospitable folks Americans really are, but the filmmakers exploit this trust to reach their own, suspicious goals.<br/><br/>Here comes another worrying element in the film. First of all, to be honest, whenever I am watching a hidden camera show (which Borat essentially is most of the time, as the non-actors appearing in the movie were tricked to do so) in the vein of Candid Camera, I find myself wondering what it would be like if they would not limit themselves to harmless little pranks, but put their victims into an extremely uncomfortable situation. Well, the filmmakers of Borat truly have freed themselves from such silly restrains. The victims of Borat are bullied to boiling point, which takes varying amounts of time, but what becomes clear is that wherever Borat goes, he is supposed to cause havoc. The further you watch the movie and the more you read the interviews with its creators, it becomes obvious that they wear every called police patrol, every forceful tackle by security like a badge of honour.<br/><br/>It seems to be impossible for Baron Cohen to use the premise of the film to extract subtle, poignant humour from situations in which the cultures collide. Instead, Baron Cohen and his company have reduced themselves to mere a**holes and aim for the lowest common denominator, complete with the tiring scenes in which the filmmakers assume that the naked body of an ugly man is supremely hilarious, especially if it is wrestling with another ugly man."
"prwhittle","Null","5","8","10 April 2007"," Is it because they is American?
","The majority of critics, with the noble exceptions of Matthew Bond in The Mail on Sunday and Phillip French in the Observer, have been wetting themselves over the Borat movie, which opened last week, although from the mountain of press it has received it seems to have been with us for months. The effect of all this hype has been to deflate most of the gags  seeing it this weekend, it all felt awfully familiar.<br/><br/>More importantly, the film fails in what was surely its main aim  to ridicule any American unfortunate enough to fall into Baron Cohen's trap. Other than some chilling scenes at a rodeo, and a crass fraternity party which was obviously set up, all the people he meets are unfailingly polite, non-judgemental and open to him as an outsider. In particular, a group of feminists show quite remarkable restraint in the face of imbecilic provocation, and a dinner party group similarly behave with the utmost civility even when faced with the character's unspeakable rudeness.<br/><br/>So the joke  hey, look at these dumb Yanks  rebounds completely, and in an odd way, ends up at the expense of the European audiences watching. Could this be why, at the end of the screening I went to, there was an oddly mirthless, joyless atmosphere? A review by The New Culture Forum - http://www.newcultureforum.org.uk"

","There was quite a lot of uproar in regards to this film, and anyone who watches would see why. I honestly think that it isn't Sacha Baron Cohen, who was absolutely hilarious in character Borat, but the ugly racism that he uncovered on his trip. However, that was the only deepness within this gut-busting comedy. Not for years have I seen a comedy film that has had me laughing as hard as I was watching this. You could consider these jokes as being likewise to the Jackass or any other gross-out comedy, but this has intelligence & a style all of its own. Cohen touched the screen with a marvelous comedy that I don't think he can ever do again because of infamous popularity & cult status. Granted he was sued many times over, had the cops called on him nearly 100 times during production & caused an enormous amount of controversy in the press, he succeeded in making a cinematic classic & deserves his film to watched for years to come. Although, some of the jokes will age the film, I don't feel this film will ever get old, but will be rediscovered by new generations of cult comedy film lovers."

There are for me some sensitive issues with the film towards the end, some graphic scenes that are not normally shown in the TV show version of Sascha's show. Those I wish had not been in there, and I felt like I had to not tell my wife about the refrigerator incident, since she wasn't looking at the screen at the time.

"Quinoa1984","10","19","43","3 November 2006"," most fearless, vulgar, and successful satire of the year
","Even before I saw Borat: Cultural Learning of... I knew what I was in for. Sacha Baron Cohen's Borat on Da Ali G Show is possibly the most consistently funniest character of the lot of his creations. Just the theme music and the opening images of him running after a truck and swimming in a pool are funny. It's not hard for me to figure out why- Cohen gets what it is to lampoon current times- bring out the worst in people without even really trying. This is a tactic that is, of course, Mel Brooks inspired, as he was once quoted as saying of his film the Producers ""my film rises *below* vulgarity."" Once you see Borat you'll see what I mean, and if you've never watched the show don't fret, you may still find it to be a truly funny comedy on its own.<br/><br/>What's even more genius is how Cohen even figures in a storyline, however thin, to his movie. It would be one thing if it was just random vignettes spliced together, which could still make a great time. But there's a road-movie quality to the picture, as Borat and his friend Azamat Bagatov, go off to make a documentary about the US-of-A for his homeland of Kazakhstan. He suddenly comes across Baywatch- particularly Pamela Anderson- and finds his ultimate goal, to make her his wife by any means necessary (which includes, of course, bagging her, literally). So this becomes the template for the picture, and which leads to not only great comic scenes, including little ones that strike up a lot of good lines and gags (i.e. antique shop; the ""gypsey"" yard sale), but the kind of outrageous sequences that make my sides hurt thinking about them. The rodeo, the bed & breakfast (that might be my absolute favorite), and of course the ""running of the Jews"". Of course, complications come along, and sad times, but there could still be hope just yet- perhaps by Jesus? <br/><br/>All of this outrageousness would work a lot less if not for two main factors- 1) Cohen has a mind that never stops, and so his Borat is always on the move with a line or a small gag that ends up becoming part of the fold of the rest of the film (the retard line, heh), so the improvisation is at the highest caliber. 2) the people that he sets up are not even necessarily set-up all that well; what you see really is what you get, and not without too much by way of him 'tricking' these people. There was recently a small blurb in a Newsweek magazine where one of the people complained, after getting fired, that Cohen made him look bad. How can this be though if the person, among many others, don't get that it's a joke for a SECOND? It's almost a shame that (possibly) there will never be another round of Borat material after this. Like Andy Kaufman, soon Cohen's personalities will be known all too well, and will lose their flavor. But in the meantime, we do have this film, which is a kind of near-priceless work of satire by someone who has no shame, or rather has no shame in how far he goes with the material.<br/><br/>In other words, even if you don't think you might be much of a fan, give it a chance and see what might spark up. Borat, for all of his little quirks and un-knowable ways around him (e.g. the result of him going to the bathroom in a mannered Southern home), is never really a mean person, and with one exception of a violent outburst (you'll know it when you see it) is a kind of bumbling fool of a character too. Still, this doesn't stop Cohen, through Borat, showing what ugly things racism and stereotyping are in America, and in a sense this is kind of like a near-masterpiece compendium of the state of America right now. That we can at least laugh at it is a good sign, and all apart of the kind of Brooksfilm vein Cohen is descending from wonderfully. JINGJAMESH!"

My head was hurting once I stopped laughing,and my cheeks gave me severe pain. But mind you,this is the most offensive and racist comedy too.Its remarks and its suggestive content is gonna make at least someone in the crowd angry.<br/><br/>The TV Reporter of Kazakhstan,BORAT introduces his country and all the great stuff you can do in his country.He shows you his hometown around.You can play ping pong,disco,have sex,curse,offend,sun-bathe,and all that,while introducing the #2 or 3 or 4 prostitute in all of Kazakhstan,who happens to be his sister.He is then assigned to go to the country he loves, US&A,to discover the cultural and social world of the ""Best Country in the World"".He gets his documentary crew and heads to the States,and then begins his wild,insane,and silly encounters with the natives and their world,as a cultural Learnings for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan.But instead of doing what he was suppose to do,he goes off searching for Pamela Anderson and to propose to her so that he could take her back to his glorious country.<br/><br/>It's a merciless,shameless comedy.And I think this is something more original than anything I've seen in the last passing years.A comedy at 80 minutes plus,with every single minute worth a laugh.I say save all your money for this graphically offensive,explicit and the most insanely wild laugh riot.Because you may have go back and watch it again and again until you give up laughing.I've already planned to watch it again once it's officially released.And boy,what moolahs it will make.It's a phenomenon of a new kind.And you thought JACKASS was funny?Forget that,here's something that will not only come to you as a racist film but as a film that you won't find anywhere else,cuz no film will make you laugh this hard and be as daring and original as this. I think I'm going crazy.I've gotta go watch it again and I can't wait for it to release.Any more free screenings or festivals and I'm there if it's showing. <br/><br/>The Dialogues are ingenious and utterly laugh out loud hilarious.It's phenomenal work.I loved the script.It's main purpose is to make you laugh like you've never laughed in your entire life watching a film.It's a miracle of a comedy.<br/><br/>Cohen is ,I don't know,unbelievable?I see of no reason why he should be overlooked at the next year's Academy Awards.If not that,he will surely win the MTV awards for the sake of the audiences.Whatever's gonna happen to this film at the box office,one thing is for sure,it will break a bone or two after it ends.I know I broke a few while laughing my butt off.Truly original comedy with method acting at its best.<br/><br/>So,please for the sake of Borat,look/see his movie-film or else he'll be execute by his government."

Trough this supposedly serious setting the dark humor shines even more - showing Borat as an anti-semite, Americans as some hicks or just racists, that he is ""unintentionally rude"" and what have you... which all adds to the total obscenity that makes this movie the entertaining dark comedy that it is. And in it all that naked hotel room scene and other (pick your favorite!) are just the icing on the cake.<br/><br/>All in all the movie does a very good job being an absolutely disgusting, rude comedy, and for those that like this kind of thing it will certainly have an appeal just like ""Brüno"" and ""The Dictator"". Sasha Baron Cohen follows trough in those movies much the same way he did with Borat, without ripping off anything or recycling old jokes. I think his approach to all these movies is the fact that slowly but surely the audience of ANY entertainment gets numbed by copycats, reboots, remakes, re-everything... so to construct this movie he had to use a tank instead of a hammer, and that's the point: something new, something totally obscene to spice up the already present originality and ultimately that all boils down to first- rate entertainment somewhere down the line."

He is basically criticizing Americans attitudes toward something different or not the ""norm"" and it's evident by the awkward situations he sets up, the reactions he gets (almost always what he expects i.e. negative), and peoples hatred toward this movie; which is ironically the reaction he was expecting but thankfully there are some people out there who do get it.<br/><br/>The half truth of the truth that I mentioned before is that this movie is kind of gross.

""Borat"" doesn't have a classic scene like ""Dubya"" has (who could ever forget that achingly funny scene where the military police come looking for the draft dodger Dubya but can't find him, as he is hiding under his bed? Of course, when Dubya comes crawling out from under his bed and utters his by now trademark catch-phrase ""Mission accomplished"", does the whole cinema fall about laughing helplessly) but it has many moments that approach the former movie's hilarity.<br/><br/>For instance-when Borat stays at a Jewish American family's bed and breakfast and expresses patently absurd beliefs about them. For many people, the funniest scene is the gross out moment when Borat unintentionally engages in a ""69"" type position with a morbidly obese man.<br/><br/>This is a very funny but provocative and ill-mannered pseudo-documentary about a bigoted foreigner in the US. Of course, that he gets away with his dreadful behavior reflects badly on the real Americans he encounters (most of the people in this movie are not actors but real people/dupes). In fact, the truly dreadful people are the ones Borat encounters, not him, as he's not exactly real, is he?<br/><br/>This is writer/performer Sacha Baron Cohen at his best. I think he has brought his TV show (""Da Ali G show"") to life on the big screen with this movie.

","Unbelievably hilarious and clever. Sacha is an amazing actor and Borat is a genius character (about 7 viewings)"
"claudiamcc","10","4","6","27 March 2008"," To me,it was hilarious.I don't know why everyone hated it.
","I've read loads of comments on IMDb that hated the movie for its strong crude humour,discrimination of Jews and Gypsies,and grossness. I don't care if lots of Americans didn't like it,I actually thought Borat,who was played by Sasha Baron Cohen,was a hilarious scream who was trying to prove to America that we all need to have a good laugh at something every now and then and learn to not take everything so seriously ALL THE TIME.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong,even I thought Borat was a freak at first when the movie came out in theaters.But when I got the film on DVD,I laughed so hard because everything in the movie throughout was brilliant though not intelligent.<br/><br/>Borat was better than Jackass.The stunt guys in Jackass were,well,jackasses.Sasha Baren Cohen has incredible comedic talent, he's the funniest actor I've seen in years,though I liked Jim Carrey as well,I think the actor who played Borat was pure genius in comedy. The American characters in the movie weren't that amusingly funny,but so far Borat made the movie funnier.<br/><br/>One thing that surprised me was Sasha Baren Cohen got hundreds of lawsuits from people in the movie for being filmed unexpectedly and humiliation of Kazacstan,and there's also been a controversy about Borats comment in the movie about the war in Iraq.<br/><br/>But Borat is a character who in the story is politically incorrect in a hilarious way.So I say it's okay to laugh at an un-PC movie."
"woods_mat","6","10","20","29 November 2006"," Racism and Satire aside.. it really wasn't that funny
","Borat has somehow managed to get a fairly high score. There has been much talk from it's critics of it being racist and needlessly offensive. The defenders of it claim it is all satire and people need to 'chill out.' <br/><br/>The portrayal of Borat as a Kazakhstani is fairly generic. If you were to go into the film thinking Cohen is expecting you to see it is an accurate portrayal then the joke is on you. It's obviously exaggerated, as most of the movie is.<br/><br/>On top of this (as in any movie showing 'how stupid Americans are') the people he interviews and their reactions have obviously been selected to accentuate this exaggerated approach. Some scenes are so exaggerated they would be considered slap stick, and then the slap stick moments are so amateur that it might as well be an episode of 'punkt' or 'candid camera' If you like Jackass, you might like this, but it's probably far too tame.<br/><br/>The other thing that many have been mentioning is whether certain parts were staged or whether it was 'all real' Most people have caught on that the scene with Pamela Anderson is staged. The thing to ask is... was it all staged? I wouldn't be surprised. There are 'reports' of people in the movie taking Cohen to court, but whether these are actually part of the marketing and publicity of the film is yet to be revealed.<br/><br/>The main thing you want to know is if the film is worth seeing. It comes across as an extended version of a TV skit. The first half hour is entertaining enough, the remainder of the movie is a bit flat.<br/><br/>My Advice: Don't see it at the cinema. It might be worth hiring the DVD when it comes out if you're really bored and can't find anything else."
"FrankICURN","1","15","33","9 November 2006"," Very tasteless
","I expected to see a great comedy. Instead, I'd found a movie, which I can call in 2 words ""Extremely tasteless"". Jokes were on the level of last range of porno movies. Religious jokes? Is this in good taste? I doubt. Besides those remarks, there were several serious mistakes: Language - in Kazakhstan people speak Kazakh, for international contacts Republic of Kazakhstan officials use Russian, though Kazakh is an official language of the UN. Why Borat speaks Polish/Russian I don't understand. Kzazakhstan's National Anthem - not US National Anthem melody and NOT such words as in the movie. Again: waste of time and money."

","I've had funnier poops than Borat: Cultural Learnings of America Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakstan.<br/><br/>Where to begin? Sacha Baron Cohen is NOT a Kazakhstani TV talking head dispatched to report on the United States. He is instead a rather ridiculous presence, not to mention an arguably poopy comedian. There were times when I felt like I was watching a rerun of The Crotch Chronicles. And what's with the suit, Chuckles?<br/><br/>Also, the whole ""Pamela Lee playing herself"" thing is getting old. She ain't no Della Reese. They needed some real comic relief. You know who they should have brought in as comic foil? Bull the bailiff from Night Court. Sock it to me!<br/><br/>One thing I will say is that Borat: Cultural Learnings of America Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakstan has some pretty crazy writing. It was making my brain switch gears back and forth like a dysfunctional slinky. Imagine that big Borat head on an IMAX screen.<br/><br/>Overall, I do not recommend Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakstan."

The only people laughing in the cinema i watched this in were foreign and presumably from Kazakhstan as i couldn't understand a word they were saying to each other in between laughter. <br/><br/>We've all watched an American sitcom and there's programmed laughter every time someone opens their mouth (funny or not). Well that's what this film was like for the foreign minority in the cinema i was in and unfortunately (not being from Kazakhstan) myself and colleagues could not join in. <br/><br/>The entire film is an inside joke with nothing for the general public and i'm a huge fan of comedy. I've seen good comedy and bad but this is by far the worst. Sacha Cohen only proves he can be extremely stupid but not funny. <br/><br/>If you are English or American and above the age of 5 this film is not for you. Mr Bean and ""Dumb and Dumber"" (if you want to laugh at someone stupid!), Laurel & Hardy, Smith & Jones, The Young Ones, Peter Kay, Police Academy, Friends, Frasier, Austin Powers, Scary Movie 1, Will and Grace etc.. are far better and free on UK television! They are not necessarily great for everyone but believe me when i say ""they are better"". <br/><br/>In summary: ""Borat is the worst film on the cinema at the moment and should be renamed Prat"""
"gspro15198","1","16","36","6 November 2006"," don't believe the hype
","i decided to go to this movie with a few friends, i had not seen the character of Borat before but since he is a ""popular"" television character i thought what the hey and merrily paid my £5 to sit in the theatre. the credits started to roll and from there on in i was subjected to the most puerile base humour, well humour actually implies that it is a funny film, it is not. i am a pretty open minded person as my friends can testify but i just did not get the comedy with this film. one joke stretched painfully beyond breaking point, lots of obviously staged meetings with American people where, as the socially inept Borat, Cohen, acts stupid, behaves stupid and fundamentally is not funny. i must admit that the idea behind the film is very good, but why does it need to be told in the form of a road trip movie with all the clichés that genre affords. from the opening few minutes where we meet Borat's home village and such luminaries as the town rapist it feels like Cohen might as well just hit you with a 2x4 forced comedy stick. and as anyone who has actually been hit with a stick can confirm, it is no laughing matter. but on the flip side my friends found this film to be funny i could hear the occasional titter of embarrassment from their general direction. but if the plan is made clear to shock then the last thing that can be done is get me shocked... a bit more subtlety near the beginning and this film could have been salvaged."

","How to adequately describe Sasha Baron Cohen's BORAT: CULTURAL LEARNINGS OF AMERlCA FOR MAKE BENEFIT GLORIOUS NATION OF KAZAKHSTAN? How about lame? And exploitive.<br/><br/>And vulgar.<br/><br/>Amateurish.<br/><br/>Cheesy.<br/><br/>Sleazy.<br/><br/>Anti-Semitic.<br/><br/>Racist.<br/><br/>Hateful.<br/><br/>Homophobic.<br/><br/>Corrupt.<br/><br/>Insultingly contemptible.<br/><br/>And most of all: Unfunny. Excruciatingly unfunny. Extremely excruciatingly unfunny.<br/><br/>Is there anything positive that can be said about BORAT-BLAH-BLAH-BLAH? There sure is: It's short. Yet, at 84 minutes it still drags on interminably. And the amazing thing is that even though writer/star Cohen and his director Larry Charles filmed many hours of material, this sloppy hodge-podge of cheap shots and crude gags is apparently the best they could scrape up and slap together. This is the funniest stuff they could find? Apparently so. But when you start with garbage, you can't expect haute cuisine -- but something at least non-toxic would have been nice.<br/><br/>Even marking the continued slow decline of the so-called mockumentary, a genre of comedy pioneered with films like Rob Reiner's THIS IS SPINAL TAP and Woody Allen's TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN and ZELIG, BORAT is nothing less than an embarrassment. Evidently, it is meant to be a satire of reality TV and/or crude travel documentaries, but BORAT has more in common with the tactless trash made by pseudo-journalists like Michael Moore. Like Moore and his ilk, when true creative inspiration is nonexistent, Cohen sets up real people in booby-trapped situations designed to mock and humiliate them. And then he hides his cunning dishonesty and lack of ethics behind the claim he is using deception to find out how people really act and what they truly believe. Truth through lies. How Orwellian. And beyond this hypocrisy is its sheer cowardice and laziness in attacking easy targets. The result is less like cinema verite and more like a nihilistic ""Candid Camera."" <br/><br/>British comic Cohen plays Borat Sagdiyev, supposedly a TV reporter from Kazakhstan, a poor country in Eastern European which inexplicably has a TV station, but no toilets. Consistency isn't one of this film's strong points: Borat's hobby is collecting humiliating Polaroids of women on the john, yet later he seems to have no idea what a toilet is or how to use it. And though he can quote Clint Eastwood movies, he apparently doesn't know what a turtle is. Borat's level of intelligence and sophistication fluctuates according to how low the film wants to go for a joke -- and there seems to be no end to the depths. Anyway, Borat heads to the United States to make his documentary and prove America is an ugly place; but ultimately the film only proves that our immigration laws are far too lax.<br/><br/>In an insipid one-note performance, Cohen milks the ignorant peasant bit far beyond its meager credibility. His whole shtick is stolen from Bronson Pinchot's Balki Bartokomous, which he copied from Andy Kaufman's Latka Gravas, who imitated Bill Dana's Jose Jimenez, who owed a lot to Chico Marx. All and all, it has all been done better, and with greater affection by real immigrants like Yakov Smirnoff. While each progression has made the basic character increasingly dim, Cohen takes the archetype a giant leap downward by making his characterization utterly hateful and devoid of charm. The sweet naivete that has always defined the foreign visitor stereotype is all but gone with Cohen draining his smirking and leering Borat of all traces of innocence. You'd be hard pressed to find a more contemptible lout anywhere this side of ""The Jerry Springer Show."" <br/><br/>Worse, Cohen is an opportunist, a rapist/con man who time after time is shown gaining the good graces of innocent people who welcome him and befriend him, only to have their kindness repaid through ridicule and exploitation. Cohen is being praised as a creative genius when it is all too apparent he is an immoral manipulator. And since the entire film builds to an attempt to kidnap actress Pamela Anderson, you can add celebrity stalker to the list.<br/><br/>But the nauseating thing about BORAT is not Cohen's predatory approach to comedy or even the film's cold-blooded indifference to human dignity -- or for that matter even the public's willingness to once again to be treated so condescendingly -- but that this whole unsightly mess has been embraced by critics who should know better. When the Sasha Baron Cohens and the Tom Greenes and the Michael Moores and the South Park guys and all the other cultural bullies spew their bile at the audience, their snide, antisocial sadism always seems to be forgiven because ""Come on, guys, it's a just joke."" <br/><br/>""Is nice!"" says Borat. No, it's not nice. It's pathetic."

","I did not enjoy this movie. That's my review in a nutshell. Though there were a few 'belly-laugh' moments I just found it to be mostly a collection of badly put together mildly humorous scenes. There were a few scenes that were just too gross and over the top, like the naked wrestling. It was obviously there for shock value but it misfired as far as I'm concerned. Cohen's mockery (and that's what it was really, even if he is a Jew himself) of that gracious Jewish couple was a bad choice to say the least, and I found it embarrassing and offensive though I am not a Jew myself. Not many people laughed at that. I resent the claim that if you don't find this funny then you just don't get it or lack a sense of humor. I do have a sense of humor and I do 'get it'. It's just that it is not worth the effort. I wish I had spent my Saturday afternoon at another movie instead. This movie is riding the hype of it's marketing and its amazingly positive reviews.

","In 1999-2000 Ali G was the funniest thing on UK TV (late night Channel 4 - remember?), with Baron Cohen brilliantly dissecting the thorny issue of race whilst being hilarious to boot. This didn't last, however, as on his own stand-alone show (and film) the Ali G character quickly becoming a tired cliché. <br/><br/>Then came Borat - funny, original, sharp ... alas, he's gone the same way. Let's get it straight - this film is bad, really bad. At times it looks as if the film will use Borat to expose the hidden underbelly of American life, to our amusement. Instead, Cohen opts for the easy option - sex gags (every 5 mins), gay gags, women gags, disabled gags, 'funny foreigner' gags - that's reeeeeeeeaaaaaaal original Sacha. This laziness extends to the material itself - half the scenes here have already been shown in pared-down form on the UK TV show (the dinner, the rodeo etc.). <br/><br/>That said, I give the film a '2' as there are some interesting things here - the horribly obnoxious New Yorkers for instance, or the insight we get into the right-wing fundamentalist types. But these are few and far between - both the above mentined scenes end with an oh-so hilarious piece of slapstick/physical comedy.<br/><br/>In short, if jokes about faeces, penises, vaginas, 'retards', prostitutes and masturbation are your thing then go see this film.

The film was just provocative for the sake of being provocative, and nothing more.<br/><br/>I can fully understand Kazachstan's reaction to the film. In the past, the character of Borat was used to highlight the worst facets of the American (and sometimes British) culture. The focus, in the past, was never on Kazachstan itself. In the movie, however, there is too little focus on America and too much focus on Kazachstan."

This is a fantastic Mockumentary comedy with ""Yuksmash"" Borat Sagdiyev (Golden Globe winning Sacha Baron Cohen) of Kazakstan explaining his home life and traditions, including ""Running of Jew"", they fear the Jews. Basically he travels to America, New York to film his journeys to learn the American way. He changes his mind of filming there though, when he discovers his wife has died, and finds a new love, CJ Parker/Pamela Anderson from Baywatch. So he begins a long journey to Hollywood, California, with his friend Azamat Bagatov (Ken Davitian) to find Pamela, and along the way encounters many hilarious antics including punks, cowboys, politician types, drunk jocks, almost insane Christian believers, and Jews (he is obviously frightened). This is an unmissable film, and I have honestly never laughed so much at a film so much, at the moment when Borat and Azamat are naked and rolling around fighting and running around the hotel. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay, it won the British Comedy Award Ronnie Barker Award (writing), and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy. Sacha Baron Cohen was number 8 for Ali G on The 100 Greatest TV Characters, Borat was number 24 on The 100 Greatest Funny moments, along with Bruno at number 77 and Ali G at number 6, Borat was number 17 on The World's Greatest Comedy Characters, with Ali G at number 6, and Sacha Baron Cohen (as Ali G) was number 12 on Britain's Favourite Comedian.

"jdcaldwell40","3","9","18","5 November 2006"," Bad movie
","I have to admit, the movie started out to be possibly the funniest movie I have ever seen. Borat in his home country for the first 10 minutes were priceless. However, the movie traveled down a dark path and became nothing but perverted antics. The accent got old, and the perversion was boring. Not recommended for viewers looking for a movie with an actual plot and original scenes. If the movie had more of a political and social influx of ideas, then it would have been much more appealing to me. I give Cohen a nod for trying as hard as he did, but many more ideas could have been implemented. I know this movie is going to be popular with a lot of people, but I was not impressed."
"sarahqin","1","12","26","10 January 2007"," I voted Borat for the worst movie 2006
","Borat, a long-awaited movie to one of my friends, was finally screened at the end of this year. Due to my friend's recommendation (I should say he was absolutely a fan of Ali G before he saw this movie), I went to the movies and tried my best to finish the whole movie without attempting to flee the theater though I really wanted toIn this movie, I saw nothing but very low-class comic ingredients like naked body, maniacs, jerks,freaks,whatever you name this kind of people. I could not find any ingenious things featured in previous Ali G shows. I really want to tell Sacha and his whole team: being provocative, controversial does not always make yourself outstanding. In most of the cases, make yourself look stupid and inferior.<br/><br/>There are so many scenes that annoy me a lot, like take s**t down the Trump Tower, run through a Hall with nothing on, tell a Congress man that the cheese is made from his wife's tit and even show obscene photos to a elegant woman. I mean all these behaviors are totally unacceptable in our daily life if we consider ourselves educated enough. I don't think anyone could tolerate this kind of behavior. It is not funny at all, it is insulting, humiliating and villainous. As a normal person, I don't take the degeneracy as a way to show you are distinct or humorous and what's more,I don't think well-educated people would do either.<br/><br/>To me, the best and profound comical factor is that you successfully make people meditate after bursting into laughter rather than making them feel sick. Comody is what makes our world more lovely and make people more grateful to what they have owned today. It is not something that builds up happiness at the expense of other kind people or even a country sort of already isolated from the industrialized countries.<br/><br/>We are happy when we see wonderful things and we don't make fun of people when they are in trouble. The movie ""Borat"" completely overturns our existent moral standards, devastates the social conscience and set a very bad example about how to be a decent man. It even raises the question whether we should let this kind of movies into our movie theaters without judging its deadly negative effect on our young generation just in the name of freedom of mind or freedom of speech!<br/><br/>Last but not least thing I've got to say is that show appropriate reverence to people and different cultures, only by this way will people respect you!"

","First, i really laugh at some scenes even though they were horrible. But jokes on bad things happening right now around the world???, incest,pedophiles, woman abuse, poverty... Those things are not to make fun, do you laugh when you see a woman beaten or a child raped??. The only passable (or mediocre at his best) parts of the film where those that showed the proud and selfconfort in what north Americans live, and those explain why they got a ""warlord in the white house"" the best sentence in the film, if not the only one. The dining society scene was so laughable not because Borat's stupid jokes but because those people do really meet for dinner in that way, and if a b1tch entered the pastor would go running like she was a lepper, did Jesus the same or he would say: Let anyone among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone. Well it could be a set up, most scenes were an obvious set up, but others were so bad they must have been for real. You can laugh for a second but you have to recognize that this is trash.

"Knuckle","1","12","26","21 November 2006"," For those of you who missed out on Andy Kaufman...
","Except that Andy Kaufman was a truly brilliant comedian - Sacha Cohen is merely an imitative cretin without the talent or imagination to make his mark on the world of comedy in any meaningful way. It's true that Andy Kaufman's comedy often made its audience uncomfortable (Tony Clifton, anyone?)but what separates Kaufman's routines from this crap is that it did not make discomfort its sole source of comedy. This fine, but important, distinction between the two men is what separates the geniuses from the mewling pukes who exemplify the worst of ""reality"" based entertainment.<br/><br/>In this fantastically horrible pile of trash, Cohen's alter-ego Borat buffoons his way across America and gets those wonderfully credulous everymen to join in making asses of themselves. Borat is not funny enough to sustain an entire film, so what cheaper way is there to pad a meaningless waste of time than to film regular joes acting stupid? He might have tried writing some decent material, but not everyone is cut out for that line of work, lacking either the talent, intelligence or humor to do so. <br/><br/>Sure, sure, I've heard the arguments that by parading about as Borat, and getting regular folks to speak what's really on their minds, Sacha Cohen is exposing anti-Semitism in everyday life, but he does it by lampooning the Kazakhstani people in a way that can best be described as ignorant and bigoted. In fact, if this movie were directed at Jews, it would be declared to be the most objectionable movie to hit the screen since Birth of a Nation.<br/><br/>Even if you ignore the fact that this movie is mean-spirited, ignorant, xenophobic, and imitative, the bottom line is that it also is just not very funny either.<br/><br/>1 out of 10."

","This movie took an interesting movie genre in a new direction and for me fell flat on its face. The only time I laughed were not at the jokes intended but a few moments of sanity displayed by the ""documntary participants"". The portrayal of the knowledge cultural norms and values of Borat were so far fetched and removed from reality made the attempts at humor fall flat for me.<br/><br/>The irony and humor of ""the stranger in a strange land genre"" works best when it points out true distinctions and revaluation's based on differing ""realities"" or world views, be they cultural, gender oriented or age based. Aside from the running gag involving ""personal space"" in Borat's greeting Americans this film was devoid of any of this reality. For me Borat was not entertaining not funny.

"drednm","10","18","43","6 March 2007"," Sacha Baron Cohen Is Hysterically Funny and Yet Moving
","This rude and raucous faux documentary is hysterically funny, scarily penetrating in its look at American culture, and oddly moving.<br/><br/>First off Sacha Baron Cohen is absolutely fabulous. He's got to be the bravest actor who ever lived. He goes basically ""under cover"" as Borat and braves some of the ugliest Americans I've ever seen. All the time he is in character, he probes and cajoles and insults a wide spectrum of Americans who I am afraid mostly come off (in turn) as a batch of crude, smug morons. The view we get of ourselves as a culture is quite, quite chilling.<br/><br/>This is a film that could be deconstructed and analyzed for ages and always come up with something new. The nicest characters Borat meets on his journey across America are the black prostitute and the black street boys. The others are a pack of bigots, humorless drones, and people terrified of him. Borat uncovers an underbelly of mainstream America that is every bit as ugly and filthy and ignorant as the third-world village he so proudly shows us at the beginning of the film. And this is exactly the type of humor that many American viewers didn't get. The humor is always what is seems to be.<br/><br/>For all the anti-Jewish ranting in the film, the fact is that Cohen is a devout Jew. The British comic turns everything upside down but the condescending dolts he meets along his journey only see him as he presents himself. They can't get past the accent, the rumpled suit, the bad hair, the stereotype, etc.<br/><br/>The film is not politically correct and is filled with hilarious bits, sight gags, slapstick, word play, etc. and Baron Cohen is very, very funny. He constantly catches the audience off guard. Just the sight of Borat and his sidekick (Ken Davitian) zooming across America in a 1950s ice cream truck is funny. That they also have a bear as a passenger adds a level of absurdity that goes beyond inspiration in the same way the Marx Brothers did in the 1930s.<br/><br/>Sacha Baron Cohen won a Golden Globe and certainly deserved an Oscar nomination for his incredible portrayal. But I'm afraid this inspired comedy, even though a box-office hit, went over the heads of the establishment.<br/><br/>The ending of the film is surprisingly sweet after the ride Borat has taken us on. Not to be missed!d"

I was more uncomfortable than anything at how embarrassing this must be for everyone involved. I'm not a huge fan of crude humor so that that into consideration but enjoyed the crude funny found in movies like American Pie, 40 days and 40 nights, and even parts of Jack Ass but this was just stupid and not worth watching.

"tpaladino","1","6","11","8 November 2007"," Horrible, horrible film.
","Let me start by saying that I actually like Sacha Baron Cohen and his characters, including Borat. I think that he is a true talent, and that his technique and timing are impeccable.<br/><br/>This film, to me, was a real disappointment. You see, the charm of the television show was that it lambastes a wide cross-section of people, and the audience is pretty much in on the joke. The movie lacked both of these elements. It focused almost exclusively on unsophisticated middle-Americans, who are almost too easy a target for parody, to the point that his pranks lack any kind of diversity or inventiveness and almost begin to seem cruel in many cases. To me, Cohen is at his best when he takes on the cultural elites and those who take themselves far too seriously (feminists, academics, politicians, vegans etc.), not just poor, often well-meaning shlubs who were unlucky enough to encounter Borat and his cameras.<br/><br/>The other major flaw was the fact that Cohen insisted on carrying a bizarre and stinted narrative throughout the movie. Everyone who goes to see this film knows that Borat isn't a real person sent to interview Americans on behalf of Kazakhstan, so the subplot of his slimy producer and their relationship just seems forced and out of place. The worst scenes of the movie are the ones of Borat and the producer arguing. It makes a film that is already struggling that much more difficult to enjoy.<br/><br/>There are surely some laughs to be had, but you are better off buying DVDs of 'The Ali G Show' to see Cohen at his best, rather than wasting time on Borat."
"mimeradio","10","6","11","9 October 2007"," Not for everybody (only everybody who matters)
","Borat is a SATIRICAL movie about prejudice, and love. While Sacha Baron Cohen pretends to be a journalist from Kazakstan, he interviews dozens of people from all walks of life who all share their ""wisdoms"" about America. Some people are turned away from Borat because of it's at times grotesque humor. Sure, Borat is filled with bathroom humor, but that doesn't make it less intelligent. I challenge anyone who watches Borat and does not love it to show me a comedy with more relevant social commentary and funnier scenes. Borat will either have you laughing hysterically, or it will have you with your mouth open in disgust, but either way it will have you. Sacha Baron Cohen is a comic genius."

","This movie has to be one of the funniest of all time. However this humour comes out of the awkward situations that Borat is in and therefore this humiliation is passed to the viewer, making the movie somewhat painful. This movie reveals amazing things about America which someone from outside of the country can appreciate more. I could hardly believe the things that people said and did in this movie and it shows a different side to America which I never knew truly existed. Cohen does this by being racist and sexist himself, however he is joking they are not. His brilliance shines in this one. An awesome movie and definitely worth seeing both for the comedic value and the insight into some racist and sexist American people."
"aemmering","5","6","11","11 July 2007"," A very mixed bag--of garbage
","Regarding one British reviewer who commented that Borat reveals ""a society just brimming with hate"" or whatever, just once, just once I'd like to see some film maker put the damn shoe on the other foot. Preferably a European fed up with his culture's random snobbery, maybe he'd find credibility with old world audiences. Any asshole (like his eminence Michael Moore, for example) can play around with allegedly off the cuff documentary footage to construct his own ugly picture of any society-and I do mean ANY society. How many shots, I wonder, did Mr.Cohen need to take to arrive at his contrived assemblage of supposedly representative vignettes of US manners and mores? Actually, some of Borat's victims seemed enormously tolerant of his bizarre provocations. But interviews with intelligent, pleasant folks wouldn't make for a very funny film, would they? I'm sure there are plenty of brilliant intellects out there (you know who you are, you've never even been to the US, just like your culture hero LVT) who would say that all of us were as dumb as the rodeo guy, since they value their own preconceived ideas about us more than any form of actual observation or interaction. Such persons, when they do actually encounter US visitors, are often wickedly skilled at doing and saying things that will only make these encounters fit into their preconceived notions about what proper transatlantic relationships should be. So many seem to believe that THEY know the true realities of life --they possess the truth with a capital T, and we are only allowed to worship their sacred opinions from afar, never to question, only obey, like good little colonials. I know these things--I've traveled in Europe several times. I have never ceased to be amazed at the sheer arrogance, the rudeness and the supercilious, vicious snobbery I've encountered as an American. In Europe I learned what it felt like to be treated like a minority--such behavior is never excusable, by politics or anything! I do not behave like the stereotypical ugly American. Plenty of Americans do read books, do object to the war in Iraq (isn't it obvious?) and some of us (such as myself) actually know where Kazakhistan is! Its in Central Asia, its a very large country, and the people there don't look like Caucasian Romanians, or European gypsies, either! Cohen is a talented performer who seems not only to be chronically lazy with the cheap laughs-he is also unaccountably addicted to potty humor of the lowest type. He is capable of much more, but perhaps his own issues (being Jewish and foreign, perhaps) prevent him from accessing any 'higher' levels of creativity (higher than the anus, I mean). Having said all this, there are some clever ideas here which get flushed down the drain about 20 minutes into the film. Some of the grossness is actually amusing (even the awful nude wrestling scene, I confess). But the potty humor dilutes the film's satiric impact, and all the random story threads (making fun of absolutely everyone at all times, for example) make the whole deal look like a giant spit wad, composed of bits and pieces of all things good, bad or indifferent. As I said before, Cohen is a talented performer, given the right material, which this certainly isn't.<br/><br/>BTW, if this post sounds like a diatribe (yes, yes I do know what that big word means), it is! This particular innocent, when abroad, was never impressed with old world 'wisdom' or whatever you'd call it. Not that I didn't have pleasant experiences, but somehow the bad stuff always stays longest in the memory....."

","Borat (Baron Cohen) is a reporter from Kazakhshtan (pictured as an undeveloped, savage illiterate uneducated country) that goes to the 'US and A' to make a documentary to import some of the greatness of America. The film shows the funny situations from the culture clash.<br/><br/>The way the film is made is quite unorthodox because there are few actors and the main part of characters are people who really think they are talking to a reporter from Kazakhstan, just a candid camera. It is not surprising the huge controversy aroused as some of the people tricked into the 'documentary' have already sued Cohen.<br/><br/>The film is funny. You will sure laugh at one stage or another. But there are many clichés and stereotypes that Cohen uses as he wishes presenting a subjective vision of society. First of all, he could have used a fake country instead of Kazakhstan. It would not been so easy to trick some of the 'victims' into the 'movie film' but the comical effect would have been the same without offending anyone. Just like Molvania from the guys of the hilarious travel guides from Jetlag Tavel (from which I think Cohen gets some of the inspiration).<br/><br/>Then, there is the Jew issue. Although Borat (and all Kazakhstan according to the movie) is afraid of Jews and hates them profoundly, the film is not offensive to Jews at all. Jews pictured in the film are very nice people and the display of hatred against Jewish is so over stated and absurd that the irony is far from subtle. It cannot be any other way as Cohen is a Jew himself. However this is used as excuse: ""Look, I'm laughing at me making jokes about Jews... now I am legitimated to laugh at anyone as I wish"".<br/><br/>The target of Cohen criticism is clear, the white Christian traditional southern people. He laughs at some evangelists in a church, high class republican southern people, drunk college guys, people attending a Rodeo... using sometimes hidden and sometime obvious insults, always protected by a camera and the ""I am from another culture, you should be respectful"". Some of the people pictured could be idiots but you can find idiots in every single community in the world. In fact, outside the USA the film has been taken as a opportunity to 'laugh at those stupid Americans'.<br/><br/>Overall it is a really funny movie due to the absurd of the situations described and the hilarious acting of Cohen. Not very elegant and often rude but anus, penis and testicles are also part of humour. However, the rhythm of the movie is a little uneven getting more boring as time goes by making the short 80 minutes of movie a little bit too much."

"nick-megoran","4","8","16","20 December 2006"," Clever and complex but ethically disturbing
","Is Borat a clever satire deftly uncovering American prejudices, self-indulgent adolescent vulgarity, or just a plain laugh that should not be taken too seriously? <br/><br/>It must be acknowledged at the start that Borat is a clever film. To pull off the deceptions that Baron Cohen undertakes requires imagination, courage, and some good acting. The primary aim of film companies is to make money, and Borat's producers have cleverly picked both their audiences and targets alike. The groups that Baron-Cohen chooses to make look foolish  such as 'veteran feminists', Kazakhstanis, and drunken frat-boys  are easy targets and also lack the power to hit ticket sales through boycotts. One notable taboo that Borat (thankfully) does not risk transgressing is that against mocking Islam. Most Kazakhs are Muslims, and misogyny and anti-Semitism in Central Asia are commonly legitimised by appeal to discourses of traditional Islam. Borat, however, leaves that subject well alone, even to the point of explicitly denying that he is Muslim ('I follow the hawk', he says). This was a clever move from a commercial point of view. <br/><br/>Borat doesn't generally work as a satire on America. Some scenes are exceptions to this, such as when he hilariously highlights social dysfunction and anomie by attempting to befriend strangers in New York. Likewise, a rodeo evening scene, where Borat declares to a cheering crowd, 'I support your war of terror', is brilliant, cleverly pushing at the limits of American nationalism. However, the endless concentration on bodily parts (genitals and anuses) and functions (sex and defecation) is simply puerile. More worryingly, audiences are encouraged to laugh at sexist abuse rather than confront it in themselves. <br/><br/>Interviewing someone under false pretences should only be done cautiously, rarely, and for some very good reason. Simply to get a laugh, as Borat does, is cheap and at times abusive  and has triggered various complaints from people who appeared in the film and claim they were tricked. For example, the veteran feminists are in a no-win situation when Borat asks them if it is a problem for co-education that women have smaller brains that men. Michael Moore manages to pull it off with his unsettling interview with an ageing Charlton Heston in Bowling For Columbine. Arguably, Baron Cohen did likewise with some of Ali G's covert interviews. Borat, however, fails to work consistently on the level of satire, and the apparent abuse of some participants is ethically disturbing. <br/><br/>So, if its portrayal of the USA is disappointing and even disturbing, how good is Borat's depiction of Kazakhstan?<br/><br/>Central Asia is normally presented in Western film as dangerous. It was a hornet's nest of terrorists in Airforce One, dirty, wild and erotic in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and lawless and dangerous in The World is Not Enough. It has played the similar role of backdrop to danger in a host of lesser-known films and television dramas.<br/><br/>Borat echoes these in painting the region as culturally backwards, but breaks the mould in depicting it as ludicrous. Borat's village, briefly explored at either end of the film, is populated by ridiculous characters doing ridiculous things. The hero himself strives manfully to maintain this reputation in every encounter with Americans.<br/><br/>However, Borat has more in common with these darker films than first meets the eye. Like them, it depends upon the viewer's ignorance about Central Asia. Hollywood-style action films often work by framing scenes with locales that are reasonably familiar to Western viewers (see James Bond in Cuba, London, Istanbul etc) . Like Airforce One and The World is Not Enough, Borat works on exactly the opposite principle, of unfamiliarity.<br/><br/>All of these films rely on people not knowing much about Central Asia. Borat wouldn't be as funny if he claimed to be French, Indian or Chinese, as the stereotyping wouldn't be convincing. Central Asia remains, for most people, not an identifiable place, but a blank space that can easily be filled with the fears, fantasies and prejudices of film-makers and audiences. The producers of Borat show an accurate map of Kazakhstan, but this is a deceptive move, as accuracy generally stops with the cartographic outline. <br/><br/>In contrast to all these films is the excellent 2002 Kazakh-French production, Murat. It is a compelling and superbly made story of an ordinary Kazakh guy, Murat, trying to survive in post-Soviet societal meltdown, sucked inexorably downwards by a cruel cycle of misfortune and injustice. <br/><br/>Murat presents Kazakhstan as both dangerous and ludicrous, but in very different ways to the Western films. It shows how dangerous Kazakhstan can be for ordinary Kazakhs, as capitalism dismantles a social welfare system that was once the envy of 'third world' populations and even some 'first world' women. It depicts how ludicrous 'globalisation' is for a young man on the brink, pushed to become an unwilling killer by the very processes of globalisation hailed by many as the country's future. Whilst Borat is a tragic-comic character, Murat highlights the genuine tragedy of the impoverishment of a region that only 20 years ago had a higher literacy rate than Western Europe, but where now former nuclear physicists can be found driving taxis.<br/><br/>It has been said that analysing humour is like dissecting a frog  no one is particularly interested, and it dies instantly. It may be that I've missed the point, and the joke is thus on me. Borat is an ambiguous film that works on a variety of levels, and to pigeon-hole it with either clear approval or disapproval would be simplistic. However, if pushed to choose between forking out money on Borat or Murat, I'd advise spending it on the latter.

","What are you people smoking? This is the most overrated movie since 'Braveheart!' It's hard-hitting satirical revelations: some prosperous Southerners are genteelly racist, a few old cowboys are homophobic, frat-boys are misogynists. Is there something new here? Some subtlety that I'm missing? 'Subtlety,' Mr. Cohen, the word is 'subtlety'. Oh, you don't? It's pronounced 'suttle-tea.' Oh, you still don't... Well, never mind. The intention is obvious - the Man-from-Mars comes to the ruling civilization, and by making naive mistakes and asking innocent questions underlines the hypocrisy and contradictions of that civilization. That's one of the intentions, anyway. The other, I suspect, was to get as much mileage as possible out of anti-PC, out of misogyny and of mocking poor and retarded people, under the guise of satire. Incidentally, when 'Borat' tries to take on a real PC target, it falls flat. The feminists he confronts are not shrill or unreasonable, and they quickly realize that he is bullsh***ing them, and refuse to play along. Unlike the frat-boys, they refuse to be used."
"zippyflynn2","3","8","16","10 November 2006"," The trailer is better
","What a disappointment, especially after seeing the reviews ""funniest movie ever!"" ""I couldn't stop laughing!"" I'll admit, I thought the trailers were pretty funny but that was it, those were the best jokes. The movie just takes a couple of other much lower brow jokes and beats them to death and they, sadly, weren't as funny as the jokes I had already seen. Frankly, they weren't funny at all. I stopped laughing at poop jokes and sophomoric homophobia jokes when I stopped being a kid. I've seen other Borat skits and thought they were worth a laugh but, like the trailer, they were far better than this film. I got to admit, they did a good job of promoting this movie and even led skeptical me to think the film was going to better than the promise. I really didn't expect Cohen to dive straight into the toilet to find his material. Literally! I also was anticipating more development with the ethnic jokes, as some reviewers had claimed but he never gets out of first gear with them so they remain simple, two dimensional stereotypical embarrassments, far more effective as fuel for the prejudiced and the racist than as satirical commentary. That was a major disappointment. I know Mr. Cohen is Jewish, so it seems he is making fun of anti-Semitism but, unfortunately his material is poorly developed, clichéd and amateurish, so it won't give him the desired results, that is, if he wanted the ""jokes"" to have more effect than belly laughs for the primitive brain. At one point he states his manager does not want to fly in America because he does not want the Jews to do the same thing they did on 9/11. It might actually have been funny if, sadly, there weren't such a great number of dim witted, hate filled people, including many Americans, who actually believe this to be the case. Anti-Semitism is on the rise everywhere, just look at a lot of the messages on these message boards to confirm that. As Woody Allen stated when asked about the Holocaust ""Records were made to be broken."" Of course, the Holocaust never really happened, just ask the ""experts"" like Mel Gibson's dad. I never cease to be amazed at the hatred and scapegoating that comes about, usually as the result of bad, moronic fiction. Mr. Cohen's bad, moronic jokes won't assist him, despite his ethnicity. As any intelligent and honest student of history can tell you, the Nazis became very effective at turning innocuous little Jewish jokes and ordinary proverbs into raging, racist tirades used as fuel to run the death camps and the trains that took their cargo there. I really hope Mr. Cohen likes the money he'll make from this film, because that's all he'll end up getting from it. He failed to accomplish anything else with this venture, other than offending the people of Kazakhstan. That was completely unnecessary: he should have made up a fictitious country for his character to come from, then all the jokes about the backwardness would be funny because they don't belittle others with stereotypical crude jokes, particularly a place the vast majority of outsiders did not know existed prior to this movie. A lesson in comedy for Mr. Cohen: your jokes that take the stuffing out of the arrogant well-known (i.e. the rodeo segment) work because, well, they take the stuffing out of some arrogant well-known. Making some unknown little country the butt of your jokes is cruel and the tactic of a bully, which loses its comedic effect when the viewer realizes they will be nothing more than crude stereotypes, unless the viewer, (like too many, unfortunately) likes the cruel ""humor"" of the bully. I think you have potential to really be funny Mr. Cohen, but you lost me when you degenerated into sophomoric gags whether due to your laziness, desire to appeal to the lowest common denominator, and/or your lack of ability to develop and deliver smart, thoughtful material."
"tomq5p","4","8","16","5 November 2006"," An offensive letdown
","This film had a lot of potential, but Sacha Baron Cohen rarely capitalized on it. He basically just resorted to making comments that reflected how ""backward"" his fictional Kazakhstan is. People have the right to be offended. However, I am by no means advocating the censorship of this movie. In fact, the most outrageous scenes in the film (which must have raised the eyebrows of the censors at the MPAA) are also the funniest. <br/><br/>There is an ongoing debate on whether it is appropriate for Sacha Baron Cohen to create a character who is supposedly from a real country, Kazakhstan, and then proceed to insult the country for an hour and a half by acting like a racist, misogynistic idiot (among many other things). Some argue that Baron Cohen's motivations - to expose usually carefully hidden American ignorance, racism and prejudice - justify the film's content. I do not buy into this for one primary reason: the majority of the people will laugh for all the ""wrong"" reasons and few of the ""right"" ones. In the theater, many scenes that elicited laughs clearly did so by simply portraying highly racist and sexist beliefs, not by exposing the ignorance that those beliefs are predicated upon. <br/><br/>It is sad to say, but the majority of Americans have been brainwashed for so long that they are not ready to see this movie and definitely not equipped to understand the complicated, highly critical satire that it is meant to be. Many may argue that a movie should be judged on its ""real"" or intended message, not what people take from it, and that makes perfect sense. But the question is whether Baron Cohen motivations are purely honorable. Let's remember how much money is at stake here. The movie has already made over 20 million dollars at the U.S. box office. It seems much too convenient to make a movie that can be interpreted in at least two ways and make the majority of the money off of people who are laughing AT Borat and the ultra-racist stereotype he represents, not the critical lens of American society and culture that some will see him as. <br/><br/>Many, possibly even the majority, of the jokes in the film are based on Borat's ignorance, not on the ignorance of the people he interacts with. The notable exception is a stand-out scene at a rodeo in which Borat whips the crowd into a small frenzy about the ""war of terror"" and killing all the Iraqis. <br/><br/>I am afraid the frat boys that Borat encounters during his travels represent the response that mainstream American will have to this film - albeit exaggerated. <br/><br/>In future films, Baron Cohen should be more critical and rely on exposing ignorance, not participating in it. <br/><br/>That's not to say that an intelligent, critical person won't laugh at the film. Everyone will, especially during the soon-to-be infamous hotel scene. However, I left the theater thinking more about Baron Cohen's motivations and the average American's reaction than how Borat pulled the wool over so many people's eyes to create this biting satire. <br/><br/>4 out of 10"

","Sacha Baron Cohen picked an innocent country (Kazakhstan) which cannot defend itself and took a large dump on it. Why not making same jokes on UK countryside's peasants, since the actor is from UK?? The answer is pretty obvious - he knows which tree he can SAFELY bark on. Sacha could have easily lost his UK citizenship and be banned from UK if he made a movie about UK. This is too much even for the toilet humor. Sure, some of you can say that he made fun of Americans as well... But it was a mild humor comparing to the dirt that he poured on people of Kazakhstan. I wish that this movie was banned worldwide.

In fact, as a red-blooded college student I would say that when it comes to film I tend to lean liberal. Like everyone else, I had seen previews of ""Borat"" and was expecting to see him in the yellow thong, I was braced for some nudity, I was even prepared to politely giggle at the several references to incest sprinkled throughout the film. What I was not prepared for, by any means, was the 6.5 minute long nude scene that occurs 30 minutes before the end of the film. <br/><br/>For those of you who insist on seeing this movie, I will spare you anything that may be considered a ""spoiler"". Just suffice it to say that after the aforementioned that another reviewer has deemed a ""racier scene"", I was ready to walk out. The scene wound up being a blight on an otherwise predictable film.

"Miranda345","1","9","19","20 May 2007"," Worsest film I have ever seen
","I do not know how Mr Cohen and his director got away with it. This film does not only have any artistic value but is downright racist as well. The film has no concept and if Borat is out there to get Americans or laugh about Kazakhstan the only person he makes look bad is himself - Sacha Baron. <br/><br/>There certainly are real, deep problems in American society but Mr Cohen is not targeting any of them - quite clearly for the reason that for this mission more talent and intelligence is needed. <br/><br/>All he is doing is hassling normal middle class people who actually give very polite and intelligent answers to his stupid questions. Most of the people interviewed react with dignity and surprising calm to all idiotic situations that Borat creates. The character of Borat is a character of a pervert and if I met somebody like him I would call police straight away or at least show him the door. <br/><br/>Also the film is an insult to the country of Kazakhstan.They have not deserved it in any way. It shows clearly that Borat knows nothing about real Kazakhstan and I doubt he has ever been there. If similar film had been made about any Western European country it would have been an international scandal. But as it's Kazakhstan, it is safe to make ignorant, inferior jokes. <br/><br/>There was a scandal on British TV recently on reality TV show Big Brother and one participant, Jade Goody lost her career over the racist comments she made on TV over an Indian movie star. The whole country stood up for the offended Indian woman.<br/><br/>But the jokes Mr Cohen makes on account of Kazakhstan people are much worse - how on the Earth is he getting away with it? It's not funny. The whole film is as if created by a mentally challenged 5-years old. <br/><br/>I do not understand how general rating of this film can be 7 out of 10. This film is cruel both towards Kazakhstan and regular, normal USA people; it's ignorant, stupid, racist and without any talent. It's complete carbage. <br/><br/>The only thing that had any value in this film were the real folksongs in the soundtrack. They were like flowers in the middle of dirt."

"adinutzza2001","1","9","19","7 December 2006"," A striking example of how humour can manipulate
","I won't pretend that this movie wasn't humorous and I think few people would. This actor can be truly funny, the problem is that when this type of humour is repeated and taken too far you get the feeling something is wrong and start feeling uncomfortable. I think there's a limit between being humorous and disgusting, between being critical and offensive... and this movie crossed this line in the most evident way.<br/><br/>OK, so during the first part of the movie I must admit having a really good laugh at some of the jokes. Although already faced with a few sexual and ""toilet"" jokes that were out of place, I could still rate the movie as entertaining. That until the naked scene, which left me with my stomach turned and staring at the ceiling...One of the most vulgar and disgusting scenes I've ever seen. What was the need of including something like that and at such a lengtht??<br/><br/>And practically what does this film base its humour on? Revealing the worst in people without their consent and have the others laughing in shock at their narrowmindness and stupidity? On depicting men as being led by disgusting instincts in everything they do, showing practically no respect for any human value? On how far you can go shocking people with your triviality: the recipe ""Shock with grossfulness and you'll make people laugh"". Was it trying to ironise people's hidden faults and thoughts? If so the manner is simply terrible and disgusting. Social satire is one thing, while vulgar, mean spirited and deceptive pranks are not showing any true insight into the human condition.<br/><br/>What intrigues me most is how this movie is so manipulative, not only with the people starring in it, but also towards the viewers. I was shocked to see how over 50% of the voters gave this a 10. I believe it proves how humour can be manipulative, as under the euphoria of some good jokes people tend to accept all the others as good entertainment. I wonder how many would still find the naked scenes and the toilet jokes funny if being faced ONLY with them. I believe (and hope) that much fewer. <br/><br/>I only found out it was interdicted to under 18s when the movie started. That alone should have been a signal to document about the movie a bit before, but unfortunately even the trailer doesn't really predict the vulgarity of the movie, including only the most humorous scenes. Coming out of the cinema I could only think how suggestive the title of the movie was...In Romanian ""Borat"" resembles extremely well with the word ""puke""."

","The day after our wedding, my wife and I sat down to go through our wedding gifts. Among the appliances, gift cards, and cookware, we discovered a copy of 'Da Ali G Show, the Complete Second Season' on DVD. I had seen snippets of the show on HBO, but had never paid much attention to it. Hungover, and too poor to go on a honeymoon at that point, we decided to pop it in the player and veg out. To make a long story short, we quickly realized that it was some of the funniest material we had ever seen. We watched all the episodes, and then watched them again. Cohen is undoubtedly a comic genius, and his act has produced some of the longest and hardest laughs I have ever had in my whole life. It is probably the funniest show I have ever seen.<br/><br/>However, it is this affinity for the show that has caused my relatively low rating for this movie. If you have seen the TV show, then I don't think that your socks will be blown off by the film. Cohen goes in for the same gags and devices that made the show so damn funny (e.g. the nude pictures of his family members and the southern dinner party theme), and there was not much in the way of novelty for those already familiar with the character. The best thing about Borat is his unpredictability; in the movie, he did not do much that was not expected (with a few VERY notable exceptions).<br/><br/>That being said, this is definitely a funny movie. If you are familiar with the show, the now infamous nude wrestling scene alone makes this flick worth seeing. If you have never seen Borat in action before, I envy you. You are going to laugh til' you puke, I would guess. By the way, I think this movie has received such great reviews because most critics fall into the latter camp.<br/><br/>As an aside, I think the final scene had to have been staged. If it was not, Cohen has the biggest cajones in the world. If ""CJ"" did not agree to that out-and-out assault and battery, Cohen could have been looking at a huge law suit and/or extradition hearing in addition to vast box office receipts."

Borat is making a film taking advantage of the stereotypes we have (or imposed) in our heads and making fun of them. IMHO this is the lowest sense of humor. What is that make people laugh and voting this movie as ""the best"", or ""exceptionally funny""??!! Was it the exploitation of poor people in an eastern country to play in a movie that they didn't know anything about? Was it the lame jokes about women and the size of their brains? Was it the total disrespect for ""retards"", gays, Christians of the American south, ""rednecks"" and the list goes on....<br/><br/>So he takes the ""stereotypes"" in our minds and he uses them to mock other minority groups and even countries. I am really amazed that the government of Kazakhstan has not sued yet. Maybe they haven't seen the movie yet because they don't have TV's, or DVD players. Maybe their government doesn't have the money to sue, or the brains to understand that they are being ridiculed?! I am sure Borat knows the answer to the questions since he has made a movie about them.<br/><br/>The only ""stereotype"" that he doesn't use to make fun, but using it the other way around is that of the Jews. He is imposing on us subconsciously that even in a country that 99.9% of the Americans don't even know where it is on the map, the Jews are hated and chased with no reason at all! It's the only ethnic group in his movie that he doesn't actually make fun of, but instead he makes fun of every one else who has a bad opinion about Jews.<br/><br/>So far I understand his motives for doing such a movie. What I don't understand is why people find it SO funny, unless of course they are the ones that like the same demeaning jokes about other people as long as the others are not themselves.<br/><br/>I would recommend that you go and see it, so that you understand how sick it is, and when you laugh and get out of the venue feeling superior and powerful, just think if you were a citizen of Kazakhstan and somebody like you was laughing about your country."

One thing is to supposedly come from Kazakh, and other to act irrationally and saying dumb things to every person you meet. Well, this is what this movie is like. A dumb acted movie, with silly jokes. I'm sure most of the people who have watched it will agree with me. I'm glad i watched ""Borat"" just because now i know how bad it is.

"The_Void","7","7","14","15 November 2006"," Not constantly funny, but hilarious in places
","I have to say, I went into this film with high expectations. Borat was always the funniest character on ""Da Ali G Show"" and Sacha Baron Cohen is undoubtedly a talented comedian, but somehow this film feels like an overlong sketch, and isn't as consistently funny as the segments on Da Ali G Show. However, that's not to say that Borat is in any way a failure - Cohen delivers his lines with brilliant comic timing, and there are several real standout moments in this film. Borat is presented as documentary made for Kazakhstan television, and the base plot is that TV presenter Borat is off to America in order to report on the cultural differences between the two nations. We are introduced to Borat first in Kazakhstan where he tells us of the seedy goings on in his local town. From there, we go with the Kazakhstan man to the USA, where he talks to various people before catching a glimpse of Pamela Anderson on Baywatch, and deciding to relocate the documentary to California; where he hopes to track down and marry the sinful Baywatch blonde.<br/><br/>A lot of this film is like watching a train wreck waiting to happen. For example, at one point in the film; we discover that Borat is going to have a chat with a group of feminists, and it's not hard to imagine what's going to happen! Most of the humour focuses on the central character and the situations he gets himself into thanks to the fact that they apparently do things differently in Kazakhstan. The fact that the film relentlessly pokes fun at the Kazakhstan people means that I'm not surprised it wasn't well received over there, although I can't say it really bothers me all that much. The thing about Borat is that he's not poking fun 'his people', but rather poking fun at the world view of sensitive topics such as anti-Semitism, terrorism, homophobia and racism. Cohen's style of comedy puts the people being interviewed at the brunt of the joke, and half the time these people deserve this treatment for their extreme views (the rodeo sequence is of particular note in this respect). My main problem with this film is that it doesn't really leave a lasting impression on the viewer...although you have to respect the star for his willingness to constantly put himself in risky situations."
"amandam-7","2","7","14","13 November 2006"," Social commentary? Or an excuse for perversion?
","A serious warning for anyone who thinks this movie could be an interesting ""social commentary"". It isn't! The preview misleads viewers into thinking that we will experience a funny look at our culture from a new perspective. Although some parts do accurately portray the North American mindset, it appears that Sacha Baron Cohen has simply created a character shock value. The plot was weak, revolving around the main character's desire to marry Pamela Anderson, and to discuss his obsession with vaginas. Enough said. <br/><br/>This film has no substance, no purpose, and above all, more nude men in compromising positions than I have ever wanted to see. I give the film a 2/10 for the amount of times I laughed during the entire film: twice. It definitely was not ""one of the funniest movies ever made"" as advertised."

","He is Borat and he is in town. If you have not heard of Borat by now, you are probably one of the people living under rocks in Uzbekistan. Borat Sagdiyev is just one of the multiple personalities that is Sacha B. Cohen. This should all be familiar from Sacha's HBO show, Da G Ali Show. If you aren't familiar and happen to be one of the rock-burdened people from Uzbekistan with access to a computer and the internet, then by all means please read on. <br/><br/>Borat, heir of Boltok the Rapist, is a reporter from Khazikstan, sent to the US, along with his producer - Azamat Bagatov, to document American culture (under penalty of death). For those who don't know Borat (and as a way to show the before, before the after.) we first are taken to his home town of Kuczek. As a funny sidebar, this was actually filmed in a Gypsy shanty town north of Bucharest, Romania and not in Khazakstan. As a second sidebar, the things said in the town are even funnier than the subtitles. After a long, long and circumnavigating Indiana Jones-like plane ride, we arrive at JFK.<br/><br/>The premise of Borat is simple. A caricature simple foreigner (anti-femanist, anti-semitic, anti-gay, sexual deviant,etc) travels to another land, with all the faux pas as comedy and critique. For the magic to work certain criteria must be present. For one, the people Borat meets must not be familiar with Borat or his country. Next, the illusion of foreign documentary must be maintained. Thirdly is the air of spontaneity. For example, Borat singing the national anthem at the rodeo could have cost Sacha his life if it had lasted a few minutes longer. The actor was evacuated from the building for fear of his safety and/or a riot. At times the humor is quite physical and quite graphic. I personally could not stop laughing while others in the theater were wincing or just plain looking away. <br/><br/>You know you have made something meaningful when you upset people. If no one is upset, it means that it is universally acceptable or not important enough to justify a meaningful contradiction. This movie has upset a lot of people and with good reason. Borat instigates and often the second party fills in all the graphic and quite colorful, unscripted, personal nuances. It isn't that Borat is critiquing Khazakstan or the third world (which of course he is to an extent). He is criticizing our culture through our biased perceptions of ""foreigners"" and through our own instigation. <br/><br/>The movie reminds me of John Wilmot's Sodom, in terms of open critique, except without the monarch. Sic semper tyrannis, or something. The only problem I had was with all the previews and show appearances. A lot of the jokes could be seen there prior to ever setting foot within a theater. Even with all this ""hype"" I highly enjoyed this movie and I recommend it to others. Now to dust off those G Ali DVDs until the next movie or until the DVD of this comes out.<br/><br/>Jenkui..."
"CyMaddux","2","7","14","11 November 2006"," Over-Hyped, Over-rated and done before
","I think the reason people are rating this film so high is that they think it is actually real. Well, it is not. This movie takes many of the ideas from Jackass, The Tom Green Show, Trigger-Happy TV, and every other reality-based shockumentary and tries to put it into legit movie form.<br/><br/>Newsflash, this is not real. It is a movie. It was scripted, played out with actors. The plot is fake, the reactions you see people have to Borat are scripted and fake. The whole premise of this movie seems to be to rip on Jews to me. The only reason I gave it a 2, is due to some of the humor is funny, such as in the hotel room, however none of the principles in this movie are real, other than the nudity. This movie is not funnier than Jackass (and thats sad in itself) and contains nothing new that hasn't done before."
"Kalle_it","1","5","9","2 December 2009"," Politically incorrect doesn't equal smart
","Borat is by far the worst piece of cinema (and I use the word VERY loosely) I've ever had the misfortune of watching.<br/><br/>The ""movie"" is basically a sequence of candid cameras and pranks made at the expenses of unaware people who are trying to deal, in good faith, with Borat's over-the-top antics.<br/><br/>Not only the whole thing is overly mean, but it's also brutally disgusting, disrespecting, raunchy and racist.<br/><br/>Cohen uses the ""Kazakhstan"" excuse as a way to ""expose"" America's racism and ignorance, while in reality most of the persons he meets and makes fun of are genuinely polite to the unorthodox foreigner.<br/><br/>It's just when Borat gets really really really annoying or rude, they react.<br/><br/>But Cohen's agenda, i.e. exposing the ""good"" Americans for what they are, fails miserably. In the end Borat-Cohen looks like the biggest tool in the movie. Not even the drunk frat-boys can make us forget it's all a dirty trick.<br/><br/>A weird foreigner you don't know is talking trash about women/random ethnicity, what would YOU do? Would you confront him or you would just stand in puzzled silence, letting him utter his incoherent rants? No, really... not even the most progressist mind would embark himself in an actual debate with a man like Borat. But of course those who didn't in the movie are racists or whatever we're supposed to label them.<br/><br/>Borat is the epitome of reversed racism, something that has become very hip lately. The poor excuse of ""social enlightening"" doesn't hold. The movie is cheap and nasty under every possible aspect. Sugarcoating it with a thin layer of (non-existent) social criticism is giving it a role and a dignity it doesn't deserve.<br/><br/>Borat is an appalling and sanctimonious ""smart movie"", who'll be appreciated either by toilet-humour fans and by those who crave so much being hip and cool who'll like anything that rides the coattail of the hypocritical ""America is evil!"" movement."
"stefrance99","6","5","9","30 August 2007"," Jewish humour, (Not for Rednecks, Christians and other bigots)
","For those who may not have known (or even guess, given the name) Cohen is of Jewish origins (although educated in a Christian school), like Seinfield and other Jewish comics he is the first to criticise his culture/heritage and make us laugh. Very often the jokes against the Jews are in fact aimed at the reaction of the protagonists of the scenes, best example is the ""Throw a Jew down the well"" scene when he sings a country like song and that the audience repeat the lyrics, or again in the minivan with the graduated students. To understand some jokes you have to either know history or culture, the Jewish Satyre puppet laying an egg being crushed before hatching is a direct reference to the behaviour of some eastern countries citizen against the Jews in the Nazi/Stallinians years of the mid 20th century. I think Cohen had a lot of courage in some of his scenes and I would love to see a behind the scene extra to see how much of it genuine, the Khazak Anthem song, the well mannered people dinner party, the Jesus church, the abduction of Pamela Anderson... because if they are, then that Americans are not so ""trigger happy blood minded killers"".<br/><br/>Why I gave only a 6 is that although it's a good laugh it doesn't teach us much more about America that we already know. Yes there are loads of Racists (WASP, Rednecks), yes they are a Theocrary instead of a Democracy, yes they are usually unaware of what happens outside their borders but we already know that, don't we? I have lived in America and I can tell you there are a big bunch of very decent and friendly people over there, it' true that the IQ level seems to drop as they gather in larger and larger groups but I think it would have been nice to include some gags with genuinely friendly Americans.<br/><br/>This movie is sure to make some fuss, and on my shelves it goes next to Fast Food Nation, Farenheit 9/11, Bowling for Columbine and Supersize Me and the likes"
"Jonny_Numb","3","5","9","6 July 2007"," Guy in suit + funny accent = hilarity (right?)
","It was refreshing to scroll down and see a non-rave spotlight review of ""Borat,"" one of the most inexplicable comedies to come along in quite some time (well, it equals this summer's ""Knocked Up""). Like Judd Apatow's latest, I spent most of ""Borat"" staring on, sporadically laughing (there are maybe 3 good 'lawls' here), but mostly wondering what the hell critics and viewers alike were (and still are) thinking. I believe all my laughter (if not all, then 90%) came during the mock-dinner etiquette sequence, which has some low yet effective humor. But therein lies the problem with a film that many have mistaken for 'comic genius': as Borat (Sacha Baron Cohen), from Kazakhstan, is a 'bumpkin' touring the United States, it gives his naive reactions to things free reign to pull in the low-brow humor, while sending off the 'clever' allusion that its lowbrow execution is mired in intellectual 'intent.' Sure. And seeing as how Borat's naive reactions are, indeed, intended as punchlines unto themselves, I wound up hating this one-note joke of a film."

The presentation of his sister and wife and of course the rest of the people in his hometown is a little bit too much. I liked the car and the engine of witch he travels away from Kazakhstan too meet America.

"aktowfik","2","5","9","19 March 2007"," A lesson in bad taste
","I have no backgrounds about this TV show, so I watched this movie with a virgin mind. I daresay it hit the bottom of silly and toilet humor that Monty Python and even John Waters could never dream of. U get a nice message about Kazakhstan from the early minutes of the movie: He kisses his sister with passion in her lips and says she's the best whore in town. He is a racist who hates Jews. He is a sex maniac who defecates and masturbates in public, and brings his excreta and his whore to decent American people sitting on dinner table. He thinks the elevator is his hotel room, and travels with a chicken in his bag. I hate to know what the Kazakh people thought about the movie, but it can't be compared to the infamous Indian supper scene in Temple of Doom. I think it's more like this racist impression of Amazon people in Cannibal Holocaust. There is a naked wrestling scene between two men that marks a new era of debauchery in Cine history. Anything for a laugh (I admit U laugh many times, but U lose ur self respect all the time). Borat is in fact the only ugly racist in the whole movie... All Americans are nice friendly guys, even the black gang he meets only taught him how to speak and dress like rappers. If he was pretending he exposed America, then he is a total failue.. He only exposed and humiliated Kazakhstan. National anthem is a sacred emblem that should be respected everywhere.. Nobody dared before use the national anthem of a nation in the manner we saw at the end of the movie, with lyrics like ""our prostitutes"" etc.... Since Kazakhstan' s religion is mainly Islam, we can assume we're talking about a Muslim in USA post 11-9 era. This s no propaganda, but every Muslim knows that Jewish food is Halal. It's at least safer than Christian food, so no Muslim will get this phobia when a friendly Jewish woman offers him dinner. He even tries to flirt some red necks by wishing that Iraq becomes a parking lot. The message of the film is clear: It's mockery.. Mockery .. and nothing else."
"rzajac","Null","5","9","28 December 2006"," Anti-American?
","NOTE: I'm reposting a message board entry regarding alleged anti-Americanism in Borat. It wound up saying pretty much how I felt about the film, so I think it's worth posting as a comment, as well.<br/><br/>------------ Yes, a lot of the hapless victims in the film are just ""being folks,"" and people anywhere would respond the same way. When you consider it in a piecemeal fashion, there's no need to see this film as particularly anti-American.<br/><br/>However.<br/><br/>For one thing, I think people like to watch others doing what they do best. Cohen has an undeniable gift of comic verite chutzpah.<br/><br/>I think this film is a kind of Rorschach. When you collide the aforementioned unmitigated comic cheek of Borat against all these features of ""normal"" society, trinkets spill out. This film then lays them all out for our delectation, like a comic garage sale; everyone is going find something they'll want to ""take home"" i.e., laugh at. For instance, I thought Borat's infiltration of a modern, ""charismatic"" megachurch was priceless. We get to take it all in; the hint of twisted antiprogressive politics (ex. the church/state nexus), resentment of science, the bogus speaking in tongues. The film takes us places many of us will never go, and we get to bask in the experience.<br/><br/>There are little ""inside"" gems, like Borat's meeting with Alan Keyes. You can't really savor the situation unless you have some background on Keyes; his ""in-crowd"" status with the fundies, his de rigueur doctrinaire stance on homosexuality, and his daughter having come out as a lesbian. There's a lot in this movie that rises like a heady aroma from the fecund loam of middle American culture. The scene at the rodeo is probably the basis for claims of an anti-American subtext. I've been to large social gatherings of staunch, nationalistic Americans, milked for patriotic fervor by play-to-the-crowd ""entertainers."" Given that, how hilariously cathartic and timely to see that scene with Borat.<br/><br/>His scene in the civil war antique shop is either a bludgeon or a scalpel. You're going to love it or hate it. It's either poorly sublimated aggression, or it cuts the Gordian Knot. Your call.<br/><br/>In short, if you analyze Borat, scene-by-scene, you'll miss something. Sort of like the Old Testament: If you analyze it scene-by-scene, you may conclude it's a load of rubbish (many do). But I feel that when you take it all in, the connections are made, and wisdom can be obtained. And real wisdom obtains you real benefits.<br/><br/>There's something wise in Borat. That's the important thing.<br/><br/>----------- Writing again, 12/16/2008<br/><br/>I just realized that I think I can explain the wisdom and overall genius of Borat.<br/><br/>It's a film fantasy on The Idea of a ""Great Nation.""<br/><br/>That's all there is to it; really. Borat does to national pride what Python's Meaning of Life does to the search for life's true meaning.<br/><br/>If you just keep that idea in the back of your mind, you'll see every scene weaves together into a larger brocade. If you stand back and look at the finished brocade, you'll see the clever hidden message, ""Wake up, America; the laurel branches dried up and all the leaves fell off, a *long* time ago.""<br/><br/>And *that*, my friends, is the wisdom of ""Borat."" I presume he will take this distilled wisdom back to his home country to, uh, make better it."

I have built up a great deal of eager animosity against all of these groups. But watching Borat skewer these same people somehow caused me a bit of discomfort. Sure, it was an uneasiness punctuated by laughter --- but still the whole process left me a little queasy. <br/><br/>It has been said that this movie is holding a mirror up to America --but I think that the makers of the movie (Cohen, Charles et al) really say a lot more about themselves than about the U.S. ---- The same goes for those who have posted review after review on IMDb (and other places) that herald this as as the ""funniest movie ever made."" There are a lot of laughs to be found here --- but they are easy laughs - the moral equivalent of shooting fish in a barrel. Where does the comedy stop and the ugliness begin?<br/><br/>The inspired comedic moments in this film are there but they are few and far between. Borat addressing the crowd before the Rodeo and then mangling the National Anthem. The highlight of this sequence is a cowgirl bearing the stars and stripes taking a tumble - a fortuitous accident that greatly benefited the filmmakers. Then we have the infamous nude wrestling sequence involving Borat and his morbidly obese producer (Azamat). It's funny the first time you see it--but I would bet heavy money that subsequent viewings are rather less hilarious.<br/><br/>The upshot of all of this is that the stars danced just right in the sky for Borat to be the huge success that it has been -- but don't tell me that there is anything truly groundbreaking here -- and certainly not anything socially relevant. Borat is just not in that class. And the mass of humanoids will probably figure that out sooner rather than later. I have to believe that the number of people who buy the DVD for Borat and whip it out once a year (like I do with Dr. Strangelove) to get a few laughs -will, in the end be, quite disappointed. It's going be like eating a stale sandwich. In that respect, Borat is easily the ""Titanic"" of the comedy genre."

","Greetings again from the darkness. I realize I am in the vast minority here, but I found little to laugh about in this vile, mean spirited glamorized SNL skit. Sacha Baron Cohen's Borat character is on the surface a wonderful vision, but rather than tap new comedic ground and push the political humor boundaries, it instead slams us with mean-spirited pranks and jackass style segments.<br/><br/>Of course, I understand why Gen X and Gen Y will think it cool to jump on the bandwagon, but I see no genius or brilliance as displayed by Mel Brooks, Kevin Smith or even Jon Stewart. This one trick pony runs out of gas once he finishes his tour of his hometown.<br/><br/>I will not be surprised if one day Mr. Cohen does in fact break new comedic boundaries, but ""Borat"" will not be the project and will be soon forgotten in the world of political comedies. Just another wonderful premise gone awry, which is a shame since the great Larry Charles (""Seinfeld"" ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" ""Entourage"") is featured as the director. Always hate to see another Seinfeld alum fail."

","The premise of the movie was very generous: poking fun at cultural differences between USA and other parts of the world. A lot of the topics the movie touched on (American ""scholars"" aka frat party loving freshmen, the righteous red neck right wing, the religious wackos etc...) were easy targets and rich sources of comedy. Unfortunately, the odd funny bit is buried in loads of vulgarity of all kinds from promiscuous more-than-innuendos to excrement to disgusting exhibitionism. As a matter of fact what disappoints me the most is not that someone made a movie of this base nature but the fact that there are so many people who find it amusing. This film pretends to challenge prejudice, taboos and conformism. It actually forgoes the most elementary principles of decency. As artistic value is nil. Are we going to see a sequel? Here are some ideas in the same league of fun and subtlety : a drunk peeing in a church, a junkie killing his mother, a boy being castrated just for fun. Is it still going to amuse and arouse the crowds?"
"stephanmj","1","15","38","9 November 2006"," Sasha Baron Cohen is an embarrassing racist
","According to the CIA's website, Kazakhstan is a country with a majority Muslim religion of 47%. Cohen is supposedly portraying a typical Kazakhstani, therefore a typical Muslim. He portrays this Muslim character to be a backwards, degenerate, jew-hating imbecile, who likes rape, incest and murder. I am not a Muslim, or religious, in any way, but I can understand that for a Jewish person to do this at such a sensitive time with the fake war on terror going on, is not a particularly pleasant thing to do. However, as you can see by the high rating on IMDb, most people are too stupid to figure out what is going on.<br/><br/>In fact Cohen is making a good living of importing racism to America. He portrays Muslims, Germans, and the French in his new movie Taladaga nights, in very negative manners, which will no doubt fuel anti-European and anti-Muslim feelings in what already is a hate filled USA."

I must say initially I was extremely skeptical of the film, having seen the the Ali G movie years ago and getting sick of all the 'punani' jokes. This film however gave me a headache from laughing so much, I was exhausted after viewing the film! There shouldn't be a problem for religious and racial groups(as this film sets out to offend everyone!), but Kazakhstan I can understand having a problem (maybe). I actually feel it is the American people who may come off worst after this film is released (see Pentecostal church scene, frat boys in Winnebago, the people at the Rodeo and the couples in Birmingham, bystanders in NY etc etc.) There is a loose plot and while funny, is not the central focus of the film (quite paradoxically). Watch out for the Kazakh wedding sack! PS Pamela Anderson's credibility with me has sky rocketed! I believe a film like this says what we all have been wanting to say but were too afraid to, or even laugh at. In a ultra-Politically Correct world, we are losing the ability to laugh at ourselves. This corrects that! This film will get edited (Guaranteed), so if you get tickets to a preview, go see it. This is the comedy version of Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Last Temptation of Christ, the edited version will always be an injustice (or banned for that matter).<br/><br/>I consider myself one of the lucky few!"

I've gotten a big kick out of films like ""Kingpin,"" ""There's Something About Mary,"" etc. The difference between those films and Borat is that those films maximized the use of outrageous situations and assumed its audience at least had a certain level of sophistication or intelligence. On the other hand, Borat tries to appeal to a much lower level kind of funny-bone tickling, in the same way children try to make each other giggle by repeating ""outrageous"" words they just learned like ""caca"" over and over again to each other.<br/><br/>Borat being a fish out of water is funny by itself only so long, and you would think that after a short while, what is suppose to pass for outrageous sexual comments and potty humor would just get tiresome when there is no clever point behind any of it.<br/><br/>And for those who try to convince you that the Borat character (who has sex with his mother- in-law and takes dumps off busy sidewalks) has some kind of innocent or naive charm, don't buy it.

It's basically Yakov Smirnoff meets stuttering John, meets Jackass, who cares? If making a hit movie means going around and doing stupid things with a camera, I might as well make one myself. Why does everyone keep saying this is the funniest movie ever? Have none of us graduated high school? Even if I were in high school I still might think this is stupid.

Oh and everyone keeps saying that it's an anti-Semitic movie, and that is not the case at all, it's quite the opposite, it's an anti-gentile movie. The people in the movie that are anti-Semitic which he chose to show us, are the ones he makes fun of, including his character Borat who comes from a Muslim nation. He also makes fun of the southern Christian right, which is an easy target, but you have to remember that Sasha Cohen himself is a Jew and he has his own agenda. The Jewish home he goes to had to be someone he knew, cause their ain't no way they are letting two guys in an ice cream truck stay at their place. I used to have a Jewish girl-friend and she wouldn't even let me pick her up from her home because I was a goy, so ain't no way he didn't know that old couple, so the only people in the movie who weren't getting hoaxed were Jewish. Oh and Pamela Anderson, I don't really give a rat's ass about her, but that was mean. She didn't know who he was and to chase her around in the parking lot like that must have scared her horribly.

","Generally I enjoyed the film Borat. I was glad it was not longer than it was. Once one dramatizes humor about cultural differences one, I think, can take it only so far. At the end I kept saying alright already I get it! Having said that, however, I think the film has something poignant to say which belies the prevailing humor of its content.<br/><br/>Some in the Jewish community, I have read, have refused to see the film because of its explicit and continuous anti-Semitism. Admittedly, some was hard to take. I am Jewish. I am extraordinarily sensitive to the history of anti-Semitism and the Jewish historical plight. It is because of that, I think, those who were offended by that element of the film miss the point of what the film was about. I think Sasha Baron Cohen, who is Jewish, was making a serious contention about cultural relativism. It doesn't matter where one comes from, hatred and ignorance is what it is no matter how you dress it up  or down.<br/><br/>In part, I believe he was taking aim, too, at those in America who pride themselves as being an advanced western culture. Some in America have things in common with those in a seemingly backward country such as Kazakhstan. However stupid you may think those people are, there are those from an advanced society who will have many of the same attributes.<br/><br/>Eastern Europe, Russia and the west have had virulently anti-Semitic histories. Anti-Semitism, has existed, too, in countries which have not had a long history of it. Anti-Semitism and racism, in general, know no cultural boundaries. It merely takes on a different face. The Jew as ""the other"" has faced demonization nearly everywhere. Ancient canards about the Jew as the devil still incredibly prevail where people have not even met a Jew and where no Jews or few exist. A documentary film called ""The Longest Hatred"" about the long history of anti-Semitism once said ""you do not need Jews to have anti-Semitism."" Three positive characters exist in the film. Two were orthodox Jews and one was a black prostitute. This was not accidental. Sasha Cohen tried, I think, to say something to defend those whom the majority still often think  for the most irrational reasons are the indefensible. People are still just people after all and one can find humanity in people and in places where you think none would exist.<br/><br/>If others who are not Jewish take away from that movie the idea that Borat and the characters he meets are right about their world view, then there is little hope for those of us in this world who would like to extricate ourselves from the sewer of its stupidity and ignorance."
"MOscarbradley","7","4","7","15 November 2006"," A bit more bite?
","The problem with ""Borat"" is, while it's certainly very funny, it's never terribly original nor is it as dangerous as it could be or thinks it is. The usual targets are on hand, (gays, blacks, any minority really, people with disabilities, mental and physical and so on). Some of these gags hit their targets while others completely backfire. The anti-women jokes seem to me a bit close to desperation and perhaps the only real surprise is Cohan's blatant lampooning of the Jews which is about as daring as the film gets. Posing as a rabid anti-Semite Cohan, in his persona of Borat, actually manages to blow apart the whole notion of anti-Semitism and the film's best 'sketch' is where Borat and his producer find themselves staying at a guest-house run by a sweet old Jewish couple. For the rest it's mostly toilet humour, in every conceivable sense, (Borat seems very obsessed with his 'anoos'), and jokes about masturbation. The first time Borat does a gag it is genuinely funny, the second time, less funny, the third time ... well, you get the idea, and the improvised 'candid-camera' style sketches work far better than the staged ones.<br/><br/>As an actor Cohan is genuinely creative and Borat can be a wonderful comic creation but the material here never really finds him at his best. It may have seemed like a good idea to go to America and lampoon the Republicans, (and it's these scenes, set mostly in the American heartlands, that really hit the mark), but Cohan doesn't seem to be able to sustain these jokes. Just when he might be getting close to the jugular he pulls back and goes after some other easier option instead. The one time he does sustain the gag is when he cross-cuts between an organized dinner party and an etiquette lesson. For a while this is a really funny scene, (even the toilet humour in the scene is funny), but Cohan doesn't know to end it so he brings on a black hooker. Funny? NOT! (And we don't want to see Borat's sentimental side either).<br/><br/>Perhaps not surprisingly the film has become a big hit in America, (its frat-boy humour will certainly appeal to a younger audience). But if Cohan really had the courage of his convictions he would have given us something like ""The Aristocrats"", which really was in bad taste, and risked alienating just about everybody. Fans of his British television series ""Ali G"" knows he can do it. Perhaps next time?"

Kazakhstan is 47% Muslim, 44% Russian Orthodox, and 2% Protestant. Guess they've never heard of Jesus, either!<br/><br/>As far as the ""outrageous"" wrestling scene -- yawn! Why were Borat's naughty bits blacked out but his son's weren't?

However, the two latter groups only take to Borat because they understand his crudeness and language. He does not have to form a firm, meaningful relationship with these groups them and therefore does not have behave socially appropriate.<br/><br/>He never even succeeds to critically vilify the affluent groups but only makes a himself look like a disgusting criminal. Even the college boys got tired of his antics and had to draw the line when he became socially over demanding and provoking.<br/><br/>It is unclear what the aim of the film was - whether to satirise and poke fun at the American people when all it does is just make Borat look like an obnoxious fool.

In a time where we can't watch a good horror movie with a few scenes of blood and gore because everything gets cut out and yet we can sit down and watch what must be the director and producer's racist fun-fest, we live in sad times indeed.

","****I discuss some of the flaws in Cohen's attempt at representing someone from Kazakhstan**** The only reason I gave this movie 1 star is because zero is not an option. Sacha Baron Cohen is a poor excuse for a comic. His brand of comedy, laughter at the expense of somebody in a contrived situation, failed to make me laugh. Moreover, he has a major chip on his shoulder that he tries to knock off by way of denigrating so many groups. This would-have-been rabbi uses Muslims, Eastern Europeans, Women, Gays, and Americans as fodder. I think Cohen is doing nothing more than using this poor attempt at a mockumentary to convey his xenophobic, racist, and misogynistic views.<br/><br/>Additionally, he does not look Kazakh, maybe somebody from the Caucasus region, but definitely not Kazakh. The captions on the screen in the Cyrillic alphabet do not actually say anything; they are a hodge-podge of random letters that quickly disappear under the superimposed supposed English translation. Anytime he says something like ""dzien dobry, dziekuje,"" or ""jak se mas"" he is speaking Polish, a Western Slavic language. Kazakh is a Turkic language, like most of the other languages spoken in Central Asia. With a little more attention to detail maybe this could have been a funny movie in spite of all the scatological humor. But Cohen must think a separating ocean is enough to keep him from developing an authentic character for the American viewing public.<br/><br/>Cohen is a bore and with any luck his fifteen minutes of fame are ready to expire. I hope all of the law-suits filed against him are ruled in favor of the plaintiffs."

","This film is great fun.It's one that makes you get cheek cramp from grinning. It is laugh out loud. It makes you squirm with embarrassment and it constantly makes you ask ""Can they really do that?"".<br/><br/>The film tracks Borat from his home town in Kazakhstan on a quest to improve his nation by learning from the Great US of A. He bids farewell to his prostitute sister, his bear of a wife and the village rapist and sets about reporting from abroad...yet on the way he falls in love with Pammie when he buys a Baywatch Magazine from a 'gypsy' and his mission changes.<br/><br/>The quest to bag her is broken up by his interviews, set ups and general experiences along the way, from ruining a live TV broadcast to trying to avoid getting lynched at a redneck Rodeo for changing the words to the Star spangled banner - which is all hilarious. You can scarcely believe the people he meets along the way and SBC's incredible improv genius at drawing out the worst in so many different types of Americans from frat boys, Pentecostal Christians, to Homophobic rodeo organisers and WASP High society.<br/><br/>Yet nothing can prepare you for the lengths that he himself will go to. Never have I seen such a scene in mainstream cinema where two men have a full on five minute no holes barred (yet crap) wrestle match (Borat falls out with his producer for cracking one off over his Baywatch mag). It involves suplexes, pillow biting and sitting on faces to suffocate the foe...oh and it's all totally naked. And I mean TOTALLY. The fat producers man yoghurt factories swinging in SBC's face as he cries ""Eat my Ass"". Can they really show that? It will haunt me and yet cheer me for many years to come.

","Java Man Reviews ""Borat: Cultural Leanings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"" (2006, R). Directed by Larry Charles. Written by Sacha Baron Cohen, Anthony Hines, Peter Baynham & Don Mazer. Starring Sacha Baron Cohen, Ken Davitian & Pamela Anderson. Running Time: 83 minutes. This review originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com.<br/><br/>OVERVIEW: <br/><br/>Borat (Cohen) is a Kazakh TV journalist who has been assigned to come to America and make a documentary about our people and culture. He also happens to be a sexist, racist, chauvinist, and any other ""ist"" one could possibly imagine. In his NYC hotel room, he sees an old Baywatch episode, becomes smitten with Pamela Anderson and decides to head for Hollywood--in an old ice cream truck--in order to make her his bride.<br/><br/>On the way, he and his crew, including his slovenly producer Azamat (Davitian) encounter a cross section of everyday Americans, upsetting and insulting every one of them as they go. He bickers over women's brain size with feminists, parties with drunken frat boys and visits the home of southern conservatives with a prostitute as his date. When invited to sing our national anthem at a rodeo, he is at first greeted with cheers, until he revises the lyrics and the audience viciously turns on him. He barely escapes.<br/><br/>REVIEW: 3 1/2 OUT OF 4 JAVA MUGS <br/><br/>""Satire is a sort of glass, wherein beholders do generally discover everybody's face but their own."" Jonathan Swift <br/><br/>When this film first came out, there was a lot of talk about how the nation of Kazakhstan was displeased about being the victim of Cohen's unkind cuts. We laughed. But as we file out of the movie, we realize that it is America, not Kazakhstan, whose face is discovered in Cohen's Swiftian mirror. I suspect that the central Asian nation, with its recent increase in tourism, may have been in on the joke.<br/><br/>In fact, the British Cohen (who is also Jewish) is following in a great satiric tradition made popular in the coffeehouses of early 18th century England in the stories of Addison and Steele, as well as Swift. It is called the ""Innocent Eye"" or ""Fish out of Water"" technique, where an outside observer innocently reacts to the absurdities of the predominant society. Cohen takes it to its limits, and thus the well-deserved R rating.<br/><br/>There are many gross-out moments, especially when Borat nude wrestles with his fleshy producer; but there are also huge laughs, as we look on while people just like us become Borat's victims. Cohen stays in character even when he is about to be pummeled. In fact, Borat--and not Cohen--has traveled the movie's promotional talk-show circuit. His appearance on Conan O'Brien's late-night show was especially disgusting (and, of course, funny).<br/><br/>Director Charles deserves a lot of credit here. No stranger to comedy, the Seinfeld veteran somehow convinced all these people to cooperate, shot the scenes with a straight face, and got each set-up done in one take. (Once the marks knew they were made, the crew would have to wrap the set and make a quick getaway). The American location work is engaging, but the opening scenes in Kazakhstan are wonderfully bizarre. (They were actually shot in Rumania).<br/><br/>Suggestion: When the nude wrestling sequence starts, take a trip to the refreshment stand."

","I am glad I waited for this to come out on DVD. It appears to be only a typical money making movie based on toilet humor and racism. If one tries to draw a socially relevant conclusion of the various points this movie attempted to make, they are deluded. This is nothing more than cheap, vulgar humor made at the expense of others and seem to be made OK by Borat's naiveté'. Sorry it just doesn't wash. I will admit I laughed a little, but overall this was a very feeble attempt at some misguided and unforeseen point. It's sad that Hollywood has resorted to films with no substance and character development. Instead, we are subjected to mindless plots, poor acting, and high ticket prices."

"botan_k","1","5","10","9 April 2007"," Cheap toilet trash humour
","The humour in Borat is as witty and tasteful as chewing on barbed wire and mud pie. Seriously folks, if you want a funny foreigner movie watch something else. Trust me, I know lots of immigrants and I got plenty of funny stories, but this film disappointed my expectations.<br/><br/>Most of the humour in this movie is very, very degrading and low. The exception is some funny scenes such as when a kid is driving a car to take Borat out of his village and the camera zooms out to show the car is being pulled by a donkey. What's not funny is how incredibly stupid beyond logic Borat himself is. It seems somewhat ridiculous that he would spend the whole day trying to kiss random strangers in New York without realizing that it's not a welcome custom.<br/><br/>What's also not funny are the cheap jokes. A good junk of the phony jokes that Borat forces on the audience to pull out a laugh are immensely anti-Semitic, anti-feminist, about degradation, and homosexuality. It's so disgusting it's not even funny for most people who like this kind of garbage humour. What's not funny for most civilized people (I should hope) is the degrading humour attempts such as showing off the naked unattractive people, wrestling with a naked, disgusting, and fat obese man, masturbating to Pamela Anderson in the open with another man 10 feet away in the same hotel room, showing off your teenage son's hairy penis, making out with your prostitute sister, crapping in public, etc.<br/><br/>A lot of it is some of the most appalling and offensive material I have ever seen in a film. It belongs to the Nazi's propaganda film storage vault that was used as an excuse to annihilate 6 million people. It has jokes like Jews are egg-laying monsters, like at one festival in Borat's village. I guess some Arab terrorists would laugh at that kind of crap. Borat and his obese producer come to the home of a nice old couple who greet them with hospitality but when they find out they are Jews, they become so suspicious, they believe the couple changed form at night into cockroaches that crawled under their bedroom door. There are other grotesque jokes about mentally retarded people and handicapped people.<br/><br/>Although it's been 60+ years since WWII and the Holocaust, that kind of crap wasn't funny, isn't funny, and should never be funny lest there be another holocaust. And being a Jewish film producer doesn't give you the excuse to make this kind of film.<br/><br/>This film is a disaster to Kazakhstan. It portrays their people to many Americans who've never heard of Kazakhstan before as being full of borderline homosexual men who are so stupid they wash their face in the toilet because they've never seen one before, as Nazi's hell-bent on protecting themselves with animals and weapons against the egg-laying Jews, as being full of female prostitutes who win awards for their accomplishments, as being an over-bearing patriarch society that sees woman as nothing more than pleasure tools and property, as being lewd, offensive, and uncivilised people who have little self-control and prance around like naked, incestuous, homosexual, savages talking about having ""sexy-time"" with animals and woman at the dinner table.<br/><br/>Bye the way, I happen to be from the ""Stan"" regions, and my name happens to be a five letter word similar to ""Borat"" that starts with the letter ""B"". In fact, some people nicknamed me ""Borat"", and I wasn't that insulted with the nickname until I saw this abomination and what was it about. This movie is a big disgrace to all the people from those regions, and the way he portrayed Kazakhstan is less humorous than it is downright demeaning. I wouldn't be surprised if Sacha Baron Cohen got sued by any one of the ""Stan"" nations."

","It's really a shame that most of America will never realize what a comic genius Howard Stern was (and may still be). From about 1984 to 1988 Stern was the funniest man in America. From that point on he spiraled down, caught up in a self-destructive obsession with garbage and pushing the envelope on common decency. Plus Howard just got lazy. I see a little of the same phenomenon with Cohen. There's no disputing that portions of this movie are very inspired & outrageously funny. But Cohen goes over the decency line so many times it eventually became unwatchable. I have other problems with this movie - are we supposed to believe the other ""actors"" think this is a valid documentary? If they're not in on the joke it all seems pretty mean-spirited and makes me uncomfortable. If they're in on the joke then what's the point? I understand that ""tasteless"" in itself has its own mindless, Wet Hot American Summer market, but this is one movie I think might have benefited from some responsible studio oversight."

I expected something more sophisticated. His previous show - AliG Show was much funnier. Probably because there were more characters and it made the show more interesting. In this movie main character is boring, he does all the time the same things although he supposed to learn. I really liked AliG show but Borat disappointed me a lot. There is not to many movies I stopped watching before it ends. I usually pick good movies to watch but with this one I was wrong. I couldn't stand watching it. I really advise you not to see that bad movie. I don't know how anybody can enjoy it."

It pretends to make a political statement but instead panders to the lowest common denominator of movie goers by relying on cheap laughs at the expense of others and crude humor. I'm difficult to offend and often push the envelope myself but I was just grossed out by a morbidly obese man literally shoving his backside and genitals into Borat's face. It really isn't funny at all, and now I am left with this image. I did chuckle a few times but in general was uncomfortable watching these poor people have to deal with a complete jackanapes. I will be telling my friends to forget Borat if they haven't seen it yet. The thing that really disturbed me about going to this movie was a group of 4 children in the audience in front of us (probably about 8-10 years old maybe younger). I'm not sure if the responsible adults accompanying them were their parents, but if they were...WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? unbelievable! this movie is just gross."

","I know I'm quite a bit in the minority on this one but I just didn't seem to think this movie was much more than some obnoxious mockery of third world countries and some fraternity-type humor. I don't think Borat does much at all for pointing out bigotry or antisemitism as much as he simply sensationalizes those same problems at the expense of blind sighted participants being told this was a real documentary. Never liked Ali G. either. Sorry to say I really believe all the critics are wrong. It's not a satire or black humor or much more than crass foolery to me. I think he should cough up some hard cash to Glod, Romania and be a sport about it too.

The excellence of Borat is that he lulls people into dropping their guard to such an extent that we see their prejudices exposed. The rodeo ranch bloke in this stood out as an example of backwards, ultra right-wing bigotry second to none. Its scary to think such people actually exist! The great thing about the film was its road-movie/travelogue type plot: Borat drives across America in an ice cream van hoping to marry Baywatch babe Pamela Anderson. Along the way he gets down with some wannabe rappers in the ghetto, destroys an antiques shop, causes a stir at a polite dinner party, encounters some bizarre drunken students and most comically and disgustingly of all, wrestles naked with his vastly obese director in a scene which induces so much cringing you think your face will pop!

","Myself for renting the DVD of this thing, or the reviewers who thought it amounted to something? Either way, that's the point: Borat thinks it's exposing stupidity and even venality, but it's just worthless. You get an accurate read on the nature of a society by interviewing its members, letting them speak for themselves--NOT by provoking them into behavior that puts them in a bad light. In fact, most of the responses to Borat's antics are pretty restrained, which is a credit to the Americans involved.<br/><br/>A rational response to this unbelievably crude and boorish character would probably involve jail, a baseball bat, or a gun, depending on your taste and tolerance for insult after insult.<br/><br/>The real significance of Borat is summarized in the title of a recent book about the consumer economy: Everything for Sale. Including this dreck. I'll give Baron Cohen credit for one thing: He illustrates the maxim that nobody ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the public. Cohen is laughing all the way to the bank. I already wasted $4.00 renting the movie: Everyone who hasn't seen it, keep your money. Enough is enough."
"TorquemadaFan","1","6","13","24 December 2006"," Somethings are better left unsaid
","A lot of today's films are just plain old stupid. In fact, that is probably an apt description of the typical mainstream film: film purely for amusement. A cheap laugh. A brief thrill. Nothing else, and most certainly nothing that truly matters in the long run. Sure, people need to laugh and have fun as a part of a healthy life, but amusement for amusement's sake is like a drug. You want more and more and more until finally your view of amusement is literally insulting to any respectable person. Borat manages to accomplish that with all barrels blazing. The film is literally vulgar excess that can be best described at excrement of an ever rapidly declining art form. An utterly shameless glob of phlegm that you cough out with blood, because it is clinging to your throat like a determined parasite. However, this parasite infects your brain, which, in a sense, makes it more painful. Not to you, but to society as a whole. People are dumbed down by this sort of trash and our view of what in art and entertainment has really fallen.<br/><br/>It is not the tasteless humor that is insulting, but the presentation of the United States as a nation consisting primarily of bigots and simpletons. The people of this great country are not perfect, I in no way want to imply that and we've had our share of bigotry in this country (like most others), but somethings are just better left unsaid and to keep on bringing it up is just in poor interest of everyone. You have a wound, you let it heal. You don't keep probing it with the hope of it speeding up any sort of healing. As if that wasn't enough, the film also manages to insult the National Anthem. Out of all the silly music out there they just had to pick the one piece that is truly important in this country. Then if that wasn't enough, they present a humorless and insulting piece which poses as the ""national anthem of Kazakhstan."" In fact, the film goes as far as insulting everyone that appears in it and, as irony would have it, Mr. Cohen insults himself by making it all happen. How can a graduate of any respectable university (Mr. Cohen is a Cambridge Grad.) use his talents, effort, and creativity to produce such worthless slime as this? I don't know, and I am not sure I want to know, but I just hope that this sort thing will stop when people realize how stupid and pointless it is. Then the so called ""filmmakers"" of these types of films will stop making them when they all of a sudden have no audience.<br/><br/>That will be the day. When the Borats, the Jackasses, and the lot them just realize their stupidity and the people who make them (who undoubtedly have ambition) will focus their efforts of something else. If that is at all possible for them. But, let's be positive, even the town fool deserves a chance to repent his blunders."

THe Blair witch project segment was pretty creative however, and at the very least Cohen sells his performance to the utmost, never letting himself in on the joke. Azamat also had a hidden depth to himself that he was never allowed as an actor to explore. With just a bit more effort, real development and emotion could have gone into these characters. The sad fact is that they are stereotypes of something that doesn't even exist, and any humor seen by them is IMO completely overridedby the naked wrestling scene. Whatever redeeming qualities the film had were just killed by that... Cold War humor just isn't funny anymore, nor is the characterization of Russian satellites as backwards and morally corrupt. More disturbing yet is the behavior of some of the victims of the movie. While the frat boys are forgivable, the rodeo owner and several others not featured in the movie show us that we still have a lot of problems as a nation. I'm also interested to see how the many lawsuits are going to turn out."

","Based on what I've been reading, I thought ""Borat"" was going to be one of the funniest films I'd ever expect to see. It wasn't. Aside from a FEW side-splitting laughs, it was a mess. The scenes in Kazakhstan were out of focus. Polish was inserted where Kazahkstani should have been. It was most disparaging to our Jewish neighbors. The scatolology was everywhere and almost in everything. The story, at times, became incoherent. It clearly showed signs of being ""Candid Camera"" in which notables never knew they were being ""had."" Funny films most certainly can have excellent story lines and be in good taste. ""Borat"" failed on both counts."

","When my brother and I were far younger we would make comedy tapes on our father's reel-to-reel deck. The comedies made us laugh, they were very funny to us, however they weren't something we wanted out parents to hear and if any one of them appeared today I would not be very happy about. Making gross jokes and fun of those who can do nothing about it should be done with care as it can hurt, those who are the butt of the joke and perhaps those who make the joke.<br/><br/>Initially I thought this would be a fun film, which would satire the government of Kazakhstan and some of its leaders. It has nothing to do with lampooning the government. Instead found a film that it was going far in belittling the people. It was effectively the same puerile humor my brother and I carried out, except there is a developing story in the film. It isn't much of a story and continues to pain the kazaks as a backward and idiotic people. I'm surprised this sort of thing sells and even ranks an 8.4 rating (as of this comment.) I rather wish I had my money and time back."

","I am not easily offended, and I have to say the gross-out humor in this movie was mostly funny. But this is only one of two films that I have ever walked out on.<br/><br/>First, I agree with the Kazakhstan government. This was an successful attempt to defame and ridicule a country. It was 100 minutes of unrelenting and mean-spirited stereotyping, that was mainly aimed at Muslims but included its fair share of Christian ridicule. BTW, Kazakhstan is a majority Russian Orthodox country.<br/><br/>Did I say mean-spirited yet? The whole movie was principally an attempt at showing how stupid and evil Muslims are. Followed by the stupid and evil Christians. No attempt was made to show stupid and evil Jews. A few Jewish stereotypes were shown, but only to highlight how evil and stupid Christians and Muslims are. I could have lived with the humor if it had in fact been balanced out in both tone and content (a la perhaps a dark and brooding Carlos Mencia). But it wasn't. This movie was a full-bore, relentless, people who are not like me are repulsive, meme.<br/><br/>As a result of all this, this movie itself became a part of what it was trying to parody, namely ignorance and meanness in the world. If you are what you parody, you cancel yourself out and cease to have anything meaningful to say. So it was bye, bye Borat, for me.<br/><br/>I gave it a 3 for the movie magic aspects of ""How did they get them say that?"" and ""Where did they find these people?"" and some of the humor.

"catweasel","4","6","13","8 November 2006"," A missed opportunity
","Borat (and Ali G) works best when interviewing unsuspecting people in order to reveal their bigotry. This was acknowledged as the reason the Ali G film didn't work and I'd heard that a return to that format was why this film was a huge success. Not entirely true - it's simply somewhere between the two. Borat travels across America, supposedly so that he can return home to Kazakhstan with his cultural learnings. This leads him through Middle America where he encounters, among others, a homophobic rodeo organiser, a feminist group, and a fanatical Christian group. If you've seen Borat before this will give you high expectations for comedic results. Unfortunately, he never goes for the jugular, leading to a lack of laughs and a feeling of disappointment when compared to his previous TV work.<br/><br/>But the main problem (and it's a problem which devalues the film) is the blurring of reality and fiction. Most of the supposedly genuine interviews and situations are blatantly set-up. They may have got away with more if the cameras followed them around, documentary style, but when we suddenly cut to the inside of buildings, lifts, bathrooms, a conference etc, where camera crews have clearly already been set up, it's insulting to be expected to believe that security guards / lift passengers / homeowners / Pamela Anderson didn't know what was about to happen. This means that the ""real"" incidents (if, indeed there actually are any)lose their impact because you can't believe their authenticity. One of the highlights comes when he dines with a group of socialites, ""accidentally"" insulting them. Viewed on its own this would have been hilarious, but in the context of the rest of the film you have to start to wonder if it was scripted.<br/><br/>There are a few mildly amusing episodes but this should have been brilliant. They bottled it."

Most of the Borat audience in which my wife and I attended was hysterical with laughter, and yet I found myself pretty much bored, offended or otherwise turned off by much of the movie.

"davek5823","Null","13","35","3 November 2006"," A Rarity
","Borat is a rarity. A character so repulsive and completely lacking in sense, you can't avoid laughing at his foibles. From the improvisational mastermind Sacha Baron Cohen (Da Ali G Show, Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby), comes his most controversial character, Borat Sagdiyev, the clueless anti-Semite from Kazakhstan. If you have been fortunate enough to catch ""Da Ali G Show"", you're probably already familiar with his antics. As it is with Cohen's other characters, Borat goes across America, shocking unsuspecting Americans with his socially, as well as politically, incorrect behavior. One graphic example is showing strangers pornographic pictures of his wife and sister. Being on HBO, Borat has had the freedom to be all he was meant to be and his barely R-rated film is no exception. In what is basically, several Borat segments combined into one 90 minute mocumentary, we see Cohen as his mustachioed alter-ego raising havoc on a road trip across the ""U S and A"". What was the purpose of this voyage you ask? Why to locate and marry Pamela Anderson of course and if there's time, shoot a documentary on American culture. And American culture he finds while discovering feminists, embarrassing rodeos, and finding Jesus along the way. If this movie does anything, it proves that Cohen will do anything, no matter how disturbing or illegal. I'm not sure, but if a few of these scenes weren't staged, he should have been arrested several times for some of his comical mischief. I'd give examples, but it might not be as shocking so I'll leave it up to you to find out. So among all this chaos and slandering of an already angered Kazakhstani Government, is there a film worth paying for? No contest. Borat has a tremendous chance of being the funniest film of the year. It's clever, outrageous and most notably unapologetic. Of course, I enjoyed the film myself, but I've never seen an audience laugh and applaud on so frequently. I doubt Cohen will receive any Oscar buzz, but it isn't a stretch to say that his performance is some of the best comedic acting in a long time. But don't think I'm soft, this being my first review and all, but I had a very difficult time trying to find a reason it suffered. Borat also manages to do something that many films before it have failed to do; be insightful as well as funny. Though mostly absurd, Borat sheds a floodlight on how people from other nations can be viewed in America. Despite a few exceptions, it was almost refreshing to see some Americans be so tolerant of a supposed foreigner who was intentionally meaning to anger them. I predict this movie will do well. This based on the ticket sales of R-rated comedies and the massive cult following Cohen already possesses. When I said barely R-rated at the top of the review, I didn't mean almost a PG-13. Borat is extremely graphic, profane and obviously went through many cuts before avoiding a NC-17. If you are over 17 (or have a fake ID that says you are) and don't offend easily, you won't be disappointed."

","""Borat"" is a brilliant movie, even if you've seen and loved the ""Ali G. Show"" before. In a lot of ways the Borat from the show is superior to the one in the movie, though: Sacha Baron Cohen's main goal used to be to confront people with Borat's vulgarity and his special views so that all their bigotry would be uncovered. In the movie he only really does that once or twice (namely when he talks to the Rodeo guy and the fret boys). There is also a lot of obviously (and then some rather secretly) staged material here, but you can't always tell. When Borat's comedy is scriptet, however, it isn't half as funny, so when Baron Cohen walks around and introduces his country in the beginning, it's not that hilarious.<br/><br/>Anyway, the movie really gets into gear in its second half. Mr. Baron Cohen takes the whole thing to such extremes you won't be able to believe your eyes. This man is absolutely unafraid of anything. Faux interviews for comedy purposes have been done millions of times before, but never as effectively as here. Borat is just a weirdly lovable, if sexist/racist guy. Speaking of which, to enjoy this you should definitely bring along some understanding for not so politically correct-humor and some mindless slapstick! If you do, there's no way you're going to want to miss this movie. It's a riot (and I've never used that expression before). The absolute highlights include a nude wrestling match between Borat and his overweight manager, and the very final scene, which I'm not going to give away. <br/><br/>Sacha Baron Cohen is doing something here, that's never been done before, if you think about it. He's starring in a movie he's written and everyone else around him is starring in it, too. Only most people aren't aware of it. Even with this kind of setting there's still so much love for detail here that although a lot of key scenes may be staged the whole thing is still adorably well structured and inventive.<br/><br/>""Borat"" brings Sacha Baron Cohen a success that's long overdue. Unfortunately, it also marks the death of this character since a) Borat will be commonly known throughout the world after this and b) this movie is unsurpassable, anyway. Bring on the Brüno movie, then!"

","Borat is a one of a kind film. It's like a one-man-show version of Jackass, yet instead of doing painful stunts, Borat commits to highly controversial and publicly invoking stunts of cultural misunderstandings. Many will be offended, but the open-minded will see that this film plays off of cultural misunderstanding, and how we as Americans react to that.<br/><br/>Plot- Borat (a fictional Kazakhstani man portrayed by Sacha Baron Cohen) travels abroad to America where he discovers culture. There is a fake disruption by his fascination of Pamela Anderson, causing him to chase her all the way out in California. Yet, his trip still encompasses alot of America, resulting in a cringe-worthy, hilarious, and overall crazy adventure.<br/><br/>Characters/Acting- Sacha Baron Cohen is the main event. He pulls himself through such awkward situations without ever slightly breaking character- all while being in real situations- and manages to make you die from laughter. Whether you're easily offended or not, he will make you laugh in an uproar at least once.<br/><br/>Writing- There may have possibly been minimal writing in terms of a screenplay, considering basically all of the scenes are pulled off in front of complete strangers, but I'd say whoever wrote whatever is genius. They play off of a simple factor- cultural confusion- and let it roll out like the red carpet. Every scene makes me laugh like an idiot.<br/><br/>Quality- The film is essentially a mockumentary- including some cinematic scenes that are acted out- but the end product is honestly touching. The filming is amazing, even for being primarily in the reality television style. The situations this actor had to undergo (92 police discrepancies) as well as memorizing lines in public still makes it so uniquely hilarious. Nothing is more hilarious than a real reaction to indifference.<br/><br/>Overall Borat is an essential Comedy film, at least of my generation. When I first saw it as an 11 year old, I laughed incredibly hard. When I saw it again as a 23 year old, every scene held me hostage. Just plain perfection in my eyes. Many people could be turned away by the religious offensiveness, but at the end of the day, a character is a character, and we must accept the fact that they may have offensive perspectives. That's why you watch a movie. Murder is repulsive, yet we go see every slasher movie that comes out- right?"

There are a few moments which preserve the sharp hilarity of awkward encounters that the show handled so well, and I appreciate that they have to appeal to a wider audience, including those unfamiliar with the character, but this was hardly the way to go about it. I admit I laughed a couple of times, but mostly at the beginning - after the first ten minutes, the ""story"" became bitterly familiar and Borat's quirks were all but lost as he soon transformed into any other gawky teen movie protagonist.<br/><br/>I'm sure there are many people who disagree and found it enjoyable but I just thought those who haven't seen it should hear a negative reaction too. In my opinion, utterly missable. If for nothing else, avoid it to save yourself seeing *that* scene...(shudder)"

","An unfunny film in unfunny times.<br/><br/>Sasha Baron Cohen is largely a has-been in Europe where his scriptwriters put him through his first, genuinely snappy shows that brought together a lot of influences from lampooning youth culture to spoofs of veteran shows like Benny Hill.<br/><br/>The Borat character was initially used to mock snotty Oxbridge students, foaming-at-the-mouth foxhunting protesters, or just breaking the routines of other performative artists. The point of the skit was that people would treat Borat with respect or courtesy despite his grotesque missteps, so he could go on childish rampages like farting in a meditation group.<br/><br/>It was also widely regarded as the weakest part of the show, relegated to the late or ending segments. After a short but flamboyant run the initial ""Da Ali G show"" had lost its special touch, and US cable seems like the natural place to continue the job for a few years in these cases.<br/><br/>And now, there's an ethnic comedy movie where a Jew, that means from one of the traditionally most tightly sealed-off communities in history, tries to explain something about our world to Americans, one of the youngest and most self-centered nations on this planet. The method used beyond the traditional 'playing dumb and childish' routine from Cohen again seems to be gratuitous offense and over-the-top insensitivity, but somehow it isn't funny at all anymore.<br/><br/>There's a genuine lack of anything like wit or surprise, and he probably writes his own material without much input from a real team. Taking an act 'over the top' is a risky thing and similar results can be observed in many rushed Hong Kong comedies where the fun just doesn't happen despite or because of technically correct execution of 'funny'.<br/><br/>One reason may be that real comedy still comes as interaction between several level players, whereas this film presents a nearly autistic performance that leaves the viewer rooting for the genuinely clueless and debased victims. Going at it or chutzpah is a valuable thing, but if you don't know when to stop you're just a crazy horse."

Then she tells him not to cheat on her, and once he gets to America, the poor woman dies so he goes after Pam Anderson. What an idiot. Then there were the awful gay and Jewish jokes.

I was expecting an intelligent X-ray to the American society even better than Michael Moore's documentaries (at least, this is how the movie was promoted in Argentina). My feelings with this movie are: a) a complete lack of respect with Kazakhstan. I cannot imagine how I had felt if instead of Kazakhstan, the fake country had been Argentina. If Kazakhstanis are offended, I'm with them. b) not very clever. just obvious jokes. c) Borat's behaviour is not politically correct, but i do not consider very difficult (or at least an important thing to watch) to be sitting at a table with a group of people and tell one of them that her wife is ugly. In other words, I'd rather watch Michael Moore's documentaries if I want to understand a little bit of Americans, and some TV show to laugh at people caught in tricks, but not in a serious movie as Borat pretends to be....7 nominations to the Oscars !!! come on !!"
"moviewood","2","4","8","7 January 2007"," I had great expectations
","I went to see the movie because it got so many great reviews and I liked the trailer. I walked into the movie theater thinking I would have a great time. It seemed to be a fun satirical movie. Well, I was very very wrong. I sat there, glancing at my watch, just wishing it would end soon. Some parts of the movie were just gross and not the least bit funny. I must admit that I did laugh, but only a few times. By the time I walked out of the movie theater I was completely disappointed. The idea of making a documentary about a foreigner that travels to America could have been done much better. Do NOT watch this movie unless there is absolutely nothing better to watch."

","No, I do not care that it is rude (I am Dutch, so we're used to that). But it did not make me laugh much either; one can expect this ""humour"" not to be sophisticated, but my God, this sort is extremely juvenile.....<br/><br/>So I found this movie overall pretty boring....<br/><br/>What I did like was the role of the guy that played Azamat Bagatov. Very daring for an actor to go this far in a scene like the one in the hotel room... Yes, he shows guts!<br/><br/>Please bring me something better next time Sacha Baron Cohen .... Maybe your character Bruno, the homosexual fashion designer from Austria Even after this disappointment; I am looking forward to that."

"jrhartley","2","4","8","28 November 2006"," I think I laughed twice, so one vote for each giggle
","Honestly, this was really a painful watch. There's nothing clever about the humour in this, it basically works along the lines or humiliating Americans for having some very bigoted opinions and being out of touch with the modern world (or just stupid) - which is a theme that's been around in Europe amongst comedians for a good 20 years+ now. so if you're European and you watch any comedy at all, you're unlikely to see much in this film that hasn't already been done to death on TV or on the stand-up circuit. a lot of the humour is very forced - one of the times i laughed was when the guy fell off his horse at the rodeo - so something completely by chance, outside of the film-maker's control. i expect a lot of Americans think they are being right-on by liking this film and laughing at themselves, but i think its important not just to like something because it mocks you, there needs to be some quality behind the humour, and there just isn't here. save your 80-odd minutes, i'm sure there's some paint drying somewhere which needs watching."

","I did enjoy this. I need to say that right off the bat, entertaining, hilarious in parts. The film does loose steam, and becomes a one-joke movie and this is where I believe I have problems with it. And the problems I have with it emerged only upon chatting about it with friends. What BORAT shows and completely takes advantage of is the kindness and politeness of Americans. Here is a guy who, by all rights, should be tossed out of most situations he's in... But watch it again, think about it some more... the victims (frat boys aside, idiots) they really have a tolerance, a welcoming nature that Cohen exploits (not that it's not funny) but I'm conflicted with how I'm reacting to the movie."
"soniah_k","Null","4","8","14 November 2006"," If this was for real...
","The Kazakhstan government is not happy, nor should it be. Sasha Baron Cohen's movie 'Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan' depicts Kazakhstan as a misogynistic, anti-semitic, handicap bashing backwater of impoverished villages. Borat arrives in the US to learn civilization for his country and we follow his journey from New York to Los Angeles with stops at Richmond, Dallas, Atlanta etc. Borat is played even bigger and better than his character on HBO's Da Ali G Show. My husband can't stand Borat. I think his dead pan politically insane comments and attitudes are hilarious. Never-the-less, even as I laughed at Borat 's goofs and spoofs in this 80 minute film, it was a very uncomfortable 80 minutes--the comments about Muslims and gay people and the anti-semitic jokes turned my stomach. But in a searching way. There's a scene where an old Jewish couple are figuratively turned into cockroaches-- not funny. To me. Yet much of the audience in the cinema laughed. I kept having to remind myself that Sasha playing Borat is Jewish himself-- you know, I can call my mother what I want but you better respect her. Which is a troubling notion. If people do think this way, is it only a problem when they think this way out loud? Does political correctness curtail freedom of speech? Am I now advocating thought police? Some scenes were downright frightening: a group of white frat boys bemoaning the end of slavery, a Christian revival where Borat is encouraged to talk in 'tongues', Borat at a gun store where he's happily shown a gun perfect for killing a Jew. And some scenes were gross-- hair and fat coupled with nudity is not necessarily funny. That the film's most touching and protective relationship occurs between Borat and a prostitute speaks volumes for the social satire this film is, and for the goodness that deep down Borat's heart is capable of. Or maybe I'm giving Borat too much credit. At the end of the film one wonders that, were this actually real, what 'learnings' Borat would have returned to Kazakhstan from the US with. One thing is for sure though: there are many Americans who have a bit, a lota bit, of Borat living within their souls."

","This movie is supposed to be a comedy about a backward, naive Kazak ""journalist"" crossing America to make a documentary. In reality, it is about someone simply being very rude to others and laughing about it - kind of like when we were in junior high.<br/><br/>I guess it is human nature for people to enjoy being spectators of other people getting humiliated. I suppose that is why folks enjoy the Jerry Springer show. At least on Jackass, people do it to themselves. Such entertainment differs from throwing folks to the lions in the Roman Coliseum only in intensity, not in concept. Based on the half of the movie I wasted time watching, I give it a 1 out of 10."
"paddlin_jones","1","6","14","11 February 2007"," At least it made me spend time thinking about my reaction
","It seemed fitting that upon arriving home after I saw this movie I channel surfed past a Comedy Channel ""roast"" of Pamela Anderson. In that ode to maximizing the ratio of dollars earned per ounce of IQ present, several people - some famous - pulled out all the stops (one surmises there were no stops left to pull) to scrape through the barrel bottom to reach previously unplumbed depths of mean-spirited, profane puerility. It's hard to call it humour.<br/><br/>Borat slides right in to that same vein. Or does it? <br/><br/>When I found myself laughing constantly and often uncontrollably through ""There's Something about Mary"" I figured then that I could be as caught up in potty humour as much as anyone. Borat, however, goes well beyond ""Mary's"" silly and simple sight gags (related often to the middle third of the human body). In that movie, the humour is based upon two factors: the reaction to the initial gag, and also the viewer's realization of their reaction to the gag - they laugh a second time at themselves when they realize they laughed at such silly stuff. Monty Python was often similar.<br/><br/>Borat, in contrast, works off a very different premise.<br/><br/>First of all, it is about deception. Sure it ""pokes fun"" at attitudes towards others. In the global scheme of things of over 6 billion ""others"", Cohen leaves us with the suggestion that the way to deal with diversity is ridicule. Cohen suggests that the ridicule need not stop when one is invited into anothers house for dinner - it's OK to leave a turd beside your plate on the way out. That'll fix 'em so they can all be like... like.... who? Which of the >6 billion is the correct model that we should all follow?<br/><br/>I don't believe that Cohen and the rest of the production team was out to provide moral guidance or even point out anomalies in our society. I think it's likely that he was simply out to be as ridiculously offensive as possible and choosing the race, moral, religious subjects was simply the vehicle for doing that and, besides, harming animals is against the law.<br/><br/>As for the rating (1 out of 10), I had considered initially rating it much higher. The logic goes like this: It provoked me into thinking deeply about my reaction -> thought-provoking cinema is a good thing -> forces a re-examination of both what I know and my moral foundation -> reinforces (or not) my personal moral beliefs -> I should be thankful to the film-maker.<br/><br/>Ultimately, however, it made me think: What does this really say about our society and how much we value other people and diversity of views and cultures? This is rhetorical but it's not so much even the movie itself that most concerns me but the effusive reaction to it from paid critics and its box-office popularity.<br/><br/>What does it say that we honour a person simply because they have a pathologically low level of inhibition and decency? That we would place such a person in the same league - through awards - as the true cinema artists simply because he pushes the envelope of offensiveness? In our society, we view this as being behaviour to strive for and worth rewarding? Now that I have seen the movie I can question why Cohen was even nominated - much less having won - at the Golden Globes.<br/><br/>Best actor? He has the range of a toddler trying to hit the toilet he is sitting on.<br/><br/>Similarly, that the Academy would nominate anything about this film for an Oscar - best adapted sceenplay...? What screenplay?<br/><br/>For anyone who hasn't seen it... If you must, I suggest stealing it - download it or whatever. Don't pay anyone a cent to watch it."
"lambiepie-2","1","5","11","13 October 2007"," If this is comedy, then hold a funeral - comedy is officially dead.
","I am not even about to consider this film in the field of ""gross out comedies"" because within that genre, there is a lot of black comedy executed that those who aren't seeking the dark corners of comedy are satired - and you laugh despite yourself - even when no one else is.<br/><br/>I didn't laugh ONCE throughout this film. Why? Nothing was humorous - although much was done as personal and religious shots against fellow human beings that some may find humorous. I'm not that big of a fan of laughing at other people's failures (of common sense, ethics and decency) or like to make fun over others failings. This is why 'Borat' did not appeal to me.<br/><br/>While I understand that this was a kind of ""Candid Camera"" or sorts not with a filmmaker but with an over-drawn out fictional character pulling the on screen jokes and situations to show how people would react, it still didn't deliver the goods for me. The humor was almost always based on some hind of body part - and personally this film went over board on male anatomy as the bunt of jokes. This got old very fast.<br/><br/>Then there is the shock value - there was plenty of that. But it wasn't shockingly funny - it was shockingly amateur. I found no satire. I found no black comedy. I found no ribald humor. I found no humorous cultural divide. I found no entertainment value. What I did find was almost two hours of my time wasted that I could have used to do something else that would have kept me entertained - and watching the grass grow would have been included in this scenario.<br/><br/>Goshawful film."

","Do not be deceived: This movie is symptomatic of the intellectual and moral rot that masquerades today as entertainment. And sadly, America is buying it.<br/><br/>As a movie, it suffers from the usual: Thin storyline, amateurish and wooden actors, choppy editing, and unintelligible dialog.<br/><br/>But, the biggest problem is that the movie does not know the difference between satire and overkill. Sadly, I don't think the producer and director care, because they know that the American public has lost its ability to discriminate between what is clever and brilliant and what is disgusting and pathetic.<br/><br/>Score one for the Philistines."

","Not only is it a delightful and thoughtful comedy but it's also brilliant and conceptually intelligent. It flies over social satire films and documentaries I've seen so far; ""Borat"" is compulsively funny, ingenious and well acted by this English guy, who'll probably be a celebrity very soon. While making laugh, by means of gaffes, idiots and so on, Borat handles sexism, intolerance, transgression and wild racism. Tells very well about the way social biases are hidden, denied and encouraged, and it gets better and better the way the plot develops.

"cdoelle","5","5","11","7 January 2007"," Itsa... howyousay.... vera bad!
","Before you think I just don't like the kind of humor presented by Sasha Baron Cohen in Borat, let me assure you that I absolutely loved his HBO series Da Ali G Show. I loved all of the characters including the Borat one. What I didn't care for was this horrible movie.<br/><br/>It wasn't until the second half of the film that I even laughed out loud for the first time. The only scenes I found remotely funny were the ones in which he was at the religious revival and at the formal dinner in Georgia. Other than that, it was one big stinker. It is once again a classic example of the difficulty of translating a skit into a full-length film. The writing was horrible, the over-the-top attempts to be gross, and the poorly acted scenes littered between the staged skits made the film barely watchable."
"jimc1215-1","3","5","11","18 December 2006"," Not what I expected
","This movie was 90 minutes of Sasha Cohen being crude and offensive and coming up with all sorts of humorous sexual terms. Normally, I am entertained by this kind of humor and, yes, some of it was very funny,especially early in the movie. As the movie wound down disappointingly, I failed to see the humorous slant on American culture that I expected. Anyone who did must have one fine imagination. Please explain what the hotel room scene was satirizing. Having a limited knowledge of the movie before watching it, I was never sure what scenes were staged and what scenes were real people unaware of what was happening. In the end, I am not sure that it mattered. Though I got some good laughs, for the first time I can ever recall, I felt a little ashamed afterward for having sat through something so stupid as Borat. Check the IMDb voting demographics and you will see that it is the younger crowd that has driven its rating up."

","Having just seen the film (if it can called that), I thought back to my travels to the ""U.S. and A"". Americans, especially outside major urban areas, are polite, pleasant, a bit boorish but overwhelmingly friendly. It is these folks he targets, having clearly worked out NYers, Bostonites, SFans etc. weren't going to fall for it.<br/><br/>So he works on these silly Southerners or nice mildly moronic Mid-westerners as he does.I would be keen to know how many were setup in advance? I feel genuinely sorry for the well meaning old Jewish couple. I hope they were well paid at the end of the day! I have stayed in B and Bs in the ""US and A"", and the proprietors were often ""sweet and hokey"" by any non-American English-speaking definition. It is not an exclusive thing that Americans often appear ill-informed and even dim about the outside (USA) world. But Borat's send-up of these poor folks is excruciating!! I hope they all sue his arse and get him! Kazakhstan is irrelevant to the film - it is just an imaginary country with a real name as it happens, his non-English languages are Hebrew mixed with some Polish.<br/><br/>What is relevant is how ridiculous the sample of Americans appear in the film. Since America has such good anti-home invasion gun laws I would like to ask why someone didn't shoot him dead for abusing their good-natured though naive hospitality.<br/><br/>Here in Australia he wouldn't have been shot but with his previous persona Ali G being comparitively well known and well as people having some knowledge of Borat (from Ali G shows), he would have got a good smack in the head and then had it kicked in ...... instead of being treated so politely. This was put to him on recent (November) visit to Australia as Sacha Cohen - his real self, apparently much of his planned move to go into character here was realistically abandoned and his trip to Australia curtailed. He did apparently go to Bondi Beach to rub suncream on some topless chicks but this segment was thankfully yanked (no pun intended). I understand he only appears now in character to do controlled promotional blips. <br/><br/>Please Americans don't stand for this either as humour or even think it could be. It was a mockumentary in the poorest taste."

It's pure comedy with little if any indecent writing. Would it be for Mr. Cohen, that film would be a marathon of filthy episodes. <br/><br/>One final comment: The proper rating for this movie is NC-17.

","Watching the movie feels like being slapped in the face and kicked in the behind as well being fed a big jar of sweet chocolate all at once. If the reasons behind its making were to mock either the American or the Kazakh way of life it only managed to mock the way in which cultural differences are perceived. There is nothing more hilarious than the reactions that casual Americans have to Borat's habit of kissing and greeting everyone and to his childish sincerity.<br/><br/>The introduction is truly one of the best sequences of the movie even if it is very misleading in the very absence of any Kazakh element. Not only that the music is Serbian and some of the actors are British but it was entirely filmed in Romania, I presume in one of the most secluded and poorest villages the producers could find. Many of the villagers are actually gypsy (Borat's ""asshole"" neighbor for one), the very ones that Borat seems to hate so much.<br/><br/>As for the dose of laughter the movie produces, all I can say is make sure you take an extra pair of underwear with you, you might need it…"
"PaulDA2000","3","5","11","20 November 2006"," Funny but kind of disgusting
","As a Christian, I wanted to check out this movie mainly for the 'salvation scene'in the Church. There are many Christians who don't agree with that Pentecostal style, just so people are aware of that. The Pentecostal scene wasn't that bad, as a matter of fact, many real Pentecostal/charismatic church services look like that. I did find the last scene where they are picking at Jesus (?) on the cross to be offensive. I just have to wonder if he did something similar with Mohammad, how many hundreds of thousands of Muslims would have rioted by now, as they did with those cartoons a while back. Anyway, I understand where the movie is coming from: Borat is ignorant of American customs and comes off as rude and racist, but at the same time the movie shows how racist many Americans are, as we pretend to be this 'great moral nation'. I did not care for the nude wrestling scene, nor for the scene showing Borat's son'd genitals. I did laugh at some of the jokes, my wife laughed a lot more than I did, but this is not the kind of movie that is going to help my walk with the Lord. I mean I don't mind a good comedy with a bit of shock value, but I don't need to see this type of gross out stuff to tell me that there are still racist Americans out there. I already know this."

But, does this make this movie deserve a spot in the top 250 movies of all time (according to the IMDb ratings as good as Twelve Monkeys or Shrek)? I don't think so at all.

","English comic-actor Sacha Baron Cohen takes one of his famous stable of characters,Kazahkstani journalist Borat Sangdiev,and sends him on a cross-country odyssey of America that is as scattered in its logic as it is wildly funny.<br/><br/>Kazhakstan is fictionalized to the point that I have no doubt that any real native of the country will be less-than-pleased with this portrayal. Here we have a fourth-world country of abject poverty and warped social values(for examples:evidentally,prostitution is not only tolerated but is rewarded,and the town rapist is as common as one would consider a town doctor or sheriff)where the customs include such barbaric practices as abusing animals for sport,killing gypsies and collecting their tears(to ward away AIDS,one reasoning)and their fear of Jews,as demonstrated in their ""Running of the Jews"" festival(similar to Spain's ""Running of the Bulls""). Borat leaves his homeland behind(not to mention his angry,abusive wife,his jealous neighbor,his grown son and the large Holstein cow he lives with)to do a report for the one television station,one on that great glorious nation of the U.S.of A.<br/><br/>Once in America,the tour-de-force picks up as can be inferred by the ads. From his inability to get anyone in New York to warm up to his lack-of-personal space mannerisms,to his crusade to win over ""The Virgin Pamela Anderson""(for whom he falls in love with while watching a new and mystical television show on his first day in NYC:""Baywatch"")at a Virgina mega-store signing in Los Angeles. Along the way,he busts up everything from a bright redneck rodeo in the deep South to a gentile dinner party in Mississippi(?),finding a way to fraternize with inner-city black kids and some USC drunk-boys returning from Spring Break. All the bits are quite funny and a nervous stay at a Bed&Breakfast run by Jews that has Borat and his producer(Ken Davitan) scared enough to believe that the roaches in the room are the hosts transformed and a knock-down,drag-out fight Au naturel being uproarious as well as painful to watch simultaneously.<br/><br/>Director Larry Charles,mostly known for his work on TV,particularly ""Seinfeld"",makes this look as seamless and mockumentary as possible. A review(it was either Rolling Stone or Entertainment Weekly)described this as(and I'm paraphrasing)a socio-political version of ""Jackass"" and that may be the most accurate way I could encapsulate it. Cohen's seemingly innocent yet crass foreigner is as able to draw out the awkward,unplanned funniness out of mostly innocent folks(a dumbstruck drivers'Ed instructor,a ""gypsy""woman holding a garage sale)and skewer those who are far,far from innocent(a sleazy car dealer;a racist,pig-headed rodeo exec;the drunken frat-boys mentioned earlier). I'm not sure there's a clear reasoning or moral to this show,but I do get the feeling that the filmmakers were only hoping to give you a broad idea of how bigotry and ignorance is as much domain of the U.S. as it is any backward,poverty-stricken,culturally backwater country. Otherwise,this is mostly a comedy of cultural disconnect. Cohen(a quiet,educated Jewish gentleman,BTW) is excellent here,as his commitment to character is brilliant. <br/><br/>I won't recommend this movie to just anyone.Those who have a wicked,dangerous sense of humor with brains,though,I would highly steer towards this."

I expected it not to be as good as it was popular, but I really didn't expect complete crap. Out of the attributes mentioned above, it is only offensive. Don't get me wrong, I'm not at all against offensiveness. Quite opposite, I'm against today's aggressive political correctness and offensiveness is one of my favorite techniques in achieving humor. But if we are going to be offensive let's do it in the most hilarious way possible. If it's not funny then it's just offensive and just offensive is ugly.

","In the Holy Trinity of comedies with extensive titles, I name the Father: ""Dr. Strangelove or How I Stopped Worrying and Love the Bomb"", the Son ""Everything you Wanted to Know About Sex (But Were Afraid to Ask), and finally, ""Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"", adapted from the titular TV character created by Sacha Baron Cohen.<br/><br/>Like its glorious predecessors, the title wraps up the general idea of the film. Like Woody Allen's film, ""Borat"" is made of little vignettes, outrageously offensive and politically incorrect, like Stanley Kubrick's, it's one of the most brilliant political films. I use the word 'political' because the film delivers, beyond its gags, a brilliant testimony subtly denouncing the level of racism and bigotry that prevailed in the Post-September 11 era, fallaciously disguised as patriotism. If there ever was a film that defined the Bush-era, like ""Strangelove"" did for the Cold War, ""Borat"" is the most eloquent, endorsed –and it's not surprising- by Michael Moore, himself. <br/><br/>But it's not just about America, there is the second titular country too, ""Kazakhstan"". If the merit of ""Borat"" is to have put the ex-Soviet Union Nation in the map and print an indelible mark in American Pop-Culture, should Kazakhs be proud of this tall and lanky mascot with a cartoonish mustache carrying a bag with a chicken inside? I guess not, but the alternative is no better. To attack Borat is to take it seriously, now, are we such naive fools to believe that Kazakshtan is such an underdeveloped countries women would win prizes of prostitution. If you're smart enough to get that it's a joke, then you should take it as a joke. After all, Borat turns into derision some aspects of America as well.<br/><br/>The film follows Borat's journey to America, with his sidekick Azamat. His mission is to collect all the necessary information that can help to improve the standards of the glorious nation of Kazakhstan. The most appealing aspect in Borat is that he's physically odd enough to appear like a foreigner, even an Arab, and his accents made with Russian barbarism, 'very nice' and 'woowoowewa', complete the hilarious caricature. Yet his gray suit and quite affable nature is enough to inspire the benefit of the doubt and allow him to immerse in society. And in the meantime, we have one of the most memorable cinematic characters to grace the screen with an originality and speech mannerisms that would challenge any struggling imitator. After Forrest Gump, Karl Shilders, Ace Ventura, there is Borat, a new comedy icon.<br/><br/>Among the interactions he has with American people, many of them are unscripted; he acts rather naturally, expressing his racist and misogynistic views in the most matter-of-fact way. He describes a feminist as an ""old man"", he brings his excrement on a plastic bag in a gentlemen's dinner, he randomly goes kiss people in the subway or during a yard sale, accuses a woman to be a gypsy who just shrunk the owner into a Barbie doll, these are some of the film's funniest moments. But, the fact that he could go as far in his 'act' is really a credit to American's open-mindedness, even though it sometimes confine to their most caricature traits: stupidity. Are they stupid enough to believe the man is only fooling them? <br/><br/>Well, the film delivers some answers when Borat lures some Rodeo-participants to ill-speak about Muslims. The film offended Kazakhs, now were American opinions on Muslims that different from the opinions of 'Kazakhs' on Jews, keeping in mind, these were real.The film strikes a very sensitive chord in the way it caricatures the ugliest traits of patriotism and pride of belonging and translate them into laughs. The film tackles the racism of its character by respecting our intelligence and not trying to depict his people as malevolent but victim of their own prejudices. The gags are only the reflects of sadder realities in microcosm, and American audience laugh because it's still better than laughing at themselves.<br/><br/>Which leads to one of the biggest issue of the film, Anti-Semitism, Borat informs us that in Kazakhstan, there is a problem"" social, economical and Jew"", he says it in such a casual way that it's already hilarious, even more than the cringe-inducing national sports made of the worst Anti-Semitism. I regard this aspect as a masterstroke of writing because it consecrates the total idiocy of Borat without condemning it, he's more a victim of himself and we look at it as a jovial imbecile. That he's taken seriously after that is one of the film's most exquisite delights. Indeed, it's not when he asks for a gun to protect him from Jews that is funny, it's that the owner doesn't react to it.<br/><br/>The film avoided that Anti-Semitic criticism on the basis that Sacha Baron Cohen was Jewish. Although I understand the point, I don't think it's the right reason to justify it. Would the same film be made by a non-Jewish actor stop being funny? I don't think so, and if it had ever been proved that the actor was malicious, the film would never have been released. Cohen is not mocking people, but the way people are blinded by their own misconceptions. Borat's conception of gypsies, Jews or homosexuals is no worse than Americans' against Muslims. And remember the scene where he realized he played dirty games with a homosexual despite his blatant homophobia, this sums up the whole idea of the film, that sometimes, we're not necessarily better or different in our actions, than the people we accuse. <br/><br/>If the Antisemitism of Borat can be taken like humor on the simple basis that Sacha Baron Cohen is Jew, then following the same logic, he should have been American and only an Arab comedian could have done ""The Dictator"". In my opinion, it's precisely because anyone can be offended by ""Borat"" that no one should."

","me and my buddy have a thing - we laugh at anything anywhere anytime. All we need is a push - a weird expression or a dumb innocent person - and we're off laughing like those clowns in circus. We both ofter gather together at least once in a month to watch comedy movies in theaters or at home. I tell you, people hate us when we're at the theaters because we qiss the audience off with our giggles and comments even at a touching moment in a film.<br/><br/>About this film- it was a blasting start for us- we burst into laughter the moment we saw his face and heard his accent. We laughed at his people, place, accents, etc absolutely everything. We paused the movie and kept rolling on the floor laughing, then we rewind the scene and again laugh till our bellies begged for mercy.<br/><br/>This is one of the best comedy films. I'd give it 20 out of 10 ratings if I owned this website. It took us 3 hours to finish the movie after all those pauses, rewinds and pukes. Oh yeah, we threw the burgers out we ate while watching the movie.<br/><br/>This is a must watch for cool guys like us who make fun of people's accents, behaviors and dumbness."

","I saw this movie today for the first time and I am very impressed. It is a movie which has complexity and has indeed many levels of reading.<br/><br/>1. Funny: I started laughing on the first scene and stopped after the end credits. Sure, there are many instances of ""gross"" humour, but also important, a layer of satire.<br/><br/>2. Disturbing: Some scenes are horrifying, the fight scene, the racist scenes, and I think also the anthem scene. They constitute a shock perfectly apt to bring us to the next level,<br/><br/>3. Deep: This film did make me think a lot. It brings forth considerations to what is the meaning of social conventions to us. What really makes us ""feel at home"" or not. I have read many comments about the satire ""against"" the United States. I can agree to these, generally. But while knowing the American culture, we are more prepared to understand the cultural differences, I think the movie could have depicted an Indio from Paraguay visiting China, or whatever, and this message would be much the same.<br/><br/>And the last thought.. this film is not suited to an audience under age 3. Of course I laughed. Then I thought, OK I wouldn't show this movie to someone under 14. Then I thought: and why wouldn't I? (Because there are two naked men? Because I'd have to explain what is a prostitute?) And I realized this was _exactly_ the point of the movie.<br/><br/>I really didn't like the comments saying that this movie is ""racist"" or ""sexist"" when in fact it is exactly the opposite."

It's actually pretty smart as well. Sacha Cohen is so ridiculously consistent and never seems to break character, even when he turns an entire rodeo against him in less than 5 minutes.<br/><br/>I really don't want to speak anymore of the film, because part of the beauty of it is being surprised by what you see on the screen.

"oneguyrambling","8","2","3","3 November 2010"," The work of a real improvisational genius - try this on Will Ferrell!
","I loved Da Ali G Show, bought him Indahouse and own a couple of Ali G Show DVDs, one of which heavily features Borat in several hilarious bits, so why the change of heart? I'm not sure, but when pressed (by myself) I admit that I enjoy the concept more than the films, and I felt uncomfortable knowing that Sacha Baron Cohen was manipulating what were often good and innocent people so that they would feel themselves uncomfortable and unsure of themselves.<br/><br/>Yes it showed that Americans are often critical, unthinking and hypocritical idiots, but surely by now that is shooting fish in a barrel.<br/><br/>So since checking it out the first time I never bothered with it again.<br/><br/>I certainly admire Sacha Baron Cohen, in any of his Ali G Show incantations he never varied from character and directed the chats back to where he wanted them to go regardless of the interviewee's intent, but when things did go astray his ability to work and ad-lib on the fly was nothing less than incredible. Even in Borat guise, he apparently remained in character at all times to keep sharp and was so focused on keeping things authentic that he never washed the Borat suit, and those that have seen the film know that there is only one outfit that he wears in what must have been a multiple week shoot.<br/><br/>The Borat plot is irrelevant, a Kazakhstani reporter goes to the United States with the intent of making a documentary on US customs, only he gets sidetracked by an episode of Baywatch and decides his new goal is to marry Pamela Anderson, (if he had chosen Paris Hilton it would have been a fait accompli). The laughs come from both Borat's view of society, gender relations and his lack of political correctness (all of which p*ssed off the Kazakh people who rightfully thought that the less intelligent viewer might swallow the shtick lock, stock and barrel), and from the reactions of the unwitting Americans who feel they are being interviewed by a clueless hack and open up to their true attitudes.<br/><br/>There are a million quotables in the film, most of them involving the society taboos of incest, rape and bestiality, among others. Again this elicits the shock response from well meaning people, but more disturbingly it signals to those with less than pure thoughts to go nuts and espouse their own ridiculous ideas. An example comes where Borat asks a car dealer how fast a car needs to go to kill Jews, and the dealer calmly gives not only a blank stare, but a thought out answer! I think realistically if anyone takes offense at what Borat says, they shouldn't be watching the film in the first place, or they at least didn't see the preview. It is the responses that should trouble society, as so many interviewees casually toss out racist and homophobic comments with precious little prompting, only because they thought it would never be seen.<br/><br/>Borat has been criticised for being largely set up, and the scene with Pamela Anderson is clearly a set up. The scenes involving the rodeo organiser, the car dealer, driving instructor and Idiot college kids must embarrass the participants and anyone ever associated with them. The College kids in particular earn the right to be publicly shamed, (thanks to Anthony, Justin and David's parents!) I won't go into any other scenes here, the movie is only 80 minutes and watching it is almost as quick as reading this. In essence I feel the charm of Borat is that he is largely ego-less and ignorant, his apparent innocence is endearing to those he comes across, so their attempts to help are endearing, which is why I feel awkward watching them get screwed over.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 7.5 / 10. Extra points for being the first and going the furthest. Now we'll see post-Bruno how far other less talented and less inspired filmmakers go, because gross outs for gross out's sake lead to American Pie clones.<br/><br/>If you liked this (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com"
"sc8031","5","2","3","25 June 2008"," Are YOU dumber than Sacha, too?
","I don't think this is as funny as the Borat sketches Sacha Baron Cohen did on his earlier series, ""Da Ali G Show"". Those, being limited to about 7 minutes, were much more digestible. The Borat movie is pretty funny for the first third or so, but becomes kind of tiresome after a while. It ends up feeling kinda mean-spirited.<br/><br/>To me, this kind of candid humor is more like horror. You can argue that Sacha Baron Cohen, a borderline sociopath, is making some kind of statement about racism or elitism or the people in the US. Whatever. I don't buy it. I think he just gets a kick out of this stuff.<br/><br/>There are certainly some funny scenes, but in the end it amounts to Sacha exploiting people who are dumber than him. Sure it's funny to the audience, but you're watching his movie and giving him money. You're dumber than him too."
"Floated2","8","1","1","1 May 2020"," Offensive but quite entertaining
","After having watched Sacha Baron Cohen's other films in Bruno and The Dictator, and having not seen Borat but being quite familiar with the film and knowing of its success and strong feedback. As a film, Cohen portrays the character of Borat well as it does feel genuine and we can't always tell which scenes are scripted and which are authentic. The film does feature much offensive jokes about stereotypes, racism, religious themes and others and often does take several things quite far (the nude wrestling with him and his manager in his hotel room for one).<br/><br/>But overall, it does provide genuine laughs and has a certain entertainment factor about it. Unlike Bruno, in which we can see is more of a replica of Borat, this film is overall more entertaining and better simply because the character of Borat is better and isn't as forced as Bruno. Perhaps people's perceptions would be different if Bruno were made and released before Borat.<br/><br/>Though the film does feel like several unrelated scenes one after another, there is somewhat of a plot as it unfolds in the end. Another thing, the film doesn't tend to drag since it is quite short in runtime (83 minutes), which is beneficial to the film and its audience. It is a film which is offensive and severely not for everyone, which is understood. Borat was released in 2006 and in today's time seem to be considered a classic to many. It has seemingly aged well."
"Jeremy_Urquhart","9","1","1","20 April 2020"," An absolutely brilliant comedy
","Okay, so from now on I'm just going to refer to this movie as ""Borat,"" because while the official, full title of the movie is hilarious, it sure is tough to type. It's even tough to copy and paste. It's just that long.<br/><br/>Anyway, ridiculously long title or not, this movie is absolutely hilarious. Of course, humour is almost completely subjective, so I understand that my praises of this movie won't likely convince anyone who doesn't like this movie to judge it otherwise, but that's honestly okay with me. In my personal opinion, this is one of the funniest, smartest, and most satirical comedies in cinema history. Can I really say that a comedy that's merely 13 years old, (and has yet to proven itself as a film that can stand the test of time) is one of my favourite comedies of all time? Well shoot, I guess I just did.<br/><br/>Before the review, I just have to mention that there are a boatload of honourable mentions for this category, as there are a number of comedies that I can sincerely claim to be amazing (at least to me- remember the subjectivity of comedy). Dr. Strangelove, The Blues Brothers, Some Like it Hot, City Lights, Life of Brian, Tropic Thunder... all comedies I love, but for me, Borat manages to triumph slightly over them all.<br/><br/>Borat, in case you didn't know, is a mockumentary involving the fictional reporter Borat, played brilliantly by Sacha Baron Cohen, who comes from Kazakhstan and travels to the USA in order to ""learn"" the cultural differences between his country and theirs. What he actually ends up doing is freaking out a bunch of Americans with his extreme and vulgar behaviour, and in the process reveals a sinister level of racism and xenophobia present in some (mainly southern) areas of the country.<br/><br/>Yes, the humour in this film can get extremely crude, and many of the scenes are hard to watch because of how disgusting and uncomfortable they can be. But Sacha Baron Cohen has to make these people uncomfortable as hell, as it's the awkward situations that reveal the prejudice numerous Americans seemingly have towards races and cultures they're not used to. Of course, Baron Cohen does resort to extreme stereotypes and over-the-top antics in order to get the reactions he wants from the people he comes across, but it's all done in order to support the film's strong level of satire. And it is the use of stereotypes in order to reveal a dark under-current of racism in America that makes this film memorable, and so much more than just another crude and disgusting comedy.<br/><br/>Although, in my opinion, the crass, revolting scenes in this film are usually very funny because of just how far Baron Cohen is willing to go in a number of unfortunately unforgettable scenes. Good luck ever forgetting the scene in which a naked Borat and an equally naked fat assistant have a prolonged fight/ chase scene through a hotel. And yeah, you see almost everything. But the scene is an example of one that goes so far over the top with its vulgar visuals that it somehow becomes manageable. Barely. It's still horrifying to watch, but it's ultimately a hilarious scene.<br/><br/>A lot of the film's scenes have reached near legendary status, with Borat having been definitively inserted into modern day popular culture for a while now. To detail too many other scenes would ruin many of the film's surprises- as unpleasant as some of them may be, it's still best to go into this film knowing as little as possible. That way the shock comedy will likely be more effective.<br/><br/>Sacha Baron Cohen is on fire in this movie, coming up with some brilliant on the spot quips and just generally expressing some amazing examples of improvisational comedy sequences. And most of the scenes look genuine too- if these sequences were indeed staged, then they were certainly staged extremely well. Borat's escape from a Bed and Breakfast is the only scene which feels almost certainly scripted. Everything else feels very real, maybe too real- but ultimately this makes the movie more effective, and definitely more memorable.<br/><br/>Baron Cohen's 2009 follow-up Bruno was still a pretty funny movie, but it retread a lot of ground already covered by Borat, and it felt regrettably more scripted than Borat too. And The Dictator was decent, although its comedy was a little too hit and miss for my tastes, leading to a somewhat unsatisfying film for me personally. So in my opinion, Borat is Sacha Baron Cohen's true masterpiece- a great comedy, a masterful mockumentary, and a film that expertly balances disgustingly crude humour and exceptionally smart satire.<br/><br/>It's a must-watch for those of us with reasonably strong stomachs and a decent tolerance to some seriously cringe-worthy comedy."

","This is easily among the top 5 funniest movies I have ever seen. There were points in which I was laughing uncontrollably-something I do not normally do while watching movies...ever! ""Borat"" is simply a genius comedy, one that isn't afraid to be a little dark and edgy, while also remaining intelligent, satirical, and-most importantly-hilarious! The fact that many of the characters that Borat encounters are actual unsuspecting people makes the film even more hilarious...and shocking!<br/><br/>However, this movie does have genuine, witty humor rather than just the immature nonsense some of its opposers may claim it has. There is tons of satirical commentary throughout on subjects including racism, homophobia, religion, political correctness, and so on. <br/><br/>Not to mention, the lead performance by Sacha Baron Cohen is practically flawless, he captures the ridiculousness of his character and the script with excellency.<br/><br/>If you enjoy laughter, this movie is extremely recommended."
"corymauricejohnson","6","1","1","16 February 2016"," Hilarious
","By far the best Sacha Baron Cohen movie. That isn't saying much considering the others are pretty mediocre, but Borat is absolutely hilarious. You can watch this solely as a silly comedy and there will be tons of great parts for you. However, the reason why this is such a good movie is because it's more than slapstick. The documentary aspect of this movie improves it so much more, especially since many of the scenes weren't staged and show real civilian reactions to Borat's shenanigans. The plot is fairly standard, but who's watching Borat for the plot? Instead of watching for the plot, watch this movie for the insanely quotable lines. Everyone knows at least one line from this movie, and if not then you at least know the iconic Mankini. Great movie that has been properly judged by critics but overlooked by the people, unfortunately."

"CinemaClown","Null","1","1","22 September 2015"," A Priceless Comedy From Sacha Baron Cohen!
","Making a complete mockery of everything in its path, Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (simply known as Borat) is an absolute riot that's offensive, shocking & hilarious in every possible manner and despite the controversy it caused during its time of release, it remains one of the finest comedies of its decade.<br/><br/>Borat tells the story of its titular character; a TV reporter in Kazakhstan who's sent to the ""U, S and A"" by his government to make a documentary about American society & culture. Once there, he interacts & interviews numerous people in order to understand the American way of life and after watching an episode of Baywatch, falls in love with Pamela Anderson.<br/><br/>Written by Sacha Baron Cohen & directed by Larry Charles, Borat works only because of Cohen for the actor is truly committed to his role and does a terrific job in bringing to life one of the vilest characters to ever grace the film canvas. Many segments present in the final print are unscripted & improvised on the spot and the hysterical reaction it is able to garner from its unsuspecting subjects is truly priceless.<br/><br/>There are multitudes of rib-tickling moments to be found here for we witness Borat taking a course to understand American humour, mocking a panel of feminists, irking a rodeo crowd, insulting his hosts, making numerous anti-semitic, homophobic & sexist remarks, and many more situations that soon escalate into total madness. And yet, as the film nears its closing moments, it goes on to show that it has a heart of its own.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Borat is an insane exercise in crude humour that spares nothing & no one over the course of its runtime, captures the ignorance & tolerance of American society quite effectively, and benefits a lot from Sacha Baron Cohen's swashbuckling performance which single-handedly elevates this mockumentary to an instant classic status. Enjoyable, entertaining & filled with moments you can't help but laugh despite being aware of its utter offensive nature, Borat is definitely worth a shot and comes delightfully recommended."
"cleary-joshua","8","1","1","31 January 2015"," Baron Cohen lampoons everything, with no exceptions...
","I can still remember very clearly the time ""Borat"" came out, mainly because everyone that I seemed to interact with was talking about. The posters were everywhere, it was in the news, the hype was enormous. Somehow it took me 8 years to see it, but for a film which is incredibly topical it still feels alarmingly relevant. It's crude and offensive, and yet extremely funny because of the situations that go on. Of course, Sacha Baron Cohen shines in the title role, lampooning everything he can with no exceptions.<br/><br/>For anyone that's been living under a rock for the past 8 years, Borat is a Kazakh journalist who goes around tricking people into doing or saying absurd things. We meet him in a rural town in Kazakhstan, where he is sent by the government to America in order to make a documentary about their culture. He goes with his producer, Azamat, with whom he has a sometimes rocky relationship, and they meet people from all walks of life. The character is inherently funny as a cultural stereotype who is stupid and offensive, but the real laughs in the film come from the reactions of other people. Because he is often so plausible, people will do or say things that they wouldn't on US television, and he baits his targets with ridiculous situations just to see how they'd react.<br/><br/>It's a film based less on plot and more on hilarious set-pieces, which become even funner because the reactions are genuine and unscripted. Borat releases chickens on the subway, sings made up words to the US national anthem at a rodeo, embarrasses himself at a a dining club, goes to a Pentecostal church meeting and has a naked fight with Azamat through a crowded hotel. The stunts are all hilarious, and made even more-so by the fact that they actually happened - it's really just a standard road movie, but accentuated by being real.<br/><br/>At the start of the film, you try to figure out who the film is satirising through its offence. It seems anti-Semitic or anti-Kazakhstan, but it soon becomes quite clear who the fools of the film are - the American people. Borat is there to exploit American stereotypes of nationalism, rednecks, conservatives and Christian crazies. Sure, he's a stereotype, but the fact that he's so often taken as genuine shows Americans as gullible and stupid. His choice is dangerous, however, since there are many who won't understand the depth of this lampooning, and instead think it's okay to be anti-Semitic etc. In this way, the film very occasionally crosses a line in terms of taste.<br/><br/>The film is just over 80 minutes long, and this feels like the perfect length for it. Any more and the jokes might become tiresome - there isn't really a proper plot to any of it, just a series of vignettes. Having finally experienced it, I can instantly tell why it was such a craze and has become so iconic - it's quotable, and nearly every scene makes you laugh. In this way, it's better than a vast number of scripted comedies these days. Shouldn't we be worried about this?"
"bowmanblue","9","1","1","21 July 2014"," Will probably offend everyone (and all the better for it)
","If you're wondering whether to watch 'Borat' or not, you probably need to ask yourself how do you feel about its star – the man behind the moustache, aka Sacha Baron Cohen himself. If you don't know who he is by now, or have never heard about him, I strongly advice you look him up on the internet (there must be numerous clips of his work on Youtube for example) and, if you like what he does, then Borat will be a treat for you.<br/><br/>Sacha Baron Cohen is an English comedian/actor who specialises in sending up his (unsuspecting) victims by portraying outrageous characters in their vicinity and secretly filming their reactions. Here, he plays a fictional journalist, Borat, from Kazakhstan who travels to America to do a documentary on American culture.<br/><br/>However, if you're thinking that the whole film will be nothing more than 'hidden camera antics,' then you'll be wrong. The 'story' is heavily scripted around the 'set pieces' which make up the footage that is filmed without the knowledge of the public. It's most likely best to view the film as half scripted, half hidden camera and completely outrageous.<br/><br/>It is offensive. Although it's hard to say exactly who to. Much of the debates surrounding the film centres on who should be offended more. Some say that it portrays people from Kazakhstan poorly while others say it's 'anti-American' and, in places, anti-Semitic. I think it just mocks the world we live in and nicely points out that no one should be beyond parody.<br/><br/>Don't expect a beautifully-created storyline with well-developed characters and clever story arcs, just enjoy seeing pretty much everyone sent up, as they are repeatedly amazed and appalled by the antic of the man with the moustache. And, as I said at the beginning, if you have no idea what to expect from this film, don't watch it. You need to know what you're letting yourself in for before you spend an hour and a half in the company of Borat. Also, if you enjoyed this so much that you bought it on DVD, it's worth noting that a lot of extra funny scenes were cut from the theatrical release and can be found on the 'extras' menu – don't take the DVD out of the machine without checking those babies out!<br/><br/>http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/"

","Sasha Baron Cohen really made a breakthrough with this film.

","Borat is one of those things that is so hilariously immature, if you didn't have a context for how the movie was filmed it might seem a bit childish. But it resonates on a much deeper level, and as i'm sure Sacha Baron Cohen intended it, the character of Borat brings out the ignorance in people around him like a magnet. He's not meant to be taken seriously, but instead more of a trickster disguised as a fool to expose the foolishness of men. Borat was filmed documentary style, and people actually believed it was a socially awkward kazakh guy with no understanding of American culture. He and his ""producer"" are the only actors in the entire movie, everyone else are actually real people. The fact that it was so easy to convince people that his character was real should inspire Americans to expand their close-minded worldview, and as a kazakh girl i dated told me, real Kazakhstan is nothing like the one from Borat. But as i see it, Borat is not parodying Kazakhstan, it is parodying America."

","Sacha Baron Cohen creates a mockumentary about one of his characters. Borat Sagdiyev is from Kazakhstan mesmerized by Baywatch character C. J. Parker. He vows to find actress Pamela Anderson and take her from California back to his home in Kazakhstan.<br/><br/>The humor is edgy, offensive, and rather mean spirited at times. Most of it is directed at Borat. But many people in this film become collateral damage. There are multiple stories of people who got filmed thought it was a real documentary. And they were edited to make them look ridiculous. Those parts are not always that funny. They're usually too obvious. Anyways self deprecating humor is usually the best. Sacha really excels at making fun of Borat. He has to be one of the most original characters on screen. Just ignore whatever class or taste you have, and enjoy the outrageousness that is Borat."
"JPfanatic93","8","1","1","22 September 2013"," Politically correct? What's that?
","Hilarious, subversive and playful comedy about a journalist from Kazakhstan, Borat Sagdiyev (undoubtedly Sacha Baron Cohen's most memorable character), who is sent by his government to the 'U, S and A' to make a report on life in its various aspects in the greatest country of the world, together with his short tempered and less than enthusiastic producer Azamat. On a trip across the country, traveling from one great sketch to another, Borat falls in love with Pamela Anderson (after seeing her only once on TV) and aims to track her down and marry her the Kazakh way, whether she likes to or not. Though the scenes in Borat's village in Kazakhstan are quite obviously staged (to great comedic effect), since such a wonderfully silly place just can't exist anywhere, the question remains just how much of the American part of the film is for real, as Borat interviews many different average Americans and manages to get great reactions out of his subjects, most feeling very natural and many of them quite disturbing, but all of them the object of very funny, often completely politically incorrect gags involving every conceivable minority out there (Jews, gypsies, coloured people, women, homosexuals, prostitutes, etc.): if Cohen didn't happen to be Jewish himself, it's likely he wouldn't have gotten away with the stunts he pulls here, though after the success of this film (both in terms of reception and box office) he got into many a lawsuit for his outrageous behavior regardless. The funniest scenes of this film include the 'Running of the Jew' event in Borat's home town, Borat singing the Kazakhstan national anthem on the melody of the American national anthem at a rodeo in front of hundreds of conservative flag waving American citizens, and a fight between Borat and Azamat in the nude in a hotel that goes on for much longer than is comfortable to anyone. Cohen would repeat the formula verbatim in 2009 with the much less impressive and fairly predictable Brüno."

The question raises its ugly head, did they all sign releases? SAG minimum perhaps for those whose voices were clearly heard speaking meaningful words, but what if they refused the bait? Can't be. Ordinary-people ignorant, but isn't that risky? Are the producers and distributors open to a class action suit? We'll see. This, too, is America.<br/><br/>Oh yes, I thought that all these kept-in-the-dark people delivered first class completely believable performances aka natural behavior, no actory shtik to be seen anywhere. Ensemble performances professionals should envy and audit.

","I just got back from a midnight showing of Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan and here is my review: Crap.<br/><br/>This movie is bad. Now don't get me wrong, I loved the Borat clips we've been used to seeing from his Ali G show, it's just that this movie falls victim to the same pitfalls of Sacha's last movie Ali G Indahouse. That is, to involve itself with a spaced out simple minded and juvenile storyline, completely ruining the movie's main character.<br/><br/>The strength of Sacha's Borat character is his impromptu conversations with the 'man on the street'. When Borat is interviewing unwitting subjects on camera, it's downright hilarious, but when he delivers his lines to willing participants, it's downright dumb. And unfortunately, there is just way too much of that in this movie.<br/><br/>I don't need to see Borat making faces while calling his neighbor an as*hole, his bear scaring off children, or Borat pretending to capture Pamela Anderson with a bag. It just doesn't work. All those scenes come across as cheap, poorly written and acted crap about as entertaining as an episode of Save by the Bell and as unfunny and unconvincing as Police Academy 4. There is far too much of this crap in the movie, and it takes away from the few real interviews we get to see."
"Buddy-51","8","5","12","14 April 2007"," Candid Camera for the 21st Century
","The pseudo-documentary ""Borat"" resembles nothing so much as a ""Candid Camera"" episode on crack. Like Allen Funt, the originator of the format, Sacha Baron Cohen - along with his co-writers, Anthony Hines, Peter Baynham and Dan Mazer and director Larry Charles - generates laughs by tricking unsuspecting people into making complete and utter fools of themselves on camera. Only, in this case, Cohen ventures much further into the realms of vulgarity and crudeness than Funt could ever have imagined or the television censors of his time would ever have permitted. <br/><br/>As embodied by Cohen, Borat is a fictional character who hails from the very real West Asian country of Kazakhstan. Convinced that he can learn some valuable lessons from the West that he can then bring back and share with his own people, Borat says goodbye to his impoverished village and heads to the United States to experience first hand the accoutrements of American culture. The film chronicles the many absurd encounters he has with the folks he meets, mainly in Middle America, as he wends his way westward across the continent in search of his dream girl, Pamela Anderson. <br/><br/>Some of the ""skits"" the filmmakers have come up with are sidesplitting and hilarious, some merely amusing, and others downright offensive (and all the funnier for being offensive, I might add). The movie is least successful when it breaks away from the strict ""Candid Camera"" formula and shows us Borat on his own, out of sight of anyone not in on the joke, still carrying on the fiction. In other words, the more ""scripted"" the movie appears, the less authentic it feels. It should also be noted that there are times when one gets the impression that the people on whom the deception is being played are not quite as ignorant of the ruse as they appear to be, primarily because the placing of the camera often feels illogical if the spontaneity were truly real and genuine. The one element that made ""Candid Camera"" utterly believable was that it was careful to keep the camera completely hidden throughout the course of the bit. Here we wonder why it takes people so long to realize that they are indeed the target of a colossal joke (a prime example is when the old Jewish couple is walking up the stairs to bring food to the visiting Borat and the camera is filming them from OUTSIDE the room rather than sticking with Borat and his cohort within).<br/><br/>However, what gives the movie its gravitas and heft, and takes it far beyond the level of mere ""Jackass""-type gimmickry is how Cohen manages to use his shtick to expose the bigotry and xenophobia that lie just beneath the surface of a certain segment of American society. Yet, one should also point out that quite a number of these people are actually more tolerant and indulgent of Borat's inane antics than one might except any reasonable person to be (or than we ourselves might be if we were put in a similar situation). Indeed, there's a certain cruelty to the film in that the individuals and groups he is mocking are actually treating him rather nicely at times. The audience is allowed to feel superior to the people on screen in a way that might not be entirely justified. ""Candid Camera"" always seemed innocent and harmless in its intentions; ""Borat"" definitely does not, which is both the strength and the weakness of the film.<br/><br/>Still, love him or loathe him, one cannot help but sit back and admire the sheer courage and chutzpah Cohen displays in placing himself in what are, in actuality, some pretty hairy situations. That he isn't ridden out of town on a rail, the outraged citizenry chasing close behind him with torches ablaze, is, perhaps, the most astonishing aspect of the movie. It's the bald-faced audacity with which Cohen throws himself into his work - rather than the quality of the individual sketches themselves - that ultimately makes ""Borat"" so much fun to watch."

","I went to see Borat because of the great hype generated in all media. I even checked on IMDb en saw a great mark of more than 8/10.

It seems that every non-American is a complete idiot, extremely racist and vulgar. <br/><br/>Secondly,I am most surprised by the amount of people can actually like this movie and who declare it is the best comedy ever. Maybe liking this movie or not says a lot of the cultural level of people.

"tomhbrand","9","5","12","3 December 2006"," Borat, Cutting Open The Belly Of America
","The latest full length adaptation of one of Sasha Baron Cohen characters is part gross-out comedy and part social satire on American society, as the charmingly clueless Kasakhstani reporter travels across the country to learn how to make his home town more like ""the greatest country in the world"", along the way falling in love with Pamela Anderson and beginning a journey across America to find and marry her.<br/><br/>The joy of Borat is the total cultural incompatibility combined with the easiest aspects of American culture to mock. (You notice how he travels through the southern states, not the north) And sometimes you find yourself unsure which is actually funnier, Baron Cohen's activities or the reactions he draws out of the American public. Some of the people he meets, especially at a rodeo in Texas, really do defy all belief and/or any faith in humanity.<br/><br/>Of course the big question when watching films like this is exactly how much of it is done live and how much is staged, and how much the director had to manipulate to get the reactions they wanted. And of course when they want to make sure they get away with it. (Apparently the police were called on the actor 91 times during production) So sometimes you feel that people had to have been briefed on how to act to move the plot along/prevented being arrested, and sometimes the people say such horrible things they just have to be truly and deeply held beliefs. And the fact that so many people are currently trying to sue the production for the way they've been portrayed in the film, from drunk frat boys to a Romanian village, really proves that people are quite happy to say how they really feel to someone they think they have to be superior to.<br/><br/>Despite all the things that he says and does you can't but help but like the character, because Sacha Baron Cohen manages to imbue the character with such innocence and charm that not once do you ever suspect any of the things he does or says are meant in malice, only total cultural misunderstanding. Especially as you just know there aren't people in the world who are really like this, and if you do well then the joke appears to be on you.<br/><br/>The only point I felt slightly uncomfortable with is the fact that Baron Cohen uses a real country to use as a stereotype, when that might offend real people. But the whole point is that Borat is a collection of stereotypes that people will believe. A mixture of all the different beliefs that people have about poor eastern European countries. (Conversations you see in the film between Borat and his producer actually consist of a mixture of Russian, Yiddish and Armenian with the two actors speaking totally different languages to each other.) Deep down the underlying joke with Borat is that people are so uninformed that they actually believe that Borat's really exist somewhere in the world.<br/><br/>But the main point that underlies all of this is the however offensive Borat is, or however much you cannot believe what you see on screen, you are laughing far too hard to care. There were times it hurt I was laughing so much. You can go into the film consciously acknowledging all the points that could make the film could be politically incorrect or possibly cause offence, but once you're watching it's impossible to take it seriously, and that's the whole point.<br/><br/>I wouldn't say that this movie is to everybody's taste. Avoid if you take offence easily, but if you do remember that that you are missing one of the comic highlights of the year."

But for those with a suitably twisted sense of humor, the movie is world class fun.<br/><br/>""Borat"" achieves a level of inspired nuttiness I had not seen since the height of the Monty Python oeuvre. There is something about British humor that allows thorough silliness but (seeming) earnestness and seriousness, too. <br/><br/>Our protagonist, Borat Sagdiev a Kazakhstani TV reporter, comes to America to report on ""the greatest country in the world."" During the course of his adventures, Borat learns about the intricacies of indoor plumbing and vows to marry Pamela Anderson  to whom he later proposes at a book signing, promising Pamela her own plow if she will have him. And so it goes.<br/><br/>Some reviewers have found high minded messages in Borat. I, in stark contrast, thought that it was simply a very funny guy  Sacha Baron Cohen, the star and co-writer of the piece  creating some very funny situations of an earnest but naïve visitor to our shores dealing with culture shock of a high order in a raunchy but inspired way.

Go to this movie expecting to be offended, because I simply can't think of a group here he doesn't poke fun at. Jews, gays, women - all are touched on, but in such a way that the offensive nature of the film reveals the bigoted nature of his (I can only assume) clueless co-stars. Cohen himself is orthodox Jewish, so for him the jokes are purely that - jokes. However, you'll see that such is not necessarily the case for those around him. Even if you align with a group that is targeted, if you can see the fun intended by the movie, it will keep you laughing for hours. (Being Jewish myself, I still found the Running of the Jew and ""cockroach"" scenes to be among the best in the movie.) Folks, this is one movie you must see before you die.

","I was hoping for something more from this movie, having seen some of Sacha Baron Cohen's other stuff and having heard lots of good things about the film from friends. There were a couple of funny scenes but overall the movie was boring and predictable. It seems stuck in that sort of Tom Green mentality, stupid + offensive = funny. Cohen's shtick is basically that he's supposed to be from one of the former Soviet Republics, and he likes to see how far he can push ""regular"" people (most of whom seem to be actors) before they drop politically correct facades and get angry at him. I think the idea is that he is sort of making everyone else ridiculous, and it's true that there's almost no way to retain your ""cool"" if you were confronted on the street by someone of ""Borat's"" ilk. But any kind of political or personal revelations in the movie are highly suspect.<br/><br/>It's funny to watch him exhort a rodeo audience to ""destroy Iraq, kill all living things"" and so forth, but the guy is just so far over the top that it's impossible to believe that anyone really takes him seriously. He needs to play it a bit more straight in my opinion in order for it to be really funny. With the ""frat"" boys, for example, you could see it as Borat conning them all into revealing some of the casual ugliness of their lifestyles. That is, you could see it that way if you were really naive and you didn't think that Borat's act is so outrageous that the guys in the movie were just sort of playing along with the general craziness.<br/><br/>In my opinion it's not really worth seeing."

"DeeNine-2","7","4","9","16 April 2007"," Crude and gross but with some telling satire
","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)<br/><br/>Although superficially this mockumentary would seem to be a satire of the people of Kazakhstan or the citizens of any country thereabouts, it is really a satire of America the beautiful. Surprise! It makes some good points and there are some laughs. Mostly though I think the average viewer would be grossed out about half the time. But that's okay. For the average movie-goer or DVD watcher, getting grossed out is a lot better than being bored.<br/><br/>Of course you might be bored too. Personally I don't think I could watch the naked mock fight between Borat (Sacha Baron Cohen) and Azamat Bagatov (Ken Davitan) again. I wasn't so much grossed out as made to feel that really I ought to find better ways to waste my time.<br/><br/>Yes, we're bored in America. Our neurons are sated with violence, pornography, and crude, boorish behavior toward our fellows (both real and on TV and in the movies). Which is why, to be successful, people like Sacha Baron Cohen have to turn up the crude volume to get the old laugh-o-meter activated. A glimpse of stocking used to be looked on as something shocking, now, heaven knows, anything goes.<br/><br/>But should we care? Yes, your preteen sons are going to find out who in the neighborhood has this DVD and they're going to watch it. Will they be scarred for life? Will they ""get it""? Will it make them uncouth? Will they watch it more than half a dozen times? One of the interesting things about this movie is the publicity it got and the controversy it engendered. Kazakhstan initially was greatly offended and protested loudly at this misrepresentation of its people. But then they thought it over and realized that maybe this isn't necessarily such a bad thing. In Hollywood any publicity is good. They probably figured out that what is being made fun of is the average American's provincial attitude toward foreigners. Cohen goes a long way toward proving that with the scene at the rodeo, for example, where his line, ""We support your war of terror!"" gets a nice round of applause. And the guy who thinks that somebody with a moustache looks like a Muslim who looks like a terrorist adds a little to the impression that Americans, when they think about foreigners, think superficially.<br/><br/>Actually, they don't do any real thinking. Xenophobia reigns supreme in the heartland--but that would be the heartland of any country. The frequent anti-Semitic shtick throughout was originally aimed at Europeans, I understand, who despite the embarrassment of the Holocaust are apparently as anti-Semitic as ever. But Cohen, who is Jewish, makes fun of the antisemitism of Muslims as well as Westerners. And he makes fun of the uneducated and uncouth as well as the superficially sophisticated--witness the scene at the Magnolia Fine Dining Society.<br/><br/>Some people sued or threatened to sue. Some guys from the University of South Carolina who were caught off guard and drunk, mouthed some stupidities for all of the world to hear. They sued but lost the case, I understand.<br/><br/>Larry Charles of TV's Seinfeld fame directed. He achieved some tension with the simple plot of Borat coming to American and making a road trip across the land to California to meet and hopefully mate with Pamela Anderson. That was pretty funny. I understand that some of the scenes were staged and scripted, for example the book signing scene with Miss Anderson was at least partly staged. But other scenes were play-as-you-go with Cohen just making up stuff and saying provocative things to get reactions from the innocents. The scene in the bathroom with the woman from the Magnolia Fine Dining Society was pretty funny as she explains to Borat so seriously and so sincerely how to wipe himself.<br/><br/>Bottom line here is, should you bother to watch? My answer: maybe if you can stand the crudities, and maybe if you don't squirm at satire directed at Americans. On the other hand, this is not in my opinion in the same league as some other famous comedic movies. Certainly it is not nearly as good as Blazing Saddles (1974), which I was watching the other night. Finally, the techniques used by Cohen and Charles are interesting in their own right because of the reaction of people who were taken in, or somewhat taken in, and so that they ended up saying some outrageous and embarrassing things."

","I love the characters Ali G and Borat on Cohen's show. Both of them reveal painful truths about our cultures (Brit and American) by burying our hero in apparently ignorant characters that elicit authentic ignorance from real people. Cohen's character Bruno (who will have his own movie before long), a gay club-kid/fashionista, is much, much less interesting. When all you do as a straight comedian in lampooning a gay character is act like a shallow sissy, you're probably working something out for yourself (wink wink), but you're not entertaining me. All this character says to me is that Sasha Baron Cohen has some need to dress up and act like a sissy every now and then. (Let us know how that works out Sasha.) At any rate the Bruno character is infinitely staler than the other two. <br/><br/>The show was funny because it was smart. This movie is beneath me on both counts. By the time I rented it, the accolades had been piled so high, and the value of the concept so overstated, that it couldn't live up to the hype. I couldn't even finish this. The whole movie is set in motion when Borat decides he has to track down Pamela Anderson after seeing Baywatch. Oh stop... ha ha ha... my sides are splitting. The last time I heard something that funny, I fell out of my horseless carriage. Yeah it's actually that limp. Ensuing jokes are set up even limper.<br/><br/>""Borat"" heads into shallow one-joke ""SNL movie"" territory very early. Much like Little Miss Sunshine it takes potshots at people we all already agree have poor values. There it was just the kiddy pageant set. Here everyone is an idiot.<br/><br/>So let's examine the naked wrestling scene that audiences found so amusing: Here's how I understand the offense-scale of these viewers: Gay sex is gross; but something which is ninety-five percent of the way to gay sex, involving simulated sex positions (analingus) with a repulsive obese man with a hairy back, a flabby white paunch, floppy man-boobs and droopy buttocks is a new height in humor? So actual sex performed by attractive guys, is more distasteful than simulated sex between repulsive ones. You'll have to show me how I reset my taste & values, so I can get my head around that one.<br/><br/>At one point Cohen almost breaks character when a fat black hooker he has used to humiliate herself and others, says his name correctly as they say goodnight. He registers a look that's more thoughtful than Borat should, remarking ""You said my name right."" The moment and the way it's played is already borderline, and then the movie cheesily underscores the scene with schmaltzy 'message' music.<br/><br/>The critics who raved over this are just so many squares who came to the Sasha Baron Cohen party late, but want credit for being hip. This is not a smart movie. I wouldn't even call it outrageous. It's the same limp movie that TV-to-film comedians have been making for three decades.<br/><br/>This is desperate. Most of you fell for it."

","I liked the small clips of Borat I saw on Ali G, so I really was looking forward to seeing this film. However, after watching it, some of the gags worked, while others were plain terrible.<br/><br/>Let me preface the following by saying I'm not adverse to offensive humor...hey, I love South Park. However, while South Park uses its humor to convey a (almost always) great message, ""Borat"" is filled with scatological humor that gets tiring after 40 minutes with nowhere to go. No doubt, the ""wrestling scene"" was hilarious, but with its multiple allusions to sex and body excrement, I got tired of it after a while. I think if half the sex/BE jokes were left out, and Borat was more ""gullible"" than his horny self and an uninitiated stranger to the American ways in a more realistic way (e.g. not presenting feces at a dinner table), this would have been a classic. But as some folks that I saw it with said...""in the end, the Americans won, because it showed them to be on the whole much kinder than the mind behind Borat"". While it may be a satire on people, it did not do so convincingly, and in the end, I think I could have waited for it on DVD.<br/><br/>6/10."
"pcaquet","6","4","9","20 November 2006"," A swipe at political correctness more than a comedy
","Fans of Ali G and Bruno are likely to be disappointed.<br/><br/>Borat seems to aim to shock at least as much as to amuse. While the film contains enough occasions for hilarity, it also gets increasingly baffling as the delirious storyline achieves a pitch. A number of questions suggest themselves to the mystified viewer. Why does Borat greet people in Polish? Are the antisemitic fantasies really meant to be funny and, if so, who are they poking fun at exactly? Americans, Kazakhs, anti-semitism in general? In many of the scenes whose victims are unwitting, who is meant to be holding the camera? In fact, while some of Cohen's targets exhibit the customary tendency to put foot in mouth, even degenerating into pure crassness, others seem rather polite and patient with his antics.<br/><br/>Perhaps this is simple mystification, after all."

","Honestly, this film isn't that great. I've been a long time fan of the Borat sketches, going back to Da Ali G Show in Britain years ago. The material shown in the Borat movie is almost all a stale rehash of what he has done in past years. Although many people may not have seen previous Borat sketches (and therefore might be more inclined to laugh during the movie) that does not help this film where it fails the most: The majority of the screen time is spent on pointless scatological, sexual, and otherwise juvenile jokes. It's awkward, its painful, and yes, it is funny, but it hardly merits the raving reviews this film has been getting. Except for a few scenes --Frat boys and Rodeo-- there was very little of interest in this movie. I also had the distinct impression that much of it was made from unused footage from Baron Cohen's HBO series with the ""plot"" scenes tacked on to give some justification for Borat's antics. Really, don't waste your time or money on this one."

"just_hamish","6","4","9","5 November 2006"," Wildly overpraised
","It seems to have become somewhat of a trait for Sacha Baron Cohen's creations to fall in their quest for big screen stardom. Ali G's limp ""Indahouse"" followed the characters phenomenal TV success, ultimately failing as Cohen removed what is his greatest asset, the reactions of members of the public to his overblown stereotype. Having taken a bit of a lull from the limelight, Cohen returned with news of an upcoming big screen outing for his lesser known, but arguably even funnier creation ""Borat"" the Kazakhstani news reporter. The swarm of media attention certainly built up a huge audience for the movie (and secured it as a financial success), but ultimately only enhanced it's failings by revealing what turned out to be among the funniest sketches again, and again, and again.<br/><br/>Yet it all seemed so promising, far from a carbon copy of his previous venture with his other character. The trailers suggested a film crammed with hilarious candid camera gags as the hapless Kazakh fired his extreme views and racist jibes at members of the public, exposing the shocking cultural prejudice that exists in today's American society while simultaneously delivering gut crunching laughs. Finally Cohen playing to his strengths, surely the film is one big joyous extension of the razor sharp TV sketches? Unfortunately not, while efforts have been made to maintain the public reactions (which are at times as funny as ever) the attempted ""plot"" is still present in full force. Not only do these scripted sequences fail as a whole, they also undermine the great public sketches that form the meat of the comedy. By inserting them into the story, with Borat's overweight producer never far behind, how ""real"" the reactions are come into question. This is something that doesn't (and certainly shouldn't) occur to you in his TV work. Instead of monologue followed by sketch followed by monologue, we have a thoroughly unconvincing story that lessens the weight of the character.<br/><br/>As a larger than life stereotype in the public domain, he is ceaselessly amusing. In the film it is almost as if Cohen is trying to emulate himself sometimes, subtlety lost in favour of cheap, obvious laughs that aren't particularly clever. Plain and simple, Cohen has overdone the character, simplifying him and losing something along the way. Even in publicity interviews it seems he is trying too hard (Wow-wah-wee-wah, High Five) Our awareness of his clever ""acting"" is dulled, giving way to a scripted character that just isn't all that funny, at times even bordering on the offensive. Yes, most of us are aware that the comedy is without seriousness, yet you begin to wonder whether some people are laughing for all the wrong reasons. It is this that proves a little sad. Controversial as his methods are, Cohen is still trying to drive home a point about prejudice and cultural understanding. There are moments in this movie world where Cohen's signature becomes a little lost, some particularly cheap gags giving you the feeling that the racism is the joke and their necessity is called into question.<br/><br/>How successfully Cohen's ulterior motive translates to modern audiences is debatable. Has the success not really been built on the hilarity of ""that Kazakh guy who hates Jews and women""? However it is not all bad, certain scenes showcase Cohen at his very best, with clever, biting satire, a reminder of why we really love Borat. Even some of the scripted scenes come off rather well, slapstick maybe, but successful none the less (the naked fighting scene is so wonderfully outrageous and distasteful that it forms perhaps the best scene in the entire film, the one moment where the scripted Borat meets the public reaction spectacle entirely successfully). Cohen is a talented comic, though it is clear that his true domain is in television. An improvement on ""Indahouse"" most certainly, but in the end here lies a merely average comedy film in the place of a potentially outstanding one."
"aminkhan00","5","8","23","5 November 2006"," Shallow, cheap comedy masquerading as social satire...not without its laughs though
","Don't get me wrong, there were moments in this film where I laughed heartilyproper deep belly laughs  but there were plenty of others where I was just shaking my head with embarrassment, and indeed a few moments when I was just rolling my eyes out of boredom. There is little new here to offer people who are already well acquainted with Borat from his TV shows. The same lines , the same 'set-ups', the same inappropriate Polaroid's of his family are all reused. Some of the comic subtlety with which Sacha Baron Cohen has portrayed his Kazakh creation in the past is dispensed with here in an attempt to shock and outrageit's a bit of a cop-out.<br/><br/>Don't let this film fool you into thinking it is a work of potent satire, its not that clever, but unfortunately some feel safe enough with this excuse to chortle at the notion of a black man being referred to as a 'chocolate face'. Borat does successfully elicit offensive views from many of those being interviewed, but they don't seem to need much encouragement. One does have to admire Sacha Baron Cohen's 'chutzpah' when watching this film (I'm thinking especially of the rodeo sequence). He is undoubtedly a talented comic actor, some of the nuances of Borats character are so hilariously and convincingly observed as to fool his hapless interviewees into all sorts of bizarre behaviour, though, like I mentioned before, too often and too quickly in this film does he resort to a shocking crudeness for his laughs.<br/><br/>If you intend to watch this film and are not familiar with the TV show, nor this breed of humour you may well be shocked and/or you may well laugh uncontrollably, but trust me the more intelligent amongst you and those with a better developed sense of humour will find many parts of this film objectionable and cheap.<br/><br/>The central premise of Borat  i.e. exploiting people's hospitality to effectively mock them  makes me tad uneasy too, not to mention the rather offensive and undoubtedly baseless caricature of Kazakhstanis. If you've read the reviews of this film you'd be forgiven for thinking you are about to watch one of the funniest films ever madeand you will be disappointed."

Borat is Sacha Baron Cohen's more appealing alter-ego, and this film is much funnier and wittier than the crude, cringe worthy 'Ali G Indahouse'.<br/><br/>The Ali G film was a failure as it took Ali G outside of his familiar mock interviews, which were humorous, and gave him a 90 minute film in which he had to operate on a higher level amongst a league of people very different to his bewildered guests. It relied too much on childish toilet humour and basically hammered a nail into Ali G's coffin.<br/><br/>Anyway, enough about the past. I am glad to say that Borat is a lot more amusing and smart than the fore-mentioned. The film is done in a mockumentary style, in which the reporter travels to USA for 'cultural enrichment' as he believes it is the greatest country in the world. He is accompanied by Azabat, a short fat grouchy sidekick who only speaks in his native Khazak, and helps provide the audience with a grotesque naked fight scene with Borat in a hotel room. The strange relationship between these 2 never lets us down in terms of entertainment, as a kind of Laurel and Hardy connection seems to happen. I would say the humour arises in seeing the blatant culture difference between Borat and the mainly middle class, middle aged Americans he comes into contact with. However, it isn't only that social group he encounters, there are the young African-American ""gangstas"", the drunken Leary guys in a campavan and the hand waving pentecostal Christians-all encounters are amusing in their own way.<br/><br/>His startlingly backward attitude to taboo subjects like animal cruelty, incest, mistreatment of woman and even rape raise afew eyebrows along the way, as Borat goes about his business with his own un-westernised attitudes and beliefs never far from the surface.<br/><br/>The humour can be offencive, such as the constant anti-semantic references (this is probably only allowed as Cohen is Jewish himself) in the form of Khazakstani village games and Borat's sudden fear and distrust upon discovering his kindly Guest House hosts are both Jewish. Then there are his comical reactions to being told women are equal to men and should be respected. This is NOT a film for the easily offended, but if you can appreciate the humour which arises due to the vast culture difference which is at the heart of this comedy, then you should be in for a treat."
"Roger Hane","9","3","6","17 August 2007"," Americans aren't so bad. *Gasp!*
","I hadn't planned to write a review of this movie. But when I noticed all the very negative reviews from all the people who didn't seem to get the point, I had to chime in.<br/><br/>Cohen is parodying what the rest of the world believes to be America's bigotries and views of the rest of the world. He's letting the world know that America isn't the ugly, bigoted, bullying place they think it is. Cohen takes the stereotypes Americans are believed to have, throws them in American's faces and shows that Americans aren't really that way. He shows the great majority of Americans in the movie to be perfectly nice, decent people who don't buy in to the stereotypes he tries to stick on them.<br/><br/>Do Americans think third world eastern European countries are so outrageously backwards and Soviet? The outlandishness of his portrayal shows we don't. If for no other reason, we've seen too many travelogues to believe any of it. Do Americans fear and hate the Jews? He tosses it out as a given and never gives an iota of evidence. Look at Borat's fear of the old Jewish couple running the bed and breakfast. A wonderful juxtaposition of fear and reality. Who wouldn't love to stay with that couple? Are women inferior? Look at Borat's encounter with the feminists. Are Americans jingoistic world dominators? Look at the crowd at the rodeo, how they slowly cooled to his jingoism and turned against him.<br/><br/>Most of the movie's humor is gained from the fact the the people he dealt with were too dim to realize Borat was a faker. Can we laugh at ourselves for being that way? There's your test. I'll bet there were plenty of scenes where people did catch on, but those scenes didn't make it into the movie. That would have ruined everything.<br/><br/>If you were offended that he poked fun at nice, innocent people, then OK. If you were disgusted by the movie's toilet and sexual humor, well, I'll grant you that criticism. But get beyond that and realize the message he's sending to the rest of the world about America. You might appreciate Cohen a lot more after that."

","This movie is very controversial in that the overall rating is fairly high but most of the comments here are very negative. For this single reason you shall watch it (and rate it yourself). Be warned that the movie is packed with political/reality jokes. You may find some scenes are very gross (like the one of hotel fighting), and some overdone (like the one in supermarket). My wife literally left at the hotel fighting scene.<br/><br/>If you watched the DVD version and you think you can take more, you can find 8 more censored footages in ""other materials"" of the DVD. The displayed version is of the right length. It's a bit too much with all the footages."
"jeroen-106","4","3","6","14 April 2007"," Staged scenes and reality
","For me, the Borat ""shorts"" were usually very funny. The way he approaches people that do not realise he's not from Kazachstan, is very nice.<br/><br/>However this film about Borat really fails to be funny. Most of the time his character relies on sex, while the shorts often contain very politic elements (e.g animal protection group, government election, etc).<br/><br/>My problem is that the makers of this movie staged several scenes, and want you to believe it is real. I have no problems with staged scenes that carry the story: it's clearly fiction! But the ""drivers lesson"" scene and the ""student in a van"" scene to name a few, made me think: ""hey, do the makers really want to cheat me? Do they think the public is dumb?"".<br/><br/>How big the nonsense is; as a maker you should not underestimate the public, don't cheat them! Some great scenes include the rodeo anthem, the Pamela scene and the nude-in-a-hotel scene (a scene where 'sex' is also functional; it's terribly embarrassing to see how people respond)."

","Let me start off by saying I didn't have a problem with the racial jokes, nor did I have a problem with the jokes against USA or any other nationalities this movie joked about. To me this movie was boring... I laughed at a few scenes here and there but none of the scenes were as funny as many people claim. Sasha did a very good job in convincing me that he is the character and that is how the character is. But the movie itself wasn't very funny.<br/><br/>Most of the complaints I hear about is how outrageous and gross the movie is... or that it is offensive to so many nationalities and races. I had no problems with the satire in the film, that is to say I wasn't offended or disgusted, I just did not find them funny, and I watched this with a few other people, and they all agreed that it was over-rated.<br/><br/>I gave it a four because there were some funny scenes, and the character was genuine. The reactions from the people in the film (none of whom were actors which is why some of the scenes were humorous) is what made me watch the whole movie... other than that I would not recommend this movie."

"Sweet_Ophelia","4","3","6","31 December 2006"," Hype = Hollow
","So much has been said about Sacha Baron Cohen's controversial and successful comedy ""Borat: Cultural learning's of America for make benefit glorious nation of Kazakhstan"": there have been lawsuits; Cohen has been involved in physical altercations with people who didn't like the film and 'Borat' had the biggest box-office opening weekend for any film that opened in fewer than a thousand theaters. But I personally didn't like it.<br/><br/>I was a big fun of Cohen's 'Da Ali G Show', and expected to love the film as much as every review I read seemed to. Sadly, I think the hype didn't help my viewing.<br/><br/>People are now calling Cohen a comic genius for playing on the ignorance of the American people (I'll admit, I thought Kazakhstan was a fictional place before this film came out) and putting them in outrageously uncomfortable situations and using their ignorance to trap them and reveal true bigotry and xenophobia. Cohen has been nominated for a Golden Globe award in the category of 'Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy'. Alright, but I suspect that nomination comes more from the popularity of the film than the weight of Cohen's performance. Really, 'Borat' and Cohen's 'mocumentary' style cannot be hailed as comic genius; not when the film involves a lengthy naked man wrestle between Borat and his overweight and hairy manager, Azamat (Azamat Bagatov). Really, 'Borat' may be amusing, eye-opening, and will definitely elicit a laugh or two, but what Cohen does is no more comic genius than what the Jackass boys do, eating yellow snow and such. It's all for cheap laughs... and when you've heard about all the outrageousness and read descriptions of certain scenes that have now landed Cohen a few lawsuits, watching ""Borat: Cultural learning's of America for make benefit glorious nation of Kazakhstan"" becomes a pretty hollow experience. I feel like I laughed more just hearing and reading about the film than when I actually sat down and watched it."

"JosephLee411","Null","3","6","15 November 2006"," Offensive, Crude and Wrong...I Loved It!
","The Joe Cool Experience: Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan(2006) <br/><br/>Starring: Sacha Baron Cohen as Borat Sagdiyev and Ken Davitian as Azamat Bagatov <br/><br/>Plot: A reporter from Kazakhstan journeys to American to make a documentary. He quickly tours the United States, falls in love with Pamela Anderson, and offends many people in the process.<br/><br/>Openers: First of all, I have not see Da Ali G Show, or any of Baron Cohen's previous characters. I only know him from his role in Talledega Nights. So I went into this pretty uninitiated, having only the trailers(which made me laugh) to go on. Oh and the hype from everyone. Did it live up to the hype? Was Borat indeed one of the funniest movies ever made? The Good: The answer is a resounding YES. This movie is so offensive to so many people, and that's what makes it hilarious. Sometimes you just have to take a step back and not take things so seriously. Not only is the character of Borat funny, but what's especially funny(and shocking) is how the people he talks to actually act. The rednecks at the rodeo, the bigots at the dinner party, even the frat boys all have flaws that are exposed. Maybe that's why they all hate the makers now. They feel they were made to look stupid, and they were, but it wasn't anyone's fault but their own. And I laughed at their stupidity. In addition to the smarter humor of exposing people's ignorance, there is plenty of stupid humor and gross-out jokes for those who like that. And the offensive jokes keep coming. I like the fact that no one is safe. The south, Jews, mentally handicapped, women, Christians, etc, etc. Everyone gets made fun of as Borat is an equal-opportunity offender. The movie is also very quotable, and will stay with you when it's over. Sacha Baron Cohen gives an excellent performance as Borat, who is sure to join the upper echelon of comedic characters.<br/><br/>The Bad: The offensiveness can also be a bad thing if you don't like that sort of humor. It may feel a little out of line, but really, once you accept the fact that it's just a movie and not meant to be taken seriously, you may find yourself laughing. You may feel terrible for laughing, but you will laugh.<br/><br/>The Ugly: Borat and Azamat wrestle around, chase each other and beat each other up in the nude. With a rubber fist. About as gross as it sounds. Plus there's quite a few penis and scrotum shots and that's just never nice to look at.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: With lots of good, and not that much bad...Borat takes it's place as one of the funniest films I've ever seen. All the critics can say whatever they want, but I say that I highly recommend this film, but with a warning: Go in with an open mind, and prepare to be assaulted.<br/><br/>Rating: ****1/2 of *****"
"CanadianHobbit","7","3","6","11 November 2006"," Sure I laughed, but...
","When I went to see Borat recently, it was amongst a full theatre of people around my age group (18-20's) so I suppose the setting was perfect. And I laughed throughout the movie at the completely offensive material, thought /what the ****/ at all the right parts... and yet, when I left the theatre, I just didn't feel like I really enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, this movie is perfect for people who like nasty comedy (40 year old virgin meets Jackass?), and it put a smile on my face (and even managed to touch my heart in one or two spots!), but if I had to choose between a lobotomy and watching Borat again? I'd saw my own skull open."
"bopdog","6","9","27","3 November 2006"," Hold on there Jethro--- this is OK, but great... NOT
","'Borat' has some laughs. But how hard is it to ridicule a bunch of lower class Bible-belt hicks and rednecks, though? That doesn't take much imagination, and seeing their earnest adaptation to ignorance and poverty, over and over and over, wears a bit thin. A lot of the humor here was a 'cheap shot'. I don't object, I just point out that while this is a mildly amusing movie, and a bold concept, it is not a great movie. It is certainly not 'the funniest movie in years', as some are claiming. Maybe it was the funniest movie this month.<br/><br/>It also has a lot of cringes too--- such as the naked fat man whose belly fat hangs down so low that his genitals are obscured from sight--- most of the time. He and Borat wrestle around stark naked, and mouths and anuses touch. Ewwww. But whatever.<br/><br/>I kind of admire Cohen's boldness in making this movie, and I don't object to any of it. That's not to say I was thoroughly entertained at all times, either. I could have done without much of it--- especially the 'real life' candid-camera kind of confrontational humor. I HATE that kind of thing, personally. Preying on other people's basic good naturedness is a bit cruel, as is 'stealing' glimpses of their rather dreary and crappy lives, and holding them up for ridicule. We all have stuff we wouldn't want some smart-ass filmmaker to tape and put on the screen without our knowledge, or at least without our fully understanding what the joke is supposed to be. This was definitely a case of laughing at people, not with them. As the late, great Eudora Welty remarked, proper comedy satire is a tool for the weak to 'get back at' the powerful. This was the other way around. The 'powerful', the movie crew, exploited the weak, the dullards who got trapped in Cohen's 'jokes'. That's not proper, it's not nice, and it's not really all that funny. It's mean spirited and ugly at times.<br/><br/>I would ordinarily not be so negative about a comedian I kind of like, because he does bend the noses of the Right-Wing Christians, powerful warlords, and even so-called Liberals, and the like. Except that so many people are hem-kissing and drooling and genuflecting in front of this movie, and it simply isn't THAT funny, nor is it THAT good."
"davegrenfell","8","6","16","21 September 2006"," Ees nice
","This is one of the few films that has made me laugh a lot. The screening started an hour later than planned, in a very hot cinema, so everyone was probably a little dizzy with dehydration, which probably helped the feeling of giddiness. Unfortunately my sight lines were blocked by the low rake of seats, which made it almost impossible to read the occasional hilarious subtitles.<br/><br/>OK. The movie purports to be from Kstan (cowardice spelling of tricky word) so has soviet era graphics and credits, but then very good quality 35mm sequences which spoils it a little bit. Might have been a little braver and convincing to have the whole thing in low quality Kazakh video.<br/><br/>The balls in the face. The balls in his f***** face. Oh God, oh sweet dear God. He's wrestling naked with his fellow star, a very fat man, whose genitals are obscured by his rolls of hairy flabby flesh, and he ends up with the man sat on his face, his nose up his arse, and the man's balls ON HIS FACE. At the same time there seems to be a little bit of tentativity, as Mr Cohen's penis is blacked out with an enormous penis shaped black blob. The pair then run naked through the hotel they're staying in, get crammed in a lift with strangers, and invade a conference, at which point they are wrestled to the ground by security.<br/><br/>I don't know if it was faked or not. There's no way to tell. They weren't shot, so maybe it wasn't real. Certainly at the end, where he shoves Pamela Anderson into his marriage sack at a Virgin megastore signing, she must have known about it before.<br/><br/>A few of the scenes are taken from his British series and reshot in America, but with an extra twist. He invites a black prostitute to an etiquette dinner of white southern secessionists. They call the cops. He smashes $425 of crockery in a civil war antiques shop. He buys a bar and rides around with it in an old ice cream van. He kisses strangers in the street, and chases them when they run away.<br/><br/>It's certainly a lot better than his performance in Talladega Nights. Maybe Ferrell didn't want to be upstaged, or didn't want to rub his balls in Sacha's face. Oh God. OH GOD."

","Sure, the movie is highly amusing. Many people have not even heard of the country Kazakhstan and decide it's okay to laugh at the horrid exaggerations and false portrayals of the Kazakh culture. It truly is a downright shame to disrespect another culture in such a way. I myself have been to Kazakhstan and the movie sends an extremely false image of Kazakhstan through the media. There's news that Kazakh officials have invited ""Borat"" over to Kazakh to see the nation for himself.<br/><br/>""I understand that the feelings of many people are hurt by Cohen's show,"" he said. ""But we must have a sense of humor and respect the creative freedom of others."" (quoted from a news article)<br/><br/>A sense of humor is fine and so is respect for creativity. But the blatant false portrayal of a nation is disgusting. It's okay to enjoy a movie and a parody of certain aspects of a culture. The fact of the matter is, many people are going to watch the movie and not think twice about the ""things they learned"" and accept the movie for what it is. How many people can actually say they've been to Kazakhstan and they know that the culture is not what it is shown to be in the movie?"

"bauulben","10","8","24","11 November 2006"," Glorious in many different ways
","With a film such as this, almost every definition of what the movie is about has been posted by someone or other. Some see it as sharp political satire, others stupid toilet humour, a few not even any humour before. Truth is, what you laugh at in this film, why you find it funny, will vary from person to person. The reason is that Cohen and Co have fitted a large variety of humour types into the 90 odd minutes of film. There is satire, and there's toilet humour, and also slapstick, spoof, cringe humour, everything really.<br/><br/>The one thing you can say universally about it is that it's outrageous. This outrageousness present in almost all the scenes elevates what ever humour is present at the time to new heights. The satire is bold and without a hint of caution, the toilet humour is as clear and graphic as you can imagine, the slapstick genuinely hilarious and shocking at the same time, the cringe humour takes us to places never seen on a big screen before, everything goes that one step further. To describe it in terms of any one form of comedy is missing much of the point of the film, it's funny for a large number of reasons. This certainly goes some way to explaining the near universal acceptance of the film, as everyone sees a slightly different reason to laugh till your cheeks hurt.<br/><br/>Personally, the part of the film that got me the most was the sheer balls of Cohen. He does things I would never imagine someone having the nerve to do, especially someone who does have something to lose. I won't go into what exactly, but the film makers show such dedication to the cause, even at the expense of their physical wellbeing, to get that one shot, you find yourself applauding simply for the lengths they went to.<br/><br/>On a more serious note, many people are finding this film deeply offensive. But, really, that's the point. It is offensive, but it's so silly, so ridiculous, so over the top that you can't take it seriously. You KNOW Cohen isn't really anti-Jewish, you KNOW he doesn't really hate women or think 'retards' should be locked up, you KNOW (or you should know) he's only joking, so getting wound up at the horror of it all is completely useless, as most of the none PC stuff is made up. True it's placed in the real world, and there are some real world opinions that will make your toes crawl, but most of the offensive content is from Borat himself, and you can forgive him anything, as he's made up. For those finding the film too offensive to watch, I can understand why, but for the vast majority of people, the bad taste certainly won't stick in your mouth."
"DickNay","10","9","28","4 November 2006"," Still in Shock
","""Borat"" is the funniest movie I have seen in a long time - probably since ""Blazing Saddles."" This is acting to the ultimate extreme, as Sacha Baron Cohen plays Borat, a Kazakhstani reporter sent from his government to learn about the culture of the ""U, S, and A."" And what's truly shocking about this film is not the content (although some of it is ridiculous), but the fact that Cohen did not break character once; in a story in Entertainment Weekly it says the crew was pulled over by the cops more than once, and even then did Cohen stay in character. Although I don't think Cohen should get an Oscar nomination for Best Actor, he should get his own category. Because this film - the message, the execution, hell, the whole idea of the thing - is completely original. No one will say this is the best movie they've ever seen - and it's probably not. But what everyone can say is that it's the most impressive feat in the film industry any of us have seen in a long time."

","Those who have called ""Borat"" a ""Jackass"" with a higher IQ pretty much have hit the nail on the head. This is low-brow humor for the high-brow set with enough offensive posturing and crudeness to appeal to a broad audience. Those claiming it's one of the funniest movies ever made and a brilliant satire are grotesquely overstating the appeal of Sascha Baron Cohen's creation. On many levels, as a mockumentary, it succeeds in making people laugh out loud (especially in the opening moments in his hometown), but to call this satire is an insult to pure satires like ""Dr. Strangelove"" and ""Network."" <br/><br/>The extended nude wrestling/chase scene in the hotel that people have hailed as a film classic was far from it in my mind. The funniest bits I found were instead the not so obvious subtexts (like the fact he spoke Hebrew in many of the Jew bashing scenes) and throw away moments like when he threw down his bag in despair and the chicken was still inside. Still, a subversively clever movie that seemingly exists to only push the envelope certainly has its place in this increasingly sensitive, politically correct, and censored society, which is why I feel this has become a cultural phenomenon. For Cohen and his alter ego, success, yes, it nice. Very nice. We like."

Some parts are hilarious though...off the wall. Too bad they are few and far between for a long time fan. Obviously if you are offended by misogyny, racism, bigotry, homosexuality...um...any other big words then do not go see this movie. Borat pokes fun at Christians, Jews, Muslims, blacks, whites, gays, feminists, animal rights activists...Luckily I love laughing at our differences so these parts were funny to me.

"fertilecelluloid","8","5","13","21 October 2006"," Anarchic and delightfully offensive
","Larry Charles, who has directed many episodes of the brilliant ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"", was an ideal choice to direct this anarchic, delightfully offensive masterpiece; its simple premise permits the skewering of every holy cow you can shake a cattle prod at. Sacha Baron Cohen is hilarious as Borat, a ""journalist"" from Khazakhstan, who travels to America with his obese uncle (Ken Davatian) to spread his country's goodwill and soak up the ""best"" America has to offer. Many will be offended by Cohen's adventures, but so what? The best comedy needs to offend; that's why we laugh. This is not some angry, mean-spirited, depressing testament to the failures of the human race. On the contrary, it is an uplifting, raw, terribly funny celebration of how humor crosses all boundaries. To give you an idea of the film's tone, let me describe one conversation: When Borat makes it clear that he intends to have any woman he wants in America, his host explains that, in America, women ""choose"" whom they have sex with. Borat reacts with a shocked: ""WHAT???"" Quite similar in style to ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"", each scene has a looseness to it that allows the humor to germinate. Director Charles also knows when a joke's done and quickly moves on to the next one. The film never outstays its welcome and engages totally with its audience. I predict wide success for this movie."

","I finally saw this film today, after much anticipation and found it to be gut busting funny and frighteningly insightful at the same time. The jokes were raw and the kind that make you laugh out loud hard, however by the same token, this film showed some of the worst sides of human behavior. There is an old saw about what you do when you do not think people are looking is a true indication of your character. In this case, people showed their worst biases and prejudices and knew they were being filmed. I do not want to spoil this for those of you who have not seen the film yet, however Baron Cohen cuts deep into the underbelly of hubris, prejudice and mean spirited thinking that shows how in-human we have become. Thankfully, he leavens these painful scenes with very funny humor and placing people in very bizarre situations that force their true colors to show in a very humorous way. Baron Cohen and his team deserve all the positive recognition they have and will receive from this film, I am hopeful that those who see this movie learn some humanity from the lessons shown in this film.<br/><br/>Additional comment: I have been reviewing the comments made by many IMDb members and am not surprised by the polarized views on this film; however, I am surprised at the self-righteous indignation of many reviews. It can be most difficult to look in the mirror and truly deal with what you see looking back at you."

","I went in to see Borat with high expectations and everything I read about it sounded hilarious. Wow, what a disappointment! Yes, there were parts that were funny -- some very funny -- but sitting through this movie was like watching a stretched out Saturday Night Live skit that should have been only 4 minutes long.<br/><br/>My problem with the film was NOT that the material was often offensive. To me, the more un-PC the better -- but this was just a one-joke film.<br/><br/>The theater I saw it in was packed and everyone was laughing, but I couldn't help but think I was witnessing the Robin Williams Syndrome where everyone laughs because they feel like they have to. Well Robin Williams is a tedious bore on talk shows, no matter how much Jay Leno guffaws like a stuck pig, and Borat just isn't funny, either, no matter the number of magazine covers or critics saying he is a comedic genius."
"moegolden","10","8","25","3 November 2006"," Funny on every single level
","I just caught the matinée....perhaps the funniest movie i've ever seen. Definitely the funniest in years....what's best about it is that it is funny on every level (utilizing physicality, satire, race, topical humor, sexuality, malapropisms).<br/><br/>If anyone out there is under the impression that the guy is just doing a Yakov Smirnoff impression, trust me....it's a lot closer to Andy Kaufman meets Dave Letterman in their primes. When you see Sacha Baron Cohen at work, you'll see why people consider a Tom Green cheap imitation (even if he was in the mainstream first).<br/><br/>Another beauty of Borat is that people with overdeveloped and underdeveloped senses of humor will find this equally funny. I was actually sitting near some people who were laughing hardest at the simplest of jokes, as well as the more subtle social commentary implied through the documentary style.<br/><br/>Its only weakness may be the thinness of the ending of its plot , but Hitchock referred to that phenomenon as the Maguffin - meaning that if something can be successfully used to propel a plot most effectively, it should be used even if it ends up being discardable.<br/><br/>Of course Borat gets uncomfortable at many moments, but that's a huge part of the fun. It may definitely not be a great idea to bring little kids, but it may be the finest example of comedy in years."
"brandynbaldwin","10","8","25","3 November 2006"," Funniest Movie Ever
","Borat has officially pushed movies like Airplane and Office Space out of the way for the title as funniest movie ever, in my mind. Cohen plays the confused foreigner trying to find the real American life, while hunting for the girl of his dreams. Borat takes racism to a new level of funny that so many other movies have failed at.<br/><br/>I'm 18, and I was seated between an elderly couple, and a veteran who had lost the use of both of his legs in Vietnam. The four of us, along with the other several hundred attending the premier were in tears we were laughing so hard.<br/><br/>And it's not just the racism or the gross-out humor that makes this movie. It's the confusing little quips that Borat drops along the way, showing his misunderstanding of the English language.<br/><br/>I'm still trying not to laugh as I type this, so sorry if my review sucks, but the movie was really beyond funny."

"la_rra_la","1","4","10","17 February 2008"," Weak even on the noteworthy points
","This movie is a disaster, because:<br/><br/>1. some parts of it should be dismissed for lacking any real object of parody 2. some parts should be dismissed and disqualified for the deceptive, manipulative and exploitive methods used in their filming 3. the few remaining noteworthy points fall flat because of unimaginative representation, weak humour...or simply because they get lost in all the folly. 4. and last, but not least, because it steals songs from movies I love and utterly profanes them by using them in trivial scenes and in ways, which make no sense whatsoever.<br/><br/>On the first point, many reviews here and elsewhere have pointed out the the factual folly of the movie. That people, culture and conditions in Kazakhstan have little resemblance to those of Romania has already been made clear for those, who lack the cultural background to figure it out by themselves. (Although in some reviews, one still can read comments like ""The booming Russian ethnic score melts into Harry Nilsson's ""Everybody's Talking' At Me""...well, at the least it is not a Russian score booming, eh). What has often been overlooked, though, is the essence of this factual folly - the movie has no object of parody. What it aims at? Does it aim at the gypsies? Does it aim at the uneducated or minority groups in society? Does it aim at the generalised ""Eastern Europe""? Or probably South-eastern? Or why not the whole ""East Camp""? These possible ""objects"" of parody are so complex, that one should make his point carefully and clearly. Otherwise, all I hear is a loud, ignorant, unimaginative Blah-Blah. <br/><br/>If the film-makers wanted to parody some traits or qualities, they should have made up a fictitious place, or should have found a way to parody those qualities without attributing them to any community. <br/><br/>Of course, we could be more permissive and lenient, say, by imagining that the author actually meant his object of parody to be incongruous. In other words, to assume that the author deliberately made the image of Borat and his culture the way he assumed (""ignorant and narrow-minded"")Americans would perceive it. That might have, even if clumsily, worked  satirize America not only be depicting the cultural shock and all the prejudice, but by actually making the supposed object of this prejudice consistent with it from the very beginning. Unfortunately, this assumption does not seem to be true. This simply cannot work with the narrative in first person, singular. <br/><br/>The second point is also well known. Yet, many people seem to not pay Enough Attention. It's not funny or acceptable to film and use people without their permission. It is even less funny and acceptable to manipulate and provoke them into saying something stupid and take advantage of it. It is absolutely not funny and is kind of illegal to deceive people about the purpose of the filming and the ways they would be used. And is downright immoral and disgusting to do so to poor, uneducated people who just try to make ends meet. Why, have the authors imagined that those people are too far to see the movie, too stupid to grasp what's going on or too poor to sue? Oh, I hope the things would get right in court. <br/><br/>As for the third point, well, if after all, we still want to consider the rest of the film what do we get? We get the problem of anti-Semitism and the problem of Americans' prejudiced and narrow-minded view of the world. Both very important problems And Yet. The Jewish moments in the movie lacked power  the anti-Semitic images were ""classic"" and widely exploited (the Satanic images with the horns, the Jews as torturers of Jesus and his followers, the cockroaches as allusion to Jews' representation in the 30s) yet they failed to convey any insights about anti-Semitism; the anti-Semitic parody itself was weak and bleak...The author's Jewish background makes this all the more incomprehensible, as one might have expected a more perceptive and insightful treatment of the subject from a member of the Jewish community. Most of Americans' prejudice parody should be dismissed, because of the manipulative means by which it was filmed. Yes, it is important to expose hypocrisy, prejudice and bigotry in society. It is even more important to expose those quality in the most powerful nation in the world, and all the more a nation which assumes a pose of moral rectitude and moral universalism. But. There are more intelligent and acceptable ways to do so. We are looking for something more convincing and insightful than the candid camera effect.<br/><br/>On the fourth point there is not much to be said. Anybody who have watched Kusturica's movies should know what I mean. Anybody who has not, in my opinion, would benefit a lot of doing so. <br/><br/>On the whole, this movie is an insult to the public and the only real parody is produced by the viewers who cannot realize what they are duped into. The object of this parody is the ignorance, and worse the illusion some people have about ""understanding"" things; the assumption that they are, therefore, entitled to opinion about what those things are and what should be done about them. Unfortunately, this parody is lost on those very viewers."

Jews, Christians, Kazakhs, Muslims and HUMANS of all kind should stay away from this sort of movie simply because watching it will give,through box office receipts, encouragement to upcoming disgustingly degraded humor based movie makers to make a movie like this.

The film is full of cliché characters and situations; i.e greedy Jews, horny Homosexuals, ""Domb"" Blonds, Homely Women... The film possesses a strong stance in reducing todays population in order to rid the world of such waste. Borat is a reminder of pre Nazi Berlin; an apathetic world lost in pettiness and indulgence, lost in boredom . If we look beyond the mist of terrorism and perhaps understand why someone is trying to stop us or...perhaps is asking for help. What is happening to us if we can not see the truth of what our wants are doing to others? The American dream can not be the way for it was not the way before.<br/><br/>Borat is a caricature of translation lost. The problem is that the audience gets it and goes to bed smiling...not seeing the ugly truth hidden underneath the films true message: That if we do not get rid of our prejudices we are going to self destruct. Democracy wasted. The problem with American Democracy is that it is Capitalistic. It feeds the ego with vanity, lust, waste, envy, greed, pride, and avarice. <br/><br/>Once evolution gets rid of the ego only then will we prosper and love one another for existing in this beautiful paradise.

"SnorriGodhi","7","5","14","12 October 2006"," Travels into the Heart of America
","This movie includes both straight comedy and a kind of candid camera (the kind where the camera is visible, but the victim is unsuspecting). The comedy is merged with the candid-camera segments so well, that if you do not pay close attention you might forget that some of the people are not acting. <br/><br/>Before going on, a few words about my background: most of my interactions with American people have been academic - meaning, I mostly interacted with American students and academics. As a consequence, I have come to see America as the land of political correctness and moral relativism. No doubt, mine is a biased point of view, but it's the point of view from which I saw this movie, and it must be mentioned.<br/><br/>So this why this movie is interesting to me: there is this Borat character who pretends to be from a country that few of us know much about; he talks to a number of Americans from different backgrounds, in different contexts, and everything he says and does is very un-PC, if not plain offensive. How are Americans going to react? are they going to be PC and tolerate Borat because of his background? or are they going to reject him because he is not PC? or are they going to reveal their own un-PC prejudices when it is safe to do so?<br/><br/>The answer is a bit of all three, of course; but, on the whole, the people meeting Borat make the best of a difficult situation. Usually they explain, politely but firmly, that certain things are not done in the USA. This is what the self-defined ""veteran feminists"" do, for instance. Of course, it helps that they are ""veterans"": modern Taliban-supporting American feminists would not dare to contradict a non-westerner, even if he says that women have small brains.<br/><br/>In a way, it is disappointing that Americans behave in such a civilized way: Borat himself is always funny, but his victims are a bit too predictable. However, sometimes we see reactions ranging from the funny to the outrageous. For example, the scene in the gun shop is a hilarious double-act, with Borat as the comic and the shopkeeper a brilliant straight-man. Better than any single scene in ""Bowling for Columbine"".<br/><br/>On the other hand, I found most offensive the attitudes of the college students who gave a ride to Borat. That's a relief: there are no more outrageous people in America than I met on campus! (update 2006.11.11: apparently the students sued the film studio.)<br/><br/>There is much more in this movie, but I'll just give a warning: pay attention to how New Yorkers are much more wary of physical contact than people in other parts of the country.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Borat put the American people to a harsh test, and they came out reasonably well, but not too boring. How would Europeans come out? I am not sure that I want to know. I take one star off the rating because the movie could have been even better with more candid-camera and less straight comedy."

","I came into BORAT fairly unfamiliar with the work of Sacha Baron Cohen. I had downloaded a few ""Ali G"" clips but had never experienced Cohen's other characters. I was delighted to make Borat's acquaintance. <br/><br/>The host of a wildly popular show on Kazakhstan TV, Borat acts as a cultural ambassador when he and his producer, Azamat (Ken Davitian) land on American soil, determined to document this strange country for his government's glorious cultural ministry. All goes well as Borat takes a course in understanding American humor and interviews a group of feminists but when he discovers the beauty that America has to offer in the form of C.J. Parker / Pamela Anderson; he begins an errant quest to make her his wife. High five!<br/><br/>The humor of BORAT is one not of cultural snobbishness where we mock a ""fish out of Kazakhstan water"" protagonist but where the fish is making fun of the waters he's in. Poking fun at rednecks, fratboys, fundamentalists, and gun nuts (among others), no one is safe from his cockeyed observations and probing questions. Some patrons of the earlier BORAT screenings admitted to feeling guilty for laughing at parts of BORAT. I imagine that the rampant political incorrectness of Borat's ""culture"" has and will make some viewers squeamish (with some to the point of being incensed) but I always admire comedy that plays against conventions in a smart, funny way. BORAT does this.<br/><br/>Laughing to the point of hyperventilating, I haven't had so much fun at a film since SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, LONGER, UNCUT."

Of course she laughed a few times, but she was more shocked that this movie was released to the public.Further more, offensive to other country's.

","I've just witnessed one of the most crude, unapologetically discriminatory films of all time....... and loved it! <br/><br/>Borat is pure comedic genius. The fictional character (Borat) is a creation of British actor Sacha Baron Cohen who hails from ""Da Ali G Show."" Borat is a Kazakhstani television personality on a mission to the United States, the ""greatest country in the world"" to film a documentary so that his country may learn about the culture of the USA. Borat himself is a paradox; he greats us with a Polish ""Jak sie masz"" but his physical appearance is of Middle Eastern descent. It should not be difficult to understand that Borat does not represent anything remotely Kazakhstani, but rather, a clever manifestation of western ignorance of other cultures. How many audience goers actually knew he was speaking polish? All his hilarious quips and accounts of his 'beloved country' should be taken with a grain of salt - I highly doubt they have cars pulled by donkeys in Kazakhstan. Those who enjoy this film will see the political incorrectness of his opinions and crude behavior as the highest form of social satire in a time where political correctness goes hand in hand with western cultural dominance and civility.<br/><br/>While America is far too easy a target in the film, it is also the most appropriate target. Here is a nation that touts itself as the beacon of truth and freedom, in a time where the war on terror is also a cultural war. A place where Christian ideologues criticize Muslim extremists, yet turn their gaze from evangelists and the 'revival movement' and their antics; talks shows discuss the prejudices against women in the Middle East and try to fathom how anyone could live in such a place, believing their society to be more equitable to members of the opposite sex; a place whose citizens consider themselves friendly and tolerant towards others, but ignite into a rage if you greet them on a subway train, let alone speak to them. What Sacha Baron Cohen has effectively done is turn the magnifying glass back onto ourselves: the movie no longer concerns itself with the crazy antics of Borat, but the cultural reactions and sometimes unsolicited opinions of some of the unfortunate people who found themselves in this movie. In this way, the movie really does become a documentary, showcasing Western culture at its worst.<br/><br/>Critics of this movie will point to the multiple instances of discrimination, the anti-semitism, and other outlandish behavior of Cohen as hateful and morally degenerate; however, these moments are so completely ridiculous in their execution that you would have to lack any sense of humour, or even INTELLIGENCE to take anything seriously that Borat does. Cohen himself is part Jewish, so the anti-semitic claims have no basis here. It's not anti-Kazakhstani (for reasons discussed earlier). If anything, it might be anti-western but Cohen is British and apparently, lives in the U.S. This film merely pokes fun at some of the socio-cultural ideas and behaviors of western society.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film!

","I don't recall the last time that I laughed so hard in a theater as I did in Borat. The sheer outrageousness of the movie, combined with the immature-but-still-funny humor than Sacha Baron Cohen is so good at made me nearly wet myself in the theater watching this movie. I'm still amazed at how the movie took in over 26 million dollars this weekend in about 800 theaters nationwide. That's pretty ""beastin'"" if you ask me. Some of the stuff that they did in that movie was simply unbelievable and I can only imagine being one of the people in that movie, watching yourself be humiliated on the big screen. It was the best $9.25 I ever spent and if the movie weren't sold out on every showing, I would go see it again today in a heartbeat. Please, excuse me while I go change into clean underwear."

","O, it was awful. To say the truth Borat is just a bad movie. Really pathetic and disgusting. Is it funny to see two naked men fighting with each other? Of course Cohen told that this movie is partly documentary but I believe that he lies. It's just a show like wrestling. Do you believe that old man really told this things about homosexuals and Muslims? Do you think that reaction of the audience on rodeo was real? It's obvious that it was a show. Cohen played disgusting character, told lies about Kazakhstan and USA and after all got his money. And some people really believe in this things. Guys don't be so naïve. But after all worst thing in this movie is humor. I thought that it couldn't be anything as disgusting as ""My boss' daughter"". It was a mistake.

I would like you to look at this movie from a distant perspective of a person not living in the USA. Can you see what Borat is depicting in this movie? He's joking about the Jews, he's talking about hitting gypsies with a Hammer. And what kind of response he is getting? They applaud him and they agree with him, I couldn't spot any person in this movie that was truly arguing with him, they understood that his opinions were extreme and they took them with ease. What does it really show? How egocentric and uneducated the people are. How prejudices are still present and how easy it is to agree with somebody when extreme topics have been raised by someone else. I loved the movie, I had plenty of laughs. Next time you watch it, try to discover what message this film is broadcasting about the common people in the USA. Especially when they are singing ""Throw the Jew down the well"" with Borat. Watch it if just for this reason."

","Scattershot satire/documentary of Baron Coen's cult character Borat the Kazsakhi reporter doing the American odyssey and dodging every prejudice possible along the way, including his own. Probably as many rigged as authentic set-pieces, and plenty of big, as well as failed laughs. Coen (who can't stop reminding me of a young John Cleese) is immensely talented in his very raucous, low-brow and puerile humor style, although I haven't seen any Ali G skits- or the movie. But to me eventually, this is basically Candid Camera, a made-for-TV skit collection. <br/><br/>The laugh's certainly on Borat... and the shudder's on the Americans. But it also makes me wonder: how many try-outs to prove the alleged idiocy of the whole American society without scoring ANY points did they actually make?

"fardarter","4","3","7","17 December 2006"," Much Ado ...
","Spurred by the outcry of outrage and controversy, I walked into the theater with high expectations. Laughter overcame me in several hilarious moments, especially with a joke involving a cheese ritual (can't spoil it, sorry). Overall, I was underwhelmed. Had the theater been more crowded I might perhaps have laughed more by going with the flow, but I confess I was a bit bored. The controversy grew old very quickly, as did the ethnic/religious jokes. Born and raised in Europe, I find many US-based stereotypes about non-Western cultures tragically un-funny, therefore US born and raised viewers should not trust my impressions. Most of my US friends (prevalently white Caucasians) laughed a lot. Most of my non-US friends left the theater wondering what was there to laugh so hard about. I laughed much harder for Young Frankenstein. My vote of 4/10 is generous and takes into account my admiration for the courageous enterprise. Had I seen a shorter feature of Borat on TV, I would have enjoyed it more."
"ahmetozk1","4","3","7","1 December 2006"," Primitive scenes
","I had great expectations from this movie. However, I was disappointed at rather absurd behaviors of Borat on primitive scenes. The same topic could have been put in a realistic framework with more subtle humors. In Turkey, we have seen wonderful examples of Turkish comedy movies on the differences between rural and city cultures.So I can say that comedy movies generally produce more profound effects when they depict real scenarios. The use of nudity added more to the clumsiness of the movie. Borat's offbeat swimming suit did not even fit into the local culture in which it was supposed to be worn. His chasing of Azamat in total nudity had no entertaining spirit in it. While the movie greatly lacks artistic value and realism, it can also be considered rather humiliating for Kazakhstan, which I suppose could produce no such idiotic anchorman."

","Everyone speaks of it... everyone loves it...I had huge expectations for the movie, but I was a little bit disappointed after it. The movie was a documentary, but then there was added a very bad storyline considering about the P.... An.... Some of the jokes also went too far, and I have to admit that I felt from time to time to be forced to laugh.I've heard that many parts of the film were ""real life situations"" and I wanted to believe that for the most of the time. But finally the Naked 69 thing and running thru the congress room crushed my borat-world. It was a very good idea to make a Such documentary movie, but with an extra pee poo humor I sometimes felt like an elementary school kid when laughing to that. A funny film, but maybe a little irritating too."

Anyone who is easily offended by sexism, racism, anti-semitism, gay sex, male nudity, incest, masturbation, anti-americanism, neo-con bashing, and Christian-fundamentalist bashing, my advice: a must see on a Saturday nite, absolve yourself the next day. The rest of us can see this any nite, chuckle for days, AND, look forward to the DVD with the outtakes and inside jokes.<br/><br/>Finally, Borat ultimately mocks the audience as he eventually hits upon the most common states of universal human hypocrisy.

Being a psychology major, I enjoy watching real people in unusual situations, but the plot around this idea lacked any substance. The movie will not bore you, but you might wonder why it was even made after you take time to think about it.

"eastbergholt2002","7","3","7","12 November 2006"," Entertaining
","Sacha Baron Cohen plays Borat Sagdiyev, a leading TV journalist from Kazakhstan (formerly part of the Soviet Union). We start off in Borat's home village which is full of white-trash dressed in clothes they believe are ""cool"" in the West and where anti-Semitism is regarded as a participation sport. <br/><br/>Borat travels to the U.S. to make a documentary and takes a road-trip from New York to California in an ice-cream van he buys for $700. Borat uses the pretext of the documentary to meet real people and we observe the reaction as he attempts to shock them. Borat's victims are keen to appear on Kazakhstani television and most Americans he meets have no problem in believing that the citizens of his country are stupid peasants. <br/><br/>Borat breaks many of the taboos of polite Western society by making outrageous statements or behaving disgustingly. It's like a revolting re-interpretation of Candid Camera. Cohen's technique is to extract idiotic remarks and the audience is asked to laugh at the brainless dupes. His antics include: defecating in a flower bed in the middle of New York and telling a group feminists that women have smaller brains. One of the strangest scenes involves an extended bout of vigorous nude wrestling with his producer, a fat, ugly hairy man. Cohen literally has his head up the guy's ass.<br/><br/>Most of the U.S. movie review I have read see the movie as a hilarious satire about America. The aim of satire is usually to ridicule the follies of humanity or poke fun at the rich and powerful. As a Brit, my view is that Cohen is simply ""taking the p*ss"" out of America's great unwashed. In every country in the world you will find people prepared to say ridiculous things for their 15 minutes of fame. <br/><br/>Most teenage boys will enjoy its sadism and find the movie hysterically funny in the same way they enjoy the Jackass movies. I'm not sure what to make of the exaggerated claims for Cohen's brilliance but some of his antics are very funny. I know my wife and mother won't enjoy it."
"derekstein","4","14","55","30 September 2006"," You Laugh, Then Feel Dirty
","Some of the scenes within Borat definitely make the movie worth viewing, ... one in particular. However, one should discuss their opinions after the movie. You'll find interesting reactions. Much of the movie is about laughing at negative stereotypes, mixed in with some bathroom/shock humor. After waiting in line for an advanced screening, I was ready to laugh at anything. Some of my reaction might have been subconsciously forced. Nevertheless, the attack on religion was particularly telling. Yes, Cohen made fun of his Jewish heritage, but it was satire that presented Jews as the victims of ignorance - which, unfortunately is the case in much of the world. However, when he directs his camera towards Christians, he doesn't want us to laugh at their persecution, but rather he wants us to laugh at their religion itself. Furthermore, it is interesting that Islam was't mentioned once in a movie partially set in Kazakhstan. In all, there is enough creativity in how Cohen crafted some of the humor, that the movie will make you forget about things for a few hours, which is sometimes, the reason we go."

","Jagshamesh!!! I wish i could give this movie a 1,000,000 rating on IMDb. This movie is FUNNY, OFFENSIVE, SATIRICAL, Poignant, ABSURD, & Hilarious!!!! Sacha Baron Cohen of Ali G fame has gone out and made ""reality movie"". I don't want to give out any spoilers, as I stayed away from them for many months before this epic comedy came out in theaters, but suffice to say you will be SHOCKED by Borat.<br/><br/>At the screening I attended, parents (you idiots) brought their 8-9 year olds to the the flick. This is not a movie for kids, nor is it a movie for those who don't understand satire. Sure, there were a few chuckles during the toilet humor (mostly by the dunderheads who did not really understand Borat) but the real gut-inducing laughter came when Borat did or said something politically insensitive/incorrect. I noticed, the people who did not laugh during these parts, were most probably at the screening due to the all the hype the flick generated pre-release. Sacha thanks them for filling his pockets with $$$$ though.<br/><br/>I'll have to re-watch this comedic gem again (multiple times) because at times the laughter was too much and I could not hear all the subtle jokes by Borat.<br/><br/>The two major highlights of the movie are the wrestling match with Azamat and the dinner with the southern socialite. Get ready to have aching stomachs after those two scenes.<br/><br/>I cannot wait until Sacha Baron Cohen makes the follow up the Borat, Bruno. Another one of his creations, that tests the morality of Americans and their so called democratic and freedom of speech values. I'm certain the Bruno movie will have less toilet humor and the Dunderheads will keep their kids at home.<br/><br/>Only watch this movie if you value intellectual satirical comedy.

Several people ask themselves... is this real or staged? and the answer is.... this is all real, but so well executed that you have to wonder how can people be so ignorant.

"gavin6942","9","5","15","19 November 2006"," The Hype Was Real, This Film Will Be Legendary
","Combining a fictional man (Borat) with factual events, this film shows America to Americans from an outsider's perspective. Sadly, what we find is distressing in the modern era. A country full of people with biases and prejudice, or as my friend put it, ""Borat made fun of all the things that people think matter, and actually really, really don't."" Sacha Baron Cohen continued the ""Candid Camera"" pranks he was pulling on ""Da Ali G Show"", only stepping up the offensiveness to a whole new level. While this will scare off certain people (jokes about Jews, blacks and 9/11 aren't always well-received), those who are mature enough to understand the context will appreciate the presentation.<br/><br/>Borat comes from a world that fears Jews (with their ""horns"" and endless greed) and the audience is left to think he is very backwards and a relic of unenlightened days. But by touring America -- and the scenes are all real people, not scripts -- we see that people still hate people for superficial reasons. Religion, orientation, class, gender and race are all held as the keys to what a good person should be. But these are those things that Americans think matter, but don't.<br/><br/>The humor is not just a decloaking of America. There's also some fun ""Baywatch"" and Pamela Anderson references, and a lengthy scene of male nudity that is both hysterical and revolting (but in my opinion the hysterical far outweighs the revolting). Another scene of male nudity is perhaps even more shocking from the themes it implies. I cannot really say more here without ruining the jokes.<br/><br/>The ""great films"" each year are dramas or documentaries. Rarely do comedies get remembered as being ""great"" critically. But this one might have broken a barrier we haven't seen in almost forever. ""Borat"" is not only endlessly funny (the hardest I ever laughed in a theater) but timelessly important."
"goran_tito","10","5","15","4 November 2006"," Who is he really making fun of?
","Yes, funniest-movie-ever. But something else I'd like to point out, as many people seem concerned about the political correctness of the movie. He's neither making fun of Jews nor of Khazaki/Eastern European/Central Asian people. The first one, because he portrays anti-semitism in its stupidity, not Jews in their stupidity. And the second one because obviously he takes some stereotypes that people (i.e. Americans) have about other countries and makes a satire out of them. Its obvious they're not serious and real. Americans' reactions in the movie on the other hand, are very REAL and SERIOUS. HE'S ACTUALLY MAKING FUN OF Americans. It's disappointing how people cant see that and *spoiler* laugh the most at the scene where two naked men chase each other in a hotel, when there are so many more intelligent and subtle references in the movie. *spoilers* Not funny (poor taste) scenes include IMHO only the one where he enters into an antique shop and starts breaking things as by accident while the poor seller attempts to help him get back on his feet, and the pointless charade ""Running of the Jew"", where grotesque monster-looking Jew-puppets chase people on the streets. But all in all, genial portrayal of the fall-backs of American society."

The movie follows Borat (Sacha Baron Cohen) as he travels to the US from Kazakhstan in order to learn lessons for his country and make a documentary. But when he discovers Baywatch on TV, and more importantly Pamela Anderson, he sets out on an epic quest from NY to California (where Pearl Harbor and Texas are).<br/><br/>The humor is what happens along the way. He purchases an ice cream truck for the trip, accidentally enters a Jewish-owned Bed and Breakfast (Borat is anti-semetic), consequently holding a cross and his money close as he speaks fearfully into the camera of how the clever, shapeshifting Jews attempted to poison him, and later buys a grizzly bear for protection after the traumatic experience.<br/><br/>He eventually reaches LA to meet his elusive Pamela Anderson, and funniness ensues--I won't go into further specifics.<br/><br/>This is a great movie and an intelligent movie. Don't get turned off thinking it's just stupid humor or just making exploitative comments about Jews for cheap laughs; nay, it goes as far as making a few sly insinuations about our own culture, insinuations we can learn from.<br/><br/>But, it is first and foremost a funny movie.

Too much of the movie is ""fake"" in the sense that the reactions of too many of the victims and the victims themselves were staged. I would estimate that maybe only 10% of the film used real victims and the rest were staged to look like real victims. That is not enough for this type of movie to be worth seeing. <br/><br/>The yard sale scene was obviously staged since that is where he found the Pam Anderson book that is part of the ongoing plot of the movie. I believe the hotel convention scene was staged just from the cameras that were already setup inside in anticipation of their entry into the room. Also, too much of the movie was exposed on TV clips, talk shows, and newspaper write-ups.<br/><br/>For a movie like this to work for me, you really need real victims like you had in the Jackass movie that had no clue."

I previously had been unfamiliar with Sacha Baron Cohen's work (except that I thought he did a great part in ""Sweeney Todd"" as the barber Pirelli and so I admired his work as an actor). I didn't see Borat when it was first out in theaters. We rented the DVD recently, having heard that this was a ""funny"" movie. We had no idea what kind of an awful film this was! WARNING! DO NOT rent or buy or go see this film unless you love ""Bevis and Butthead"" or other exploitive and offensive types of ""comedy,"" including (literally!) in-your-face offensive nudity.<br/><br/>This movie is horribly and unconscionably mean. Even if (as some reviewer comments have suggested) the sequences with ""innocent bystanders"" were rehearsed or staged, they are still very disturbing, at least in part because I can see teenagers or immature people trying to imitate this kind of ""humor,"" causing no end of harm.<br/><br/>At least the guy in Jackass did all the stupid things he did to himself. One of the most disturbing aspects of Borat is that he's being rude, offensive, and cruel to other people, supposedly in service of ""comedy."" This is just NOT funny! I can't understand why some people like this film. I find that the most disturbing of all. Lest you think that I just don't ""get it,"" I LOVE humor and comedy. This is just not funny.<br/><br/>Let me give you an example -- you're at the circus and someone -- a clown -- slips on a banana peel and falls down. Big laugh, OK? But would you keep laughing if the clown then tries to sit up and you see that he has broken his leg and there's blood pouring out of his head? Would you laugh if he started screaming in pain? To interpret Borat as funny, you basically have to be able to laugh at the bleeding clown. Oh, I ""get it"" -- the ""joke"" was on him. He thought he was being funny and instead he got badly hurt. Could you really laugh at that? To find this movie funny requires you to interpret people's discomfort or their being insulted as amusing.<br/><br/>At least I know now -- I will never ever go see any film by Sacha Baron Cohen EVER AGAIN. I hope, by these remarks, to give other potential viewers a ""heads up"" about what kind of ""humor"" this is.<br/><br/>Don't be fooled. This is not funny. It's very ugly, very offensive stuff."

","Comedy as a film genre has changed considerably since ""The Groove Tube"" created gross-out humor in 1974. Basically, most risqué film comedies try to synthesize lowbrow scatological shenanigans with crude sexual monkeyshines. ""Kentucky Fried Movie,"" ""Animal House,"" ""Airplane,"" and ""Porky's"" followed in the footsteps of ""The Groove Tube"" in the late 1970s and the early 1980s. The Farrelly Brothers established new rules for gross-out humor with ""Dumb and Dumber"" (1994) and ""There's Something About Mary"" (1998). None of the Farrelly's later films achieved the popularity of either ""Dumber"" or ""Mary."" The Weitz Brothers pushed the envelope even further with ""American Pie"" (1999) and its sequel ""American Pie 2"" (2001). The Wayans Brothers intensified gross-out comedy with their ""Scary Movie"" franchise and made millions with the first two entries. The wacky but less perverted Zucker Brothers of ""Airplane"" fame took over the series with ""Scary Movie 3"" and substituted absurdity for perversion. Popular HBO comedian Sacha Baron Cohen of the ""Da Ali G Show"" has made the latest attempt to take film comedy to a new zenith or nadir depending on taste or tastelessness. Although the jokes miss more often than hit the target in ""Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"" (* out of ****), Cohen's comedy of errors is making a lot of people laugh.<br/><br/>""Borat"" qualifies as a typical fish-out-of-water comedy about a klutzy foreign journalist on his first tour of America. Imagine what might happen if the Beverly Hillbillies went to Iran, and you'll have some kind of a clue about what the filmmakers were trying to do. British comic Sacha Baron Cohen bears a striking resemblance to late rock music icon Frank Zappa, and the brainless Kazakhstan reporter that he impersonates here dresses like the Howard Sprague character that Jack Dobson played in 18 episodes of ""The Andy Griffith Show"" on TV between 1966 and 1968. Cohen generates some hilarity with his quasi-Polish accent, even though Kazakhstan's chief language is Russian, and mangles the English language with delightful results. <br/><br/>This thin tale unfolds without fanfare in Borat's third-world village in Kazakhstan. Cohen breaks the invisible fourth wall as Borat and speaks directly to the audience when he introduces his family as well as the village rapist. At one point, he kisses a woman, identifies her as his sister, and then boasts about the trophy that she won for being ""the fourth best prostitute in all of country."" Afterward, he piles all himself and his luggage into a taxi that is drawn by a couple of mules and heads off for America. <br/><br/>Borat claims to be the sixth best reporter in Kazakhstan. His fat, scummy, pinchpenny producer Azamat Bagatov (Ken Davitian of ""Frogtown 2"") and he fly to New York to make a documentary about America. Along the way, Borat surprises the passengers with a live chicken that he packs around in a valise. In New York City, Borat tries to buy a Hummer once an auto dealer convinces him that Hummers attract women. Unfortunately, poor Borat doesn't have enough dough and has to settle for a used $700 ice cream wagon that plays kiddy music over an intercom. His producer and he argue about finances after Borat becomes infatuated with ""Baywatch"" honey Pamela Anderson. Originally, they had planned to confine their documentary to New York City alone, but Borat's hopeless infatuation with the ""Baywatch"" star prompts him to travel across country so that he can propose to her. Borat and his producer temporarily part company after our protagonist catches the latter abusing Borat's Pamela Anderson magazine for prurient purposes. The audience that I sat with went berserk over this scene, especially when Borat and Azamat wrestled nude with their hindquarters in each other's faces, before they ran amok in the buff through a hotel convention, flashing everybody. When Borat isn't making a complete fool of himself, he tries to make fools out of real-life people. Apparently, he managed to fool these nitwits into believing that he was a real-life journalist. The overall effect is worth a smirk or two but not a belly laugh. One instance early in the movie occurs at the ABC-TV affiliate in Jackson, Mississippi, WAPT-TV, where he dupes the Morning News crew in believing his lies. The jokes are mostly tame, and Cohen doesn't resort to the ""Punk'd"" MTV antics of Ashton Kutcher. White Southerners make easy targets for Borat. He dines with a middle-class group of Southerners who appeared to have been plucked from the early 1960s and shocks when his fat African-American girl/prostitute date shows up. In another scene, the oblivious reporter visits a White Supremacist's antique shop and accidentally destroys over $400 worth of merchandise. No, this scene isn't a tenth as funny as a similar scene in ""Jackass: The Movie"" (2002) set at a car rental agency. Eventually, Borat hitches a ride to California with a bunch of drunken frat boys, meets Pamela Anderson at an autograph session, and attempts to kidnap her. <br/><br/>""Seinfeld"" TV producer Larry Charles makes his debut as director with ""Borat."" Cohen and he season their trim 82-minute farce with some politically subversive wit. They ridicule Jews unmercifully and Cohenwho is Jewish himselftakes particular delight in this clowning around. In one scene at an American gun shop, Borat makes inquiries about the best gun with which to shoot Jews. Watching ""Borat"" is like binge drinking. Binge-drinkers go until they blow. Despite its classic comic set-up, ""Borat"" blows more often than goes."

","I'd heard nothing about this film before watching it other than the general consensus that it was one of the funniest films that many had ever seen in their life, so obviously I went in with high expectations that couldn't fail but be disappointed. It's not that the film isn't funny, because it is when you're in the right mood and with the right group of friends, but its not clever, witty humour like I was expecting, instead it was an invitation to laugh at Ali G making an idiot of himself for an hour and a half. I know there are many complaints about the sexist + racist comments made in the film, but come on, the films not discriminating against certain racial groups, it's discriminating against just about everyone and everything! Not a film to watch if you like movies with any substance, pretence at a plot, decent script, good acting, ladidaa, but something to see if you need a cheap laugh and something to discuss with your friends the next day. Watch it at least once in your life, just don't expect a masterpiece."

"aburn-1","8","2","4","20 October 2007"," HILARIOUS movie....for the right audience
","Sacha Baron Cohen is a comedic genius. He presents a new form of comedy hardly seen by anyone in the western hemisphere. This movie is, in a sense, improv comedy filmed on location where only Borat knows what is going on. Borat, played by Cohen, is a fictional character from the country of Kazakhstan who makes fun of and makes up everything about the country and its culture. The whole movie is one giant skit.<br/><br/>In a way, this is similar to all those Bloopers shows where the camera crew plays a gag on unsuspecting victims. The difference here is that this movie plays out along a plot, takes the gags about 10 notches up in some scenes, and the unsuspecting victims are never let in on the gag. Cohen's ability to improvise and adapt his performance to each situation is part of what makes this movie so darn hilarious.<br/><br/>Target age for this audience should be around 15-40, and mostly male. Beware that this movie contains vast amounts of crude humor and makes many jokes that would ordinarily be considered offensive. So if you are easily offended by jokes made in comedies, please steer away. Otherwise, viewers of such comedy shows as SNL, MadTV, Family Guy, Simpsons, Adult Swim, etc. this movie is for you!!

The male nudity sex scene was funny, but personally I could have done with out it, or at least shorten it a little bit. The Pam Anderson story line was priceless, I liked when the Frat boys clued him in on the Real Pam Anderson. Sasha Barhen Cohen is a great actor he really stayed in character, and it is amazing that he can keep a straight face. Also, where did he find his costar? That guy clearly needs to win an Oscar.

","""Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"" portrays somewhat of a make-fun story not only towards Americans, but towards Kazakhstan itself.<br/><br/>Borat's first scene in The ""U.S and A"" starts with him going down the stairs from JFK airport, but the memorability starts when Borat ""Accidently"" drops his luggage in the subway, and you guessed it. Along with all of the clothes that he possesses, come hens from Kazakhstan. ""Careful! They Bite!"" says the comedian. Scenes like this are what make ""Borat: Cultural Learnings of America For Make Benefit of Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"", but others just simply don't. In another stupid and typical Borat scene, You find Borat (After his other Kazakhstani friend Azamat strips of him of everything he has) lying on the floor burning his Pamela Anderson picture, and whimpingly crying as if the world was going to end. The crowd started to crack up as if it was the funniest part of the movie, while I was just silently waiting for the scene to end.<br/><br/>For some film goers, ""Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"" might have the properties of a cinematic masterpiece that has no diminutive end towards laughter, as much as some may see it as anyway they please.<br/><br/>Either way, there is still something that makes ""Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"" stand tall, and that is Sacha Baron Cohen. The film's pace revolves around his performance. He is a master at improvisation, and if it were not him who plays Borat, the film would be a dud.<br/><br/>Every time the film achieves a balanced essence, the director ruins it with a daft scene of stupidity. But surprisingly, every time the film is an inch away from darkness, Sacha Baron Cohen pulls it up miraculously. Its the critics highest grade of the year, but that may not signify anything until you see it yourself. In this case, I am not telling you to not not see it. Either way, ""Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"" is here to stay for a very long time."

There was something I didn't understand though, why did they chose Kazakhstan as the country they're trying to portrait in this way? As far as I know Kazakhstan isn't that bad. As a matter of fact, the opening scene was not filmed in Kazakhstan. I do believe they should have chosen a more suitable country, probably an Arab one... It would fit in like a piece of puzzle"
"Matt_Layden","7","2","4","21 November 2006"," ""Borat Is Much Funnier then Ali G.""
","Borat is a Kazakhstani television personality who heads to USA, the so called ""greastest country in the world"". In an attempt to learn more about the country to bring to Kazakhstan, Borat manages to upset almost every single person he encounters. While in America he develops an unhealthy obsession with Pamela Anderson and begins a quest to become her husband.<br/><br/>I have to say this right off the bat, I hate Ali G with a passion. That character is not funny one bit and every time I hear his voice I feel like punching a baby in the face. Now, Borat is another story. I've seen some of his skits on television and guess what...no punching of babies. In fact I smiled every once and while I yes a chuckle did happen. Once I saw the trailer for Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan, again a smirk or two and a chuckle. Then all these reviews came pouring in: Funniest Comedy of the year, A fearless comedy, Riotously funny, and so on. So does BORAT make it as one of the funniest films of all time? Is it full of side-splitting laughter? Or is it just over-hyped?<br/><br/>Much like Snakes on a Plane, Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan, has you laughing at the title alone. Without even seeing the film you knew it would be funny and it is, although I do have to say that hype killed it. It is nowhere near the funniest film of all time. Of the last five years maybe? Well, I would put it high on the list, but I still find The 40 Year Old Virgin to be funnier, maybe because it was a smarter comedy.<br/><br/>The one problem with Borat is that while it claims all be set in ""reality"" it's quite obvious that some scenes are staged, the best example would be the final ten minutes of the film, with Pamela Anderson. While it is indeed funny, it takes away from the rest of the film because it immediately takes you out of it's reality. Yes, it is a film with a story to tell, even if that story is buried deep under it's randomness, but the feel of the film goes all over the place.<br/><br/>It's offensive, but in this day and age almost everything is. At no point did I think anything in the film was over-the-line or in bad taste. The film is on the heels of Jackass II for being crude. It's one more step towards what is excepted in the eyes of the movie going public. Both films contain male nudity, and in both cases they get laughs. In Borat, the nude wrestling match had me on the floor. It was definitely the highlight. Whether or not THAT particular scene was staged is debatable, if it were, you might ask yourself is it still as funny.<br/><br/>I found myself laughing off and on with Borat, more times it was a chuckle that a gut buster. Cohen does a good job at staying in character throughout the entire film, which is a short one by the way and ends faster then you can say the whole title. It does make for an entertaining watch, just don't go in thinking that it is the funniest thing ever cause you will be disappointed."

","Surely some of this movie was staged. The question of course, is, how much. It is awfully hard to believe that the participants in this movie were not aware of the presence of cameras and cameramen and/or camerawomen. How much of it was scripted? Also, is a release not required to show the people Borat is interacting with on film? Why would some of these people sign a release if what they said on film cast them in a bad light? Do they not realize what they sound like? Did they sign a release beforehand? Then how could they be unaware of what was going on? I might give as an example, the dinner party talking behind Borat's back while he was upstairs. However, even if it was staged, I definitely killed myself laughing."

","After initially writing this movie off as stupid and insulting years ago a rewatch changed my opinion significantly: while this is not an easy movie to sit through it is laugh out loud hilarious, and while offensive a work genius. It must have taken a lot of wit and courage from the actors playing Borat, the camera man and, anyone else in on the fact a mockumentary was being made, to pull this off knowing the difficult and embarassing situations they put themselves and other people into. Also they must have known the backlash revealing the whole act to their targets would cause. Does this movie reveal anything about human nature because of what they did and said in ""Borat""'s presence? Yes and no: yes, because extreme situations can reveal the worst and best in people; no, because situations were forced onto them by actors without their knowing or permission. Would it be more telling had they reacted to people who really were as ""Borat"" was depicted? Who knows. The movie looses points for being offensive and what its targets must have gone through during filming; it gains several for being a laugh out loud work of genius. 9/10"

The true genius of Borat however is the fact that the Americans think Borat is a real person and that he is filming a documentary about the United States, this is how sacha Baron cohen gets so many pretty surreal opportunities. The acting and character of Borat are so good that every single person who saw him thought he was just a weird, foreign man filming a documentary. There are also not many people or films who would take the jokes so halariously far just to have the 'victim' of Borat to say the most inappropriate thing they could possibly say in that moment.

","Outrageous and very funny, Borat is able to propel the mockumentary comedy format to new heights with its sheer brilliance and daring nature alone. Sacha Baron Cohen provides a terrific comedic performance as reporter Borat, and his charisma on screen is undoubtedly hilarious. The gags throughout the film are timeless, and the situations so insane, that you can't help but smile as you watch and think back upon them. The film is very memorable, and does a good job of not taking itself too seriously, and focusing on trying to make the audience laugh.

","Borat is over the top, highly offensive at times, making it uncomfortable to watch for certain scenes. Some of these scenes are uncomfortable in a good way though as they point out how bigoted certain Americans can be. Though the intent for this movie was to be a comedic road film, it accidentally turned out to be a well- structured commentary on America as a side note for this extremely raunchy film.<br/><br/>One fact I dislike about the making of this film is that the filmmakers didn't have the ""real"" people they interacted with sign release forms, which instigated a lawsuit by the frat brothers in the film as they did not want their families to see them act the way they did on their part of the road trip depicted in this film. While the lack of release forms brought out honesty and bluntness from the real people shown in the film, it was very inconsiderate of the filmmakers.<br/><br/>What is quite brilliant is the ""bad"" aspects of America depicted in this film. When Borat visits a rodeo to sing his national anthem, we get racist comments from people who are involved in the rodeo, we see the crowd strongly agree with Borat about ""killing all the terrorists,"" showing the ugly side of being a radical in the U.S. Funny and uncomfortable moments also depict real people making offensive comments about Jewish people, homosexuals, and other minorities.<br/><br/>Aside from the sub-theme of a commentary on America, this film is very funny, although a lot of the comedy deals with Borat's own bigotry, which is not so bad when you think about it since it is Sacha Baron Cohen, an American, playing the role of a character - part of the fiction in this film. This can be seen as a commentary of bigotry in general as well, though Borat's bigotry mainly deals with the Jewish community. Seeing Borat trying to adjust to and learn from American customs time and time again evokes big laughs from the audience since he is clueless about manners and respect for certain people. One of the best moments of the film is when Borat's driving instructor informs him that women can choose who to have sex with in America and Borat goes wide-eyed as exclaims ""WHAT?!?""<br/><br/>If you are easily offended this is not a film for you, but this is a surprisingly very good comedy and a good commentary on America.<br/><br/>3.0/4.0"

","Borat (2006): Dir: Larry Charles / Cast: Sacha Baron Cohen, Ken Davitian, Luenell Campbell, Pamela Anderson: Controversial yet hilarious comedy about a Kazakhstan reporter shooting a documentary about American culture. Begins at his village with leering neighbours and a pouting wife before beginning a road trip to America where he misinterprets every situation to offensive levels.

","Borat is loud, vulgar, culturally insensitive, racist, sexist, crazy but ultimately a ridiculously hilarious 84-minute movie that might be one of the funniest movies ever made. The eccentric title character is played by Sacha Baron Cohen.<br/><br/>Borat hails from Kazakhstan and works as a television reporter. He is sent to the USA in order to learn from their culture and incorporate the things that he learns during his visit.<br/><br/>Due to the incredibly hilarious opening scene, the main problem with the movie lies in maintaining its level of hilarity. There are a lot of moments which might disgust some viewers and it is definitely not a movie for those who cannot stomach some disturbing imagery.<br/><br/>Sacha Baron Cohen, the British comedian, also helped in shaping the character and in writing many of his own dialogs. It is a splendid performance and he deserved the Golden Globe that was bestowed upon him.<br/><br/>Borat starts off with a lot of promise, but the second half of the movie fails to match the level that was shown in the beginning. However, due to its short runtime, Borat is great if you are looking for something funny with a limited time."

","Like he did with his character Ali G, Borat is filmed with Cohen (The Dictator, 2012) moving around real life people as the character Borat Sagdiyev without people knowing he is an actor. This gives a brilliant and very interesting insight into the diversity of the American people, as well as a one of a kind social criticism as Borat's unconventional behaviour brings out the best and worst of people. It's quite interesting and thoughtful to observe that people in social groups often looked down on or judged easily actually are the ones best at accepting his differences as opposed to the higher social groups that reacts with horror, hate and dislike. Anyone who are familiar with the work of Cohen knows not to expect political correctness and this is really the case here where a wide range of types are victims of Borat's incorrectness. The rare real insight into the different social groups are a variety of pleasant (Luelle) and almost frightening (the audience that keeps clapping at the rodeo), you just can't make this stuff up! It is at times hilarious, at times a bit too much (the man likes being naked) but always interesting and so far the best working of Cohen's films.<br/><br/>Moviegeek.eu"
"nbwritersinbox","8","0","0","12 July 2014"," Borat: Brave Social Parody But...
","Whether you find this movie hilarious or not, may depend on where you are in the world.<br/><br/>From my British perspective, we have a long tradition of comedians sending-up authority figures and the small-minded. Ali G, Borat's precursor, was well-known on late night comedy shows here in the UK for doing just that...<br/><br/>Using the Ali G ""interview technique"", Borat visits a Feminist Group, a Comedy Training School, an etiquette coach and other organizations ripe for parody. The mistake most of the non-actors make is believing Borat to be a naive, Khazakhi TV journalist, when in fact, he's a Cambridge-educated actor who easily debunks them.<br/><br/>The cameras are rolling, all the time. The ethics of whether or not non-actors should be duped into appearing in a commercial, feature film backed by 20th Century Fox, are what stop me from laughing all the time, but often Cohen's comic improvisation, timing and retorts are achingly funny.<br/><br/>The Rodeo sequence for example, highlights the dangers of excessive American patriotism, but these are real people, unaware ""Borat"" will be adapting their beloved anthem. Their anger and confusion seemed justified to a point, although Borat is, in fact, displaying the same patriotism they hold dear.<br/><br/>On balance, I don't believe Borat is an anti-American film. Instead, Cohen delivers a hilarious exposé of both Western and Eastern Bloc small-minded values that are not shared by all. Laughing at these attitudes is the best medicine, changing them is far more difficult."

","(Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan)<br/><br/>'Yagshemash!'<br/><br/>The second film in the Cohen trilogy based on his original character creations that we all saw within his Ali G show. Now even though these characters are all very clever creations and work well within the BBC comedy, the films varied. Myself I always thought Ali G was his best and funniest creation offering killer satirical comedy, but the movie of that character turned out to be quite poor and not overly funny surprisingly. 'Bruno', his third film and final original character was easily the next best character offering outrageously embarrassing homosexual tomfoolery, the film also lived up to that brilliantly.<br/><br/>Borat has always been somewhere in the middle for me, the character never really came across that funny on the Ali G show with the small sequences, I thought it slowed the show down. Of course his character is suppose to be simple, backwards, slow, dull, dated etc...that's part of the stinging gag that Eastern Europe is slightly primitive and centuries out of date (dare I say medieval? yes I dare). But working with this angle can also be risky as the jokes can be slow coming and childishly simple, Borat himself being on the same intelligence and life experience level as a child to a degree (when outside his native country).<br/><br/>So it did come as a surprise when this film actually turned out to be very very good, very amusing, highly awkward to watch at times and totally beat Cohen's first foray into the movies in 'Ali G Indahouse'. The main change to the programme here is the fact the plot is strung together around individual sequences showing Cohen making an ass of himself in dreadful cringe-inducing situations. Unlike Ali G where the film was spun into a proper full blown story with actual characters that you didn't care about whilst ruining the background myth of Ali G at the same time. This film merely introduces a sidekick who directs Borat as he goes across America making a documentary for the benefit of his homeland Kazakhstan...oh and searching for Pamela Anderson.<br/><br/>So just like the little sketches on the Ali G show we see Borat meeting various Americans, visiting various places of interest and generally showing himself up as the innocent wet behind the ears traveller who has no clue how to conduct himself in the modern western world. This film easily tops the TV show sketches for embarrassing moments, its like a car crash...you know the rest. Some of the things we see are just unbelievable, apart from much blatant racism against Jewish folk (Cohen's favourite), we meet a racist all American cowboy at a Texas rodeo who accuses Borat of looking like a terrorist down to his moustache. More racism in the South as Borat tries his hand at etiquette lessons (again) from some clearly well to do religious white folk, the funny twist being Borat's fat black hooker girlfriend turning up at the door. Full scale nudity of course, can't not have a bit of full scale public nudity (oh geez!), breaking stuff in a Confederate heritage museum (more obvious racial undertones) and finally assaulting Pamela Anderson in a Virgin Megastore (that shows the films age!).<br/><br/>Being America it is too easy for Cohen, the targets are so obvious and so simple to set up...racism, all American jingoism and homophobia are always gonna be his weapons of mass embarrassment. He sets his sights on these and hits them spot on, be it an old person, a young person, a famous/political person or even a crowd, Cohen can tease xenophobia or discrimination out of anyone with his naive questions and general approach.<br/><br/>While the film does feel more like an extended version of the TV sketches that was to be expected. It was also expected that whatever Cohen got up to here it would be bigger and bolder than ever before, that was certainly achieved. It starts off slow and ends kinda flat but unsurprisingly those are the sequences where Borat is a character within a films plot, its only when he ventures into the reality of everyday America that the film comes alive. Unfortunately the film is riddled with offensive moments which will and have upset many people which I can understand, unlike South Park the film isn't an animated cartoon so it feels more intense. <br/><br/>To a degree you could say that all the commotion surrounding the film only goes to prove it did what it set out to do, Cohen hit the nail on the head. Most will know of this character and Cohen's antics from TV, you know what to expect and get what you pay for, if you don't like this guys brand of humour then you know not to see this, it will offend. Although I do wonder how some of these people carry on their regular lives after being somewhat exposed in this film, that is if they are not actors of course, its actually very hard to tell in my opinion but I'm sure some may be. After the disappointing Ali G flick Cohen pulls it back and produces a great slice of wince-inducing shameful humiliation that will leave you with a sheepish grin plastered across your red face.<br/><br/>'Dziekuje'<br/><br/>7/10"

","Borat : Master of disguise Sacha Baron Cohen hits the road to explore America as the crude Kazakstani reporter Borat in a feature mockumentary that brings one of the Da Ali G Show star's most popular characters to life on the big screen. Sent by the Kazakh Ministry of Information to gain a better understanding of American culture and bring his findings back home, Borat and faithful producer Azamat (Ken Davitian) set their sights in New York City. When the citizens and interview subjects of the Big Apple seem less than receptive to Borat's distinctively unrestrained approach and the curious Kazakh television personality stumbles across an episode of Baywatch while channel-surfing in his hotel room, he becomes instantly smitten with screen siren Pamela Anderson. Now confident that the only way to discover the true essence of America is to travel to California and make the bikini-clad beauty his bride, Borat purchases a ramshackle ice-cream truck in which he and Azamat will make their way across the Great Plains and on to the sunny West Coast -- all the while coming into contact with a wide variety of ""typical"" Americans. Within this loose, scripted framework, Borat engages in his usual misbehavior with unsuspecting strangers, from accidentally releasing a chicken from his suitcase on a New York subway ride to a formal interview with Alan Keyes. I think its one of the best comedys ever made "

","It's-a very nice. Performer Sacha Baron Cohen keeps character comedy alive with this ingratiating, sometimes utterly outrageous film that does do more than just deliver belly laughs, as it takes its title character - a clueless, well intentioned TV personality from Kazakhstan who travels to the U.S. and A. to study its cultures so that the great and glorious nation of Kazakhstan may learn a thing or two. It exposes a variety of prejudices as lovable Borat interacts with a great many average Americans, finding that things aren't so ideal in his host country. Cohen is absolutely incredible as he stays in character no matter what the situation is, and priceless as he displays his ignorance of so many aspects of American culture. Among his travels, which do take on an episodic nature, he learns about American humour (NOT!), antagonizes the audience at a rodeo as he does his own version of the national anthem, makes friends with a prostitute (Luenell), and spars with his curmudgeonly, corpulent producer Azamat (Ken Davitian). Granted, Cohen does go to some pretty crazy lengths to get laughs, especially when he and Davitian have their climactic physical altercation. Still, he does generate some honest guffaws, which is more than can be said for some comedies. The best moments come when Borat is meeting with the assorted American citizens, and their reactions as they try to decide what to make of him are priceless. Part of the plot revolves Borat becoming infatuated with actress Pamela Anderson and travelling across country, from NYC to LA, with the intention of making her his wife, and this adds to the wacky appeal. One of the most refreshing elements to ""Borat"" is its dispensing with anything resembling political correctness; too bad more mainstream comedies don't have this level of brevity. Cohen is a lot of fun (it's hard not to crack up simply seeing his face on the DVD cover), and Davitian makes for a great comic foil. While his brand of humour may not be for everybody, some viewers are sure to appreciate his dedication to his craft and love his go-for-broke, anything-goes attitude. The action moves along very well, and the film wraps up in record time, coming in at a very reasonable 84 minutes. It gets off to a great start, and remains amusing right to its appealing wrap-up. Eight out of 10."

","Sacha Borat aka Borat, the charmingly offensive, Kazakhstan reporter has written and appeared in a hilarious anti-PC film that tramples over every cringing, PC attitude, where previously, 'decent' folk once feared to tread. His exploits in seeking to introduce America for the benefit of Kazakhstan TV have deeply upset Kazakhstani politicians and tourism officials alike. (Did Kazakhstan have a tourist industry before this film?) But the joke is really on America and Americans and the way that they respond to Borat provides the humor of the film. Their endemic racism, homophobic and their tendency to take things literally and their inability to send themselves up produce some very funny episodes.<br/><br/>Aided by the memorably named Azamat Bogatov, 'Borat' does pander to the lowest common denominator, but somehow he gets away with each outrageous scene and stunt. How he managed to avoid arrest is open to speculation. From watching the film again, it is conceivable that more of the stunts were staged than initially seemed possible. The extras to promote the movie, which are included in the DVD package are worth viewing, as are the deleted scenes. Sacha Baron Cohen's appearances to promote the movie, (chat shows in the US and openings in cities around the world) were conducted in character. Indeed, such is his total immersion in the character that he reminds me of the late, great, Peter Sellers, who was similarly transformed by the characters he inhabited, often to the point that he couldn't step back out of character.<br/><br/>How Cohen plans to follow up this triumph will be eagerly awaited. Nothing else he has tried has worked as well as Borat. The Bruno character is more the stuff of short sketch than full-length feature film. In the meantime, Saviour the outrageousness of this DVD. Highly recommended.<br/><br/>All stand for the Kazakhstan National Anthem!"

It is film about world changing with fresh and new Ideas that crave to break through. <br/><br/>This film could actually change the mentality. Nothing is more powerful than good humor. <br/><br/>The story is reality show with a guy that is comic book character. The masquerade trick succeeds because everybody wants to know a guy who does not know how to speak English well, and whose background is poor and uneducated. The character is actually Satiric mirror, a Procrustes bed, that no one could escape the fatal judgment. Now, everybody thinks as he's less then modest appearance that he would look good in the mirror. Actually, every real life character is doing what he/she is trained by the society to do. He went to all classes, races and ages, and picture them in all of their sincerity. He pictures both 3rd world reality with parallel picturing, though well encrypted, of the 1st world reality. Reality of the 3rd world is economic crises and 1st world reality is hypocrisies. He attacks them both with one hand. His manifest, blunt and indecent, as the whole film is indecent, is marked with his pronunciation of United States of America, as leading country of today's modern world, which he maybe hold responsible for both world economic crises and domestic hypocrisies. Do not hold just to this meaning, as all sequences has so many different layers, nifty put. First layer is comical. Second is social engagement. Third is political rebellion. It has so many great and noble ideas put into it, and film itself is though saying bad and vulgar things, fighting for true virtue, as if you are seeing objects in the mirror, what is left is right, and what is right is left. Moreover, his character is total negative by which he wants to inspire something positive. <br/><br/>Both mirror like and comical/social/rebellious like declaration and light motive of his film is, like typo, like non-intentional error, when pronouncing ""US and A"". You may imagine what he meant with ""US"", but ""A"",is pronounced funny. There should be put ""I"" instead of ""A"" to catch its meaning. ""I"" means The Mirror. The Artist.<br/><br/>True genius could think of that trick to fool all of the world, even ""US and A"" movie censorship. <br/><br/>Sasha is one of a kind.

","Guerilla improv often has a very short shelf life, but this one's still funny even after you know where it's going. In Borat, Sacha Baron Cohen has a character that's perfect for dragging hilarious material out of his unsuspecting subjects: naive and disarming on the surface, vulgar and profane beneath. He gets some really ripe stuff from the act this time around, with the lowlights of his American tour including a homophobic cowboy, a troupe of bigoted etiquette experts and an RV full of misogynist frat boys. The short, storyline-advancing scenes in between each unscripted segment are generally thin and bland, but Cohen's ad-libbed torments of the unprepared masses are clearly the movie's meat and potatoes and it wisely never strays far from that core."

","It's almost impossible to not wonder as to how much courage does one need to have to make a film like this.It would be unfair to call this a satire based on a couple of scenes because Borat,inadvertently,takes a dig at everybody,sane or not.If you are on your right mind it doesn't take much time to realize that the primary aim of this movie is to make you laugh than anything else.Things that might seem outright silly and dumb on the screen have underlying comical innuendos that tickle your intrigue . I'd seriously doubt it if someone tells me that they weren't shocked at least once throughout the movie ,because Borat is so often off the limits,so often cringe-inducing ,but it doesn't take much effort on your part to ease through these scenes once you are able to hit (or at least tap)the wavelength of Mr.Cohen.

"Electrified_Voltage","6","0","0","14 September 2011"," Still better than ""Brüno"", but not as funny to me now as it was in the theatre
","It's been nearly five years since this movie, starring Sacha Baron Cohen as Borat (one of his three alter egos from ""Da Ali G Show""), came into theatres, turned out to be a great success, and sparked a lot of controversy! I went to see it on the silver screen in November 2006, and that was definitely the biggest movie-going crowd I've ever been in! I found this extremely raunchy and politically incorrect comedy to be overall very good at the time, both shocking and funny. I watched it again on the small screen a few months later, when it was new to the home video format, and still thought it was overall funny, even though I knew more about it and how it was made by this point. However, another viewing of ""Borat"" last year (my first in three years), followed by one this year, have proved to be a bit bland in comparison.<br/><br/>Borat Sagdiyev is an extremely sexist, anti-Semitic, and anti-homosexual man from Kazakhstan, and is a very popular television personality in that country. The Kazakh Ministry of Information sends him to the United States of America with producer Azamat Bagatov to make a documentary film about the country which will benefit Kazakhstan. The two of them fly to New York, and initially, the intention is to shoot the entire documentary in this city. However, as Borat flips through the channels on his hotel room TV, he comes across an episode of ""Baywatch"", sees Pamela Anderson in the role of C.J. Parker, and immediately falls in love! After finding out that Pamela lives in California, and that his wrathful wife back in Kazakhstan has just died, he decides to convince Azamat to take the filming project to California, but doesn't tell him the real reason why he wants to go there, which is to marry his new love interest! As the two of them travel across the country, they face numerous complications! <br/><br/>The vast majority of people who appear in this film are not actors, but people who were pranked into believing that Borat really was a man from Kazakhstan. Knowing this was probably a reason why I didn't find some parts as funny with subsequent viewings, such as the part with the title character at the dinner gathering, where he bluntly considers one woman's looks inferior to those of the other two women at the table, and then shows that he doesn't know how to use the toilet! However, this definitely isn't the only reason. Some parts still gave me a thorough laugh, such as Borat taking driving lessons and then going to purchase a car, asking about the ""p$#@% magnet,"" but most parts didn't make me laugh as hard as those. One part I remember making me laugh hard in the theatre was the naked fight, but I definitely found that far less funny the last two times. If I had thought the drunken frat boys were actors the last two times I saw the film (can't say I have much sympathy for them if they really meant what they said, even if they were drunk), I would have thought they were trying to be funny but failing. Even if I didn't usually laugh that hard too many times during my last two viewings, I still at least found a lot of mildly amusing parts (Sacha Baron Cohen's talent obviously helps a lot in the film), but I also found some mediocrity or lameness.<br/><br/>After the release of ""Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"", Sacha Baron Cohen followed it up in 2009 with ""Brüno"", featuring the only character from ""Da Ali G Show"" he hadn't made a movie with yet. I didn't see that one in the theatre, but saw it on DVD last year, and with just one viewing, I thought it was below average. My last two viewings of ""Borat"" were after that, and I still found this film to be better than Cohen's follow-up, but certainly not as funny as I found it several years earlier. I was not there to witness any of the filming process of this hit 2006 comedy, so I obviously don't know exactly how it was done, but knowing how few people were acting did make some parts a little awkward to me with recent viewings, though not everything, since it didn't seem ALL of them got it so bad, and I doubt absolutely EVERYONE who was pranked deserves sympathy, but it still can be at least somewhat cruel. Also, even if the entire film had been staged, I think I still would have found it to be hit and miss during my last couple viewings. So, I still don't hate this ""Borat"" movie like some people do, but I do think it is overrated."

Watching Sacha Baron Cohen portray this Kazakhstan idiot was really well-impressing with the accent, the dialouge, the humor, the idiocy, and the charm.

Because it's political incorrect, vicious, devious and spares no-one, audience included.<br/><br/>And I don't remember any moment where Sacha Baron Cohen, who may not be the most sympathetic man, isn't fully believable as the heartwarming childish character he plays. He looks fully authentically Kaszakh, although is he is from UK. That's very devious, because most people do not know Kazakhstanis, but do accept him as such one.<br/><br/>This movie was very cheap and earned it's production costs ($ 18M) nearly 15 times ($ 261 M).

"Conradical19","10","0","0","28 February 2011"," Seriously... The best comedy I have ever seen.
","This film will definitely not be appreciated by everyone but the irony is that there would be no comedy if it was.<br/><br/>Sacha Baron Cohen is an extremely versatile actor which is shown perfectly by his other character's, Ali G and Bruno. He is the best actor I can think of because some people actually believe his character's to be real. This would make him the perfect undercover spy or journalist because he is able to manipulate people and expose their prejudices. Whereas, the prejudices Borat claims e.g. Antisemitism, homophobia, misogyny, racism are not ones that the actor shares. He is also Jewish himself which makes the Antisemitism part of the humour. This is what helps him to get away with the countless times he has been sued, even by an entire nation! However, what Kazakhstan fail to appreciate is that Borat has helped to put it on the map!<br/><br/>The plot and the socially deviant stunts are cleverly conceived. There are very few people brave enough to do what Baron Cohen and Ken Davitian do in this movie which makes the film hilarious (Particularly the rodeo scene). Most of the narrative was made up as they went along and it must be very low budget which is skillful! The structure of it can be best described as a 'Mockumentary' because it's styled like a documentary which then becomes a Rom-com starring real, unsuspecting people.<br/><br/>My film teacher told me that there are as many ways of interpreting a film as there are people who watch them and that our personal experiences shape this interpretation. My first experience of watching this film was managing to buy a ticket, with my friend, several months shy off 15 which made it a daring and unforgettable adventure in itself. The character is so unique that I still hear and use his quotes frequently. In order to enjoy this film, I suggest an open and tolerable mind in order to see the genius behind it as I have. Also, prepare to cringe at some parts.<br/><br/>If you like this kind of film, I recommend Chris Morris' 'Four Lions', 'Jackass' and of course Ali G and Bruno. IT'Z NICE!"

","Sasha Baron Cohen jumps into the role of ""Borat"", fully committed to letting Borat do what Borat does. The first time I watched Borat, I didn't know that most of the filmed situations were actually real, but later that knowledge spiced up the experience even more (I've watched this movie quite a few times)!<br/><br/>The character of Borat is innocent in his ignorance, but totally sexist, racist, antisemitic, anti-feminist, and just quite simply politically incorrect in just about everything he thinks or does. And the reactions and looks on the faces of the people he meets, make for some hysterical moments!<br/><br/>Cohen plays this part quite unapologetically, delivering an absolutely unparalleled experience to the viewer. This kind of devotion is amazing to watch, and reminds me of Chaplin, who had his crew film even when something went dangerously wrong.<br/><br/>The result is a captivating work, that saved the year for me in terms of movies. Nothing else I saw that year comes close, and quite frankly, very few titles in the whole history of cinema do. I still find myself waking up in the morning sometimes, laughing at a scene I've recalled from Borat.<br/><br/>Original concept, great implementation. Full points for this one. ""Great Success!"""

","Borat is one of the most outrageous films I have ever seen. No question about it. It has so much offensive things about it, and that is why it caused so much controversy back in 2006. Sacha Baron Cohen is one of the bravest actors in Hollywood, for him to set himself in these situations and for him to be willing to do all of this. his character of Borat is so well done, and certainly one of the most memorable characters in recent film history. I did not always enjoy Borat. When I first saw it I did not like it. But it grew on me, since it obviously is very funny, and very entertaining and you cannot stop starring at the screen!

"SubZeroMK","10","0","0","30 June 2009"," The best comedy of 2006 and for 2007.
","Why for 2007? because there wasn't anything funnier than Borat up until Step Brothers.<br/><br/>Borat combines real comedy with real people and real reactions. I mean he's no stranger in most of Europe. He does make a show called ""Da Ali G Show"" which features his 3 characters, Ali G: An idiotic wanna-be ""gangster"" who tries to impersonate the lifestyle of a gang banger, with very little intelligence, but still very funny. Bruno, a homosexual fashion critic who's Austrian and loves gossip. Borat, a immigrant to other countries, comes from Khazakstan, and pretends to act like a complete tool in his interviews by acting the way he was raised in his country with his traditional customs.<br/><br/>They all have three films too, for each character. Well, Bruno is a few days away from release. But his Borat character is probably the best one, ever.<br/><br/>He travels to U.S. ""and"" A to make a documentary about American customs and culture to ""make benefit of Khazakstan"" . He looks on his TV one night and notices his love of his life, Pamela Anderson playing the lovely Baywatch babe, CJ. He sets his journey to find this woman and make ""explosion on her stomach"" after marrying her. Throughout the journey, he continues his documentary in many of the famous states in America such as Texas and Atlanta, but ultimately stopping at California to meet Pamela Anderson.<br/><br/>In his journey, he interviews real people, real American citizens who have an opinion or two about Borat or his and their idealistic views of class, race, pride, and women. The reason this is so funny is because of the reactions of people being filmed. They just don't know what to do in those situations, so they try to defuse it with their emotions and facial gestures.<br/><br/>A few shows or clips on the internet have done this sort of thing, but it was all scripted, and most of it came from MTV. So, wherever there's a scripted reality show, there's MTV. The movie exploits Borat's findings in America. One of the funniest parts was the church convention. You'd see these crazy Christians on stage hollering about Jesus saving a troubled person by shouting out all sorts of gibberish that you'd hear from a mental patient in the hospital. So, I guess in a way, this film does exploit some of America's hidden and outrageous culture, and does a very good job at it.<br/><br/>After the movie, a few people wanted to sue the film-makers for lying to them about what the project was really about. I can understand why they're mad. Maybe they should of thought of that before saying something stupid on camera. A few people in Romania, my home country were pretty angry about the film, saying it exploited them in a very bad way. It did, but there's no reason why they should sue. This movie gets a solid 10/10 for pure comedy realism. Go get this on DVD if you haven't. I can still watch this film over again and have even more laughs than before."

On his way he meets various people and finds himself in various strange situations which we should find funny and fall off our chairs laughing. I didn't. Most of the jokes/gags/situations/whatever you want to call them looked so forced, I wondered if Cohen really has to make it all so over the top and try so hard to be funny.

I do see though why some people would find it offensive.<br/><br/>I am a fan of comedy, and I don't see using stereotypes, sex or whatever else that people may find offensive, as something unsuitable, as long as it is used in an intelligent way. Here the envelope is pushed too far, and the film just loses out, because I think that it had the potential to be a cult classic.

"johnnyboyz","7","0","0","23 June 2009"," Still pretty funny and as long as all copies of films like Beerfest exist, still relevant.
","I like the Borat film, I like it a lot. In some regards, it is anti-thesis to all those crass, American produced 'comedies' that usually, often predominantly, rely on limp portrayals of Europeans as a source of humour. This might come in the form of the endless disregarding of people from many-a nation in 2006's Beerfest; to the loose, sexy Eastern European girls in the American Pie films and even onto the weak, intermittent representations of Europeans in EuroTrip – which may have had a lot of good stuff going on around all the sloppy other content, but that doesn't excuse what it presents us at the worst of times. Borat is the film that presents a similarly shocking Eastern-European-come-Western-Asian stereotype in Borat Sagdiyev (Baron Cohen) and exploits what little knowledge genuine Americans really have about the places, indeed the continent, that they lampoon so often.<br/><br/>I suppose it is a fighting fire with fire, a using of a stereotype or a negative representation in order to actually uncover the larger levels of tunnel vision some American's have on the world around them. But rather than just produce an out-and-out film in which American characters are presented in a typically naive or even stupid manner; the makers here have used real people, saying unscripted things, to act as characters instead and it is infinitely more funny than any low-brow, crass and desperate visual joke-come-representation as seen in the said films.<br/><br/>Borat and his film-making partner Azamat Bagatov (Davitian) travel through America, specifically to California from New York after Borat realises someone called Pamela Anderson exists, getting into mis-adventures, scraps, scrapes and undergoing a brilliant mock-journey of self discovery. Borat is the ultimate fish-out-of-water, and yet he dominates his respective locations when interviewing and speaking to other Americans. If the Kazakhs find offence in Borat, than it would have initially been born out of Borat's naivety to his surroundings in mistaking an elevator for a hotel room and a toilet for a wash basin. The specific size of a room and purpose of everyday-for-us appliances act as reasons to chuckle at Kazakhs. There is also an opening ten or so minute segment in which Borat's supposed home-land is put across as less-than desirable.<br/><br/>But from a certain point on in, the laughs snowball at the expense of Americans: a desperate car-salesman really wanting to unload an automobile on a seemingly unsuspecting foreigner; a gun shop salesman trying to offload a gun by exclaiming it's especially good for killing Jews; a rodeo gathering that express grossly mis-judged statements on the world and those around them whilst quite clearly in the presence of rolling cameras and an R.V. full of kids, the very audience the films mentioned in the first paragraph are aimed at, equally displaying a shocking disregard to most things around them.<br/><br/>While the things and statements most of Borat's victims come up with are deeply offensive, it is the very notion someone would be willing to utter these things on camera to complete strangers that is the most distressing thing. If we laugh, we laugh at the audacity more than the statements; if we laugh at the feminists, who themselves might well be victims of discrimination or prejudice in the past, we laugh at their reactions that someone would be so-bold as to say the things Borat says to them; things that I would not assume, in any way, reflect personal feelings on the author's behalf.<br/><br/>The important thing is that the author's are additionally able to laugh at themselves when, in a particular interview with a coloured politician who is introduced rather unnervingly via voice-over, uncovers a homosexual encounter Borat recently and unwittingly engaged in. Interestingly, the few locations Baron Cohen is unable to force reactions are in the form of a motel run by an elderly Jewish couple that quickly turns into a bit of a horror parody as they dare eat the offerings given to them by the couple, as well as an extremely tolerant group of individuals in the Deep South that Borat has dinner with. He manages to insult the host's wife and mistake a 'retiree' for a 'retard' before finally facing the fact he must flee on account the authorities are called. As very raw and very real moments of situation comedy, they work an absolute treat.<br/><br/>The film's final third revolves around a would-be romance with a certain Pamela Anderson, someone Borat is so dense that he initially assumes her Baywatch character to be someone of real life flesh and blood. When Borat does hit the skids and the chips are down, the film reels off into a mock sense of 'where one belongs' and that friendship is actually a really important thing and, despite being in the most powerful nation in the world, it's important to remember where one's roots lie getting across a sense it's easy to be seduced by surroundings and short-term goals when you have so much riding for you, initially. The pastiche is a wonderful send up of other recent comedies' final acts, After School Special and Superbad in particular, in which the characters realise their goal is elusive and that they must respect what they have.<br/><br/>Borat is a much better film than Ali G Indahouse, a film that takes rude, crude and low-brow material and turns it around so that those making an absolute packet out of it can be sent up. With the imminent release of Brüno, Baron Cohen is gaining in confidence and taking his characters out of more Western Euopean nations before unleashing them at Americans. The very effeminate personality of the character twinned with that very distinct but very deliberate German accent could spell trouble for some, cracking entertainment for others."

","Borat (Sasha Baron Cohen) is a TV broadcaster in Kazakhstan takes a trip to the United States with his roly-poly friend Azamat. His mission: To experience the greatest country on earth and acquaint its citizens with the folkways of Kazakhstan.<br/><br/>But first he guides the viewer through his home town, all its glories on display -- the cows in the living room, the incestuous relations, the ""oldest woman in city"" who is 47 and looks twice that. This technique is used throughout the film. As Borat and Azamat perambulate, there is a third person always present but never on camera, the photographer who is recording all these adventures on film.<br/><br/>The structure is by its nature episodic. There is New York City, where Borat tries to greet pedestrians on the street with a Kazakh kiss on the cheeks and they threaten to emasculate him or rearrange his features. Then there is Washington, DC. Then Atlanta and Dallas, where Borat visits a curio shop that carries items like a bumper sticker with a Confederate flag and the slogan: ""Secession -- Because It's the Right Thing To Do."" Complications arise. Borat happens to catch ""Baywatch"" or ""Beverly Hills 12345"" or whatever it is and falls in love with Pamela Anderson. His pronunciation of her name -- Pa-MELLA -- is in synch with his English syntax, of which you may get some hint by reading the subtitle of the movie. He is determined to wed her in the Kazakh manner, by kidnapping her. This leads to what impressed me as the funniest scene in the movie. Pamela Anderson is signing her book at a store and Borat joins the line of admirers. When he reaches her, he fawns all over her and produces what looks like a white tablecloth embossed with roses. He lovingly shows it to her and explains that it was made by his wife back in Kazakhstan. But it's not a blanket or a tablecloth. It's a kind of canvas dufflebag and he shouts with the pride of a successful fisherman as he throws it violently over her head, packs her over his shoulder, and tries to run away with her.<br/><br/>It is, at times, a very funny film, right down to the credits and the subtitles. Yet there was something distasteful about it too. It's not a particularly good-natured film. Cohen wrote it himself and some of the scenes are up-dated slapstick -- two naked men, one of them impossibly obese, wrestling at a public meeting. It's outrageous but it's not exactly clever. Then, too, Cohen seems to have taken aim at people and notions he personally finds offensive. Christian evangelicals come in for ridicule when they speak in tongues and go through faith healings. Homosexuals get it too. And he announces to a large rally, ""I support your war of terror in Iraq!"" (Some targets deserve to be skewered.) The only people who seem thoroughly decent and polite are an elderly African-American lady and a Jewish couple who run a Bed and Breakfast place. Borat is an anti-Semitic and he covertly spits out the food they serve him. I'd have found the comedy more satisfying if it dealt with the politically correct Thought Police or something. Or militant minority groups and their leaders. Spread it around a little bit, you know? One bunch of loonies is as silly as another. His victims are safe, easy to mock. (How did he miss the Miss American pageant?)<br/><br/>The underlying theme of contempt is not dismissable, but what we see is diverting and amusing enough and we can thank the Great Jub Jub that at no point does Cohen treat the material as serious enough to turn it into a platitudinous sermon on tolerance, understanding, and love. That's one big pitfall that every attempt at comedy must skirt, and ""Borat"" does so successfully."

","Borat is a Kazakh. Kazakhstan is a huge land mass east of the British Channel. Kazakhs are like cossacks in ancient times: Backward. Stupid. Violent. And morally corrupt to the bone - if not entirely void of any morals. It's altogether different from the Insular Culture that developed in England and spread from there to some other parts of the world, e. g. the U S of A - a beacon of hope which dazzles the less fortunate peoples of this earth. Borat goes to the US of A with every immigrant's dream: to learn the way how to get rich. His plans and aims are hazy, his determination pretty fierce.<br/><br/>Once arrived, Borat holds up a mirror in front of the US of A's face. For some reason he has to daub that mirror with fresh feces every morning. I did not really understand why this was necessary  but wait, of course: this movie wants to SHOCK! For that reason it takes recourse of some of the oldest, stalest and unfunnyest juvenile practical jokes there are. And this sinks the movie to the depths of low grade crap  and makes it a commercial success.<br/><br/>The main message of this movie is: if you're surprised, you're dumb. While there is some validity to that statement, it does not add value to a work of art. It is just not entertaining to listen to a guy say I was in construction, now I am retired"", and Borat react, aha, you are a retard""  and going on and on about it for minutes, like this is something really, really funny. He gets so lost in all those rather disorganized and ill paced pranks that there isn't a true conclusion to this movie, except that it's individual contacts that count (important, but treated as a side effect here).<br/><br/>It's interesting that most of the Americans who come into contact with Borat acquit themselves quite well. Americans, so it seems, are not easily dazed  especially when they want to sell something (a car, a gun, lessons in courtesy) they are quite willing to swallow a healthy dose of pranks and verbal abuse with amazing patience.<br/><br/>I am a Kazakh myself and I am aware that the message of this movie is mainly directed at people who are firmly embedded in the Insular Culture. But out here we watch it all the same, because we so much admire (and ape) pretty much everything that reaches us from the West. The style I so much criticized before has the effect that the satirical bullets ricochet and leave neither wound nor impact."

","Borat is really one of the most offensive/raunchy/hilarious movies of all time. This movie really is a huge step up from Baron Cohen's Ali G Indahouse movie several years earlier. That movie included a real cast and was an actual written movie. This on the other hand was Sacha Baron Cohen going around in his Borat persona playing hoaxes on unsuspecting people. Even though he did this to these people with their consent and even though he wrote some offensives things into this it was an extremely hilarious movie. Some may not agree with me, some on the other hand might agree. All in all it was a movie that will most likely be talked about for a long time to come. This may even become a cult classic someday."

","Borat is a brilliantly funny film, one of the funniest I have seen in a long time. Sacha Baron Cohen carries it singularly on his shoulders with exceptional ease.<br/><br/>It is said that most of the sequences in the film are real gags played out on real people at real places. I can only describe as amazing the end result that has come out of such experimental film-making. It takes imagination, conviction and courage to do something like that. The film does look like a series of gags but that does not take away its charm.<br/><br/>There are many obvious ethical questions that can be raised on the film. The questions will make for interesting debate. But such a debate will be surely one-sided in Kazakhistan. However, I see Borat more as a film making fun of an average American's intelligence and awareness rather than of the Kazakhistani people or their culture.<br/><br/>A must watch."
"christhecat","9","0","0","1 November 2008"," Painfully Funny, It mocks the whole of the Human Race, and We Deserve it
","Yes, it's offensive. Yes, it belittles Jews, Gypsies/Roma, Kazaks, Uzbeks, Eastern Europe in general, and Americans. Yes there is lots of juvenile toilet humor.<br/><br/>And yes, it raked in huge box office receipts the first week, and rave reviews.<br/><br/>On one level ""Borat"" is mo more offensive than the old Candid Camera TV show-- it has just taken it to a new level (nobody ever complained about the gags on Candid camera being ""staged""-- they were OBVIOUSLY staged). To enjoy the movie you have to relax, put your ego in check, and give a little willful ignorance to what is being presented; if you can read Cyrillic alphabet you know that about half of the ""Russian/Kazak"" text presented is complete gibberish, but I didn't let that bother me.<br/><br/>On another level ""Borat"" is deliberately offensive, tricking Americans into saying things they probably wouldn't say in other public forums (the rodeo organizer clearly stating how he'd like to kill all the homosexuals, or the entire scene with the frat-boys)-- are we offended by what Borat says, or by what WE say when he goads us? The Americans who come off the best are the ones who are easy going and not offended: the driving instructor being the best example. I got a kick out of the New Yorkers threatening to punch Borat -- I laugh, and yet I would probably act exactly the same.<br/><br/>Possibly the only thing that truly offended me was the extra-movie information on the Romanian village they used for the Kazak scenes, knowing that they are desperately poor and received little in compensation made me disappointed in the producers. They were mocked no more than the Americans in the film, but kicking someone when they're down isn't something I approve of."
"Chance2000esl","9","0","0","21 August 2008"," A Savage Satire on Prejudice and Stereotyping!
","Sasha Cohen lets us know early in the film that what he says is not what we, as enlightened humanists, should believe when he seeks out a 'joke teacher' wanting to learn 'Not' jokes (""You're so handsome---NOT!""). This whole movie is a ""NOT!"" spewing an endless sequence of racial and cultural prejudices and stereotypes right in our face. He's throwing a hideous mirror at us with scenes such as 'The Running of the Jews,' reminding us of the persecution of the gypsies and Jews in Europe (particularly in Poland-- much of his Khazak language is actually Polish). But he's making us laugh, in a kind of sardonic way, at mankind's inhumanity to itself.<br/><br/>His first target, then, is anti-Semitism. He uses humor to remind us of the bleak, dark world we live in, in which there are peoples who want to destroy Israel and the Jewish people. Given the endless tirades against many cultural nations, peoples and life styles, we can expand This World of Bigotry to genocidal wars wherever they are currently taking place. As he exhorts the enthusiastic rodeo crowd in the U.S. against Iraq, before he sings the American National Anthem, ""President Bush will drink the blood of the Iraqis!""<br/><br/>When he finally does meet some Jews, they are anything but the stereotypes he was been reviling us with -- they are merely a kindly little old man and his wife offering him sandwiches at their Bed and Breakfast Inn. With off the wall stereotyping, he and Azamat think that the two Jews are shape shifters who can change into cockroaches and can be appeased by having money thrown at them. As other reviewers here have pointed out, Nazi propaganda films often showed Jews as cockroaches.<br/><br/>But hey! We real people also live in a world in which genocide and ethnic cleansing still go on; a world in which female circumcision is still practiced; a world in which 'woman is the n----r of the world'; a world in which slavery, though illegal, is still practiced with women and children the victims. It's not that 'human history is a nightmare from which we are just waking up,' it still is a nightmare!<br/><br/>Borat spouts all of these types of prejudice, and even worse, meets Americans who agree with him. He tries to lighten the film with toilet and sexual humor, and even with an amazing nude fight with Azamat. But let us not forget the real message of this movie: he's trying to wake us up and show us the world in which we live as it really is. His viewpoint is disguised, like himself, and presented in a humorous way. This puts him up on the level of a Mark Twain, Kurt Vonnegut or Stanislaw Lem (also, coincidentally, from Poland).<br/><br/>Borat: Funny but bleak. I give it a 9."
"bahaynicarol","Null","0","0","5 June 2008"," phobias and biases
","Borat Sagdiyev (Sacha Baron Cohen) is a television personality in Kazakhstan. His government sends him to the United States of America to learn culture and report about the ""greatest country in the world.""<br/><br/>However, Borat's naive-stupid sexism and colonial mind bring him more trouble than cultural acceptance. Borat's disinterest in pursuing their assignment as he diverts to finding and marrying Pamela Anderson provides the narrative impetus for the Borat adventure in the American subcultures.<br/><br/>Not like us? Borat is a Saddam look-a-like, impoverished and chauvinist. He is a graphic example of a man trapped in his own world of phobias and biases while attempting to learn ""civilization"" from the ""great nation of America.""<br/><br/>Poking on our phobias, the film allows the audience to experience learning together with Borat. It becomes a powerful tool to show how the great cultural empire and land of freedom is likewise enmeshed in its own prejudices and cultural moral contradictions.<br/><br/>It allows us to look at ourselves through the Borat mirror and realize that we all have prejudices, that we all tend to 'judge a book by its cover' -- even if we claim to be civilized members of society who advocate equality and humaneness.<br/><br/>I admit that before seeing the movie, I feared if I had the persevering tolerance for whatever racist or sexist joke I will hear from Borat. Later on, I saw myself laughing at all the jokes that Borat throws at his audiences while realizing my own prejudices in the process.<br/><br/>The film spurs a popular, worldwide cultural debate that crosses human-made boundaries of religion, nation, culture, societal norms and standards as well as bases of discrimination such as class, race and ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender, work and so on. It asks us to see ourselves. Realize and laugh at our prejudiced tendencies. Across cultures, we love to hate those we see as prejudiced against us but we refuse to see and hear our own prejudices.<br/><br/>At the film's conclusion, Borat brought prostitute Luenelle to Kazakhstan as his wife. All his funny talk about prostitutes and sex in sexist tones did not really affect his perception of Luenelle as a full human being. Luenelle's work was not a problem at all. This is where the filmmakers' intent became very clear: Turn away from discrimination and really see all people as equal, including Borat, gays, blacks and prostitutes.<br/><br/>Changing this world necessitates that we all look at ourselves first and know our own phobias, biases and impositions on how fellow humans should look, act or speak. The film's approach in exposing prejudice across cultures is brave and effective. Choosing the American subcultures as templates of cultural trappings in many parts of the world simply fits.<br/><br/>Every adult should see this film. Anyone too ""Boratophobic"" to do so should not expect that this phobic and conflict-ridden world will change within his/her lifetime."

","This film takes the 'comedy of awkwardness / embarrassment' to its ultimate limit. Can xenophobia, racism, sexism, toilet humour and hairy naked men wrestling be funny? Oh yes.<br/><br/>You do need to know (as the girlfriend didn't...) that SBC's shtick is to interview unwitting (ideally stuffy and media hungry) people in character, as he did with Ali G etc. Doing this gets a laugh both because the character is so utterly crass and awful, and because the people he meets react a certain way with an apparently naive interviewer and a camera in front of them. Give some people enough rope and sure enough they'll hang themselves.<br/><br/>On the whole I'd say America comes off well from the whole thing - though certain Americans make themselves look crass, ignorant and offensive. Time and again people are courteous, tolerant and patient to an unbelievable degree - eg the driving instructor and the politeness coach. Add to this that SBC is a master of physical comedy and has absolutely no shame and you have a superb comedy film.<br/><br/>So much of the media is polished, predictable, corporatized, PC, gutless rubbish - look at the other releases this week, eg Santa Clause 3! - thank god someone can come along and produce a film like this."

Is it offensive to all the other ethnic groups it supposedly offends? I guess it depends on one's individual perspective. However, when a stereotype is twisted and pushed until it is a distorted, funhouse mirror of reality it no longer reflects the object of ridicule, but those who hold those beliefs. <br/><br/>Borat is the most offensive and the most brilliant film I have seen since Monty Python's ""Meaning of Life"" and ""Life of Brian"" <br/><br/>I give it a big ...

I just saw the movie tonight, and I can't say that I've laughed that consistently throughout a movie since Monty Python's Holy Grail. Sacha Baron Cohen is brilliant, and I hope he makes a truckload of cash for creating what is one of the most daring and ingenious characters I've seen in a long, long time. Mr. Cohen has precisely what it takes to make great satirical comedy: brains, a self-deprecating sense of humor, and lots and lots of chutzpah. He is exactly what we need right now.<br/><br/>If you like Monty Python, or, more recently and more analagously, Christopher Guest's work (This is Spinal Tap, Waiting for Guffman, Best in Show), then Borat is simply a must see.

From the US to Britian to Kazakstan, he is able to make fun of people's intellectual flaws to their face and come out on top by playing the whole ""slow, dumb, confused foreigner"" to perfection. Balky has nothing on Borat. I would be surprised if this movie does not open #1 in the box office as the word is spreading fast that this creation is well worth the ticket price even in 2006. Congrats to all who played a role in bringing this film to the big screen. Sacha please bring the Ali G show back to the the US soon, we are dying for Season 3!"
"saltywounds","10","6","20","9 September 2006"," I saw Borat last night. It was unbelievable.
","This movie was gut-split-tingly amazing. I saw it last night at the Toronto Film Festival and will never forget it. I won't give too much away, but the entire film centres on Borat coming to the United States to learn the culture and report back to his home country.<br/><br/>I think this movie may have an impact on future films is that this movie unique as it is shot with real people as extras not knowing they are appearing in a movie, or that Sacha Cohen is in character. You get the feeling sometimes that people may suspect it, and perhaps a couple are even in on it, but it doesn't really matter at all.<br/><br/>It is almost as if you are watching a documentary - and ironically, Michael Moore was at the screening, and one wonders if this film is inspired slightly by some of his documentaries.<br/><br/>Other times it is extremely similar to ""reality"" movies like Jack-Ass - but as opposed to quick disgusting gags, this film has a story-line and characters you get to know and love and cheer for, (even if at the time of the shooting of the film they were unaware they were one). <br/><br/>All of these elements are packed into a movie that is about an outsider trying to fit in, and reminds you of the old eighties sitcom Perfect Strangers (Is it just me, or is Borat not a more fleshed out Balki who has yet to find his cousin Larry?).<br/><br/>It begs the question of how he gets away with it, and showing the faces of people without being sued. My only guess is that he has them sign a waver before he begins shooting... but that's another topic altogether.<br/><br/>All and all, see this movie, as I would put a lot of money on the fact that it will be the most talked about film this year, shatter many records, and make a mint. <br/><br/>See it first and feel like the cool kid - like I do right now."

The movie is a devastating attack on racism and sexism in America, while still being extraordinarily funny, because Borat himself is so convincingly clueless about it all.

","I went to see this film today, returned about an hour ago and am still laughing. This simply is one of the funniest films I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Sacha Baron Cohen manages to stay in his role of Kazakh reporter Borat through an entire, absolutely crazy journey through America. Some of the things filmed most certainly are acted, but many encouters with people are not. There are so many highlights that it is difficult to name anything specific, especially without spoiling anything. Suffice to say that Cohen really had to do incredibly nasty (and hilarious) things in order to make this movie, and manages to make a funny moment from something as simple as entering an elevator.<br/><br/>In addition, while making a total fool of himself, Cohen/Borat also manages to show deeply-rooted problems in Western society, for instance by provoking incredibly anti-Semitic and anti-homosexual comments from quite ordinary people.<br/><br/>Granted, people from Kazakhstan might not like the way their country's lifestyle is depicted. And granted, many people will not like this (rather shocking) kind of humor.

","There's not much else to say. As Manhola Dargis says in the NY Times, ""the 19th-century German thinker August Bebel observed, anti-Semitism is the socialism of fools, a truism Mr. Baron Cohen has embraced with a vengeance..."" If you don't ""get it"", then it's not for you---but for everyone else, this is perhaps the most brilliant satire and raging comedy of all time. It took me a little while to settle in to the film, mostly because I was already familiar with Borat from HBO and frankly, the trailers on TV and the Web give away much of the introduction. As the story picks up speed and frenzy, Borat's clueless charm, if you can call it that, takes on full form. I am reminded of the late-great Peter Sellers' own Inspector Clousseau. The bumbling idiocy has that kind of familiarity. Borat isn't out to hurt anyone---he just wants to discover America. And discover it, he does. Marching through the South, Borat comes across all manner of insular, racist citizens going about their daily lives. He leaves a trail of comedic tears as he lays waste to the unsuspecting victims. What a joy to be along for the ride. You'll wince, you'll flinch, you'll gasp for air. Great comedy like this doesn't come around often enough."

He says and asks things that you can't believe, some of which make the unsuspecting interviewee squirm, and some of the audience as well..at least, me.<br/><br/>But I've not read such glowing reviews for a movie since...""The Departed"" came out a couple of weeks ago. A reviewer said he's seen it three times and plans on seeing it again this weekend. Reviewers rarely gush over a movie. I wouldn't have been surprised if he said he'd like to kiss the hem of Sacha's garment.<br/><br/>So I saw the first show on West 23rd Street..minutes ago.<br/><br/>The movie is hilarious. Not consistently, but hilarious enough to recommend. There are a couple of dry spots and some of the jokes do not get the desired effect. However, the stuff that is funny is very funny. And when its not very funny, its deliriously funny.<br/><br/>Borat is an innocent. He does not know what he is talking about. Until he is channel surfing and sees the image of Pamela Anderson on ""Baywatch"" and then his trip to America, his entire life, has new meaning. He and his companion/producer leave NYC immediately and head for California, via Atlanta. He meets all kinds of people, most of which are scary as hell. The ones he does not humiliate, humiliate themselves, unintentionally. The ones he charms would not recognize charm if it had a neon sign. A lot of the trip goes wrong and he has a disagreement with his companion/producer and they part ways. He has no passport, no money, and accidentally burns his ticket back to his country (don't expect me to remember that particular place or how to spell it) so he's at a total loss..more than usual. He ends up in California and meets up with his companion and they find that, miracle of miracles, Pam is signing autographs for her fans. He can't even propose marriage to a total stranger correctly. But he ends up with one of the only decent people he meets, who, by the way, is the only person he meets that I could even imagine having a cup of coffee with. This country is SCARY. Land of the free my ***.<br/><br/>Again, I recommend the movie. Highly. Several of the 'user comments' on this site seem to have missed the point. Their loss. For the rest of us, enjoy enjoy enjoy.

","This piece of filmatography can not even be called a movie, but it is definitely breaking grounds in more ways then one.<br/><br/>If you look at its surface it's a stupid attempt of making fun out of cultural differences, but if you look at it critically (which I'm afraid the vast majority of people - anywhere in the world - can not), you will get a very interesting profile of how a developed nation looks at a nation they believe to be undeveloped.<br/><br/>OK, they could have left the naked wrestling scene out, as it is nothing else then pointless and grouse, but the rest of the movie is playing on stereotypes, which generally really do apply.<br/><br/>The main point of the movie, which many fail to see, is the idea of American arrogance. Because the guy is from a foreign country, which once belonged to the Soviet Union and is still a poor country, not to mention that it is a country most people in US don't know anything about (except that it belongs to the less developed part of the world), they are prepared to believe just about anything. And here it the catch. Borat seems to be a complete idiot, but since he's from Kazahstan, the people he contacts with, find this to be perfectly natural (completely disregarding the fact that he is supposedly a journalist payed by their government to do a job - which would have to mean he is competent to do it and would need a quite high level of education to even get the job). This is the mirror this movie sets up for the US people - how they treat others, for whom they believe are poorer and less worth. And the higher a person is on the social scale, the less they think of the foreigner from an obscure country (they even believe he doesn't know how to use a toilet).<br/><br/>It is true, the film is showing this in a abusing way, especially to the country of Kazahstan, but more over it is a film, which criticizes the arrogant US superiority complex towards the rest of the world (one which I have experienced many times to be true).<br/><br/>The problem is, that people in US in general don't travel abroad all that much, yet they presume (even if they have no real grounds to presume that) that people abroad live a worse life and have less, thus they judge most of the nations outside the US based on the stereotypes they have at home (example: a German is a guy from an ex eastern Germany who was always oppressed by the communist regime and can't even have a radio or a TV, so every German would give a limb to be able to have an old B/W TV an American is selling at a yard sale). I know, it seems harsh, but unfortunately that's the picture many Americans have and that's the thing this movie was making fun of."

On the other hand, it is interesting how Borat's culture is different from ours. Borat Sagdiyev (played by Sacha Baron Cohen) assumed that Pamela would marry him. Mr. Sagdiyev was doing his ""documentary"" to learn about our culture. If I were going to a foreign country, I would learn all I could about that country BEFORE I would go there: it's culture, customs, lifestyle, etiquette, and protocol. I would hire a etiquette or protocol coach, who specializes in international customs, to help me be acquainted to the country's way of life. That way I would know the proper way to say hello.

I'm glad I only went to see it at the Beverly Fairfax ""all seats $3"" theater.<br/><br/>And, let me get his right, this from what I hear ""deeply religious"" Jewish man is supposed to be showing how OTHER people are racist with this film? Uh... OK, whatever! I really think the film was about as subversive as what Israel just finished doing to Lebanon. Although the main point of it is simply for the audience to look down at a parade of cretins for 90 minutes and feel superior. I mean it was so not funny. Yes kids screaming at the bear was funny. ""these 2 are hot, this one not so much"" was mean funny. ""what kind of dog is that"" regarding the tortoise was cute mean funny.<br/><br/>but his masturbating outside Victoria's secret, kissing his sister, almost all the other gags, the painfully obviously fake set up ones with people on the street threatening him, so lamely executed, were just atavistic, just like a total consciousness lowering excersize for the public. let's all demean ourselves. isn't this fun. and the fact that an ethnicity a people are like the occasion for it... well, so what right? who cares? exactly. that's exactly what the film seems to be going for.<br/><br/>and what did work in Ali G didn't here cause poor Sascha is in such a hurry to tell this ""story"" such as it is, this road film literally has ground to cover, that nobody really gets a chance to do anything interesting in the way of self immolation. I mean we get the reaction of a politician over hearing cheese came from Borat's wife's tit. Oh that's really deep, doesn't that get you thinking about the state of the world. The rodeo scene was a highlight certainly but I don't see anything really shocking about the fact that people at war can be bloodthirsty. especially when you consider many of the people in that arena might have lost sons and brothers to this war.<br/><br/>I recently read an item about how among the many lawsuits filed in the wake of the movie one is on behalf of the people from the opening of the film who were told they were participating in a documentary about poverty where they live. Guess they were ""punked"" cause in reality they lent themselves to a ""comedy"" depicting them as incestuous, bestiality loving sub humans. Despicable.<br/><br/>It is utterly demoralizing that fatuous people admire this movie as is supposedly ""holds up a mirror to the US"" as they look down on the people appearing on screen who were simply lied to and made fun of as they tried to cope with processing what was going on as it began to dawn on them that they were being lied to. What really frightens me is that complacent audiences watch this and totally have no problem with the most pernicious elements, the dehumanization of Arabs by Sascha Cohen. It's the people who enjoy this movie who are, frankly, the contemptible fools.<br/><br/>Laugh while you can. Gore Vidal said it so well in an interview he gave for the LA Weekly. ""One day the Arabs will find their Saladin and come after us and it's not going to be pretty."""
"btalman","9","4","12","11 November 2006"," Amusing, but shocking
","The movie starts off with some quite shocking scenes which make the viewer wonder what society is turning into. Being a European I consider New York, or any of the other 'progressive' US metropolitan area's as liberal and easy going. The first half hour of the movie was like a shock and awe campaign. If this is how people react to someone acting friendly, how do they act when someone is not being so 'friendly'. And NY isn't representative for the US, this was quite a culture-shock to me. not wanting to generalize but when people in NY act like this how is it in the rest of the US (and Europe too, since society hardens to the point that even looking at someone might get you beaten up). The other part, luckily, focuses on comedy, but not enough comedy to get over the shock from the first part. Borat stirs up the debate about cultural relativism. you can just beat up anyone different, but also go too far in accepting anything weird or, as shown in one scene, go ahead with life and just ignore anything 'strange'. Thumbs up for Cohen, would love to see another movie like this but, on the other hand, this movie is a one of a kind, copying an idea like this will most likely result in a movie not as good as the original."
"catbunwars","5","4","12","6 November 2006"," Call me crazy, but.........
","I don't believe this movie deserves the praise it is receiving. I saw the film a few days ago, with very high expectations. I had heard about this movie nearly half a year ago, and after seeing the preview I knew that I HAD to see this movie. Amongst my group of friends, I was the only one who had heard of this movie a long time before it's release. It was my idea to go see the movie because my friends had only heard of it a few days before the release.<br/><br/>Near the beginning, I was laughing my ass off. Cohen performs as Borat perfectly, and at times he is extremely amusing. But, near the end of this film I began to grow weary of the constant crude jokes and sexual references. Don't get me wrong, I'm as tolerant of crude humor as the next guy (I love films like Austin Powers, Bruce Almighty, Anchorman, 40 Year Old Virgin, etc.). But this film is simply over the top. It achieves its goal in attempting to become one of the most crude and disgusting films made to this day, but overall it's just an excuse to show two men with too much pubic hair rubbing their balls in each others faces. After a certain scene, I stopped laughing completely. It had become too much for me to bear.<br/><br/>Plus, I have reason to believe that this film is receiving most of its praise because of the social commentary on American life. Yes there are problems with America (PLENTY of them), but I don't want to have these issues shoved in my face, especially when they are over exaggerated, particularly about racism and hate in the south. Being born and raised in the south, I have come to hate the redneck regime that reigns supreme in this region, but to display the entire region as feeling this way is simply ridiculous. There are intelligent people here, and were not all just a bunch of yokels who hate everyone but white people. Geez, there's racism everywhere people, not just in the south.<br/><br/>Overall, Borat is a funny film, but enough is enough, and I could've done without some of the humor in this film."
"weissjeffm","9","4","12","5 November 2006"," Funniest film of the year
","In terms of viewers of this film, there are two groups of people - those who get the joke, and those who are the butt of the joke.<br/><br/>Sascha Baron Cohen doesn't actually believe that Kahakhstan is so backwards, nor that Jews are evil money grubbing killers (he's Jewish himself after all). He's making fun of Americans who do. Borat fits right into their stereotypes of how backward faraway nations are (and conversely how America's way is the only way). The Americans featured in the film were all too easily convinced that he's real.<br/><br/>I think the central message of this film is that Americans are isolated and ignorant of what the rest of the world is like. It's spot-on and it's presented in the most hilarious possible way."
"dfranzen70","8","4","12","5 November 2006"," Watching glorious Borat movie yes!
","If you like side-splitting hilarity that's based on stuff happening to unsuspecting people (otherwise known as rubes or marks), then Borat (and its unwieldy full title) is perfect for you.<br/><br/>Borat is a mockumentary starring the title character (Sacha Baron Cohen), a television reporter in Kazakhstan who journeys to the United States in an effort to explain the ""greatest country"" to his audiences back home. Zany hijinks ensue.<br/><br/>Borat begins his trek in New York, but when he happens upon an episode of Baywatch in his hotel room. Ah, he spies the luscious Pamela Anderson in her role as CJ the Awesome Lifeguard. Well! That does it for the general-interest piece he was gonna do - he (and his cameraman, and his producer) is off to California! Let the sojourn begin! Now, bear in mind that (apparently) the interactions Borat has with various Americans, of all shapes, sizes, and colors, are completely unscripted on the part of the naive citizenry. Borat travels to a rodeo, where he ""sings"" the Kazakh national anthem to - get this - the tune of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" and to the Deep South, where he receives etiquette lessons and attends a social gathering. He and his crew even get lost in Atlanta, where Borat not only gets directions but also some helpful hints on sartorial goodness from some locals.<br/><br/>The jokes and jibs always seem accidental, as if Borat is simply this unknowing foreigner who is not wise in American ways. At the same time, the proverbial seedy underbelly of Americans (that is, unseen bigotry) is gleefully, manically exposed; one gets the feeling that those who are exposed have no idea what's happening. They're just being themselves.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie hinges on Cohen's performance, naturally. If Borat's sexist, racist, anti-Semitic, boorish-yet-innocent persona grates, then the movie's lost to you. And there's Borat in a nutshell - he's all these ugly, nasty things, but he doesn't know he is. Why, he's just Borat, a typical Kazakh peasant. He can't be expected to know of our mores and rules, can he? Why, of course not. (In one memorable exchange, Borat is aghast that women in America can choose with whom they wish to have sex!) There will be some who simply won't like this movie. Those people either don't get the idea of the Borat character or don't have much of a sense of humor to begin with. If Bert from Sesame Street were real, he'd probably wander out of the theater after watching Borat with Ernie, shaking his head, wondering what it was all about. Whereas Ernie would be laughing his furry red ass off."

","OK, for starters this is the most political incorrect, insulting and sometimes even disgusting movie you will see these days in the cinemas. Then why the hell did Ã¬ rate it this high?<br/><br/>Well first of all the movie shows the large differences between people in the US (or at least their vision on society). Secondky, Sacha Cohen makes fun of everyone (some more than other, but anyhow). And last but not least it's just a damn good movie; The best comedy I've attended in years. During the movie people started clapping for a fantastic scene (this happened more than once), and on the other moments people where laughing 'till they had to BLEEP their pants.<br/><br/>Anyhow if you go and see this movie, just take a good laugh and forget about being polite for 90 minutes, otherwise the 'movie-film' will lose it's effect.<br/><br/>enjoy"
"a_ngox","9","4","12","4 November 2006"," US-and-A ------- Light, Unique, and Hilarious
","Before I watched 'Borat: Cultural Learning of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan' (I don't know why the title is so damned long), I expected it'll be similar to his previous movie as Ali G. It however turned up to be very enjoyable and exceeding my expectation. I could feel that the audiences were also enjoying the ride and picking up all the jokes easily.<br/><br/>When the movie started, I was rather worried as I saw its format. It is using a classic-film format, in which you normally find on the 70's movies. Surprisingly enough, I was wrong again as the format itself became a really good selling-point. Together with the comedy itself, Borat has occupied my mind for few days - trying to figure out how could a person have those ideas.<br/><br/>Simply put, this is a unique movie offering a different perspective to the audiences. Story-wise, you shouldn't expect too much as well as the usual aspects from a movie (e.g. sound or graphic effect), but if you'd like a one-and-a-half hour non-stop good laugh, this is the perfect course for you.<br/><br/>The story line goes as following: Suggested by the title, Borat is the representative of Kazakhstan with a mission to learn any cultural aspects of America where they are to be implemented in Kazakhstan. The movie therefore covers Borat's journey in learning the American culture while chasing his first-sight love - Pamela Anderson."
"Eyke87","9","4","12","3 November 2006"," Borat! Funny and alarming!
","Jagshemash! Here a come film review to you! OK, OK, let us leave the comedy mimicking of a central-Asian nitwit to the man who does it best: Sacha Baron Cohen. In his second feature outing following the regrettable 'Ali G Indahouse', Baron Cohen brings another of his comic creations to the screen in Borat, a riotously funny mixture of bigotry, buffoonery and bad taste.<br/><br/>Where Ali G failed back 2002 by taking the Staines legend out of his usual chat show set-up and surrounded him with fictional characters, Borat succeeds by retaining the formula that made the show so ridiculously hilarious: making real people look silly. What little plot the movie has (Borat sent to the 'US and A' to learn cultural lessons for Kazakhstan government) is made up for by the sheer amount of gut-busting laughs. As Borat, a naive journalist with tremendously backward views on matters of sex, religion and race, makes his way across the US, his confrontations with the American public, be they real or staged, cannot help but entertain.<br/><br/>We get anti-semitic jokes, naked man wrestling, a bear in an ice cream van and so much more it would be rude to spoil your fun. Some conservatives have decried the film as offensive and crude but Baron Cohen is doing something more than mere gross-out humor; revealing that racial bigotry and deep-rooted sexist beliefs can still be found not only in Borat's fictional 'Kazakhstan' but in the very real, United States of America."
"teh_mode","8","4","12","3 November 2006"," You will go to work the next day with blood-shot eyes and cracked-ribs, but will never be able to stop giggling.
","It almost seems like a million years ago that Sacha Baron Cohen's first ever insemination of the mock-interviewer, Ali G, was born out of the sporadically humorous ""11 O'Clock Show"". His 'yoof' approach to asking a former CIA operative question like ""Does you ave to be intelligent to be in da CIA? Ain't dat a bit racialist dough? What if you're thick an you wanna get in?"" was arguably his funniest period with the character, as his spin off shows, and subsequent movie, over-fed us the increasingly waning joke. The movie in particular, Ali G In Da House, had its moments, albeit very fleetingly, but was overall a complete washout compared to the riotous nature of that characters interviews with real people. Inside a fictional world, Ali was as crazy as the rest of it, and didn't seem like such a moron any more. Cohen's American takeover, at first, simply seemed like a cynical way of milking the cash cow even further, as most Brits had worked out by now that they were NOT being interviewed by real people, but by the creations inside Cohen's head. Granted some people still found his persona's intriguing, and the introduction of both Borat, the Kazakh reporter and Bruno the Austrian homosexual, managed to keep the fire going a little bit longer. But it still wasn't the laugh riot Cohen had us in at the beginning. So why then, is Borat the movie such a head-spinning, vain-popping, rib-cracking laugh-riot? Well there are two main reasons: America is quite a weird place after all, and instead of creating the weak fictional world that he did for Ali G In Da House, Cohen and friends have stuck with the documentary style of film making to capture the genuine and riotous reactions of all our fictional interviewer's hapless conquests.<br/><br/>It would be easy for me to say that this film uncovers home truths about certain American ways of thinking, but it would hardly be fair, since Cohen & Friends would never keep the duller interviews. The story of the piece goes: Borat, a television reporter from Kazakhstan, decides to up and leave his hometown for a huge report about the United States of America. His goal is to hopefully discover and incorporate all that makes America great, interviewing the locals, politicians and workers in this glorious nation. Among his problems include his blatant anti-Semitism, which gets him in more than a spot of bother on at least one occasion, and his unapologetic misogynistic views, that come to the fore in a hilarious interview with a group of feminists. As he delves into the Deep South, he is accused of ""looking so conspicuous"" by a cowboy rodeo-attendee, whom also advises him to ""shave that darned moustache off"" since it makes him look ""like one of them Muslim fellas"".<br/><br/>When one actually considers whether this film has achieved greatness or not, it is appropriate to examine the source, and value, of its comedy. There is at least one sequence, which I shall not give away, that was so pain-inducingly funny, that it literally had me gasping for air. The rest of the film could have been completely worthless and I would still have paid a worthy a cause, because of this one particular sequence. Much of the comedy is not so much witty, as it is gross or just bravery on Cohen's part. Who else would do things like try to enrage an entire stadium of cowboy hicks by singing a putrid version of Borat's own national anthem? But I have to be fair and say that Cohen is not a great comedian, yet sometimes, great comedy doesn't necessarily take all the great laughs. Watching Borat is, at times, a poignant experience about how certain members of the world's only superpower genuinely think. It is only a fleeting thought, mind you, as the creation of Borat is, unto itself, none-too-less racist a man then one who doesn't like the look of those ""darned Muslim fellas"" Mostly though, it is toilet humour done in an extremely funny way. It is hard to fault a film, which has been praised by the right wing as an indictment and eschewal of political correctness, and by the left wing for being an indictment of the prejudices and unsavoury opinions of ""Middle America"". For the rest of us, lets praise this for what it is: Unadulterated, non-PC sidesplitting hilarity."
"ksanders-10","9","4","12","2 November 2006"," High Five it's Borat
","I have never been the greatest Ali G or Borat fan, however, I have strangely been looking forward to this film for some time. I think due, in part, that's it's at least original in an otherwise poor summer of movies. Went to see a screening this evening (opening night in the UK) and it was absolutely packed. I don't think I have heard so much laughter in a cinema auditorium. I cannot recommend this movie enough. It will make you laugh and it will make you cringe. It's going to be a huge hit across both sides of the Atlantic and deservedly so. In fact I bet there will be many who will go see it twice to take friends or indeed witness for a second time what they couldn't believe they saw the first time round. I have never seen a cinema audience stand and applaud a movie before at the end credits. Excellent, High Fve!!!!!!!!"
"porbeagle_zen","8","4","12","28 October 2006"," very funny? yes. best comedy of all time? no.
","It's hard to watch a movie like ""Borat"" when the hype is as unbelievable as it's gotten. When fanboys and critics alike are foaming at the mouth, you either expect a masterpiece or a 90-minute administration of rabies. ""Borat"" is mostly the former.<br/><br/>I need to note that ""Borat"" is not for the easily offended, either by sex, obscenity, political incorrectness, or just plain mean-spiritedness. (I happen to be a Zappa fanboy, so I myself handle near anything. :-) If you can take that, then you'll likely find ""Borat"" to be a great popcorn flick, albeit with popcorn flying out of your nose from laughing.<br/><br/>Everyone likely knows the premise by now. Borat and his TV producer are drawn out of their backwater Kazakhstani village to document American culture, but things get skrewy when Borat falls in love with Pamela Anderson, leading to a wacky road trip across the southern US that we've seen 14,761 times before.<br/><br/>The difference this time is that Borat is very ignorant, very enthusiastic, and very randy Third-Word eurasiatrash. He often acts like an 11-year old kid who's just discovered that the adult world of social roles and sex exists, with disastrously inappropriate consequences. He's also extremely anti-Semetic, anti-Muslim and anti-Gypsy, although this doesn't quite jive with the rest of his (ig)Noble Savage shtick. Blame it on his culture.<br/><br/>Truth be told, the first three quarters or so is hilarious. The scenes in Kazakhstan and New York are very fresh and very, very, irreverent, all in the best ways. It's hard to know the ""status"" of all the people he interacts with (some are obviously plants, some are apparently playing along by feeding him lines, and some are totally ignorant of what's going on). It brings up all sorts of issues of consent on the observer's part. In some cases, that's quite disturbing. But that would require too much thought for this film, so I'll move on.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, some person as ignorant of screen writing as Borat is of ""pusse-magnets"" decided to give the film a ""plot"", by causing Borat to lose his cash, meet a good-hearted prostitute straight out of central casting, and fall out with his producer. As soon as this happens, Borat ceases to be poignant social satire and becomes ""Borat: Kazakh Son Of Pink Panther"". I believe they secretly hired Blake Edwards to direct the dinner party, antique shop, and hotel scenes, as they reek of his trademark cartoon slapstick cum shock factor. Incidentally, most people consider these to be their favorite scenes. Maybe I'm just a snob who thinks ""Fargo"" did a much more funny job of a fight between naked men. (""Hey, smoke a f***in' peace pipe!"") <br/><br/>After Edwards was called back to his retirement home, it appears Baron Cohen and crew realized that they had repeated the same premises ad infinitum and were rapidly running out of ideas. So they tidy up by having Borat realize the sorrowful truth of Anderson's virginity status, hence becoming depressed. Then, in a corny deus ex machina, he wakes up in front of a Pentecostal church on Sunday morning! Borat becomes a born-again Christian and forgives Pamela for all her wrongdoings. Praise be to Mr. Jesus! (This scene was disturbingly sweet, and there was uproarious laughter in the theater, not at Borat's conversion, but at the ""weird"" behavior of the Pentecostals. To me, this was the meanest, most stupidly biased moment of all.) <br/><br/>After that, things get pretty boring. There is a brilliant line during a fight on Hollywood Blvd, but that's too good to share. Then it ends.<br/><br/>So there's ""Borat"". The MySpace, YouTube audience, who laughs at anything ""ironic"" and ""out there"" will pee their pants with glee at this politically incorrect ""Napoleon Dynamite"" meets ""Pee Wee's Big Adventure"". I can't blame them; they've grown up with such crappy, unentertaining media that anything not quite in the norm, even if it's corporately glossed from head to tail, seems ""subversive."" <br/><br/>But to the rest of us, ""Borat"" is just kinda there. Yes, it does have an overt liberal bias. Yes, it is shot ""reality style"", with painful cinematography and a plot so hoary it never would have gotten greenlighted without Baron Cohen. But is it ""shocking""? <br/><br/>Well, if the mere presence of male genitals or bigots offends you, yes. If your idea of a shocking comedy is more along the lines of ""Dr. Strangelove"" or ""Network"" or like ""Pink Flamingos"", then it doesn't come close. In fact, ""Borat"" doesn't have a subversive bone in its body, despite all the controversy that follows it. <br/><br/>Does it make you think? Not really, unless you consider that some of the targets were real cheap (gun salesmen? c'mon.) or that some people didn't deserve to get humiliated. Anyone who claims that ""Borat"" intends to make the audience question their inert biases as Americans is giving it too much credit. It's likely claiming ""Jackass 2"" is an assessment of virility versus puerility, with the horse semen scene as the crux of the argument. Sacha Baron Cohen isn't in the business to be a philosopher, and 20th Century Fox certainly isn't. <br/><br/>But do you laugh? Yes. To some, that's all that matters."

","I got to see an advance screening of Borat last night. Let me say this right off, Borat is hilarious. I laughed from start to end. The interviews were outrageous as hell. I don't want to give anything away because I want everyone to be shocked at the things Cohan does in this movie. Cohan does a suburb job and earns my respect for how far he is willing to go to entertain.<br/><br/>There were one or two things that were a let down. I wanted more interviews and the movie felt a bit short, but that doesn't spoil anything. <br/><br/>Overall I give Borat 8/10. One of the best movies this year."

","I saw this a few weeks ago, at an exclusive screening, one of many taking place around the UK. I found many subjects particularly racist, sexist, homophobic and anti semitic however I still laughed at them. Not at the jokes however, but rather at the sheer stupidity of them.In one scene in particular, which must be described as a sex scene, I nearly wet myself with laughter just at the nastiness and humour combination, even though if I had seen the scene in any other circumstance, I would consider it to be a homo erotic act of pornography that would leave this speechless. In this film, the jokes just keep on running.<br/><br/>Sacha Baron Cohen portrays Borat as an Anti Semite, however the words spoken and written by him throughout the film are all in Polish (which's culture is integrated with modern Judaism) and Hebrew. The film was genius and I would recommend it to anyone who is up for a laugh. I advise people, as I did, not to take the offensive comments seriously due to the fact that it is just a humorous film. If one criticizes Baron Cohen of his Anti Semitic actions, they should realise that outside of this act, he is a practising orthodox Jew."

","Thanks to a couple of free passes, I got in almost a month early to see this. I don't normally watch Da Ali G show, or Borat so only had a vague idea what to expect. I got that and a hell of a lot more. From the first opening scenes to the closing credits my friends, the cinema and my self were almost rolling in the aisles with this 'documentary'. I hate using phrases like this but it was 'comic genius'. If you like Borat on TV then what are you waiting for? If you haven't seen him, go watch this - you're in for a treat. His co-stars in the film were excellent sports, and if some of it was candid then well done to Borat for capturing Americans at the best."
"angrysteve","9","4","12","11 October 2006"," I haven't laughed so much at the cinema in years.
","I got free preview tickets to the showing in Southampton last night. I have to say, it was just hilarious. <br/><br/>I saw the trailer ages ago, and had been looking forward to the movie for some time, being a big fan of the Borat short films on the Ali G show. I was worried that perhaps my expectations for this film were too high, having read the many good reviews here on IMDb, but I have to say, they were spot on. <br/><br/>There is a general back-story of Borat travelling across America to meet (and marry) Pamela Anderson after seeing her in an episode of Baywatch. Along the way though, he stops off in various places to continue his documentary on America for the people of Kazakhstan, which is where the film really comes into it's own. Each piece is like the short films in the Ali G show, and just as funny, if not even funnier.<br/><br/>In true Borat style, it was totally cringe-worthy in places (I'm remembering the national anthem at the rodeo, and the etiquette party), but as usual Sacha Baron Cohen did an excellent job of making the people he ""interviews"" along the way show just how stupid/racist/homophobic/bigoted (delete as appropriate) they can be. The chap at the rodeo proved just that. <br/><br/>I wouldn't hesitate for a second to recommend anyone see this movie, it was 1h 20mins of laughs. Although there were a couple of scenes that came across as staged (B&B and Pam Anderson scenes), they were still very funny. The hotel wrestling scene was both horrifying and hilarious at the same time :)<br/><br/>I have to wonder if anything will be cut, or of the version I saw last night was the final cut. It was only a 15 certificate after all."
"MartinHafer","6","3","8","7 September 2008"," Wildly uneven and a bit cruel
","This is a very difficult film to review since there is absolutely nothing like it. Sacha Cohen perpetrated a hoax by traveling across America claiming to actually be a visitor from Kazakhstan. However, instead of begin a documentary, it was a comedy in which Cohen acted like an obnoxious idiot and filmed how people reacted to him. In other words, most of the participants had no idea it wasn't a documentary and most of those on film appeared to be exceptionally patient with Cohen--even when he behaved like a boorish idiot (such as when he and his 400 pound friend ran naked through a hotel or pretended to become ""born again"" at a Pentacostal revival meeting). In some ways this was very funny and in others very cruel. Because of this, at times I laughed loudly but others I was just too uncomfortable and felt sorry for the people who were tricked into being in the film. As far as the humor goes, it was wildly uneven. Some was extremely funny and on target. Other portions were exceptionally crude and really seemed intended to make idiots laugh.<br/><br/>Sadly, despite being rated R and having LOTS of adult content, kids at the school where I teach saw it in huge numbers. I am NOT one to blame the movie, however, as it made no pretenses about being a family film. It was crude, offensive and very adult and this was not kept a secret when it was marketed. However, parents just didn't bother exercising reasonable judgment and many pre-teens were taken to see a movie I would have been embarrassed to take my teens to see. Bad parenting should not be blamed on Fox Films or Cohen. So my advice is to see it--but DON'T let your kids. It's just too jam-packed full of crudeness. It's definitely an adult guilty pleasure."

","Borat (2006) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Well, I finally caught up with this film after skipping it in theaters after seeing ""Borat"" on several television shows. I thought the TV show appearances were all hit and miss and feared the movie would be the same and it was but there were a lot more hits than misses here. For the most part this was a one joke film and thankfully they kept the running time short even if the 80-minutes started to drag towards the end. Sacha Baron Cohen is very believable in the title role but I wouldn't say he was a very good comedian. I think, like the Jackass crew, he does a great job of making an idiot out of himself but the real comedians come from the regular people and their reactions to Borat. The ending with Pamela Anderson was pretty stupid and really stuck out like a sore thumb compared to the rest of the film. Either way, it's nice to see a politically incorrect film in this day and age."

I know that the film may intend to satirize some American culture, but the result was that it made Kazakstan looks like the worst country in the world.<br/><br/>The 3 that I gave was for the OK performance of the lead actor and for the scene that Borat was nice and sincere to a black prostitute. That was the only scene I thought was worth remembering. The rest are just....Oh,gross!!! I don't recommend this anyone, except you are some people who really like mean, crude, dirty, ugly jokes."

","One of the worst films I've ever seen. I didn't mind the sexist and racist signals of the film, I didn't mind the absence of any plot. I didn't mind the disgusting scenes but I am really wondering why someone should see this film. Is it sarcastic? No. Is it a parody? No. Is it a a comedy to make you laugh? No; I believe that people pretending to laugh with this film is because the don't want to admit that there is nothing in this film. Is it the ""new type of comedy"" Well I believe no but I would really appreciate an explanation from the people that believe so. What is the new dimension that this film is adding to the comedy genre? Is there any innovative direction? Any shooting that makes this film unique? Any fresh idea that can teach other film makers? Any technique that could be become a mainstream doctrine? To my opinion no. So WHY this film is regarded to be the new type of comedy? I believe that the film maker and the producers, supported by some media and ""expert viewers"" that just want to be in the front line, intentionally created a ""myth"" about this film to help commercial success.<br/><br/>Don't waste your time with this film.

"YourMovieAuthority","1","3","8","12 June 2007"," Most overrated POS movie of the decade
","Many years ago, there lived an emperor who was quite an average fairy tale ruler, with one exception: he cared much about his clothes. One day he heard from two swindlers named Guido and Luigi Farabutto that they could make the finest suit of clothes from the most beautiful cloth. This cloth, they said, also had the special capability that it was invisible to anyone who was either stupid or not fit for his position.<br/><br/>Being a bit nervous about whether he himself would be able to see the cloth, the emperor first sent two of his trusted men to see it. Of course, neither would admit that they could not see the cloth and so praised it. All the townspeople had also heard of the cloth and were interested to learn how stupid their neighbors were.<br/><br/>The emperor then allowed himself to be dressed in the clothes for a procession through town, never admitting that he was too unfit and stupid to see what he was wearing. He was afraid that the other people would think that he was stupid.<br/><br/>Of course, all the townspeople wildly praised the magnificent clothes of the emperor, afraid to admit that they could not see them, until a small child said: ""But he has nothing on!"" This was whispered from person to person until everyone in the crowd was shouting that the emperor had nothing on. The emperor heard it and felt that they were correct, but held his head high and finished the procession.<br/><br/>The little fable above illustrates a little how this awful movie ended up with a ""91% fresh"" rating on sites such as Rotten Tomatoes. A few elitist critics thought they saw something beyond the shi t humor, lame unoriginal jokes, and utter garbage that fills the entire 84 minutes of this movie, and then the rest of the critics followed suit. If I had to guess, I would say that at least 75% of the people who watched this movie did so because they were deceived into thinking it was worth watching, either by these retarded critics, or by word of mouth about the shocking distasteful scenes in the movie. Controversy combined with publicity sells. That is the only reason this pile of dung made so much money. I would be willing to bet that at least 8 of 10 people who saw this didn't actually like it. Do yourself a favor, save your movie money and don't even rent this movie. If you must see it, steal it or something. Either way, you will regret losing two hours of your life to see this movie.

Once you look past the controversy and the shock value it is apparent that this film relies entirely on infantile toilet humour. This film is an example of the degradation of western culture. Many artists resort to this tasteless crap simply because they lack any real talent or their minds have become stagnant, probably from all the drug abuse.<br/><br/>I give this film an F minus."

Borat's quest: to woo the Pamela Anderson from the Baywatch and have sexy times in her ""red water panties"" then take back to Kazakhstan as wife. Crossing America in ice cream van with producer and suspicious friend, Azamat (Ken Davitian) is thread that join disparate - how you say? - vignettes.<br/><br/>Sacha Baron Cohen (who play Borat Sagdiyev), like Ashlee Simpson, Britney Spears, Paris Hilton, Richard Nixon and George W. Bush, has lack of ""shame"" gene, but unlike other moronis, his put genetic deficiency to good use in Borat, as eponymous Kazakhstan TV reporter, who, through him apparent ingenuousness and ignorance of America way of life, tease out the black side of Americans they keep to hidden even from themselves.<br/><br/>From Texas rodeo to high class dining, from driving instructor to ""humor expert,"" Borat somehow finds way to expose deepest prejudices, darkest social phobias and his own hairy anus.<br/><br/>An expert on obfuscating people's rhythm (big word for me - rhythm), Cohen pushes boundaries as well as he pushes buttons: as soon as upper class lady mention that ""it won't take too much to learn Borat to American way of life,"" he turn up at dinner table with bag of pooh, asking what to do; at television station, WAPT 16 News, Borat (being television performer Cohen himself) know exactly how to throw the small-town television newscaster, standing up out of frame and continuing speak to newscaster, then butting into weatherman's forecast on air; a ""Humor Expert"" decrees Borat's story of incest between his retard brother and prostitute sister taunting him with her ""vagine"" would not be considered funny in the America - yet here it is - being funny in the America.<br/><br/>Leading the witnesses into unintentional foot-in-mouth on racism, jingoism, sexism and homophobe, Borat's biggest target are the Jews, the gag being that Sacha Baron Cohen is, of course, a Jew. In gun store, Borat ask owner, ""What is best gun to kill Jew?"" And owner, whether not understand question or simply too red of neck to care, answer sincerely.<br/><br/>When Borat meet frat boys in trailer, one Nazi-shorn whiteboy stood out as biggest loud-mouth, jingoistic, sexist troglodyte. He so brash and fearless about his neanderthalism that envision only one career path for him after college - United States Marine.<br/><br/>Direct by Larry Charles (Seinfeld, Curb Your Enthusiasm), laughs come thick and fast and dirty (morbidly obese Azamat pushing naked balls onto face of Borat in position of 69, head is hurting from laugh of insane), but there is horrifying subtext that Cohen has exposed with Borat and could have not come at a more serendipitous time - on heels of this movie that show real racism as comedic, in grandest irony, a real racist show he is anything but comedic. One word: Kramer. Michael Richards, of most famous your Seinfeld, while on stage at comedy club, call heckler bad word for black man.<br/><br/>Despite media having the thrive on euphemisms as ""n-word,"" ""f-you,"" and ""a-hole"" (as if replacing words actually negate racism and swearing), Borat's success may be due, oddly enough, to American Kramer Gene: racism is alive and well in good ole Yew Ess Ov Ay - for by promulgating the euphemisms, the bile is retained through another generation. And you all become what Borat rightfully disparage: retards.<br/><br/>Borat implore in movie trailer, ""Please! You come see my film. If it not success, I will be execute.""

"EUyeshima","9","3","8","29 November 2006"," Relentless Skewering of American Cultural Mores Yields a Hilariously Astute Comedy
","This is definitely a comedy that lives completely on the edge. Its sheer audacity and fearlessness against public rebuke are admirable to some, repulsive to others. Except for a few groaners, this is one of the most hilariously observant films about global perceptions of the U.S. and an incisive, unguarded account of the prevailing social attitudes and cultural taboos in this country. In a compelling Andy Kaufman-like turn, Sacha Baron Cohen plays Borat Sagdiyev, a television commentator from Kazakhstan, here portrayed as the most backward of third-world countries. He has been assigned by his government to travel to the U.S. to make a documentary about American cultural mores.<br/><br/>After introducing us to his country, Borat arrives in Manhattan accompanied by his hefty, worrisome producer Azamat. But there is a change of plan when Borat sets his sights on Pamela Anderson and sets out on a road trip across the country to meet her in L.A. There is no let-up of ridiculous sight gags and maddeningly funny asides during its quickly paced 82-minute running time. Unlike the Pamploma bulls, there is the ""Running of the Jew"" in which the Kazakh villagers attack a couple of giant, papier-mâché puppets, Mr. and Mrs. Jew, who in turn lays a giant egg which the local children beat furiously with sticks. Other scenes have Borat erroneously presuming that a hotel elevator is his room and being a semi-attentive student to amazingly tolerant instructors as he gets lessons on comedy, driving and etiquette.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie, Cohen keeps upping the ante and yielding even more comic dividends - a question to a gun store clerk about the best weapon to kill Jews answered without hesitation; a B&B owned by a kindly Jewish couple which turns into a scene from ""The Blair Witch Project""; a conservative Southern dinner party that gets ugly when Borat invites an overweight black prostitute as his guest; an aging cowboy who lets his bigotry spew freely at the rodeo; a trio of frat boys from South Carolina who enthusiastically share their supremely sexist attitudes; and most infamously, an extended naked wrestling match between Borat and the grotesque Azamat that ends up in a convention of mortgage brokers. All these scenes expose a raw nerve which feels concurrently offensive, truthful and hilariously comic.<br/><br/>Credit needs to go to director Larry Charles, who guides this venture with the same type of deadpan élan he showed with HBO's ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" and the screenplay by Cohen, Anthony Hines, Peter Baynham, and Dan Mazer, which lends a loose structure to what seems to be a series of staged scenes with all the non-actors. But above anything else, it's Cohen's major accomplishment that he can make Borat an anti-Semitic, sexist homophobe and still have him come across as an amiable, cheek-kissing fellow full of innocently executed malapropisms. I'm sure the easily offended will continue to express their disgust, but for the more adventurous, brace yourself for a comedy that will make you roar with laughter while giving you that unsettling feeling of recognition. It's quite a trick which Cohen and company pull off superbly."

We were all jammed into one of the auditoria and the film projector started to the vast applause of all the students. The plot line reminded me a lot of Seth MacFarlane's writing style, with randomness and plenty of goofy antics that were staples in Da Ali G show (or the few episodes that I saw of it). Having known quite a few Eastern European immigrants and gauging their reactions in the theater was quite funny; interspersed with all of Cohen's antics and comedy, I was laughing so much that it hurt; I honestly did not stop laughing throughout the whole movie from start to finish.

You will be unable to believe some of the outrageous and totally over-the-top things they do in this movie. Another strength of the movie is that despite Borat being an idiot, he is a very endearing character. Borat is a biting satire, using Borat to show the idiocity of racism and hatred. The great thing about this movie is that it has something for everyone. It has intelligent satire, smart dialogue, dumb slapstick humour and everything in between.

Having seen the trailer, I thought of both statements as a little hyped up.<br/><br/>They weren't. This was honestly the funniest movie I have ever seen in my entire life. It was funnier than every other comedy I have ever seen in my life (including the Borat interludes in the Ali G show) - old or recent - thoughtful or commercial. Consider this in light of the fact that I am not greatly amused with most comedies I watch - I might chuckle and laugh a bit at the Frat Pack flicks, and smile at the Woody Allen works. Here though, I was literally unable to stop laughing from the very beginning of the movie until the end, at which point, I had to hold back because my cheeks had become sore.<br/><br/>Two of my other friends who came with me agree with me in that it was the funniest movie they have ever seen - although they knew nothing about Borat or Ali G before the screening. The audience in the theater was also enthusiastic - besides the constant laughter, there were several standing ovations.<br/><br/>I somewhat debated giving this movie a 10 but I ended up doing so because I do not think I will ever see something as funny as this.

There are a few funny scenes involving a bear and an ice cream truck. And I loved the ""man on the street humor."" But enough of the ""sexy"" talk. NOBODY needs to see the things I saw last night. And Sasha, I think I have seen your future, and Yakov Smirnoff called, he wants his act back. I feel sorry for Sascha's cousin who is a noted scholar in researching autism. After seeing the movie I can understand where much of his research must have came from. It was gross.I am so sick of all this drivel that the studios keep grinding out. BAD FORM 20th Century Fox. Even your company can do better than this sewer comedy."

","I rented ""Borat"" influenced by all the positive reviews I had read on newspapers and websites. But, once again, much ado about nothing.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, ""Borat"" has the kind of ""politically incorrect"" humor that is not for everyone. I have nothing against it... provided that it is elaborate and well prepared. ""Seinfeld"" is an example of this, and it is my favorite sitcom. This is not the case. In Borat everything comes down to the unbearable stupidity of the protagonist, which leads him to saying wrong things at the wrong time. For instance, there is one scene in which Borat has a meeting with a group of feminists and he has no better idea than telling them that ""women should not be educated"" and that they have ""smaller brains"".<br/><br/>All the movie is like that: stupid and unimaginative remarks about women, Jews, homosexuals, gypsies and so on. Make yourself a favor: don't rent this movie."

","Yes I couldn't stop laughing. I must be a terrible person then, with very bad taste, laughing at other cultures? I am. I couldn't stop laughing at the Americans, especially after reading the bad reviews on this site. <br/><br/>The movies is not an attack at Kazakh culture (or Eastern Europe, Jews whatever you like). We in Europe all know, and understand the irony, that's because we are actually interested in other countries and cultures. And know one or two things about them, like where they are located. So you Americans laugh at the part in which Kazakhstan is made ridiculous by the scene in Borat rides away with the horses in front of the car. Or don't because it's absolutely degrading right? Well guess what, I was born in Eastern Europe, and there are a few people from the village where my grandpa lives who can't ride cars and still move by horses and a wagon. <br/><br/>So I thought it to be absolutely hilarious. Things like a village idiot or town drunk, it's all there. And here ends the part in which we're making fun of ""Kazakstan"". Because as soon as Borat get's in the USA, he's making fun of YOU. Because this movie is about a country and it's people: Americans. <br/><br/>How can the message be more clear? Why do you not understand it? Apart from some scenes like the nude fighting it makes the USA ridiculous. But the greatest thing about it, is that the American opinions and people are real and the Kazakh language, country and habits are fake. The people in the documentary actually believe that people from Kazakhstan are so incredibly stupid because of the cultural differences. This is proved especially by best scene from the movie, the dinner. And even after the movie: by your reviews. In Europe we know that it's just humor, and don't see it being offensive. Because it's so over the top. Obviously it doesn't seem that way for you reviewers, because why else would you say it makes Kazakstan ridiculous while it's completely implausible?"

","""The Christians who ""save"" Borat...treat him pretty nicely...You may disagree with their views, but what else is there to laugh at? The views expressed by the people at that church, to my memory, aren't offensive or racist, they are sincere."" - Jason Eaken<br/><br/>To the people who feel this way about Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (2006), you missed the joke. This film is an American satire, or better worded, a satire about America that has been a long time coming. We deserve it. We need a good look at ourselves every once in a while. I am happy the majority of Americans understand this movie; in its opening weekend, it held the number one spot despite 20th Century allowing the movie to play in only half of the scheduled theaters, claiming that middle-America will not ""get"" Borat.<br/><br/>This film follows Borat's (Sacha Baron Cohen) journey from his mud-for-floors third-world village in Kazakhstan, where his most prized possession is a 15 year old cassette player, to the technologically, culturally, religiously, ethically advanced Unites States, where the phrase, ""We don't do that here in America"" becomes all too common. Borat's goal is to become Americanized so that he can bring the sophisticated culture back to Kazakhstan in hope that they too will become more civilized.<br/><br/>So for the middle-America that ""got"" the movie, you can stop reading here. If you think traveling across America to kidnap Pamela Anderson in a burlap sack is funny or if you were amused by Kazakhstan's annual ""Running of the Jew"", I would advise you to read something else. As for the people who continue: I hope I can clear up why this movie is funny, although I don't expect you to laugh, because I know jokes needing explanation just aren't funny.<br/><br/>This movie works because as an audience, we know nothing about Kazakhstan. Everything we know, we learned from Borat. The technology is dated, there is no indoor plumbing (plastic bags: yes; toilets: no), medicine has seen no advancement, and even if it had, the residents are more than likely too poor to afford a prosthetic limb, they are anti-Semitic and homophobic. Their culture is much worse off than the almighty American way of life, or is it?<br/><br/>There is a reason that you feel uneasy when you see Borat approaching a group of black teenagers in the middle of the night in an unknown location. We know the history of blacks and whites in America. This is surely a recipe for disaster. Why is it funny though? Maybe because we know that Borat has not exactly mastered the English language, and he is most likely going to say something that will be taken the wrong way. Or maybe it's funny because in the next scene, after the teenagers have Americanized Borat, he is calling a white man ""vanilla-face"" as if making his pants baggy has allowed him to supersede his own ethnicity to look down on someone with the same skin color as himself. Or maybe it's funny because Borat's ignorance of the prejudices in our society mirror the prejudices in his own society, say towards Jews and gays<br/><br/>And yes, Jason Eaken, the audience is indeed laughing at the views of the members in that church, but that is not the joke. We are not laughing because we think they are insensitive, offensive or racist, but because they are sincere: that is the joke. It is hard to imagine that those people actually believe what they are doing. You don't need to be anti-religious to understand that church members running up and down aisles with their hands in the air being moved by Holy Spirit is ridiculous. And you don't need to be an atheist to understand that allowing the Holy Spirit to then enter your body, which enables you to speak in tongues and heal foreigners of depression, is extremely ridiculous. These are the types of stories told after a group of preteens play with an Ouija board while watching The Sixth Sense. The funniest part of the church incident is Borat, who by the way in real life is a Jewish-actor, never misses a beat and goes along with the whole experience.<br/><br/>As one who finds slapstick comedy childish, stupid, crude, degrading and filled with cheap laughs, I would highly recommend this movie. It is extremely clever, it is offensive in a way that makes us embarrassed of how people view America, and it is funny. This is definitely the best comedy of 2006."

","Sacha Baron Cohen finally sees the success that he certainly didn't attain with his previous ""Ali G Indahouse"". Now when I use the term success, I mean in the world-wide term, as I'm quite aware he's been well known over the pond for awhile now and has enjoyed cult status in the States for a bit. However with the release of this film, he's a bonafide star overnight (well his alter-ego Borat is anyway) & with good reason as this mockumentary about a naive ridiculously bigoted, offensive foreign documentarian, Borat, touring America in hopes of wedding Pamala Anderson, of Baywatch fame, is utterly hilarious. Every time he interacts with everyday people it caused me to laugh and brought a smile to my face. The only thing that detracted from the experience of watching the film is that at one point it turned into very nervous laughter and I had to look away from the screen. (yeah,yeah, call me a prude. But if you went to see this film in theaters with other members of your family, you'd be just as embarrassed). Other than that, the film was the most i laughed in while watching a movie in quite some time.

","Comedy is an ever-changing genre in film. From the early silent, slapstick pictures of Mack Sennett and Mabel Normand to the zany and sometimes ""clueless"" comedies of the 80's and 90's, comedy refuses to remain stagnant.<br/><br/>Each new generation of comedy has its breakthrough film. Frank Capra's It Happened One Night (1931) introduced the romantic comedy; Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove Or: How I Stopped Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964) showed the world how to laugh at war and gave birth to the political satire; and Woody Allen's Annie Hall (1977) gave birth to a more artsy comedy, with originality and emphasis on the dialogue between characters. Now Sacha Baron Cohen has delivered the best thing to hit comedy since the banana cream pie: shocking cultural satire.<br/><br/>I sat in the theatre expecting a movie with little rhyme or reason for being made other than simple entertainment and the opportunity to take a few cheap pokes at religion, America, and a host of unsuspecting victims. When the opening credits rolled, I knew I was in store for something completely different. I got what I expected, just not in the manner I expected to.<br/><br/>Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Better Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan is genius. One of Cohen's hit HBO series Da Ali G Show's characters is Borat Sagdiev, a Kazakhstani reporter who is sent to America to film a documentary about American culture and why it ""is greatest country in the world"". The mysteries of proper etiquette, rodeos, automobiles, and woman's rights are all revealed to Borat. Starting in Borat's hometown (more like village), he gives the audience an inside look on the inner workings of his town. After showing off his VCR and sister (the number four prostitute in the country), he gets ready to take on western civilization, or at least all that his country missed. His journey will be time consuming, tiresome, and under budget.<br/><br/>The plot is simple. Borat travels across America in search of ""cultural learnings"" and his dream girl, C.J. Parker of Baywatch (a.k.a. Pamela Anderson). Along the way he encounters counselors, Evangelists, and a host of unsuspecting bystanders. It is rare to find such an entertaining film with such a thin plot line.<br/><br/>Without Cohen, Borat would be another forgettable film. His dedication and fearless approach to the character, however, makes the film work. He is successful in getting the laughs no matter what the cost. No subject seems to be off limit. A man of the Jewish faith, himself, Cohen's Borat verbally attacks the Jewish community, which exposes one society's biggest enemies: ignorance. This gives the comedy edge and a real satirical bite. <br/><br/>This film will undoubtedly offend those who believe that comedy has strict boundaries. For Middle America and those who appreciate crude, abusive, and hard comedy, however, Borat will satisfy. Some scenes in the film are almost embarrassing to watch and might be too ""intense"" for some moviegoers. A second look, however, will probably force a chuckle if not a belly full of laughter.<br/><br/>Borat has a hard R rating for language, nudity, adult themes, and crude, sexual content. It has a lot of everything for a lot of people. Candid camera moments as well as some classic comedy motifs unfold into a sidesplitting joy ride. Borat will have ""Great success!"""

"jzappa","8","3","9","5 November 2006"," A Portrait of American Bigotry
","Borat! is the funniest film to come along in more than a year or two, and it's also the only comedy I find truly ""shocking."" What I mean is, every time the Farrelly brothers come out with a new movie, critics say it's shocking and the shock value is plentiful and all of that, but when I watch any of the eight or nine movies they've made, I laugh and I enjoy it, but I'm never shocked by anything. When Freddy Got Fingered was released, it apparently was so shocking that a single exodus from one showing was of an epic proportion, but when I saw it, I just found it to be ahead of its time, if a bit poorly directed during its shocking moments, which I think could be what threw audiences so off-guard during those scenes. Borat! not only made me cackle like an idiot, I also found my jaw to be on the sticky, gum- and-popcorn-laden floor, being too fixated on the literally stunning instance of authentic shock to pick it up and reattach it to my face.<br/><br/>I will not describe any of these scenes to you because if I do, the shock will be killed, or at least maimed, for you, but what I will say is this: Borat! is unfathomably hilarious. Its dirty, filthy distasteful and purposely offensive humor is what made it a head and shoulders above how funny it would've been had it not been that way. My point is strengthened greatly not only by all the ethnic and country-based slander but also by the practically record-setting amount of nudity in this movie. One thing that takes the movie down a few is its awful unintentionally kitchen-sink atmosphere that makes the film less of an enjoyment for me, but Cohen and Davitian are so hilarious that I dismiss this minor flaw. In fact, Sacha Baron Cohen's seamless accent and clever Middle Eastern-to-English grammatical foul-ups could be what made me laugh the most.<br/><br/>I'm not sure I understand the head exec for 20th Century Fox. What he did was limit the theaters playing the movie, because he wasn't sure if the masses were going to get it. More simply put, there's nothing to not get, and also, each of the hysterical trailers produce waves of laughter in just under three minutes before a movie starts than most mainstream, wide-release comedies do in an hour and a half. Doesn't he understand that when your typical present-day audience sees trailers like that, whether they think they'll even like it or not, their curiosity is provoked too much to resist? <br/><br/>But there is a lot of speaking out against this movie from all different interest groups. The movie heavily loads itself with rotten Jewish-aimed humor, so people online are all engaging in forehead-vein-throbbing spewings of fury about anti-Semitism, but I'm sorry to say that ignorant as they are, they don't seem to notice all the different last names of the credentials involved: Cohen, Goodman, Levinson, Siegel, Martei, Bernstein, etc. The movie is produced predominantly by Jews, conceived by and starring a Jew that is so Jewish that his first and last names are Sacha and Baron, the most Jewish things I've ever heard in my life. Also, Larry Charles, the director, has directed countless episodes of Curb Your Enthusiasm, the HBO show for Larry David, a Jewish comedian who makes fun of his people all the time. The Kazahkstan fallout is all basically a touchstone to go back to. I mean, you'll be stunned at what they do to Jews, but then what they do with blacks, Christian right-wingers, all forms of southern and Midwestern Americans, feminists, gays, fat people, and I don't want to give them all away, but anyway, what drives the film's paper-thin plot line is its goal to offend literally everybody. And that's what's so unoffensive about it. But it is shocking. I'll give it that."

","""You might laugh yourself sick, but you may not respect yourself in the morning""(MSN.com). This quote regarding the movie is so true!! I laughed my ass off half the movie, but i also gasped about the same amount of time. I mean being a 20 year old i guess the raunchy humor would make any college student laugh hysterically, however any intelligent person may also regroup for a second and realize that what they were laughing at is in some way offending themselves. I mean while some of the anti-semitic remarks and scenes were humorous, i was also quite offended by some of them being Jewish myself. I mean idc if Cohen is Jewish, it's still pretty offensive. I'm kind of disappointed at myself for laughing at anti-semitic jokes. I mean i can't lie, i liked the movie to a point. I mean stupid teenage boys probably loved all the stupid nudity and wrestling and perversion, but in my opinion in was disgusting and unnecessary. It was like watching Jackass or some other stupid reality TV show. Again, overall this movie is hysterical, but it really makes you rethink your own beliefs and possibly even regret laughing at things that are actually offending you. It actually makes the audience full of jews, anti-semites, evangelists, southerners, etc. look like idiots because it's like they're actually laughing at jokes directed to offend them."

","For those familiar with Borat from ""The Ali G Show"" this movie does not break much new ground. After all, the mannerisms of Southerners with delusions of grandeur have served as fodder for him before. But the movie blends fantasy with reality, forming a delightful little saga, peppered with American idiots.<br/><br/>Baron Cohen is one nervy guy. It took serious balls to go through with the rodeo sequence, which took place in southwestern Virginia, particularly after the ""pep talk"" and appearance advice he received from the rodeo organizer. Baron Cohen's guerrilla approach to the situations depends on his ability to stay in character and to continually step over the line, until his subjects rebel. The genius of his characters--for Ali G and Bruno perform a similar type of provocation--is that he really does nothing but present his small-minded targets with situations that elicit gut reactions from them. Politeness versus political correctness versus true feelings--this is the struggle that Borat's ""teachers"" face. Some of the Americans are obviously uncomfortable with the racist or otherwise offensive comments of Borat, while others appear only too happy to have found a sympathizer with their own, barely-suppressed prejudice.<br/><br/>For me, the most appalling of all the ""targets"" were the fraternity brothers. The other audience members in the theater perhaps felt the same, because the laughter that had punctuated the showing of the movie up to that point (and that resumed afterwards) died out. Whether the drunken frat boy too much resembled some of the audience members, or if they were dismayed by the unflattering portrayal of the condoned and even celebrated drunken oaf of American culture, I do not know. I do know that the boorish, white male supremacist opinions of the frat boys, combined with their carefully cultivated, clichéd image (the rich trust fund baby who is too drunk and sloppy to comb his hair, but who opens up a fresh package of Brooks Brothers shirts every week) repelled me more than anything Borat could have done or said. The latest news is that these same frat boys, embarrassed by their own behavior, are suing 20th Century Fox, claiming that they were somehow duped into revealing their latent misogyny and bigotry. Poor, spoiled babies.<br/><br/>This film is funny, provocative, and it will make you think about the differences between ""marketed"" American culture and ""real"" American culture. Highest recommendation."

There was this one scene where Borat is picked up by some college guys in an RV. However, they never really tell you who is driving the RV but they just show these three guys partying extremely hard with beer and whiskey. Who was driving? Where was the RV going? We will never truly know this. However, there were many gay overtones. Borat goes to a gay rally and kisses men and then is handed a device. In the highlight of the movie, he gets into a fight with his fat and disgusting producer who is very very ugly. It's a naked fight and the fat man ends up sitting on Borat's face. You can see the male body parts extremely vividly and it was a bit over the top. At one point they are in the elevator and the fat man is naked just standing there and I swear to god he had female breasts. Also, Borat really hates Jews which was a bit strange but funny. He also thought his producer was trying to dress up as Adolf Hitler instead of the fat guy from Laurel and Hardy. I liked Borat though and hope to learn one day if this movie was staged in parts or real!"

","On general principle, I'm not going to give ANYTHING away about this movie. I'm not going to mention the plot or give hints on the best scenes or whatever. That's because this movie just needs to be experienced... by everyone. Talking about it with other people who have witnessed is incredibly fun, but for reasons that can't be explained. Basically, this move is going to be huge and people are going to be talking about it a lot over the next few weeks, so just do yourself a favor and see it as soon as possible, preferably in a theater that is going to sell out. Which is going to be most places this week.<br/><br/>Never have I laughed so hard with so many people for so long, and maybe it will never happen again. I went to see it because I'd already read several glowing reviews from respectable film critics who liked the movie for the right reasons. I'd seen Da Ali G show, and knew that Sacha Baron Cohen was a remarkably gifted improviser with the balls and skill to always stay in character, much like our generation's Andy Kaufmann. Well, with this film, Cohen has surpassed everyone. He really has. Borat mixes the most biting satire of the unique shade of dumb exhibited by today's America with ultra low-brow dick jokes and inspired physical comedy. The preliminary reports were true: it works. LIke it or not, and you will like this film, it is going to be HUGE for all the right reasons. At some point you will see this movie and nearly suffer a laughter-induced stroke, like I did (unless you take its impact seriously enough to be offended or just don't get it).<br/><br/>A lot of people are going to be calling SBC a genius for the rest of his life because of this film. It probably seems like I'm piling on the praise too thickly for any comedy. That's possible, but then again I don't take movies that seriously. What I'm saying about this movie is true, but the movie is still just entertainment. It just happens to be the most innovative comedy to come along in my lifetime (23 years, the last 10 sentient to art)- the best clown in the bunch. It boasts virtuoso execution of a complete idiot by a Cambridge educated comedic genius with something to say about America. Of course, by acting more hopelessly backward and bigoted than all but the most lunatic fringe of our country, Borat is able to get people to say things you wouldn't think possible. Unfortunately, I'm not surprised by the hypocritical depths or the polite but strained patience my fellow Americans routinely display throughout the film. I've met enough of a cross section of this country to have a pretty good idea of what we're dealing with here. What I am surprised at is how a Briton, using improv, can 1. Exploit the ignorance of people regarding foreign countries by convincing people easily that he speaks the truth about Kazakhstan and 2. Uses that ignorance to define a relationship where the (American) is speaking to someone who seems far dumber and more bigoted than (the American) who is then free, on some level, to identify with made up things Borat says about this supposedly backwater Central Asian country. There it is in a nutshell- people who believe this is the greatest nation on earth identifying, culturally, with ridiculous falsehoods about the country.<br/><br/>Of course, many reveal nothing of the sort, though they believe equally that Borat is who he says his, so those parts are still funny as hell.<br/><br/>So, in closing, if you like movies and young enough to be on IMDb, you have to see the greatest comedy of our generation. You just have to see it. But don't wait until the DVD comes out or the theaters start to thin out- see it while it is fresh on the scene with a room full of people laughing so hard they cannot breath."

","Each new ""comedy"" released from Hollywood these days seems to have one primary goal in mind; to be even more distasteful and sickening than the previous one. ""Borat"" has been lauded by critics and fans alike. This is clear cut evidence that it is already too late to save our civilization. I don't want to sound like an oldster disparaging anything new; pushing boundaries can be done well, as is witnessed by the hilarious television shows ""Reno 911"" and ""South Park."" <br/><br/>The ""comedy"" in this odious film is more mean spirited than the geekiest nerd could ever experience at the hands of his high school tormentors. The entire premise is borrowed from Howard Stern, who used it to much greater effect with Stuttering John, as he ambushed celebrities and asked them embarrassing questions. Of course, the gimmick was invented by ""Candid Camera,"" which was original and kind of funny. Too bad it cleared the way for foul mouthed carbon copies like ""Punked,"" and eventually this obscene movie.<br/><br/>Cohen doesn't seek to skewer the powerful and pompous. He chooses the predictable targets in our politically correct society. How often can we point out that rednecks are stupid and gullible? Why is it still funny? But then again, how many times can Hollywood have a super model punch out a huge man, without people questioning it? The excruciatingly long nude wrestling scene in this movie qualifies as one of the most offensive (and pointless) in the history of cinema. Why does nudity in films now consist primarily of unattractive males showing off their decidedly non-appealing bodies? Are the makers of these ""comedies"" trying to turn people off to sex?<br/><br/>""Borat,"" like the super bad films of Judd Apatow, Seth Rogen, Adam Sandler, Will Ferrell, Mike Myers, etc., is your standard ""comedic"" fare for this day and age- male nudity, loads of juvenile toilet ""humor,"" repeated jabs at Christianity and southern white males, men getting hit in the crotch, etc. I can perhaps understand why 11-12 year old boys find this disgusting stuff funny, but the sad reality is that many, many allegedly educated and supposedly mature middle-aged adults do as well."

","Very crude and unintelligent exploitation comedy that leaves a bad aftertaste. What is strange that Sacha Baron Cohen thinks that by making fun of his own Jewish Heritage it somehow also gives him the right to make fun of Romania, Kazakhstan, America and basically play on people's good intentions by misguiding them intentionally for the sake to build a cruel joke. It is the sort of film a jaded and uneducated 16 yr old would make. And this inanity is compared to Monty Python? Oh please. I think films such as these do not care who they offend. Therein lies the problem. Someone who is masterful at creating comedy doesn't need to rely on cheap shots at other people or cultures, and can create more hilarity without exploitation.

","Saw this a year after it's general release. I don't know if it's because I saw it at home instead of in a theater, or if I had already been exposed to the Borat shtick, but I didn't find this film worthwhile.<br/><br/>It's best when the Borat character is interacting with people one-on-one. Genuinely funny scenes with a comedy instructor and a driving instructor, and to a lesser extent at the dinner party scene.<br/><br/>Still, the film relies too much on shock humor. This has two primary sources - scatological references (eg, we see Borat relieving himself in some small bushes on a busy Manhattan street, and a very graphic male nude wrestling sequence), and prejudicial references, primarily to women, gays and Jews.<br/><br/>There are some redeeming moments, and one could make the case that the movie shows Borat's prejudices are America's prejudices, and that all prejudice is worthy of ridicule - but I doubt the target audience would tune into the message.<br/><br/>Appropriate for the male dorm room set, otherwise, best left on the shelf."

Borat was taken as an insult but they only want to see the bad points of film, for me is just that, i mean is just a film, a very good one. What i like of Borat is that he show to us how the people whit many prejudices are and Cohen put this in a very funny way. I love specially when he is the rodeo and a guy ask him if he can cut off his mustache because he looks like a terrorist and later in the same rodeo Borat sings about the war in Iraq and support Bush and everybody is happy. I mean those people must be a shame of their attitude and that's why everybody demand and want to banned the film.

","My comments aren't going to be about the movie itself but rather about how it offended so many people. Personally i thought the movie was hilarious and I will certainly see it again. I think the reason so many objected to this film was probably because it hit too close to home. Much in the same way someone that doesn't believe in evolution would consider such a theory completely garbage. Another thing i find interesting is that around 7,000 IMDb members gave this film a rating from 1 to 3 (with 4800+ giving it a a lowest possible rating of 1) So that means about 10% percent of everyone that voted on Borat (7000 out of 71,000) hated it but 482 out of 1040 (around half) of the people that hated it bothered to comment on it.<br/><br/>The film is not for the masses.

","Where do you start? Its as though they took the poorest taste sketches from any comedy and put them all together into one film, strung together with quite annoying dialogue. You are introduced to Borat who is sent to the USA to discover facts about the USA lifestyle that will help his poor country develop. Its a road trip movie with cringe worthy moments thrown in. But you don't cringe because of tension or gore as is the trend with road trip movies.....you cringe as Sacha makes jokes which are sexist, racist, homophobic and just morally wrong.<br/><br/>Contents include Borat laughing and ridiculing his brother who is retarded, talk of sexual incest, bestiality, sexual loonacy, racism, sexism, homophobia and generally everything in poor taste. I can stomach most things but seeing both Sacha and a morbidly obese naked man running through a hotel butt naked will haunt me for the rest of my life. To put the nails in the coffin of this film, look at some of the out-takes which include Borat visiting a sanctuary to purchase a dog to defend him against Jews (?!). In this out-take he says he wants to find a dog who will give him sexual pleasure, attack Jews on first sight, and at the end of its use when he has finished his trip, will taste good! Okay we all might laugh at things which are in poor taste at times, but in this quantity its just ridiculous. I can see why some of it is considered funny, but is it okay to make comedy out of people's prejudices? We even see Borat meet what is portrayed to be your average American, and chant to crowds about taking over Iraq, killing everything that breathes over there, and killing people who are gay.<br/><br/>I know some people would say ""Lighten up - its just a joke"" or ""Its a statement about how wrong some aspects of society still are"" but honestly.......I'd not want to watch this film again! If it were hysterically funny then maybe some of the poor taste could be excused but you'd have to have a very warped sense of humour (and no conscience) to enjoy this film to the full."

","All I hear is people talking about Borat and telling me to see it, it's so funny. So I finally watched it. The beginning was a bit slow. However, this whole movie in a nutshell is a man from Kazakhstan named Borat going to America to film a documentary - and this movie is his documentary. Borat does some very awkward things like kissing men on the cheeks when greeting, talking about how he had sex with his mother-in-law, etc. This movie starts to kick off while Borat is in his hotel room he watches an episode of Baywatch and wants to marry Pamela Anderson so he goes on a journey to California to meet her. I chuckled at a few things throughout the movie but there was nothing spectacular. Best part of the movie was the ending when Borat tries to capture Pamela Anderson in his custom bag. I must mention the scene where Borat and his obese friend is naked, wrestling in their hotel room is beyond disgusting and I would not want to watch this film because of this scene, I do not want to see 2 men wrestle with some fat guys balls in another man's face. I just can't see myself watching the film again. I give it a 3 because there were a few things that made me chuckle, but nothing memorable."

I don't have a problem with the way the movie exposes bigots; some of the people in the movie deserve being held up to public ridicule.<br/><br/>But along with Cohen's deserved victims, there are too many innocent victims for my taste; people who are probably well-meaning but still be made to look bad. I found the treatment of the Romanian villagers particularly heartless.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie just doesn't come together for me.

When he was sitting by the fire and took out his pet chicken about to kill it, I turned the movie off and never saw the ending. Killing a chicken for the movies is not my idea of entertainment.

Otherwise, people reacted how you would generally expect them to in relation to what was happening to them and other times extremely politely. <br/><br/>There is no social commentary or insightful satire in this movie. I know it is cool to be anti-American and whatnot at the moment...I hate the current U.S government as much as any central European does (note I say GOVERNMENT). <br/><br/>I was expecting this movie to be rude, which is completely acceptable and sometimes necessary. But it is ONLY rude and disgusting with 1 or 2 funny bits thrown in. Why was the wrestling scene necessary? Do not believe the hype for this movie.

","I hardly know where to begin with this movie. I went in with high expectations, considering how so many seemed to be raving about how hilarious it was. Also, I was curious because the movie seemed to ignite some litigious activity from some of it's unwitting participants. After viewing, I can certainly understand why. It was pretty evident that many, if not all of the people he encounters are unaware of the joke being played on them in this make-believe documentary. It is evident when you see these people respond with very real outrage, disgust, and hurt, that they were unwittingly duped into being victims, as Borat seems to go far out of his way to be as tedious and offensive as possible to nearly everyone he meets, with the exception of a prostitute, and a motor home of traveling drunken misogynists. It's amazing that Sacha Baron Cohen managed to stay in character, in spite of putting himself in real danger of his own personal safety because of his antics in the subway and on the sidewalks of New York City, or at the Rodeo, after singing lyrics obviously designed to be deeply offensive to Americans to the tune of the American national anthem. It seemed as though the viewer of the film was also targeted with the joke; I found a few scenes so distasteful to me personally, that I winced or turned away altogether. The scene involving a naked fight with his ""producer"" was something I did not want to see then, and hope never to see the likes of again. There were some very funny parts woven into all of this, but the humor turned sour for me when I realized that innocent people were duped, and being made fools of through much of it. Obviously, the intent here was the flagrant disregard of any standard of decency, or political correctness. Was Pamela Anderson in on the joke, when Borat tries to take her by force at a public autograph signing, and make her his ""wife?"" If not, he was very lucky he didn't do some serious jail time over that foolish stunt. So all in all, a great movie...NOT!!! Seriously, unless vulgar sophomoric humor is your thing, this movie is one to pass up."

It wasn't a true documentation of America either, (if anyone has even tried to credit it for that) Is it supposed to make us ashamed of ourselves for having manners or not agreeing with homosexuality?

It has broken lots of box-office records all over America and the director of this movie Larry Charles should have the last laugh.<br/><br/>Needless to say this is a stupid movie that makes you laugh and jump in parts. Most part of the movie is shot in hand held live camera as Reality TV. Borat is a character coming from Kazakhstan to learn the culture of America. It is crudely made film. Most of the times  it shocks the audiences and people. How on earth someone can think of such a movie  or such things to be included in a movie.<br/><br/>Some takes on America are very intelligent. Good part of the movie is that it is not preachy or does not pass judgments. Borat just asks stupid questions  basic questions  and questions everything with his bare tone. Some incidents are unimaginably nauseating. Some dialogues are un-listenable to sober words. The movie is made to shock you and it successfully does that.<br/><br/>Not a great movie, but something to see  if you want to see a really DIFFERENT movie - just to check the technique of one can make such movies too  this is a movie to go and pay a visit."

","Folks, there's nothing new here. For those of you too young to have seen it, a TV show called Candid Camera set up outrageous situations and recorded the reactions of unwitting dupes. In this movie, the dupes knew of the camera, but had been lied to about what it was there for; most were apparently told by the film makers that they were filming a documentary for a foreign audience.<br/><br/>The (attempted) humor is the usual post-Animal House bathroom humor/gross-out humor/sophomoric humor. We are treated to the public's reaction as our heroes urinate/defecate/masturbate in plain view, skewer America's national anthem at a rodeo, disrupt a local TV news broadcast, ad nauseam.<br/><br/>The punctuation of dignity is a comic staple dating back to before the Keystone Kops, or the 3 Stooges turning a white-tie gala into a pie fight. Herein, our hero Borat disrupts a formal dinner party, excusing himself to go to the restroom and returning to the table with his (alleged) feces in a sack.<br/><br/>As with Candid Camera, what few laughs that may be got from this movie are, indeed, from the reactions to Borat by John Q.

","I want to say at the outset that I'm a school teacher. One thing that infuriates me frequently is the tendency of some children, usually below the age of 14, to say an inappropriate word in front of others and mistake this for humour. Unfortunately, I know now that it's not strictly limited to children; Sasha Baron Cohen obviously possesses this trait in spade-loads.<br/><br/>People have raved about how this movie exposes bigotry, how it shows Americans for what they really are. I don't know for sure if it does that. What I am certain of is that going out of your way to offend a kindly Christian pastor and his wife - people who are actually trying to make allowances for you, no less - isn't humour. It's simply being obnoxious. And this is one of the running themes of Borat.<br/><br/>Certainly, the film has some genuinely funny moments. Cohen is certainly a master at staying in character no matter what, and the interview on live TV is quite impressive (both for what Borat said, and for the way the interviewer handles what is clearly a very difficult situation).<br/><br/>But for all that, you couldn't shake the feeling that often Cohen was simply abusing people. I felt especially sorry for the Jewish couple running a Bed and Breakfast whose kindness is repaid by (allegedly comic) mistrust, and the owners of a civil war antique shop left some $450 poorer because Cohen felt like smashing some things just to get a rise out of them (was I the only person watching this and wondering if he carelessly smashed priceless, irreplaceable artifacts? Perhaps it's just my historian blood. . .).<br/><br/>We're trying to teach people today that whilst you can get a laugh by abusing others, it's not an attitude that should be encouraged. Cohen is a member of a frequently abused minority - the Jews, and surely he should understand what it's like.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is not merely bad. It creates new definitions for badness in movies.<br/><br/>It did have one thing going for it, though: next time we're deliberating over which movie we should go to see, we can say ""How bad could it be? It has to be better than Borat!"""

And probably afterwards as well. There is absolutely no point in trying to over-intellectualize here. I'm certain Cohen - the guy behind Borat - has been through the full intellectual process and come out the other end. Yes it's boorish and sophomoric - that's the point. It's also extremely funny, especially in the first half, and occasionally rather frightening, but the joke is pretty thin and, I'm afraid, wearing out towards the end. Still..... I was creased up with laughter at the scenes in New York and at the sight of Borat chasing New Yorkers around a subway train, trying to kiss them. Then the chicken got loose.......wonderful! <br/><br/>I loved the rodeo, and that homophobic, racist guy shooting himself so utterly and completely in the foot on film for the whole world to see, but the funniest part wasn't that or even Borat's rendering - or strangling - of the Star Spangled Banner. It was the horse falling over in the background. You can't script that kind of stuff. <br/><br/>One of my favorite scenes was at the TV station, where the interviewer was trying so sweetly and patiently to get Borat to sit down and stay in camera range, and the weatherman just lost it completely and dissolved into giggles. Those guys need promoting! But the bear joke wore thin very quickly, the frat boys deserved everything they got, the driving instructor was bordering on heroic, and the revivalist meeting terrified the hell out of me. That's one of the more frightening things I've seen on screen this year. I felt sorry for the lovely couple in their Bed and Breakfast house and hope - assume - they got very well paid. The Baywatch / Pamela Anderson thread was a bit tedious by the end, and the naked wrestling was funny for a while but went on way too long.<br/><br/>Some sharper editing would have helped. I was very impressed by the size of the ""black boxes"" which were apparently necessary to cover up Borat's wedding tackle during the wrestling, (is that how the rest of the world saw Borat or is it just the USA which is so terrified of nudity?) but I'm seriously concerned about the fate of the chicken.

He never loses the character, dealing with every situation as if such an absurd character could be real.<br/><br/>The strengths of the movie are the scenes where Borat's portrayed ignorance or prejudice combines with the hateful, stupid or ignorant reactions from the people he encounters. Sasha asks a gun dealer advice on a weapon 'good to kill a Jew' - the dealer suggests a 9mm. In another scene a rodeo cowboy agrees with Borat that homosexuals should be locked up and killed. Where Sasha brings out the ugly truth and combines it with his own comedy, he's at his best.<br/><br/>The weak scenes are when Borat is with people who are open and accepting of him as a foreigner, tolerant of his failures and attempting to help him. One scene has a dinner party host trying to instruct Borat on the use of a toilet; in another a group of black youths instruct Borat on how to look and talk like them. These scenes are funny, but funny at the expense of people helping a stranger. In one scene an angry feminist walks away from Borat - Sasha's attempts to goad her having failed. Borat's lines are funny, but the scene doesn't really work.<br/><br/>The movie is a series of independent scenes - each a new encounter for Sasha to showcase Borat's ignorance. While each scene is funny, as a whole there is no real progress - the end of the movie is no funnier for having watched the start. The plot happens, but really is included as a vehicle to change the locations of the scenes, not a means to evolve the characters.<br/><br/>It's great comedy, but a mediocre movie."
"Lmiklowitz","5","2","5","4 November 2006"," 'Jackass' meets 'Easy Rider'
","This movie works on two levels. It is a Jackass-meets-Easy-Rider for adolescent minds who love crudeness. It may also appeal to more open-minded people who try to find social satire within it and test contemporary limits of decency. Sasha Baron Cohen and his writers don't explore the satire any further than having Borat cluelessly utter and do the most offensive things and showing how Americans react. <br/><br/>If repulsive is funny, this movie should be hilarious.<br/><br/>Some people on his southern route from New York to L.A. exceed his unassuming crassness, ultra-nationalism, racism, anti-Jewish prejudice, and sexism. Because these Americans are clued in, they are just plain mean. Others show their better natures and either try to assist this bumpkin or draw the line on decency. As bad as the movie makes Kazakhstan look, it sometimes makes the United States look worse. When Borat is at a Pentacostal prayer meeting, watching prominent American citizens in suits, including a judge and members of Congress, speak in tongues and swoon in religious ecstasy, we wonder who is stranger.<br/><br/>Yes, you will probably laugh, but there are different reasons for laughter. Sometimes it covers a sense of discomfort from breaking social taboos. Borat just can't get the hang of what to do with a toilet and how it works. Despite intense study with an etiquette coach, he presents a little white plastic bag to the dinner party hostess at the table in front of guests. There's not just nudity, but hairy and obese nudity and fellatio. There is a lot of that kind of laughter in this movie. It makes Lenny Bruce and Richard Pryor look mild.<br/><br/>That said, the hand-held camera work and editing are very effective for the candid scenes with apparently unsuspecting ""ordinary people."" The 90 minutes passed quickly as I followed with interest to see how many taboos of political correctness Borat would break. I lost count. It began with incest, rape, bestiality, anti-Semitism, male chauvinism and sexism, double fellatio, planning to kill and killing pets, and much more. How this movie got nothing more restrictive than a PG 17 is unbelievable."

","You either love or hate the fictional,Kazakhstani journalist Borat.I love him.For all this character's ignorance and prejudice,his major accomplishment is to reveal the ignorance and prejudice of others-he takes us on a scary journey across western ""civilization"" where he's trying to make a ""movie-film"" about the ""best country in the world"",a.k.a the US,to show his fellow countrymen.<br/><br/>The question is,who is really the most civilized/uncivilized?Or are all humans equally uncivilized,but in different ways? I admire the courage of Sacha Baron Cohen,I can imagine he stirs up many emotions,the negative are probably the most powerful.Borat is not just a laughing stock,his helpless attitude make the people he meet equally helpless,they can no longer pretend to be superior. Most of the people he meet,interview or come across one way or the other show an from-above,contemptuous attitude,trying to be charming while teaching this ""savage""(as they probably see him as)nice western manners. I laughed during the movie,but afterward I also felt slightly sick and even uneasy.Not because of Borat,he's not a real person,but because of all these ""nice"",""normal"" people he has revealed.They represent a great deal of the western world,so we should all probably feel a bit ashamed on their behalf."
"thoughtfox","9","4","14","5 November 2006"," Satire in One of Its Finest Cinematic Moments: In Short, FUNNY!
","I'd been waiting to see this movie for a long time, and I was not disappointed. From the very beginning, to the very end, the movie will make you laugh. Cohen (Borat) is brilliant, as is the material. The key lies in a hilarious blend of Borat's innocence, naiveté, preoccupation with everything sexual, and Borat's fear of Jewish people. In addition to the material, the film is also hilarious because of Cohen's ability to play the straight man with such conviction, in the presence of complete strangers (usually). Cohen's character pushes the boundaries of nearly every politically incorrect subject, and while this in itself is not funny, the fact that Cohen is making fun of people who are really racist or sexist or bigots in real life IS what's funny. This is what people don't understand. In fact, 5 minutes into the movie, a couple sitting next to me in the theater actually got up and left the theater. This movie, this actor, the character he created (Ali G is equally funny), and the material IS NOT being insensitive or racist or xenophobic or politically incorrect. What this movie is doing is actually making fun of people who are really like this; that's why it's called satire. Cohen is turning the mirror unto the face of the real enemy, ignorance, while simultaneously advertising the scary reality: that there are people in this world who hate others because the color of their skin, or their sexual orientation, or the higher power they worship differs from what they are used to. These people are everywhere; maybe it's your next door neighbor, maybe it's you. So, if you see Borat and find it disturbing, it's either because 1) you don't appreciate the satirical quality of this film; and/or, 2) you are one of these people that the film is making fun of, and don't appreciate the kind of inequality or unfair treatment with which your perspective is being dealt."
"jamessliwka-1","9","4","14","4 November 2006"," Funniest Film Ever
","This has got to be the funniest film i have ever seen. I wasn't a big fan of Borat when he first appeared on the Ali G, but he grew on me as i grew out of Ali G and when the movie was announced i thought it would be funny, but i was mistaken, it was hilarious. I was thinking back to the previous films i laughed at so much in the cinema and South Park, American Pie and most of all Jackass spring to mind. I may of laughed more at Jackass because there were more jokes/stunts but i never laughed as hard as in one scene in Borat, the naked scene, i couldn't actually breath and had tears down my face and after the film finished i was still laughing at that. There is so many other scenes to mention, so I'm not going to bother, just see it you will be in stitches the whole way through."
"eschewobfuscation92","10","4","14","4 November 2006"," Oh My God
","This had to have been the funniest film I have ever seen. It is over-the-top, confrontational, and 100% hilarious. Borat is by far the funniest movie I have seen this year, with Little Miss Sunshine and Jackass 2 coming in a close 2nd and 3rd, respectively. Borat does so many things that you realize how over the top this movie is. In fact, that is an understatement, Im sure many people will be offended by this film, but hey, all in the name of comedy. Borat shows the dark side of America, but in a very funny way, not in a cynnical way. This movie is perfect for anyone, but it is very inappropriate, this movie is not for the faint of heart. It is very crude as well, I think the youngest people who should see this film are maybe 13 year olds, depending on your standards. I am 14 and I saw it, and I had either seen or heard everything in the film, but I am a very exposed individual. If you kids haven't seen many R movies, this definitely isn't the one for them."
"annoman","9","4","14","4 November 2006"," The most brazen and impertinent film to come in ages; and one of the funniest, too.
","Jagshemash! Sacha Baron Cohen, star of HBO's hit comedy series, ""Da Ali G Show,"" further embraces the Kazakh TV journalist Borat Sagdiyev, extending his ludicrous mannerisms and farcical cultural habits to us by way of the most brazen and impertinent film to come in ages; and one of the funniest, too. ""Borat"" is a new breed of cinema; one in which insolent humor and audacious pranks are loaded upon unsuspecting persons with neither regret nor apology. This class of comedy is one unafraid of all those out there who will, with their every breath, attempt at discrediting its material. And it is of no fantasy that this film will be a target for many to pursue in the months following its release. The film's crude go-about-things is relentless in its hunt to abash and debase any and all social cliques, glorified unions and self-reputed organizations. However, beneath the barbaric slaughtering of all targeted by this film (which varies from Jews, Gypsies, gays and blacks to Feminists and cowboys and the American Fraternity) is concealed a furtively executed pearl of comedic cinema; one that will only grow in its likability, despite being anything but. As would say Borat, ""Great success!"""
"jazzmaster84","10","7","31","21 September 2006"," The Comedy of the Year, by FAR!!!
","So, I just saw Borat: Cultural Learnings of America to Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan, at a special Black Carpet screening in Philadelphia, and I am still laughing the next day.<br/><br/>Sacha Boren Cohen is a brilliant satirist, and instead of making fun of a person, he allows the person to make fun of themselves. This is witnessed most strikingly at the soon to be famous ""rodeo"" scene, which is as follows.<br/><br/>ATTENTION: THIS PARAGRAPH CONTAINS SPOILERS Borat and his producer arrange for him to sing the national anthem at rodeo. While he is getting ready to go out in the arena, he gets tips from an old cowboy, who tells him to ""cut off his mustache so he can at least pass for eye-tali-an."" When Borat tries to kiss him ""as his custom"", the guy says the only people who do that here are homos. Borat makes a comment that in his country they are rounded up and kept in jail, the rodeo guy says ""strung up? Well we're trying to do that here too!"" <br/><br/>All in all, this movie will be either loved, or hated, there is NO middle ground. Either people will laugh harder than they've ever laughed before, or be so outraged and disgusted that they will petition to have it removed from theaters."
"TheMovieExpert","Null","5","20","14 November 2006"," The most important review available
","It never ceases to amaze me just how much tripe people will put up with on this site. They post their ill-informed, uneducated, so-called ""reviews"" on this site without so much as a week's proper film schooling (unlike myself).<br/><br/>Therefore I shall post my review here, so you can benefit from my deep understanding of cinema without having to put up with other reviewers' trite and vacuous nonsense. Even young men who wear their baseball caps backwards might develop a slightly larger vocabulary if they pay close attention to my wise words. When you express your gratitude, feel free to recommend my advanced reviews to other people.<br/><br/>The film I would like to review for your benefit is titled ""Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"".<br/><br/>Clearly the film makers have gotten the title very, very wrong. It is far too long to remember easily and contains many childish grammatical mistakes. A far better title would have been ""Borat Visits America"", which explains the film content quite brilliantly in terms of correctness and conciseness. If the film-makers had consulted my vast experience on the subject of cinema, I could have suggested many other such improvements.<br/><br/>The film is a documentary that concerns Khazakhstani journalist Borat Sagdiyev. He is assigned to visit the United States and study the culture there in order to gain ideas how to improve Khazakhstan's economy. Clearly the country of Khazakhstan is intellectually and emotionally impoverished. I found it profoundly upsetting when Borat introduced his sister, for it turns out that she is a prostitute. Thankfully, the inhabitants intellectual and cultural development is so far behind that of the western world that they don't appear to exhibit any shame. I suspect their country desperately needs advanced critics such as myself in order to educate them culturally; it is tragic that I am unavailable to assist them since I am too busy educating westerners like yourself. The tragedy is palpable.<br/><br/>Whilst visiting the US, Borat takes every available opportunity to interview Americans. Unfortunately he has not mastered the English language very well and subsequently he tends to be often misconstrued as being rude. I found this to be equally tragic. The film would have been much better if the film-makers had hired the services of a great reviewer like myself as a script consultant in order to make this journalist appear much more professional. After about an hour of the film I decided that I couldn't bear seeing a professional in such difficult circumstances any more, so I left the theatre.<br/><br/>I would like to wrap up this review by noting that I understand the celluloid medium better than the film-makers (particularly Larry Charles who directed). They would benefit greatly from seeking my guidance in future.<br/><br/>I would also like to note that this film currently has a very high IMDb rating of 8.4 out of 10. Whilst the film did indeed have many interesting moments and is fully deserving of such a high score, I was incensed to find out that Bertolucci's ""La Commare secca"" had a paltry IMDb score of 6.8. Furthermore, I believe that it would have exuded more greatness had I directed it. Therefore I gave this film 1 out of 10. I believe the IMDb quite rightly gives my scores much more weight than other reviewers due their considerably greater importance. Hopefully, this should bring this film down a little. You may now continue to read less important dirges about this film, now that I have finally educated you properly."
"ender-71","10","5","20","22 September 2006"," Borat: So Good it's Arousing
","I went to the Black Carpet screening of Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan in Century City. It was jam-packed with people wanting to relish in the majesty of Borat, but they only had room for 294. Even though I got there 3 hours early, I was near the end of the line when they cut it off, saying they were full. But still, people demanded extra showings as they lined up by the hundreds outside the theater. It turns out that there was much more people than 294 that they had let in, so there were two showings -- one at 9:00 and one at midnight. I was apart of the latter.<br/><br/>The only word that could possibly be used to describe this movie is 'glorious.' Offensive to every race and only one gender, Borat is one of the funniest movies that has ever come out in the history of cinema, possibly the funniest. Sitting here, typing, it takes a lot of self control for me to keep all the good parts to myself, but then I realized there weren't any good parts. So I was thinking of telling you some of the great parts, but there weren't any of those either. The entire movie was just one f*cking fantastic film. I was laughing -- really laughing -- from start to finish. This is the best movie of 2006, and very likely the funniest movie of all time.<br/><br/>See it.<br/><br/>No, seriously, see it. I was at half-mast the whole time. Remember the first time you saw Scary Movie? Not Another Teen Movie? Old School? Caddyshack? Airplane? Combine all of those experiences into one, and you may have some idea of the pure and unadulterated ""win"" that is Borat.<br/><br/>Maybe."
"Misfit6381","10","7","32","27 September 2006"," Obscene, Offensive, Hilarious!
","My expectation for Borat was for it to be an offensive,crude and adult humor oriented movie. It was, and then some. But that doesn't begin to tell how deep this movie actually goes down the well of American culture. This movie is beyond the good chuckle humor found in your average comedies, and it is far beyond laugh-out-loud humor found in the once in a blue moon gem comedies. This movie is downright hysterical; and I mean that in the most literal sense of the word. At times I found it legitimately hard to breathe and unable to see the movie because of tears in my eyes from laughter. The reason this movie is so funny is because of two reasons. Firstly most of the people in the movie don't know they are in a movie. The actors film in real life settings where people are unaware that Borat is a fictitious character. And when he does something outrageous the reactions of the non-actors are ones that even the best actors could not replicate. Secondly Cohen exploits some of Americas biases, prejudices, ignorance and stupidity. This vaults this movie onto another plane. One in which only a select few movies should even be mentioned. This movie has depth beyond surface humor and jokes. It makes you think. But not a whole lot because you're laughing too hard and you're often worried about catching your breath. 10 out of 10"

I would recommend renting, then buying both seasons of the Ali G Show. (Any chance of a third season? What do you say HBO? I'm sure there are a few interviews left) If this movie is patterned after the show it can't miss! The trailer seems near perfect. Found a few conflicting opening dates for the film; can anyone confirm opening date for Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan. Sacha, change nothing.

"davideo-2","10","4","15","5 December 2006"," Unrelentingly outrageous and daring but unbelievably funny as a result
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>Borat (Sascha Baron Cohen) opens his film in a village in his impoverished homeland of Kazahkstan, from which he plans to travel to America and film a documentary of him and his friend Azamet (Ken Davitian) exploring the American way of life and trying to blend in. Unfortunately it proves to be a none stop assault of very embarrassing cultural misunderstandings and differences which Borat cluelessly stumbles from one to another of. Things get even more anarchic when Borat develops a crazy dream of marrying Pamela Anderson after seeing her on Baywatch and gets Azamet to start travelling, in their ice cream van, to California instead of New York.<br/><br/>Four years after the Ali G movie proved to be a (fairly) big success at the pictures, Sascha Baron Cohen now delivers a movie adaptation of his second comic creation Borat, who premiered on an episode of Da Ali G Show (but never proved to be quite as successful or influential!) Having said that though, the cards of fortune have been reversed for Borat here, because his movie proves to be just a little bit funnier than Ali G Indahouse, which means it's quite possibly one of the funniest films I've ever seen.<br/><br/>The film simply refuses to draw a line at what too outrageous is, with some (hilariously funny) but cringe inducing jokes involving sex and genatalia, bodily functions, unintentional offensiveness and outright arrestable behaviour. It's not hard to believe that the Kazahkstani locals (amongst others) at the beginning of the film could have been exploited by the film-makers into making complete fools of themselves for peanuts and if this is true you can't help but feel sorry for them but the simple fact is no matter what lines the film crosses, no matter what boundaries it's willing to break, it just never stops being anything less than laugh out loud hilarious.<br/><br/>Probably the first high light of his career, Larry Charles has here delivered a film that he will come to always be remembered by. So guide Borat into your funny bone and let him take you for a drive. *****"

I can understand going to see a film that you know nothing about and hating it, but I have a feeling that the awful reviews are coming from those who knew what to expect, and just wanted to affirm their pre-conceived notion of the film. So, the joke's on you 1 and 2 star reviewers (you went to see Borat! hahahaha). This film is a landmark demonstration of the ignorance found throughout our country (but, this movie could have been made anywhere so this is not a knock on the US). And yes, some of it is staged and cut in ways to drive the point home. But, if you can't chuckle at the absurdity of Cohen's character, then you my friend, have no sense of humor and should stick to Knock Knock jokes and reruns of Everybody Loves Raymond. Borat is the year's best comedy hands down. If you don't take yourself too seriously, and understand that comedy is not always pretty, then Borat is for you...It's very nice! Put on your thick skin and go to the theatres and just enjoy it. Cohen's only agenda is to make people laugh, and he succeeded big time. High five!"

"revjmp","8","3","10","5 November 2006"," apolitically enlightening
","The genius of ""Borat"" is its creator's total willingness to explore and step across any boundary. You'll see things in this film you haven't seen before -- quite a feat in a media-saturated age. (Some will say there's a *reason* you haven't seen these things.) Borat himself is an innocent clown, one whose naivete draws responses from the other characters that illuminate who we are, for better and worse. But what sets it apart and makes it far funnier than the mindless ""Jackass"" and grim Michael Moore genres cited by the earlier poster, is the way ""Borat"" seems basically to like even those it skewers, showing the basic humanity even of all-too-easy targets of the drearily predictable Left (Texans, suburbanites, evangelical Christians). Brainless stupidity drives ""Jackass,"" and preconceived political viewpoints drive Moore. Heart and fondness guide ""Borat,"" and that makes it a lot more interesting and more significant and gives Cohen a chance to last a lot longer.<br/><br/>It would be a shame, and missing the point, if a film as fresh as ""Borat"" were co-opted, as the previous poster suggests, by a ""left-wing"" demographic or even ""20-to-30-year-olds;"" its energy is youthful, but that places it in no particular political camp. There's a healthy self-parody even its parody of Bush supporters, and ""Borat"" rivals ""The Simpsons"" in the way it aims barbs more or less at everybody. Feminism and doctrinaire political correctness take hearty and long overdue beatings, for instance, along with seedy hotel clerks, idiotic gang-banger dress styles, frat-boy drunkenness and more. But the film resists stupid cheap shots at Southerners, shows in its goofy way the efficacy of some Christian beliefs, and in general seems to say that everybody's trying in his or her own way, and that that matters. <br/><br/>Last but not least, it's refreshing to see an enormously fat man jiggling naked on the screen. Another taboo dispensed with! Now, off to make sex with sister for enjoyment."

I really think that if you have never seen Borat before, you will like the movie even more than the rest of us who are big fans. Just the shock of meeting Borat for the first time should keep you laughing thru the whole film.<br/><br/>The things I liked about the film were, seeing his home village and the reaction of the different people he meets during his travels. He almost got hit by some of the people in New York, while the people at his dinner party seemed to give him the benefit of a doubt, up to the point where he brings in a prostitute. Of course some of the people are just down right morons, like the old guy at the rodeo and the three college stooges in the RV. Now I know why the raised the drinking age to 21 in this country.

I had never laughed all the way through a film before watching 'Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan'. Borat is recruited by the Kazakhstan government to make a documentary about American (The greatest nation on earth according to Borat) life to help improve his home land. Borat begins his journey in New York through to California meeting real people and putting them through awkward situations, although some situations and meetings are staged, nevertheless it is still incredibly funny! The film contains racism, foul language, prejudice and nudity all blended in to 1 hour and 25 minutes of controversy.

","After seeing this movie and practically falling in love with it, I hate to hear that an entire country is suing Sacha Baron Cohen. Clearly it is a film that is fictitious in plot. Although the country of Kazachstan exists, I find it ridiculous that anyone could absolutely BELIEVE that the people of Kazachstan are anything like that. The people are depicted that way in order to favor Borat's character. Movies are made about America all the time with fictitious presidents and people. I don't see any Americans suing a filmmaker because they were insulted by a stereotype. This film is very poignant and it reveals more disturbing things about America than it does about Kazachstan. I'll be honest. I actually had to ask a friend if Kazachstan was real because I didn't know how real Borat was going to be in the movie. Knowing that it is a real country just makes it funnier. I wish they did not feel so insulted by this film. If anything, now more people are aware of its existence. I highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. ESPECIALLY PARTISANS! I was more insulted by things said by Americans in the film. I was only humorer by anything relating to Kazachstan. There's such a thing as suspension of disbelief. People should walk into EVERY movie with that suspension. I hope everyone, if they don't love it, at least understands what this movie is about. As humorous as it is, it is really very deep. It doesn't leave room to dwell on petty things such as, ""the people of Kazachstan could really use an education,"" because it's not about that and it never makes it a subject. Watch it when it premieres. You'll see what I'm talking about."

Fans of the show will be very pleased with the movie. It stays true to the character we've come to love over the years. However you don't need to be a fan of the show to enjoy this movie. The presentation is such that you can just jump right in to the character and enjoy it, but knowing the character first does enhance the experience.<br/><br/>No movie in recent memory has been filled with so many non stop laughs. People worried about a repeat of the somewhat disappointing Ali G film need not worry. To some people this movie could be extremely offensive, they didn't pull any punches, this is the same balls to the wall character Borat has always been. Hopefully there won't be any further edits to the film before it see's national release. I'll definitely be seeing the film again, possibly several times, and I can't wait for the DVD release."

Mr. Cohen has created in BORAT one of the most memorable film icons of all time.<br/><br/>November 3rd everywhere, or find another screening. Don't miss this film. It is one of the funniest experiences I have ever had in my whole life. Comic brilliance.<br/><br/>A warning though: this film contains real footage of actual Americans saying some terribly bigoted and racist things about many different types of people. You will feel sorry for these people. The interviews are candid, the camera is never hidden. They know what they were saying. Yet you cannot help but feel sorry for these fools anyway. And as for the Anti-Semetic nature of many situations in BORAT, please remember one thing. Sacha Baron Cohen is Jewish himself. It is all a big joke designed to reveal the true nature some people foster under their skin. Borat's comments about Jews are merely to instigate these reactions. Very clever indeed.<br/><br/>A wonderful film that is beautifully shot and masterly edited. DO NOT MISS IT. The entire crowd was speechless after the movie ended. Brilliant!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

","This false documentary about a Kazakhstan's journalist that is crossing America (or the U.S and A, to be more specific!) to do a cultural research to improve is own country is just hilarious! I already knew Sacha Baron Cohen's character Borat from the ""Ali G"" series, so I really was expecting something like that: funny from the first to the last minute! <br/><br/>The movie is of course a caricature of Kazakhstan, but in many moments it also makes fun of the Americans and their way of life it's made with some refinement, but it's done! Do you want an example? When ""Borat"" is singing a stupid lyric with American Anthem's music or when he's learning some good manners to be at a dinner's party In fact, I'm start thinking that the Kazakhstan's character ""Borat"" is just an excuse to make fun out of the Americans! <br/><br/>The footage and the music are also very good. They make a great ambiance to this character and really made me remind some old Soviet movie from the 80's!<br/><br/>Basically it's another great work from Sacha Baron Cohen. Now that he made two movies based on his own characters (Ali G and Borat), can we expect another one for his other character, Bruno, the fashionable homosexual?"
"mitja-malnar","8","3","11","15 November 2006"," Cohen holds the mirror for us all.
","You have to admit that Borat is really something special. I wouldn't say the film is original, that no one thought of something like this before (Czech Dream, 2004), but it has a far-reaching consequences for comedy genre. Not only that it is hilarious, it also has some lessons for us all. There is not a doubt in my mind, that after megalomaniacal success, there will be raining with similar comedy movies. Cohen knew very well, that he can pull this one off only in USA. Most Americans aren't interested in the world outside their borders. Not knowing where many of the countries are, let alone knowing how people live there, allowed those Americans in the film really believe that a person like Borat could actually exist. If we all laugh at Cohen at first, now it's the other way around. If you aren't offended by some of Borat's humor - and you shouldn't be - you can see what is really the target here. It's stupidity. And what makes this movie great? Because it serves us the point he is trying to make with just that. Stupidity. We all should laugh not only to ""some stereotype"", but also to ourself for believing in it. Let's all look in the mirror an come to terms with ourselves, we will be better people for it. Knowledge, respect amongst people is a foundation to world peace. Peace everybody."
"Anonymous_Maxine","9","3","11","14 November 2006"," Funniest movie of the year? Quite possibly. Funniest movie ever? Not even close.
","I had heard countless glowing reviews of the Borat movie in newspapers and on TV and on the radio for weeks before I saw it, and almost every single review I heard or saw or read praised the sheer comedic genius of the movie, claiming that it was not only the best movie of the year, but the best movie ever made. Needless to say, this brought my expectations to nearly astronomical proportions, and by the time I saw it I was nearly vibrating with anticipation. I suppose the problem may have been that my expectations had been raised so high, combined with the fact that I stupidly brought my girlfriend with me to see it, but while I did find many parts of the movie side-splittingly hilarious, there were too many others that just fell completely flat or that once again trudged through standard scenes that I had hoped to never again see in any movie ever again at any time for any reason anywhere ever. <br/><br/>As one giant, hideously obese, and bestially hairy example, I had hoped that the Jackass movie was the first and last time that I would see a hairy, naked fat man in a film for comedic purposes, but Borat shattered my dreams. Now, I can handle nudity in the movies, even male nudity, even unattractive male nudity, but I just have no desire or reason to watch a naked fat man wrestling a naked skinny man in a movie, especially in a fight that involves the two men inadvertently getting into, and then gyrating in, numerous sexual positions. In fact, until they finally make Stephen King's Dark Tower series into movies, I don't ever want to see naked men fighting in a movie until The Drawing of the Three.<br/><br/>That being said, I suppose I should not waste too much time complaining about specific scenes that I yawned through, because the movie really does have a tremendous amount of comic genius in it. Borat's discovery that women in America are able to choose who they will or will not have sex with is one of the funniest things I've seen in a movie in years, as is his rendition of the Kazakhstan national anthem, sung to the tune of the American national anthem.<br/><br/>This scene, incidentally, perfectly illustrates the technique that Sacha Baron Cohen uses for the surprisingly prevalent social commentary in the movie. The script and the character of Borat will obviously attract dozens of interest groups interested in lawsuits because they don't see the comedy in the movie or because they just can't overlook the slurs that Borat makes (and he makes a LOT, even in giving interviews to reporters about the movie. I heard an interview of him with Theresa Strosser for the Adam Carolla morning show in which, after telling her that in his country, having women journalists is ""like to give a monkey a gun,"" he fled in blind fear when he found out she was Jewish), so it comes to my mind that it is really sad that so many people will take the literal meaning and ignore the obvious comment on such things that really exist in society.<br/><br/>Consider this, Borat and his friend run in sheer terror in the middle of the night out of the house of a sweet, elderly Jewish couple who have taken them in for the night, petrified with fear for their lives. So here's my question - Who looks ridiculous because of this, Jewish people, or the people that are afraid of them?<br/><br/>I found the national anthem scene to be one of the more interesting scenes, because Borat is making a very clear comment on the political beliefs of people in middle America (and maybe all of America), although I think that this message was lost on a lot of American audiences, just like it was on his live audience that day. When Borat exclaims, ""I support your war of terror!"" not only is there no pause or awkward looks about his Freudian slip, I suppose you could say, but the audience immediately bursts into applause. I'm not sure if this is meant to be a comment on the general intelligence levels of Bush supporters or on their immediate, thoughtless adherence to people and things and ideas that are familiar and agree with tradition, but the scene illustrates that there is a lot more going on here than some Jewish guy making Jew jokes with a heavy Kazakhstani accent.<br/><br/>At any rate, what you have here is not necessarily a movie that you will either love or hate, but that you will understand the people who feel exactly the opposite way you do, regardless of how much you disagree with them. Like every terrible, unsolvable controversy, there is no easy solution to Borat because both sides have a pretty strong argument, and there is no definitive answer to solve the debate. Yes, it is a brilliant comedy that will more than likely make you just about fall out of your chair laughing several times, but yes, it can also be highly offensive. <br/><br/>The real question is, can you watch a movie like this and walk away knowing there exist in the real world things that need to be changed, or is your first thought that we ought to fly over and take out the evildoer(s)?"
"tedgyz","9","3","11","14 November 2006"," Both hilarious and insightful
","If laughing your face off in a theater is any indication of a good comedy, then Borat is a great comedy. Yet, it has a serious hidden message. With the premise of an ignorant foreigner, Borat uncovers the dark underbelly of racist America. The movie is brilliant in making a mockumentary with a message. One one level, I would call it Jackass with a purpose. Some of the stunts Cohen pulls are dangerous. When he isn't engaged in Stooge-like gaffs, he incites people to threaten physical harm. Yet, I laughed through the whole thing.<br/><br/>I rate this movie a 9 instead of 10 because the humor is often crude and may offend a large portion of America. But I think that is what it was meant to do.<br/><br/>NICE! Great Success!"

It's terrific! I was still laughing the next morning. It's a deeply scathing satire, not on Kazahkis, but on Americans. You won't believe the lengths the actors go to for this film. The big debate will be who is worse, the ultra-crude almost uncivilized Borat, or the red-state Americans he interacts with. At least for Borat, we can say he doesn't know any better. There is also a lot of fun with a chicken and a bear and the words to the Kaxakhi ""national anthem"" are worth memorizing. You have to see this movie."

","Starring Sacha Baron Cohen.<br/><br/>This movie left a lasting impression on me that most don't. Not because anything extremely important was said, but because this was so funny. This movie was nonstop funny, and quite consistently hilarious. The plot of the film is that a TV reporter from third world country Kazakhstan, Borat, is going to America to film a documentary on how to renovate his country. An amazing thing that Sacha does with this character is he manages to make him extremely likable, but meanwhile he is a huge racist, chauvinist, anti-Semite and is just plain politically incorrect. Borat along with a partner Kazakhstani go around clueless learning what to do and what not to do. My favorite scene in the film is one at an etiquette school, where Borat shows pictures of his son's genitals and poops in a bag. You don't want to miss this very wrong, but oh so hilarious ""documentary"".<br/><br/>My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 81 mins.

"DKosty123","9","3","11","10 November 2006"," Excellent Off-Beat Comedy
","This is one of those laugh out loud films that are really enjoyable but never get many Oscar nods. After I wrote this, the Academy gave it no awards. It is mainly Sasha Cohen's show although the support players he plays off do an incredible job but they are clearly support. Cohen is better in support in Taladega Nights, but proves he can carry a film here.<br/><br/>Borat is portrayed as a TV reporter in his Eastern Europe home country. This starts in his country with a tour of his home town & that he is headed for America to learn how American Comedy works for his home country. The opening sequence is funny & sets the tone for the theme of travel which is a successful theme for many successful past movies by others.<br/><br/>Borat & his traveling companion come via a circuitous route to NYC. There is a hilarious sequence in a NY Subway & it gets funnier from there. In the hotel, Borat sees a Baywatch re-run & falls in love with Pamela Sue Anderson. This is the hook that sets the tone for all that is to come. His pursuit of meeting her takes many twists & turns & every one of them is laugh out loud hilarious. <br/><br/>The spoiler is that he does finally meet her, & what he does then is funny too. Borat takes amazing driving lessons, & then they do a car lot routine that is the funniest one I have seen (even better than Kurt Russells USED CARS from the 1980's).<br/><br/>What makes this film work so well in addition to the travel theme is the UN-predictable behavior of Borat. This is so well done that at times, even the other actors seem surprised by what Cohen's character does. This film has spontaneity which is fantastic. Some of the spontaneity was accomplished through unorthodox filming but that is an illustration of comedic genius.<br/><br/>It has some strange sequences which you have to see the movie to believe. It also has a great comedic pace. It runs around 90 minutes which is what the most successful comedy films of all time usually ran. This means it doesn't bog down & if a sequence is in danger of being too long, it stops before that happens. <br/><br/>This film is well worth the 90 minutes, classic comedy done right."

","""Borat!: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"" Brian Murphy-Evanston RoundTable. Sacha Baron Cohen, the London-born, Cambridge--educated comedian responsible for the brazenly funny ""Da Ali G Show,"" has made a career embodying clueless characters. His trio of journalist incarnations, including hip-hop wannabe Ali G, flamboyantly gay fashion correspondent Bruno, and naïve, Kazak reporter Borat Sagdiyev, through their shockingly candid questions and bizarre behavior, rile the tempers and wrest the unholy truths from their unwitting subjects. With ""Borat!..,"" Cohen has created the funniest, creatively offensive film of the year, and the most intelligent ""dumb"" film since ""South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut."" The film blends the line between reality and fiction, documentary and scripted action. While Cohen's guerilla-style interviews remain intact, they are weaved together by a fictional story involving the Kazak government sending Borat and his television producer, Azamat Bagatov (Ken Davatian) on a trip to the United States to learn from the superpower.<br/><br/>Kazakhstan is presented in the film as a depressed, backwards country, which led to calls for boycotts from its citizens and the government. After watching the first five minutes of the film, it is easy to see why the moderate, western-leaning country had issues with Cohen's characterizations.<br/><br/>We are first introduced to Borat in his small village, preparing to depart for America. He speaks with affection concerning his town while pointing out its problems. Along the way, we meet his sneering neighbor, mother, ill-tempered wife, and after the two engage in a deep kiss, his sister. He introduces us to local Kazak ceremonies, such as ""The Running of the Jew 2004"" (an event fabricated by the Jewish Cohen for satirical purposes), which is as funny as it is intentionally offensive.<br/><br/>The film takes off when Borat and Azamat reach America, traveling the country in an ice cream truck, a live bear riding shotgun (seriously), seeking advice from true Americans on their way to Los Angeles. Borat, having fallen in love with Pamela Anderson after seeing an episode of ""Baywatch"" in his hotel room, hopes to marry the star and bring her back to Kazakhstan.<br/><br/>Without giving away any of the gags, Borat terrorizes (with irony, not WMD's, mind you) a humor coach, a driving instructor, rodeo attendants, elitist guests at a dinner party, mortgage brokers at a hotel conference, security guards, and pretty much any one he tries to greet by giving a kiss on the cheek. Inconceivably, Pamela Anderson makes an uncredited cameo at the film's end, and whether the conclusion was real or staged remains to be seen (I vote for the latter).<br/><br/>Despite his sexism, bigotry and anti-Semitism, when put up against Americans who are not in on the joke, Borat miraculously escapes as a sympathetic character. His ignorance is played by Cohen as an almost childlike innocence, and his joyful exuberance is infectious. Furthermore, we realize Borat's idiocy is an act. Sadly, the same cannot be said about the disturbing array of homophobic southerners, racist Americans and misogynistic frat boys he meets along the way.<br/><br/>Doubters of Cohen's relevance can look to Cannes, among the dozens of other prestigious film festivals, who have championed the film at first screening. Doubters of Cohen's talents and/or dedication to his craft can look to his talk show promotions and film screenings, both of which Cohen has refused to attend other than in full-on Borat method mode. He is like Andy Kaufman with a punch line. And, much like the legendary comedian, he refuses to pull punches, infuriating those he involves for our amusement."

","Brilliant. Inspired. Ballsy beyond belief. Sasha Baron Cohen, the Evil Knievel of modern comedy, takes so many chances he's bound to miss sometimes but there aren't too many misses in this, his first starring movie. Gifted at the level of Robin Williams or Jonathan Winters or Steve Wright or Groucho Marx, Cohen possesses that rare ability to see the same world as we do, swallow it, and regurgitate back bizarre silly reflections that simultaneously make you laugh out loud, tickle your soul and show you the real work left for humanity. Some of the gags in this movie are so one of a kind, so sui generis, we might never see their like again. The only sad part is that BORAT becoming famous lessens the chance that there will ever be another BORAT movie with as much existential guerrilla comedy.

","(Synopsis) Borat Sagdiyev (Sacha Baron Cohen) is a TV reporter of a popular show in Kazakhstan. He is sent to America by his government to make a documentary about American society and culture. Borat takes a course in New York City to understand American humor. While watching Baywatch on TV, Borat discovers how beautiful our women are in the form of C. J. Parker (Pamela Anderson). He decides to go on a cross-country road trip to California in a quest to make her his wife and take her back to his country. Borat begins his journey and encounters a country full of strange and wonderful Americans. HIGH FIVE! <br/><br/>(My Comment) The movie begins with Borat showing his hometown with all the great stuff you can do there, such as playing ping pong, dancing, sun-bathing, having sex with the #4 prostitute in all of Kazakhstan, who happens to be his sister. You see that Borat comes from a poor and backward country, so you can understand the problems he encounters when he comes to America. Borat's strange customs are very odd to Americans, and he is like a fish out of water. One thing that you must understand about this movie is that most of the movie is about laughing at negative stereotypes, and it is not Politically Correct. Borat's slapstick and toilet humor takes on America's social ills. The entire film contains offensive humor and gags that are anti-Semitic, gay bashing, racist, prejudice, male nudity, and any other thing that is controversial. The two nude men wresting scene is funny and over the top, but you need to close your eyes when this scene comes on so you will not have that memory in your brain. The movie includes both straight comedy and segments filmed like a ""Candid-Camera show"" with an unsuspecting victim ""Punked show"" conclusion. You will find some of the reactions interesting. This is one of those movies that you will love or hate, no in between. You will either laugh during the entire movie or you will be so disgusted and outraged that you will leave the theater. I was one that laughed during the whole movie. The movie was rated R, but I think it should be higher like 3Rs (Rude, Racist, & Ridicules). (20th Century Fox, Run time 1:22, Rated R) (8/10)"

","This movie was so bad on so many levels that I had to write about it.<br/><br/>Some people say that the movie is ""racist"" and ""sexist."" That's not true. What it is, is an idiotic attempt to make fun of people who are supposed to be racist and sexist, but who probably aren't. And it does this by painting an entire country, Kazakhstan, as racist and sexist. That's bad enough--and sickeningly ironic, by the way, precisely because it makes use of the very sort of bigoted tendencies in making fun of racists and sexists. Basically, you're supposed to laugh at the idiotic, racist, sexist Americans by seeing how they are like the idiotic, racist, sexist people of Kazakhstan. This joke is completely unfunny because you can't begin to take the stereotype seriously. If you can't take the stereotype seriously, you can't take Cohen's method of mockery seriously. It ends up being just stupid.<br/><br/>A lot of people have said this film is politically incorrect. That's not true either. It's aggressively, in-your-face politically correct. It is the political correctness of a too-clever, potty-mouthed 14-year-old boy. It doesn't frown moralistically at political incorrectness, like college professors; it doesn't mock it contemptuously, like Michael Moore or college students; the movie mocks it using stupid crudity. And this really is offensive, because in the process it offends the real dignity of real people. No wonder Cohen is being sued. This is one reason he's sometimes called an elitist. The other reason of course is that he manages to put down a whole nation he obviously thinks he's better than.<br/><br/>But the movie is also offensive in the old fashioned sense of ridiculously unfunny scatological and homosexual ""humor""--which isn't funny at all. The ""humor"" is offensive, and it's offensive that we're supposed to find it funny. An elitist that makes use of this sort of bottom-feeding ""humor""--the irony is appalling.<br/><br/>What's most disappointing to me, though, and what really moves me to write, isn't how bad the movie is, but the fact that it got such an amazingly high rating on the TomatoMeter and the IMDb average rating. What is this world coming to? If ""Borat"" is supposed to be the best comedy in years, we must be closer to the apocalypse than I thought."

Sasha Cohen-the satirist-is laughing right along with us-at his ""brilliance"".He,Borat, becomes a sad and quote-lovable-unquote fish out of water.I am busting a gut over here.Sasha Cohen presents a complex movie,and I salute his intention.Ultimately- I hate Sasha Cohen.That said,this is a pretty good travel movie.A partially hateful fraud.Perhaps an acceptable documentary.It ultimately fails-although it is a valiant attempt at street-theater, with Cohen's inspired attempt to portray Borat's eastern European ""friendliness"" on the streets and subways of urban, and paranoid New York City."
"dromasca","8","2","6","26 December 2006"," testing the limits of satire and hidden camera movies
","In the very heated debates this movie has generated one aspect seems to be forgotten very easily. The genre 'Borat' plays with is by no means new, it is the good old practical jokes film, where real persons are filmed on hidden camera exposing their real character when they are not aware about the presence of the camera. It's only that here the victims of the authors of Borat do know that they are on camera, but they believe that 's for a different reason.<br/><br/>The whole difference lies in the purpose. The authors have chosen to present a manifesto about today's America and the way it relates to other cultures, to visitors and to the minorities living in the US. Does it look bad? Does it look worse than it really is - certainly it does, but yet the existence or racial prejudice, religious bigotry or intolerance is not a matter of numbers, and it is fair game in the satiric game. This is what shows like SNL are doing in the US for ages.<br/><br/>The style of the movie is a complete opposite of the Hollywood comedy style. No exact script, improvisation, all is a huge practical joke with a true background. Everybody is being laughed at, including the characters of movie itself, and the acting of Sacha Baron Cohen is perfect, not only by its comic balance, but also or especially taking into account the permanent stress and sometimes real danger he must have worked under during the making of the whole movie. 'Borat' is not a perfect film, but it is the genre of comic movie that only a democracy can afford and a democracy needs."

","I am a bit disappointed, because i was expecting something more real concerning the Kazach reality. In fact, the only thing, what Kazach was, were the national flag, the names (but those can be any Russian names). All other images from Kazachstania were absolutely nothing to do with Kazachtan. I would expect, that it was filmed somewhere in Ukraine Carpatia region. Kazachs are also mongoloid types, but those faces from the movie were quiet European. (an other minor example are the guys standing on the horses at the end of the movie: a typical scene from the Hungarian lowlands, Central Europe) I think, this is a funny movie, but throws a false image on what the reality is about Kazachs and their country. Nevertheless, the US reality presented in the movie is more to do with what I was expecting from it. So watch with care, Kazachstania is different."

","This review contains a spoiler, but I will make sure you know exactly which paragraph to skip.<br/><br/>Borat is basically a documentary about real people reacting to a man behaving very strangely.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what rating to give this movie. Up until one part near the ending, I might have given it a 7. After the ending I might have given it a 1. Had I known then what I know now, I might have given it a 10. To find out what I'm talking about scroll down past the warning below.<br/><br/>Borat is just a character played by the actor Allie G. He has several characters that he plays on his TV show, the silliest of which is a British rapper who says ""Iz"" instead of ""am"" or ""are"".<br/><br/>(Note; in the Cinema, I saw a stand-up cut-out of Borat with two bikini-clad women, with the faces cut out so you could take photos behind it.) Borat was born in Kazakstan. His depiction of Kazakstan, I suspect, bears no resemblance to the actual country. The character is basically designed to offend, Any and anger everyone he comes across. Borat is anti-Semitic, sexist (by western standards), superstitious (as evidenced by his reaction to gypsies), gross, and constantly confused by American technology and customs.<br/><br/>Interestingly, the first few people he meets in New Yourk are extremely rude, much ruder than I could imagine anyone in Melbourne being, even with Borat. (We're not perfect, but the first man he meets in the subway introduces himself in a way I can't repeat on IMDb.) He also becomes obsessed with a certain actress who once played a lifeguard.<br/><br/>It's further interesting the number of people in America he DOESN'T offend with anti-Semite and pro-war statements. (At one point, while announcing Kazakstan's support of ""Your War of Terror"", he has to try very hard to create an awkward silence) At one point he stays in a Bed & Breakfast hosted by a nice elderly Jewish couple. I was cringing, thinking ""Don't be too mean to these people"". He wasn't too mean to their face, but he did do a bad Blair Witch spoof.<br/><br/>The... What do you want to call it? ""Best""? ""Worst""? ""Most Offensive""? ""funnigest""? I'll go with ""Worst"".<br/><br/>The 'worst' part of the movie is when he and his producer are fighting naked. I suspect they gave Borat a much larger censor bar than was necessary. Strangely, his producer didn't get a censor bar at all.<br/><br/>If you didn't like ""South Park; Bigger, Longer & Uncut"", avoid this movie like the plague. Otherwise, enjoy! <br/><br/>.<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>DO NOT READ THE BELOW! DO NOT READ THE BELOW!<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>.

","I'm just out of the theater near Sydney Australia. I came out of the theater with very mixed feelings about the movie. I had never been aware of this guy existence(character or actor) but usually I am open to most things. I certainly had quite a few laughs during the screening session. Just the same about half way through I really wanted to be somewhere else. My out-bringing (like my feelings)was quite mixed with a religious spell during my late teens with some relapse later on but somehow kept away from any during the second part of my life that is about three decades. I have rolled in the dirt many times and feel rather immune from it, yet something about this movie did not sound right. As the movie ran in Sydney perhaps for its fourth week the crowd on the day was reduced to 7 people in our session; this in my view did not foster the right atmosphere. We were 2 couples, my wife usually fairly straight, to my amazement had a reasonable good time; as for my mate, he had definitely a negative experience but a ""10"" for his wife of a totally different conviction (a passionate reader). So our conversation around our supper table following the screening was rather animated! Bakc home I got straight onto IMDb and read all those wonderful reviews and had to go through a few pages to see some negative feedback. No, I did not read 64 pages of reviews, but enough to see how divided people could be about this film. Many review seemed quite intelligent on both sides of the feelings. And I must say I was uncomfortable to situate myself in this debate. As some one said in one review ""you ""must"" like this movie to be cool"" or something to this effect. I must admit that today social issues demand a lot more examination as we live in an ever more mixing and moving population. Examination and willingness to accommodate each others despite very contradicting background and values. Therefore such confrontation of our feelings if we care to explore its implication may have very positive outcome. But the point here is to try to see beyond the impact of what we are dished out and that may be a thick layer of dirt over our eyes and mind to deal with! I did laugh I did get bored I did get nauseated I did talk about I don't want to rate it I do not regret to watch it I don't want to see it again I don't think it was a waste of my time Byt I don't want to recommend it to anyone And I don't think anyone cares whether I do or not.

In one respect this is pure offence, in other you can see the comedian taking some risks.<br/><br/>If anything I kind of wish he had taken more risks (there is a scene when a chicken might be killed, but of course animals can't be hurt, casual racism is OK, but animals can't be hurt).<br/><br/>There is a scene where a fat-black prostitute crashes a dinner party, and this would be great if Woody Allen and Larry David hadn't already done this.<br/><br/>However kudos is due to anyone who manages to offend a rodeo crowd in the manner that Borat does, as well as the naked wrestling scene, which I really hope I never have to watch again.<br/><br/>Well done Peter Baynham (Armando Ianucci fans will know the name) and the ever talented Larry Charles for making this and hopefully making some cash.<br/><br/>It could have been better, but watch it with some mates after a few and it will make you laugh."
"padutchland-1","Null","2","6","15 November 2006"," Funny - but perhaps not for all viewers
","Just a few comments on the type of movie itself. You can read about the story from the many other commentaries. Please read to the end before you judge my comments. I had some younger friends of the family drag me to the movies to see this movie. They said it was the funniest they had ever seen and wanted me to see it, since I was a movie buff. OK, they are in their twenties and I am significantly older (enough said). I say this just to put my comments in perspective. Overall, I can say yes, the movie had a good number of funny scenes. However, I would hardly classify it as the funniest movie ever. Anyone who says that has not seen a broad range of comedies. Furthermore, it depends heavily on bathroom type humor (going poo-poo, etc - you get the idea), and a bit of slapstick such as Borat (Sacha Cohen) wrestling around the motel room with a naked, fat, hairy man. Were there funny skits? Sure, and I have nothing against such types of humor if, they are used sparingly to support the thought process involved in enjoying genuine comedy. However, the movie was overloaded with low brow humor. I think it was George Burns (lived to be almost 100) or some other elder statesman of comedy who said: ""anyone can be funny using bathroom humor. But if you have to depend on it, you are no comedian"". There was a scene, probably as a nod to slapstick, where Borat's friend Azamat (Ken Davitian) appears dressed as Oliver Hardy (of Laurel and Hardy fame). He tells Borat ""here's another fine mess you've gotten me into"". Borat says something about him looking like Hitler and it will escape most younger folks who have never heard of Oliver Hardy, once part of the most famous and successful slapstick comedy team in the world. We had a discussion as viewers as to whether the scenes in this movie were staged or real. Did any of these people actually think they were part of a real documentary, not a comedy movie? I honestly don't know. Some parts were obviously staged, but other parts had people on camera who would never want to be part of such a movie, due to their reputation. Were they knowingly part of it or will the company be seeing law suits from them? The scenes of Borat's home village were probably shot in Mexico, not the MidEast. My opinion of the movie is that it is a movie more for younger people (although older people trying to look hip may pretend to wow with it). Humor in the entertainment industry has been going more toward a base humor over many years. So it stands to reason that today's young people (having been less exposed to humor where one has to consider lines and skits to enjoy, versus the over exposure of reflex bathroom type humor) will find the movie funnier than those who have experienced wider types of humor over time. Today's youth is no better or worse than previous generations - give them quality entertainment and they will recognize and enjoy it. While this movie has some laughs, it is not a quality challenge to anyone's funny-bone. So - is it worth seeing? If you are easily offended, don't go. It is often the same humor formerly experienced only in night club acts. And yet, at the same time and in different ways, it offers an unusual approach to presenting humor on the screen. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder after all. Regardless of what youthful viewers are saying, I don't see it as ""the funniest thing ever"". I don't think it will become a classic of comedy. I do think it might develop a kind of cult type status such as Rocky Horror. Although I doubt it will last as long as Rocky Horror (1975). Time will tell. Borat does not have the deeper quality of a Forrest Gump or scenes of the Griswold's vacations or Caddyshack. Still, having presented the negatives the question remains, should you go see it? I'd say yes, what the heck! Go see it, as there are many funny parts to be sure. You will come away with a good number of laughs and some great quotes to quip with your friends. That is certainly worth the price of admission. Enjoy!"

","Ali G & Borat have been on the British TV for quite a few years. Ali G in particular was hilarious when it started, Borat was a close second.

On the big screen, particularly when you try to stretch it for 80+ minutes, it starts to get tedious. I would highly recommend this movie to people who have never seen Ali G / Borat before - to the others I would suggest buy the DVD of the first series of Ali G and watch it again and again, and I promise it will be the funniest thing you have ever seen."

The movie contains some key elements of Kusturica's other movies mixed with some Michael Moore documentary, some Jackass. A strange mix, but not so impressive that it might seam. Boran's village is, I can say for sure, a typical Romanians gypsies one. The poor people really envoy being joked at. It's funny for me to listen to the Romanian taking on the background. Many Romanians were outraged by this movie, but I'm sure not of them. If you what carefully, the joke is on the American style of life. It's a movie to see, it's not a good movie, it's just a movie.

","This movie had the potential to be a ten. I can completely understand how in some people's minds it was a smash, but I think the average person would come away with the perspective I did--complete confusion.<br/><br/>I love Da Ali G show and I am a fan of this type of humor, but this movie really crossed some lines. Portions of it should not have been allowed into theaters. I am surprised at how leftist a lot of the reviews of this movie have been. This movie contains a lot of hilarious moments, but the average viewer should keep some things in mind: The film making process was deceptive and contained a lot of exploitation of certain people in it. Some of it legitimately pointed out problems with American Society, but a lot of it was just crude.<br/><br/>The graphic nature of certain scenes was unnecessarily excessive. It could be very offensive to a lot of people, and that has been ignored in the rating process.<br/><br/>The racial comedy smashed walls that people died to build. On a day that marked the ground breaking of the MLK Jr Memorial on the National Mall, it is important to recognize that.<br/><br/>Taking those things into consideration, it was not the intention (in my opinion) of the film maker to be overly offensive. However, the finished product definitely can be seen as offensive. A lot of this movie was just not needed; that takes away from so much of the comedic genius. This movie gets a soft 6 for good comedy--not great comedy--and the sense of confusion it will leave you with when you walk out of the theater. It doesn't raise the question of what is wrong with our society like it should have, but rather the question of how did this film get onto a big screen?"

"monk_e_fish","7","2","6","7 November 2006"," Funny yet disappointing movie of hilarious TV creation
","When Sacha Baron Cohen's original genius comic creation Ali G made it to the big screen in Ali G Indahouse, not only was the film a complete misfire, taking away the aspects that made the character so funny in the first place and dumping him into a dire low rent comedy movie plot, it was also part of a symptom that the character may be getting old and too familiar, well used and well known. Baron Cohen's solution over the following years was to add new characters and transplant his interviews that make people look ridiculous shtick to America, the home of people making themselves look ridiculous. Of those new innovations, definitely the best was the introduction of Borat, the culturally naive, racist, misogynist journalist from the major potassium exporting former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan, always dressed in the same grey suit and clipboard. In transferring his second character from TV to movies, Baron Cohen seems to have learnt some of the lessons from his first movie and kept aspects of what made the TV show great however, like his Staines based wigga predecessor, Borat does lose something in the transition, and not just the disappointing absence of the formerly ubiquitous clipboard. The film is a strange mishmash of short sketches of the style of his TV appearances designed to appear in his documentary ""moviefilm"" Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan and a sort of plot in which our hero travels across America in order to marry Pamela Anderson. The trouble is, only the first half of this provides the comedy gold, the other seems contrived and doesn't quite work. The reason that Borat is so funny is in the way that he relates to real people and their reactions to him, how people try and be accommodating to his strange ways until he pushes them too far or how his extremely bigoted views encourage others to open up with their own disturbingly inappropriate ideas. The film does have some very funny scenes of this variety. One particularly standout moment has Borat attending a rodeo in one of the deep south hard-line redneck states. After being told that he should shave his moustache as it makes him look too much like a Muslim by one of the rodeo organisers, Borat proceeds to tell the crowd how he supports their country's ""war of terror"" and has them cheering how he hopes George Bush drinks the blood of every Iraqi man, woman and child, before launching into a hilarious Kazakh national anthem to the tune of the American one. It is here that the film comes close to capturing the brilliance of TV show moments like Borat's ""Throw the Jew Down the Well, Then My Country Can Be Free"" song and it is all in the crowd's changing reactions from suspicion, to mindless applause to anger that much of the comedy lies. Another great moment, albeit recycled from the TV version (and already adapted from Borat's early British TV appearances to the American show) is the scene with the etiquette consultant and dining club in which Borat is unsure of how to deal with the toilet. It manages to combine social satire with fratboy style gross out humour to great effect. The end of this scene features Borat calling up a prostitute and inviting her up to the dining club which provides some great reactions from the conservative diners. However, the fact that the prostitute is obviously an actress lessens the effect and this is a problem that runs through the film. The demands of the film having a plot means that there are a number of scenes that just seem very contrived, such as when Borat hitches a lift with a camper van full of drunk American students, and therefore have none of the spontaneous real people's reactions that are truly hilarious. Having said that, some quality comedy is drawn from the bear that Borat and his producer acquire for protection such as an obviously contrived but still amusing scene where the bear scares some children after ice cream. Another problem is that the Pamela Anderson quest plot line seems a little clichéd and uninspired resulting in Borat's road trip across America not actually doing what many audience members might have hoped and truly exploring the bizarre prejudices of middle Americans. Meanwhile, the scenes of Borat's home town in Kazakhstan while having amusing moments like his triumph over his neighbour (iPod minis are for girls) remove some of the charm of his fish out of water moments in the Western world and the authenticity of the character, formerly a convincing former Soviet republic TV reporter reduced to unreal stereotyping. Of course, Baron Cohen remains a skilled comic creator and actor and his dedication to the role remains impressive as he remains in character no matter what the situation and delivers a performance of occasionally surprising nuances, while the film itself is one that will undoubtedly make you laugh hard for most of the way through but, looking back on it, most people may get a sense of missed opportunity, that there were moments when a genuine classic movie could have been about to come out. Rumours currently persist that there is a bidding war going on for a new film adaptation of Baron Cohen's third character, gay fashion journalist Bruno, a newer character and therefore one who may have more material left than Ali G or Borat. Let's hope that given the marked improvement from Ali G Indahouse to Borat, it will be third time's the charm for Baron Cohen on the big screen. ***"

","Darwin's Rule of Moviewatching #57: Anything in which an ugly hooker is the most sympathetic character should not be watched while eating. For proof, see Woody Allen's ""Deconstructing Harry,"" South Park's ""Chickenpox,"" and ""Borat."" The long, broken-English title accurately describes the premise: inept, degenerate Kazakh state TV journalist Borat (Cohen, from the character he created) and his long-suffering producer Azamat (Davitian) go to New York to conduct interviews with real Americans, to get a snapshot of American culture as well as some sex, if possible. Borat first introduces us to his village, including his hateful neighbor, his massive wife, the town rapist (""only humans!"") and the mechanic/abortionist. The highlight of his New York visit is his interview of veteran feminists (""Give me smile, baby!""). After seeing ""Baywatch,"" he dragoons Azamat into a quest to California to find & marry CJ (Anderson). There's absolutely nothing new to ""Borat,"" since the premise follows that of Hunter Thompson's ""Fear & Loathing"" & Christopher Guest's ""Spinal Tap,"" as well as French historian Alexis de Tocqueville's first-person survey of America in the 1830s. The ""Kazakh"" language is patterned after Charlie Chaplin's ""Tomanian"" lingo in ""The Great Dictator"" and the gags are lifted from comics from the Marx Brothers to Benny Hill to the creators of ""South Park,"" these last noted in the credits. Cohen & director Charles nevertheless picked proved winners & their pacing is good, never letting the film get dull. Like Guest's characters, Borat skewers American traditions, presumptions & prejudices by blindsiding people with his, shall we say, very different characteristics. These include: kissing men in greeting, strict & subjective sexism, virulent anti-Semitism, a complete lack of toilet training & admiring the US for being a mighty military dictatorship. To say that ""Borat"" is scatological is like saying ""Hoosiers"" has basketball in it. Some scenes, including Borat proudly bringing his feces & a fat hooker to a genteel Southern dinner party & his protracted, nude chase & punch-up with Azamat in a hotel are probably hard to take for most people, although Cohen's sheer comic talent & timing make them really, really funny. Borat's driving lesson & his shopping for a ""pussy magnet"" to drive across the US are a hilarious satire of modern America's most cherished & most delusional cultural institution: the style, freedom & machismo of automobiles. It would be hard to top Leslie Nielsen's rendition of the National Anthem in ""The Naked Gun,"" but Cohen scores, singing the ""Kazakh"" national anthem to the tune of the ""Star Spangled Banner"" at a Texas rodeo while dressed in red, white & blue (""Kazakhstan is the greatest nation in the world/All other countries are run by little girls""). ""Borat"" is actually rather highbrow, requiring a knowledge of American history & tradition, as well as some idea of how the rest of the world views the US, to be fully appreciated. Unfortunately, the thought required also exposes inconsistencies in Borat's background. If Borat is so utterly clueless about America, how did he learn to speak English? Since American-pattern TV shows have long been available worldwide, why would Borat assume that CJ is a real person? And if he's a neo-Stalinist stuffed shirt professional, why does Borat live in a dumpy but colorful village instead of a bland Communist high-rise? Borat's Kazakhstan evokes no sympathy or understanding, a missing-link dump populated by toothless, incestuous primates content to wallow in their own feces. Indeed, the film's biggest flaw is that Borat & Azamat are too filthy & perverted--and Borat too moronic--to evoke sympathy, even allowing for ""cultural"" differences. Nor does Cohen really try to humanize Borat until the second half. The closest he comes is when Borat, after hitting rock bottom, accepts ""Mr. Jesus"" at an evangelist service--yet another comic triumph brilliantly balanced on the edge of a knife. Luenell, as the hooker, provides the only really human touch as she has a ""good time"" with Borat at a honky-tonk (their scenes on the mechanical bull turn a sappy scene into a laugh riot). Anderson, appearing as herself & listed in the credits as such, never comes across as anything but a micro-shallow, self-serving sex object & inadvertent porn star, so let's not hear anything from her--ever--about how there's more to her. In the end, ""Borat"" winds up laughing at America and the fictional Kazakhstan, not with them, since everyone ultimately comes across as either irredeemably degenerate or inexcusably hypocritical. Still, it has to be seen in its entirety to appreciate the many funny parts--and those are very much worth it."

They laughed here in Helsinki on the opening night  not uncontrollably, not immoderately, but they did laugh consistently and there was indeed a great deal to laugh at. <br/><br/>If there are targets for satire here, they are first and foremost the Americans that Borat meets, and secondarily western stereotypes of emerging nations such as Kazakhstan. It's perhaps a little hard on the Kazakhs that their homeland was chosen to give birth to Borat, and their government is reportedly up in arms about it. They might do well to reflect on the old adage that all publicity is good publicity, and on the fact that the treatment of them is affectionate in its way.<br/><br/>What did surprise a little is how well many of the targets emerged. Some elderly bigots were neatly and rightly skewered on their own prejudices. Various ""experts"" on this and that were shown up to be vacuous, as you would expect. I found one scene, set at a family guest house, unnecessarily cruel, and I'm knocking a point off for that. And some groups and individuals came out of it really well  such as the Pentecostalists and the driving instructor  and I'm putting a point back on for that, for taking the smooth with the rough. <br/><br/>A good evening's entertainment, and Sacha Baron Cohen is surely one of the world's greatest comic actors and I hope he will continue to find outlets for his immense talents. But overall there were too few surprises and too many jokes with only one dimension for it to become a classic  though the dinner party and the nude wrestling will linger in my mind for a long time to come. <br/><br/>Seven out of ten."

","I've seen a couple Borat episodes on Ali G and I thought they were OK. Nothing special, just a talented comedian acting like a weirdo foreigner. Well, this movie is pretty much the same thing. If you love his show, you'll love the movie. It's that simple. I saw a 10:50 am showing of this movie hoping the crowd would be small. Because I really hate being stuck in a theater with a bunch of retards that laugh at every single thing. Unfortunately the theater was packed, and I sat next to two fat kids who laughed nonstop, both having wheezy, spit filled throats, mixed with a dash of nerd. Then I have a dude that snorted like a pig to my left, but that was actually funny. I thought the movie was amusing, fast paced, pretty funny and surprisingly smart. There is a whole lot going on this movie - it's full of satirical jokes, scat humor, and ridiculous situations. But I just didn't find it really, really funny like how everyone else is. I would say I laughed out loud a handful number of times. Don't get me wrong, I get it, he plays a slow foreigner with little common sense. That is funny, but it's not ""one of the funniest comedies of all time"". Personally I found Jackass 2 to be much funnier. The movie is easily recommendable and my main reason saying that is that Sasha is a really talented comedian, performer and actor. The movie has displayed our society in a crazy eye opening way that I haven't seen before. That was definitely the most humorous part of the movie for me. Watching how crazy our country is. I never realized how nuts these religious types are. Those dudes are probably exactly like the fanatics overseas. It's definitely one of the better comedies to come out in a long time. It's much better than any recent Adam Sandler or Will Ferrell movie. I give it a 7 1/2 outta 10. Most likely will rise after another viewing."

","Borat Sagdiyev (Sacha Baron Cohen) is the top journalist from Kazakhstan's very own television network. His latest assignment requires him to travel to the United States. While there he must learn about American culture and what makes it so ""great"". Along the way he encounters people from almost every walk of life, all the while shocking and amazing those very same people simultaneously.<br/><br/>First off, I must warn you that 'Borat:' is not for everyone. If you can't take a joke or completely have no sense of humor, stop reading this review right now. Please then proceed to kill yourself. Okay, don't actually commit suicide, but at least hurt yourself in some way.<br/><br/>Now, having said that, it must be known that 'Borat:' is hands down, without a doubt, no matter what, the funniest film of the year. Prior to seeing it I knew it would be hilarious. I figured though that once settled in and it ran for a little while the jokes would become annoying. Then of course there'd be a few cases here and there that were laugh-out-loud funny, but nothing major. How wrong I was. Wrong indeed. From beginning to end its outrageously hysterical. Each time you think it couldn't get any better, it proves you wrong over and over. Cohen deserves much praise for being able to keep a straight face through each scene.<br/><br/>Despite being positively entertaining beyond belief though, there will still be those who insist on disagreeing. Its true, a lot of people probably will be offended by some of the things shown in 'Borat:', but don't let them deter you from seeing it. They're simply too busy trying to get the three foot stick they have up lodged up their ass out, that they can't possibly see its humor. My friend Clay put it best yesterday when he said, ""I think its too smart for Americans"". For the most part, that's correct. The irony presented won't be noticed by hardly any American because they'll be too busy laughing themselves to death over how they think Borat ""doesn't get it"". I'm not trying to say everyone in America that sees it is a dumbass either, but that's just the truth.<br/><br/>Well I guess its about time I wrapped this review up. Indeed it was short, but really, there's only three things you need to know about 'Borat:'. One, its side-splitting, two, its brilliant, and finally three, Jews can't really turn transform themselves into cockroaches. Or can they?"
"mystic_cat","10","4","17","4 November 2006"," Movie To Make Benefit Of All Viewers
","Seriously, this is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. There were only a few moments during the movie when I was not laughing out loud. Borat's inexperience makes everything he does that much more funny. The best part about this film is the outsiders view of America. Borat dives headfirst into our country and throws caution to the wind. He learns about humor, etiquette, rodeos, driving, baywatch, toilets, and religion. One of my favorite sub-genres of comedy movies is the mockumentary, and this movie gives Christopher Guest and his crew a run for their money.<br/><br/>His exploits will keep you laughing long after the movie ends. If you are looking for a laugh- out-loud comedy, you will not be disappointed."
"aussiedude","10","4","17","4 November 2006"," Side-splitting!
","This is the funniest movie I have seen in years, perhaps the last 10 years! <br/><br/>This is a movie that you will need to see more than once, if like me you laugh so hard you miss some dialog. The scene in the hotel where Borat and his producer get into a fight made me laugh so hard that I could barely draw a breath.<br/><br/>Aside from the anti-semitic them that runs through the entire movie the are a number of very confronting moments highlighting racism and prejudice that is so often hidden.<br/><br/>This movie is a must-see!"
"irabovsky","10","4","17","3 November 2006"," Hands Down Funniest Movie Ever
","I watch a lot of movies in my time. And a lot of television. Mostly, because I have no life. This is hands down... funnier than all of them.<br/><br/>The movie plot is simple. Borat comes to America to make a documentary, and in the process searches to marry Pamela Anderson. But Cohen is so funny. Now, I heard many, many people talking about how 'anti-semetical' this movie is- and how offensive it is to the Jewish race.<br/><br/>I'm Jewish myself, and as offensive as it was- the offense meant NOTHING. Why? Because Sasha Cohen (Borat) is Jewish in reality. And well, you're allowed to make fun of yourself. Granted, I'm also Russian, and therefore Borat's character becomes that much more relatable. <br/><br/>There's a naked fight scene, yes. It was funny.<br/><br/>The funniest parts of the movie has to do with Borat as a journalist. Not only does he mess with congressmen, but in the process he exposes them for being racist.How great is that?<br/><br/>Go see the film. If you hate it- it's okay. Only then do you have the right to not like it."
"onekidof4","10","4","17","3 November 2006"," Funniest movie of the year
","Probably the funniest movie I have seen the entire year. The five minutes the entire movie I didn't spend laughing were spent trying to transfer popcorn from the bin to my mouth (efforts which were unsuccessful on account of the huge guy sitting behind me that kept laughing and shaking the seats, making me spill it everywhere). Entirely worth the overpriced 8.25$ I paid for admission. You can count on the fact that everyone at school or work tomorrow will be quoting this fun filled family movie on Monday. You'll probably realize that some scenes are staged, but the majority are not. In one scene, he makes a hotel clerk read a telegram to him saying that his wife was attacked, violated, and murdered by a bear while walking his retarded brother Bilo in Kazakhstan. Imagine trying to tell a foreign man that his wife was violated and killed by a bear. The beauty of the movie comes from capturing unsuspecting characters in awkward situations like the one mentioned above. In the words of the mighty man himself, ""Great success!""I have to keep typing more lines to be able to submit this, but can't really think of anything to say. You will not be disappointed. I still have to keep typing more lines. Geez, how many do I have to have? If you are going to see one movie this entire year, you have no life. But, if you really are one of these people, make it this one."

","You have to put aside any preconceptions before you see this movie. Yes it is offensive, but if you take the movie as such, it will be the funniest thing you see all year. From start to finish this parody of a Kazahkstani TV presenter named Borat is a barrel of laughs. I don't think I have ever laughed for such a long time. Between 30 of us, there weren't any dry eyes by the end of the film (yes it was that funny). In the same vein as the Borat shows on TV, Borat tours America and acts wholly inappropriately infront of the unwitting American population in order to see their reactions. It is these reactions which are often the funniest parts of the movie as you are left thinking 'did he/she really say that?!?!' <br/><br/>This film has got to be recommended to film lovers everywhere!"

"Snowgo","8","1","2","2 January 2019"," Don't Try to Figure This Movie Out
","Never before has a movie that I issued a score of 8 stars to, left me with such a queasy feeling in my stomach. I do understand that this is a drama/comedy and that it was written for entertainment value, but I can't help but feel somewhat offended and manipulated by the inference that everyone in Kazakh is like Borat: Foul-mouthed, without morals and both ignorant and disrespectful of other cultures. Borat, himself, is a horrible, bloated stereo-type, but a funny one at times. There are times in the movie when he actually offers to help us think outside of the box, when we realize that we are almost as enculturated and dogmatic as he is. I was disgusted by the scene in the hotel room, and afterward, when they were running through the lobby naked. The sight of that fat man without clothing horrified me for days afterward, and I am trying hard not to think about it. Forever. Somehow, there is some value in this movie, in accepting others, but I feel this character was written as someone unrealistically vile. Please, whatever you do, do not equate nor associate the character Borat with the multitude of normal and good people in Kazakh. Watching this movie was like reading a copy of Hustler and listening to a Frank Zappa album at the same time. I still don't fully understand what I liked about it."

"Rickting","8","1","2","2 April 2016"," Not for the easily offended but still pretty hilarious
","Borat sees Sacha Baron Cohen pretend to be a journalist from Kazakhstan and travel around the USA with a camera crew in tow. Since he is interacting with people who don't know he's just an actor, this makes for a very interesting movie. Sacha Baron Cohen gives a terrific performance as Borat and creates one of the most memorable movie characters of the 2000s. Be warned: Borat is unbelievably offensive. While it is a funny movie and while it does have some interesting social commentary, unfortunately Borat seems more focused on offending everyone than either of those things. Also, the film should be longer than just 80 minutes since some of the time it feels rushed and potentially great scenes end too quickly. Nevertheless, Borat provides some big laughs and I admire its showcase of a comedian doing such a brave and impressive feat as going through America dressed up as a character that's being appallingly offensive and humiliating himself repeatedly. If you know what you're getting into with Borat and understand that it's a certain type of humour, you're in for a funny comedy movie, albeit one that's more notable for its technique than for huge laughs. Perhaps its best element is its thought-provoking social commentary, so Borat is definitely one of the most interesting comedies of recent times.<br/><br/>8/10"
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","1","2","7 July 2009"," Biting social commentary and outrageously boundary-pushing comedy
","There are only two schools of thought on ""Borat"" and its star Sacha Baren Cohen: You will either find him a comedic genius or an over-the-top, disgusting and truth-stretching con artist. A history major from Cambridge would suggest the former: an uncanny ability identify social stereotypes, generalizations and fears and exploit them for comedic purposes.<br/><br/>Cohen, who made the Borat character mildly famous on his HBO program ""Da Ali G Show"" reaches his broadest audience by daring to make an entire movie, effectively posing as his character in real life situations and catching it on film along with the reactions of all those he has involved (or has duped, in other terms). <br/><br/>The character Borat is a reporter for Kazakhstan's national television network who travels to America (the best country in the world, right?) to learn things that he can take back Kazakhstan. He is an embodiment of ignorance and prejudice (Borat is terrified of evil Jews and deplores womens' rights) posing as a foreigner who doesn't know any better. The results are genius and sometimes even sad in the pathetic way depending how you see it, but definitely over the boundaries of what we're used to. It's sort of an intentionally misleading documentary. Borat might be fake, but the reactions to him are real. <br/><br/>Tying the plot together is Borat's discovery of ""Baywatch"" and adult film star Pamela Anderson and his decision to travel across the country to take her virginity. That is the through line, the rest of the film are scenes addressing all sorts of social and religious groups/classifications, or even just testing Americans' basic aversion to closeness with strangers in public or excessive nudity. ""Borat"" and Baren Cohen basically take all the things that we censor in America and put them right up front to see how we handle them.<br/><br/>Truthfully, ""Borat"" is not a forgiving comedy, nor is it very mature on the surface. The male nudity is gratuitous, references to female genitalia are frequent, excrement is popular and anyone who doesn't immediately connect with the satirical purposes would find it racially and ethnically offensive in about every way possible. In other words, you have to be highly cognizant of Cohen's purpose or simply love all that stuff at face value to recognize ""Borat"" as one of the best and most original comedies in a long time.<br/><br/>For the intelligent viewer, it's completely impossible to ignore all the genius put into this film. The film seems to be hardest on Jews, yet Cohen is Jewish and actually speaks in Hebrew frequently when he's ad-libbing in Kazakh. The Jewish couple he meets are the two cutest old people you'll ever see and he claims they've shifted shapes and throws money at them. In these scenes the humor comes from Borat's reaction, not the people he's 'duped' and the intention is to point out our blind prejudices. When Borat comes across a Gay Pride Parade in D.C. he says they're the nicest and friendliest people he's met in America -- because there's no fear of personal space invasion. On the other side, he gets some serious responses of bigotry from Americans just by prompting them in subtle ways that bring up homosexuality or the War on Terror. You can call Cohen un-American, but the British actor is only provoking and not stooping as to make the people in the film look bad by editing the film a certain way. <br/><br/>Cohen and his incredible characterization talents far and away make ""Borat"" cutting edge and audacious comedy. Straight up ballsy. There might be debates elsewhere, but there's no question about how daring his comedy is. It also happens to be one of the most memorable and quotable comedies in recent years -- the scenes in this film will not leave you because this is such stand-out work."
"paul2001sw-1","3","1","2","20 April 2009"," Satire, but who's the target?
","There are odd lines in 'Borat: Make Cultural Learnings of America for benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan', to give the film its full and deliberately preposterous title, that really made me smile; for example, when Borat's producer dresses up as Oliver Hardy, Borat comments ""I had not come to America to fight with a man disguised as Adolf Hitler"". But overall, I struggled to understand this film. The character of Borat, invented and played by comedian Sacha Baron-Chen, is a central Asian man of wildly exaggerated naiveté and crudity, who in this movie makes a voyage of discovery to the U.S.A. The film is clearly a satire of sorts, but who is the target? Certainly not Kazakhstan, for the Kazakhstan, as it appears in this movie, is a generic shorthand for underdevelopment and backwardness. So is it America who Baron-Cohen is satirising, exposing its true nature through juxtapositioning it with the ridiculous? But this interpretation doesn't quite work either, The Borat character is simply too outlandish to provide much insight into the real America; most of the people Borat interacts with awkwardly humour or ignore him, and even though the behaviour of some is revealingly bad, I just felt sorry for most of his victims. There's simply no rational way to respond to someone so dreadful, and that Baron-Cohen was able to find some ordinarily unpleasant people to mock somewhere in the United States is hardly so surprising. If indeed the film is showing us candid-camera style moments: this was the sort of comedy with which Baron-Cohen made his name, but one wonders how many of these scenes could have been filmed if they weren't in fact staged, in spite of the painfully believable dialogues. I loved Chris Morris's 'Brass Eye', a program with substantial candid sections, but which successfully mocked trends in modern current affairs programming, self-promoting celebrities unable to see through naked idiocy if presented with an opportunity for publicity, and ourselves for putting up with both of the above. But I spent most of this film just cringing, unable to ascertain who the joke was supposed to be on."

","It is hard to believe that how many people enjoy such an insulting movie. At the very beginning of the movie,traced on an Eurasian map, Borat's plane stops in Turkey, Libya, Russia, and Ukraine, without touching down anywhere in continental Europe, which is supposed to be immune of ""cultural inferiority"" represented by Borat and his subhuman values. That route gives the whole idea of movie.Trying to give the impression of Judeo-Christian world is the main thing and the ""others"" who are Eastern Europeans, Muslims (both fits with Kazakhstan) etc represent all kinds of stupidity, ugglyness etc. <br/><br/>Mr. Cohen should remember that only six decades ago, while their people have been put in concentration camps and eventually in the ovens by Nazis and their allies in Germany, Vichy-France, Austria, Poland, Nederlands, Sweden and many other European territories, Russians along with many Cozachs have fought against them and helped to stop Nazi plans about a ""final solution"" destined against his people . They have never chased Jews or their puppets on the streets for any reason. Unlike Western Europeans. He should look at the further history, beyond WW2 to see what have been done against Jews in Spain, Britain and almost anywhere in Elite and Christian Europe. Eastern Europe and Ottoman Empire have always gave shelter to his people.<br/><br/>Ironically,evidenced by some scenes of the Romanian classic car ""Dacia"" which has showed up in a few frames (which is a second class Renault 12 looks like being assembled in the dim light), Borat's village is within glorious European Union borders and the ""ugly subhuman"" ""Cozachs"" in his village are actual ""prime class"", European Union citizens and the elite people of that Romanian village.(They do not look like Cozachs anyway).

","I had never seen 'Da Ali G Show' before watching this movie and had no prior exposure to Sacha Baron Cohen. I only knew what I saw from the trailers. Borat Sagdiyev (Cohen) is a reporter from the nation of Kazakhstan who is sent to America to learn as much as possible in an effort to improve his home nation. What follows is one of the most hilarious movies I've seen. I could NOT stop laughing throughout the course of this movie when I saw it for the first time. Of course, not everyone is going to like this film. In fact, most of the people I've watched it with can't stand it. They either find the character of Borat too obnoxious/annoying or they are bothered in some way by the content. Oh well, it's not for everyone.<br/><br/>The film is hilarious, but the humor is mostly derived from shock value. Unfortunately, that means that repeated viewings lose some of their luster because you know what to expect. The real comedy comes from the reactions of those that Borat encounters on his trip across America. You can tell that SOME situations have to have been staged but a good majority seem like sincere (and funny) reactions to Borat's foreign behavior. Some articles that I've read claim this movie acts as a social commentary on the behaviors of Americans in relation to a culture they don't understand. I can see how that can be true...to an extent. Then again, Borat does some pretty crazy things, things that go beyond a mere culture clash, in this film to justify some of the responses he received.<br/><br/>My absolute favorite segments had to have been the scene with the driving instructor and the scene with the frat boys in the RV. Despite Borat's oddball (and occasionally illegal) behavior in the driving school scene, the driving instructor took it in stride and let it roll off his back...which I thought made it that much funnier. As for the frat boys, they just made complete morons out of themselves. Both of these scenes resulted in lawsuits brought up against the production, though I don't know that either made it very far.<br/><br/>On one final note, if you want a good example of American intolerance in the film (WITHOUT goading from Borat), be sure to check out the friendly advice given to Borat by the rodeo organizer before Borat performs the national anthem."

"Rathko","5","1","2","2 April 2007"," As Many Misses as Hits
","For all the talk of 'Borat' being something new and dangerous, it's really just the latest addition to a long British tradition of bigot-comedy. I don't know if it started with 'Till Death Us Do Part' in the 1960s, but Warren Mitchell's Alf Garnett is one of the earliest examples of middle-class white liberals presenting working-class bigots as objects of comic derision. 'Rising Damp' continued the tradition well in to the 1970s. When done well, such comedies revealed racism and anti-Semitism to be the truly ridiculous things that they are, and during a time of rampant institutionalized racism in Britain, such comedies were genuinely daring. Of course, when done badly, they crossed the line, and became racist themselves. Sitcoms like 'It Ain't Half Hot Mum' and 'Duty Free' made little attempt to critique their protagonist's bigotry; inviting their audiences, instead, to laugh at a parade of racial stereotypes.<br/><br/>'Borat' falls somewhere in the middle of these two traditions. Alf Garnett was funny and offensive and ultimately revealed to be the sad and lonely bigot that he was. He was a brilliant comic creation because he was real. Borat, by comparison, is like something out of a fairy tale. He is pure fantasy. While we are clearly expected to laugh at the character's bigotry, he is so extreme and outrageous in his beliefs that all connection with reality is lost, which calls into question his ability to make us question contemporary racial attitudes when he himself is so far removed from them. But more often than not, we are invited to laugh not at Borat's bigotry, but at the reactions such bigotry provoke. So what exactly are we supposed to be laughing at  an ignorant man from a developing post-Soviet country or the American trying to treat him with some degree of respect? <br/><br/>The overwhelming number of Americans that Borat encounters behave with an almost unbelievable degree of restraint and show a genuine desire to accommodate Borat and his wildly offensive manners. Rather than come away from 'Borat' thinking Americans are all crazy, I was immensely impressed with their desire to appear open, accepting and non-judgmental. As for the often talked about scenes with the gun and car salesman, and the shock that many critics displayed at their apparent accepting of Borat's bigotry, all I can say is that these critics have never worked retail. If salesmen, whether in a car lot, a gun store, a bookshop, or a restaurant, refused to serve every customer that was weird and offensive, they'd never make a sale! You nod, you smile, you make the sale and get the nut out of the store. I saw no evidence of racism and anti-Semitism, just a desire to be professional while working. In fact the only two genuinely offensive people that Borat encounters are a half-crazy nutjob that seems to manage a rodeo, and a bunch of drunken frat boys. Discovering that these people are bigots is hardly a surprise, so what's the point? <br/><br/>Let's forget whether or not Baron Cohen is attempting to say anything about contemporary attitudes to race, religion and class. Is the movie funny? Well yes it is, in parts. Personally, I just don't find relatively decent people being made to feel uncomfortable all that funny. It's one thing when Ali G does it to cynical and self-serving politicians, but when it's aimed at regular people, especially when they're going out of their way to be nice, it just doesn't amuse me. When Borat descends into pure surreal fantasy, however, it is very funny indeed. I laughed out loud at the 'Running of the Jew' and the scene in the B&B, both of which, not coincidentally, focus on the idiocy of anti-Semitism rather than the cheap exploitation of a casual passerby. Such scenes, even though they are completely reminiscent of stuff that Monty Python was doing thirty years ago, reveal a genuine creative talent that is sorely lacking in much of the film.<br/><br/>Borat, and the fantasy Kazakhstan that he calls home, is a brilliant comic creation and endlessly fascinating. I could have happily watched an entire movie about Borat in his home country, and my favorite parts of the movie and the DVD are those instances when we are able to do just that  the low-fi title credits, the 'South Park'-style Kazak National Anthem, the bizarre 'Baywatch' clone. But such scenes are few and far between, skipped over in favor of the ritual humiliation of innocent civilians - a pastime that I've just never found all that funny."

","My opinion may be a minority one, but I did not enjoy this movie. It was rude, crude, and not all that funny.

I'm not defending all the victims of this movie (yes, the people he interviewed are all victims of Sasha Cohen's con job), but I personally feel that this movie was very exploitive. I feel that, in an odd way, this movie says more about Americans' kindness and sense of charity, as well as naiveté, than about prejudice and excessive nationalism. This movie mocks many people, and is needlessly graphic. IMO, if you are looking for a crude but funny skewering of American culture, watch South Park."

I won't reveal anything here, but suffice to say that I have never heard an entire audience laugh through the whole movie. but the best part is really the people he tries to talk to. from neo-Nazi rednecks to a women (he thinks) is a gypsy, they all provoke hilarious reactions that Chonan is able to work with even further.

Its amazing that a Jewish person (Cohen is Jewish) could make such an anti-Semitic film. I know people will say that I do not see the irony of the humor - but it really goes too far. Here's what is said (and done) in the movie:<br/><br/>1) Jews caused 9/11 (he doesn't want to get on a plane and says, ""maybe the Jews will cause another 9/11 while we are on-board"") 2) There is a ""running of the Jew"" similar to the running of the bulls where people run down the street being chased by a giant cartoon like Jewish person - the female then lays an egg on the street to which everyone screams ""kill the Jew egg before it hatches"" and all the kids go and smash it 3) Borat stays in a bed and breakfast of a Jewish family. He stays up late at night afraid the Jews will kill them. He claims that the husband and wife have transformed into new creatures to which they show cockroaches walking on the ground. He immediately jumps up and claims they are the Jews and starts throwing dollar bills at them and screaming at them to leave.<br/><br/>If this movie lasts more than 2 weeks in the theater i will be shocked. Its just not funny. The same joke (that he doesn't understand American culture) is just repeated over and over again."

Sacha really takes the Borat character to extremes here Just a couple of points of criticize: 1. Although 90% is as funny as hell. The background story is weak and i wish they could find a better story to connect the skits.<br/><br/>2. When broad speaks Kazakh, he actually speaks Hebrew in a Kazakh accent (Sacha baron Cohen is half Israeli, and speaks fluent Hebrew), Which is very funny at first for the Israeli audience, but after a couple of times it gets annoying and repetitive. I wish he would just speak real gibberish. It's nice to share a private joke with Sacha but it really gets tiring after a while.<br/><br/>3. The trailer gives away too many jokes, if you haven't seen the trailer yet, then just don't see it. You will enjoy the movie more.<br/><br/>But in general, although the movie isn't perfect, it is still the funniest movie i have ever seen, so it defiantly deserves the best score.

","Seeing this movie was one of the most joyous experiences of my entire movie-going life. I was in tears from laughter throughout the entire run of the film. I just can't say enough about how ridiculously offensive, un-PC, and just downright hilarious this movie is! Sure, the film's offensive, but it's an equal opportunity offender. Everyone from gays to feminists, Jews to Christians, cowboys to Kazakhstanis is viciously mauled by Sacha Baron Cohen, the brilliant brainchild behind Borat Sagdiyev. Sacha is brilliant in the way he portrays Borat as an incredibly ignorant visitor of the ""U,S, and A."" The character has no clue about any aspect of American culture, and this allows him to dig his subjects into their own holes.<br/><br/>Borat effectively exposes our nations' hidden prejudices about other classes and ethnicities. It's downright shocking the things that come out of the mouths of some of his subjects, and they probably don't realize what they're saying. I think the shock value of the film adds to its hilarity. I can't stress it enough: if you're a fan of comedy and are not easily offended, SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!! <br/><br/>P.S. There is a sequence in the middle of the film between Borat and his producer that is so outrageous, it's one of the funniest points in the film. I won't say much, but let's just say it involves a Baywatch magazine, and an entire hotel of shocked residents."

It was gross, it was stupid, it was the ""What the heck was Thatiest Movie of the Year"". I would say that this was the gross out movie of 2006. It could go hang around with the 1986 remake of THE FLY, which is the grossest film of it' time and it still.

"Bunuel1976","6","2","7","15 June 2007"," Borat: Cultural Learnings Of America For Make Benefit Glorious Nation Of Kazakhstan (Larry Charles, 2006) **1/2
","I wasn't into Sacha Baron Cohen's previous alter ego, rapper Ali G, at all; I didn't think I'd be drawn to this character (who has garnered as much admiration as contempt either), given his sexist nature  but, at least, it provides a wider range of targets and opportunities for controversy. Incidentally, the head-shaking reaction which usually greets Borat is ultimately more of a comment on his ostensibly cultured 'victims' than the unsophisticated hero himself.<br/><br/>The film itself is patchy but mercifully short  and, surprisingly, I found it to be genuinely inspired at times (even if its brand of savage no-holds barred satire has been more stylishly explored by Monty Python 35 years ago); besides, the dinner-table defecation was much better done by Luis Bunuel in an unforgettable scene from THE PHANTOM OF LIBERTY (1974)! Anyway, it generally plays like a live-action version of ""South Park"" (that series' creators, in fact, receive a special thanks during the end credits here).<br/><br/>Some scenes are undeniably uproarious  his rendition of the national anthem of Kazakhstan at a rodeo; the dinner sequence in a Southern household (mentioned above); the mayhem at an antique shop; and the lengthy nude fisticuff between Borat and his heavy-set manager (which is where the film really oversteps the threshold of grossness). However, other 'sketches' fall miserably flat  in particular, the entire Pamela Anderson episode (which actually takes about half the running-time!) is an embarrassment: this section includes Borat's meeting with a group of wasted kids in a trailer (which is how the hero gets wise to Anderson's marital status) and his eventual brush with a community of revivalist Christians."
"Robert_Hearth","8","2","7","14 April 2007"," ""Although Kazakhstan A Glorious Country, It Have A Problem, Too: Economic, Social, And Jew."" --- Borat (Sacha Baron Cohen)
","""Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"" (2006) <br/><br/>Directed By: Larry Charles <br/><br/>Starring: Sacha Baron Cohen & Ken Davitian <br/><br/>MPAA Rating: ""R"" (for pervasive strong crude and sexual content including graphic nudity, and language) <br/><br/>Sacha Baron Cohen is probably best known for his work on the hugely-popular ""Da Ali G Show"". One of the characters portrayed in the television series was Kazakhstani television reporter, Borat (played by Cohen). Borat was famous for being anti-Semitic and for being a nymphomaniac. There is not a person in this world of which this man has not made funbut, just to be safe, Cohen decided to expand his character to the silver screen and, thus, we have ""Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"". I had heard a variety of things about this movie. This movie is one of those that you will either love or you will hate. It's a crude, rude, and deeply shameless movie that takes aim at everyone, from President Bush to Jews. ""We support your war of terror,"" Borat cries to a crowd at a rodeo. Nothing is left unscathed when Borat comes to America and, surprisingly enough, I enjoyed every minute of it. I adore movies that are politically incorrect (i.e. ""Thank You for Smoking"" and ""American Dreamz"") and ""Borat"" is probably the most incorrect of them all.<br/><br/>Kazakhstani TV personality Borat (Cohen) is sent by his country's government to give a report on ""the greatest country in the world""--yes, the United States of America. Heading to New York first, Borat and his documentary crew begin to interview various people and make friendsor, more appropriately, enemiesall over the city. But, when Borat happens upon a rerun of ""Baywatch"", he falls head over heels in love with Pamela Anderson. Soon, Borat begins a road trip across the United States to California so that he may find Pamela and marry her. You have probably heard about the multiple lawsuits against Sacha Baron Cohen and this movie. That is because many (some say all, but I seriously doubt that) of the scenes were shot without a script and with unknowing individuals who fall prey to Cohen's performance. This means that this movie, aside from the actual character of Borat, is as real as possible. I understand why the people in the movie would be angry about being fooled, but I can't help but to assume that this is why the movie worked so well. The genuine reactions of these random people to Borat are priceless and provide more laughs than the title character himself.<br/><br/>The performancesokay, performance is absolutely flawless. Having never seen ""Da Ali G Show"", I wasn't sure about Sacha Baron Cohen and, in all honesty, from the previews, he just looked very annoying. I was prepared to hate him, but, once the movie started, I just couldn't help but love him. He's hilarious and immediately engaging. The only other performance is that of Ken Davitian who plays Borat's partner in crime Azamat Bagatov. He provided a stark contrast to Cohen's over-the-top performance and his inclusion was probably one of the smartest things the filmmakers did. If not for Davitian's more subdued character, Cohen's Borat would probably have irritated me more than he already did. The rest of the cast predominately included unwitting victims to Cohen's game and, though I am sure that some of them are probably staged actors and actresses, I won't waste time trying to differentiate between the actual actors and just regular people. Though, if they were actors and actresses, they did a good job.<br/><br/>This movie is an open-and-shut case. It's a simple comedy, much like ""Jackass Number Two"". A grown man does stupid stuff and we laugh--this isn't rocket science and it certainly shouldn't be treated as such. On the negative side of things, the character of Borat really did get on my nerves from time to time. On top of that, some bits just didn't entertain me as much as they just disgusted me. For example, when Borat and Azamat are running through a hotel completely naked, it was just awkward and gross. But, when everything was said and done, ""Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"" is easily one of the funniest movies of the year. It is crude, offensive, and just plain weird, but very effective. Sure, you may feel guilty for laughing at the end, but the important thing is that you will laughfor the entire time.<br/><br/>Final Thought: ""Borat"" will make you laugh and that is enough reason to watch.<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 8/10 (A-)"
"cynthialev4","8","2","7","9 April 2007"," ..but don't forget to think
","Sacha Baron Cohen is a fantastic actor and social commentator. He had been doing similar work for years, but this movie allowed him to reach a much larger audience, and get much more attention than he would have ever attracted through television. With a bit more of a budget, he has made a great film to cement Borat in cinematic and pop culture history.<br/><br/>While I have the utmost respect for Cohen and do not believe he is racist or ill-intentioned, I do worry a bit about people using the popularity of Borat as a green light for humor that actually IS racist or ignorant. Borat is funny because it exposes the ridiculousness of such behavior, and encourages us to question the roots of our own xenophobia. Cohen is not making fun of Kazakstan, he is making fun of our own ignorance of other countries, of the latent feeling that Eastern Europe is full of tiny backwards countries where the things he describes are perfectly normal. If people miss this point, then the joke really is on them."

","As a massive fan of Borat from his early days on ""Da Ali G Show"", I was eagerly anticipating this movie. Some critics were even going so far as to say it was the ""funniest movie of all time"". Having seen the movie about a week ago, I can indeed confirm that yes, this is a very funny movie that had me laughing uncontrollably at times, however, to keep the concept of Borat going for a solid hour and a half, compared to the usual 2 minute sketches of which we are used to, was surely a very difficult task. The whole Pamela Anderson thing at the end was pretty stupid, I guess with a concept like Borat it is extremely difficult to provide any kind of ""closure"" at the end of a move. But some of the jokes were hilarious, particularly when Borat goes to a ""humour"" coach and learns ""NOT"" jokes, that was probably my favourite part of the film. Unfortunately a lot of it IS rehashed material, for example, his etiquette lessons and dinner has been done before with ""Lady Chelsea"" on Ali G. Don't get me wrong, anyone with a sense of humour will definitely find this an entertaining film. I am one of those people with the opinion that the concept of political correctness is one that has spiralled totally out of control, often at the expense of humour, and so I find comedians like Cohen to be a fresh air... he does what most people are too scared to do, and more often than not, he has audiences is in stitches! So whilst I find his humour to be hilarious, I do not recommend Borat out there for those who are easily offended, or ""PC nuts"". You will not like this film. However, if you don't take what he is doing seriously, you will definitely enjoy Borat, even if some of the toilet humour is a bit off. 8 out of 10 stars for me... for your average person, definitely worth seeing!"
"socrates99","5","2","7","11 November 2006"," A fairly juvenile exercise to no real purpose
","I almost walked out several times. Borat is not that funny. It's more an almost desperate exercise in bad taste and ridicule. That it miraculously fills up its time was a major surprise after the first ten minutes. Why the extended hotel scene with the fat guy except that Cohen apparently thought things were getting a little too lame? And when not busily trying to extricate itself from its sometimes fascinating but more often just embarrassing vignettes it's indulging itself in bad taste to the point that you too will want to walk out. Somehow, Cohen as Borat comes across as a likable and memorable guy, though he's clearly a maniac. Nothing he does with one exception will make you think he's not a personable maniac. The one scene that made me feel as if I couldn't respect the man was one having to do with Eastern European attitudes toward Jews; it's way overdone. That scene seemed quite unnecessary though you will wonder why I didn't mention others as well. Cohen has a painful sense of humor but I can't help thinking he's not going to be able to do anything but Borat from now on. Any further adventures will have to be reviewed by people who don't like this one before I pay to see another of these films. I found the reviews I read were all quite misleading. This movie is closer to guerrilla theater than comedy and is better left to a very select and jaded audience."

It was about as good and as funny as I expected it to be, so I guess in my opinion, it did live up to the hype.<br/><br/>After seeing the movie I'm pretty sure that the Pamela Anderson bagging thing was scripted, but while I was watching the scene, I felt genuinely shocked and the thought didn't go through my head.

","Once in a great while, a film comes along that just leaves you staring wide eyed and open mouthed, long after the credits are finished rolling. Borat, I am delighted to say, is one of these such films. It is unapologetically raunchy, but tremendously funny and oddly poignant at the same time. Perhaps Borat's biggest feat is that it also manages to be entirely original. Sacha Baron Cohen has crafted his masterwork, and delivered to unsuspecting audiences on of the funniest and most unique films of our generation.<br/><br/>The character of Borat was introduced on Cohen's earlier TV show, Da Ali G Show. He is a journalist from Kazakhstan, sent to America to make a film about our culture. Borat is extremely sexist and anti-semitic, but also naive and strangely lovable. He takes on any social norm in his path and shatters it into unrecognizable shards. Traveling with friend and producer, Azamat, he arrives in the U.S.A., and wastes no time shifting the focus of the jokes from himself to us. This is where the movie shows its depth. I am really embarrassed that some of the people he crashed in on share the same country as I do. For example, at one point, in front of a crowd at a rodeo, he says that he wishes to see ""George Bush drink the blood of every man, woman, and child in Iraq."" The crowd reacted with a thunderous round of applause. How's that for a scathing bit of satire? I'm honestly still a bit awestruck by what I have just seen. It very well may be the funniest movie you will see in years. It is obscene beyond belief, but I laughed myself retarded for all 84 glorious minutes that it lasted. Its smarter than it looks and just plain hysterical. Bottom Line: Borat is a must see. A 10/10"

","I was privileged to receive a ticket to see an early pre-screening of this film and let me just say that I wasn't disappointed! Usually, for a film with a lot of hype, you'd expect that the movie will be terrible and only the scenes from the trailer are good, but this was not! I was thoroughly impressed at the way that Sacha Baron Cohen is able to use his character to pick out the foibles of everyday Americans and reveal our inner stereotypes that many harbour for others. Some scenes were pretty disturbing to say the least (Like a nude fight between Borat and his director), but it simply added to the humour of the movie. I highly recommend this film, but only if you're not planning on being overly critical about certain creeds and races."
"theVHSrocks","7","3","14","3 June 2007"," Funny not too funny and legitimately offensive and not in a good way
","I laughed a number of times during Borat, which was a funny film. A number of scenes are inspired, and I dig the whole clueless foreigner shtick. The film, done in a semi-documentary style, where the people don't know it's a movie, is about Borat, a Kazak newsreporter that comes to the United States to make a documentary only to have chaos ensue. Being based off a character on the Ali G show, I always thought that the character, Ali G had more funny scenes on that show, and this one disappointingly recycles gags from the show, but overall the gags remain new and enticing the way through. However, the biggest creative problem is that the character of Borat, himself, is one joke, and that joke starts to become thin. In fact, he is so one-dimensional that it kind of brings down the movie by making it too one-note in that department, but the strength of the supporting material keeps it afloat. It's a sure 7 out of 10.<br/><br/>I must also say that while I do not mind the cruelest of humor in fictional settings, the fact that this deals with real people, who are speaking without knowledge of the joke, adds an unnaceptable edge to some of the humor. The things they do to some of these real people are simply mean and disrespectful. I always felt that in the television show, there was always an element of warmness to various fake interviews and sketches, but I only got that in a few of the bits here. This doesn't affect whether it's a good movie or not, but I just want to say that I don't approve of humor that hurts real people, without their knowledge."

","Wow.<br/><br/>Subversive, crude, offensive, shocking, racist, sexist, misogynistic, crass, classless and tasteless. This is also, by far, the best comedy of 2006 (hell, the last five years). Sasha Baron Cohen completely inhabits the character of Borat with such aplomb, you almost buy him completely. Everything is in-your-face and uncompromising, resulting in a barrage of some of the most unbelievably brilliant humor ever conceived.<br/><br/>I work in a cinema, and every time I check this film out on shift, I walk into (often sold-out) rooms of people just splitting themselves with laughter. Many of the scenes are played out very well (although the question of pre-planned contrivance comes up many times), and the dialogue will go down in the annuls of quoted-at-every-turn history. The best thing about this film, however, is that it's a big dumb comedy with an underlying core of razor-sharp observation, regarding many, many problems with our world today.<br/><br/>BE WARNED: Don't even think about seeing this film, if you can't laugh at yourself or taboos. I mean that. Anyone who takes things on-screen seriously, will find it very hard to sit through. Many have been offended deeply, and that's understandable. It can be very offensive to sensitive souls. But then, what the hell are they doing seeing this film anyway?"

","This is a hilarious movie and Sasha Baron Cohen is amazing. One of the reasons Borat works is because it doesn't belabor its jokes. It delivers the punch-lines then moves on. The movie is set up as a road trip, but each stop over has its own set of characters and comedic set pieces. The variation keeps things fresh and the relatively short running length (less than 90 minutes) ensures that Borat doesn't overstay its welcome."

","The fact that this film managed to get 7,3 average score on idmb and is nominated for Oscar and other awards is BEYOND ME. It really makes me question the taste and mindset of general public and also professional movie evaluators. This film is artistically 100% tasteless, and the content is not funny - it is offensive and racist.<br/><br/>I remember when the UK reality TV personality Jane Goody (now deceased) said something about poppadoms in relation to the Indian movie star. This one sentence nearly cost Jane Goody her career. And yet Sacha Baron makes a whole film - a horribly offensive racist film - and this is going up to Oscars? Where is the logic? I have a very good sense of humor and also a broad taste in movies, as I have seen loads of different movies and i am able to enjoy many different styles and genres. However, in this movie i did not find anything to like or even barely tolerate.<br/><br/>I question Sacha Barons sanity and IQ level after seeing this movie. What is the point of this movie? Why did he pick Kazakhstan people as his target? Judging from the movie, he knows nothing about Kazakhstan.<br/><br/>I was born in Eastern Europa and i have also been in Kazakhstan. I found nothing funny in making fun of little known nations with a very ancient and interesting cultural heritage. Kazakhstan people are nothing like pictured in the movie. If anything, in the movie version of Kazakhstan people Sacha Baron portrayed himself. And the portrait of Sacha Baron I get from this movie is following: a 5 year old boy with serious psychological issues and ugly distorted mind."

"JamesHitchcock","8","2","8","20 December 2006"," Boratism Lives!
","""Borat"" is a film like no other. It is essentially a spoof documentary about a television producer from Kazakhstan making a documentary about America. What little plot there is deals with Borat's journey across America in search of Pamela Anderson, with whom he has fallen in love after watching an old episode of ""Baywatch"", and whom he hopes to marry.<br/><br/>Borat is a creation of the British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen- I presume he always uses his middle name to avoid being taken for a female American ice skater- who uses Borat, an outsider, to voice opinions that would be unacceptable in modern Western society. This is not a film for the politically correct. (Neither is it a film for those who dislike scatological humour). Borat is a dyed-in-the-wool misogynist, whose view of women is that they have brains the size of a squirrel's and were placed on Earth solely for men's sexual pleasure. This includes his sister whom he proudly describes as ""number four prostitute in Kazakhstan"". He is an even more confirmed racist with an obsessive hatred of Jews. Other targets of his scorn include blacks, gays, ""retards"", gypsies and (for some reason) Uzbeks. In the course of his journey he meets various representatives of American society- a feminist group, a Jewish couple who run a bed-and-breakfast establishment, a ""fine dining"" society, a comedian, a consultant on etiquette, a driving instructor, a fundamentalist preacher, a rodeo organiser, a group of college students- and either tries to shock them with his views or to tempt them into agreeing with them.<br/><br/>The first thing to be said about the film is that it is extremely funny. Sometimes the humour was not to my taste (like the extended wrestling match between two naked men), but most scenes - the one in the Jewish bed-and-breakfast, the dinner party, Borat's encounters with the black youngsters and the gay pride marchers, his rivalry with his neighbour Nushuktan Tulyiagby, the rodeo, his ill-fated attempt to woo Pamela- had me (and my wife) laughing out loud. There are also some great one-liners. (""You telling me the man who try to put a rubber fist in my anus was a homosexual?"") <br/><br/>Some Kazakhs have taken exception to the use made of the name of their country, it is clear that Borat's Kazakhstan has virtually no connection with the actual state of that name in Central Asia. Cohen probably chose Kazakhstan as Borat's homeland because it is a country of which the great majority of Westerners will have no mental image. In Britain we have our preconceived ideas about the Americans, the French, the Germans and a couple of dozen other nationalities- not just crude racist stereotypes but also more subtle assumptions about national character, behaviour, diet, costume and so on. Most British people (even if they have heard of Kazakhstan) will have no such preconceived picture of the Kazakhs.<br/><br/>The film has aroused a lot of controversy; some people appear to have assumed that Cohen shares Borat's opinions and that this is a propaganda film made in aid of some ultra-reactionary ideology. Such objections, of course, miss the fundamental point of this film. It is often the fate of satirists to be assumed to be espousing the views they are satirising. Cohen is himself Jewish and made the film in order to expose anti-Semitism and other prejudices in modern society. If you found yourself agreeing with Borat, the joke is on you.<br/><br/>While Borat is unable to find any Americans who share his views on Uzbekistan, other forms of bigotry seem, on the evidence of this film, to be flourishing.( For example, he is able to get the rodeo crowd cheering with a bloodthirsty speech calling for the total destruction of Iraq, even down to the lizards). Although there has been a lot of debate about which scenes involved genuine members of the public and which were scripted, it is clear that Cohen's intention was not to celebrate prejudice but to satirise it- and not just to satirise it in America. Borat's views on Jews might seem horrendous, but they are only an exaggerated version of anti-Semitic sentiments which still persist in many places In the West the expression of such opinions has, since 1945, been taboo, but in other parts of the world venomous anti-Jewish hatred can be quite openly expressed. Cohen will no doubt appreciate the irony that while his film was still in the cinemas the Iranian Government- with the full approval of the President of that country- hosted an international conference of Nazi apologists, Holocaust deniers and anti-Jewish bigots. Boratism lives! 8/10"

","Thanks to sharp satirists that came before, like Lenny Bruce, Andy Kauffman, Norman Lear, Redd Foxx and Eddie Murphy, Sacha Baron Cohen and his colleges create a sensation with ""Boart."" Co-scripter Anthony Hines and Director Larry Charles join forces with Cohen to satirize every sacred cow they can conjure. This includes nationalism, racism, politics, sex and religion.<br/><br/>One outrageous joke after the next leave some audiences in stitches throughout. Indeed, it would be good to have nurses in the lobby to treat those whose sides ache (or have upset stomachs).<br/><br/>Not that this is everyone's cup of tea; far from it. Like much avant garde and underground humor, there is much here that could be construed literally, and be downright offensive.<br/><br/>I suspect this will play better in larger cities and more hip cosmopolitan regions than in more conservative provinces. Well, if some folks don't ""get it,"" that's their problem.<br/><br/>The rest of the younger, hip set will, and laugh themselves silly over the stinging satiric thrusts taken at so many folks' ridiculous prejudices.<br/><br/>There's never been a film quite like ""Borat,"" and it lifts the humor bar several notches higher (or lower, depending on your point of view) -- daring others to ""top this."" As for ""bad p/r,"" what's scandalous today will be tame turkey tomorrow.<br/><br/>""Borat"" is a brilliant piece of work, powerful and unforgettable."

","I still go to the theater, but rarely on a Friday or Saturday night. My wife, who's always into ""what's new"", spontaneously suggested seeing this last evening and since it sounded humorous enough I took the chance. I'm glad I did, since I ended up having a great time and got to see a funny film with an appreciative audience who was in hysterics from start to finish! I'll say right from the beginning that my experience was enhanced by seeing this as movies were intended to be seen - with a fun audience having a great time together in the theater. I don't think it would nearly have been as much of a good time at home alone.<br/><br/>Borat Sagdiyev (Sacha Baron Cohen) is a modest TV personality living in the ""backwards"" (as the film portrays it) country of Kazakhstan, located in Central Asia. He sets out on a mission to America to make a documentary, first arriving awkwardly in New York City and then making his way slowly to California to search for Pamela Anderson after seeing her on an episode of Baywatch on his hotel television and falling in love with her. His wild and crude journey through the USA is continuously funny, and the rapid pace at which the gags are fired away is constant and never lets up. This is already a film that's being called disgusting, offensive, insensitive, you name it -- and I admired that it crosses many politically correct lines and may certainly get some panties twisted here and there, for people who take things too seriously. It's hard to dislike the naive character of Borat and I can't remember the last time I had this much fun with a comedy at the movies. *** out of ****"

","I just had to post a comment after reading some of the comments from the 1 star brigade slating Sacha as a racist and how the movie portrays various races/countries. If you think along these lines then you really have no sense of humour or irony whatsoever and shouldn't really go and see or comment on a movie like this in the first place. Anybody with half a brain realises that Kazakhstan may not be 100% as portrayed (in the same way any US movie portrays the UK as all country houses and toffs speaking posh) and that being a Jew, perhaps he is trying to make a statement about anti-semetic people in general rather than slagging off his own religion....<br/><br/>The only people who came out of it badly for me were the ones who deserved to, ie the college jock and the guy at the rodeo. The dinner party people and the antique shop owners came across as genuine people, and because of this there reactions were all the more amusing. He just gave people the rope to hang themselves with and some did a fine job, others came out with some dignity intact.<br/><br/>It certainly is the funniest movie i've seen for a while but with the state of comedy at the cinema its not saying much."

I think Carrey and Ferrell and Stiller are far more original and adventurous with their work, every bit as anarchic, and far less predictable. I found the hooker with a heart of gold especially disappointing. And I know films are now made to be ugly, but I can't resist the rant - Gondry makes beautiful images, Peter Sellers appreciated the artistry of what he was up to, and look at the Mr. Hulot films - very, very silly - yet stylish and masterfully shot. And then there's the magic of Chaplin and Keaton. Is this love of amateurish film-making just a fad, or is this all that American directors, inspired by HBO rather than theater, are capable of?"

But also, let me warn you that the nudity of the fat guy and the whole wrestling on the bed scene, was a little much for my taste. It was sick but you still couldn't help but laugh.

However, I'm not sure if it is good that people that do not want get involved are involved (Borat) - subtract 2. Finally, this makes a (0+10)/2-2 = 3 rating. That's fine! But people it is not and never will be the best comedy of the year. I bet that over the next few weeks the rating of the movie will drop fast. This is not a good Comedy!<br/><br/>The difference between Jackass and Borat is: who get's involved in the jokes. In Jackass the actors only harm themselves ( and eventually some mindless copyist! And this is very good very good that the copyists harming themselves). In Borat, Cohen is harming not only himself but also other people which as it seems to me do not want to get involved. I wish Cohen and the production company a lot, a lot of lawsuits! It is the reason why I would rate Borat lower than Jackass."

I couldn't believe what I was seeing on the screen, and that made it all the funnier. Sacha Cohen is either fearless, crazy, or has a death wish, but either way he is my new hero.<br/><br/>BTW - This movie is definitely NOT anti-semetic.

Get ready for lots of inappropriate, irreverent and shocking, crude behavior! But on another level, the brilliance of Borat is his ability to epitomize the very kind of people he is making a parody of. The movie speaks to everyone because we all have prejudices, just in different degrees of tolerance. As Borat continues to meet all kinds of characters in his trip, the audience learns a lot more about the people Borat meets, and secretly, about themselves if they venture enough to put themselves in the characters' shoes.<br/><br/>Now that sounds like too much work for a cheesy documentary/satire, but that's how the movie appeals to a broad range of people on so many levels. One can take this movie and pass it off as crass, toilet humor, and yet one can also take the humor to be quite high-brow in kitschy packaging.

During his coast to coast journey for research, we see the cultural differences of Borat and the American public which create all too funny situations that had me in stitches for a majority of the film.<br/><br/>It seems that most of this film was semi-thought out. The situation Borat put himself in seemed to be predetermined, but the way he went about it definitely did not seemed scripted. Even with this sort of quasi-thought out movie and plot, Cohen delivers with a hay-maker each and every scene. Some are shockingly wild, some are full of racism, some are just downright absurd; but not once does Cohen fail to deliver.

Sacha Baren Cohen truly depicts America and its people...maybe not at its finest, but it definitely is accurate. This is a great movie to go and see with a bunch of people and will most likely become a cult classic due to the popularity of Da Ali G show.

","(Now here is improv comedy at its best, or worst, depending on your point-of-view. On a dreary, rain-soaked day in Virginia, this flick eased my Election Day jitters.)<br/><br/>In ""Borat!: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan,"" the new film from director Larry Charles and starring ""Da Ali G Show"" Sacha Baron Cohen of Britain as his Kazakhstan-born alter-ego Borat Sagdiyev, the U.S. and A gets a hilarious dose of its own medicine in showing the world our ignorance of places we only see on the news. (How many of us can point out the Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan on a map? Hint: It's NOT a part of the Middle East, as its Middle Eastern-sounding name might imply.) In recent weeks, ""Borat!"" has received the scorn of not only folks here at home (who claim the film is pure propaganda - overlooking the fact it's a satire, not a political piece), but of officials high up in the Kazakhstan government, who have denounced his portrayal of their country as a bunch of backward hicks, as well as his false representation of Kazakhstan. In ""Borat!,"" a quasi-documentary/movie, Borat is sent by his government to the United States to learn the economic, racial, and social traits that could be adopted on his native soil. On a hilarious whirlwind tour through New York, Washington, D.C., North Carolina, Georgia, Texas and finally California, we get to see that we are not so perfect ourselves. During these Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan, Borat and his pudgy sidekick Azamat Bagatov (Ken Davitian) try America on for size. Borat learns to drive an automobile, is coached on humor and etiquette, purchases an ice cream truck, crashes a rodeo (which seems to get the worst of the skewering when Borat eviscerates the National Anthem), buy a bear (for protection, and also rides along in the back of their truck, and scares the daylights out of passing children), stay overnight at a bed & breakfast run by an elderly Jewish couple, ransack a hotel room in a naked brawl (that climaxes when the two barge in on a mortgage meeting), hangs out with drunken frat boys, gets ""saved"" by Pentecostal Christians, and Borat lusts for former ""Baywatch"" babe Pamela Anderson. Borat's love affair with Anderson culminates in a cross-country journey to California to marry her, which has disastrous results. ""Borat!"" is as funny as it is offensive. Anyone with a weak stomach should definitely stay away. Already, ""Borat!"" is picking up nods as one of the funniest movies of all time, if not the funniest movie of all time; I'll have a hard time disputing that. As his anti-Semitic, woman-bashing alter-ego, Cohen is a natural, playing quite excellently on American ignorance and stupidity, and ransacking our politics in the process. In short, he loves playing both sides of the coin for fools - you'll either love him, hate him, or want to watch him be executed (which his government allegedly threatened to do if his movie was not a success). Few, if any, of Borat's subjects know they're being had. He takes great pride in establishing his country's glorious awkwardness, and then counter-balancing that against our own, backwards nation. I do suspect that we haven't seen the last of talking head Borat Sagdiyev, or his Cultural Learnings of America. Maybe Britain is next?<br/><br/>10/10"

","Hands down the funniest movie I have ever seen in my life. Every minute of this movie is a laugh. <br/><br/>Granted it is unbelievably offensive, however, it really is commentary on modern American culture. At times I found myself absolutely horrified. Not by Borat, but by the actions/ reactions of the college students, rodeo wranglers, confederate socialites, and everyday American citizens that he encounters on his journey. <br/><br/>I don't want to drop ant spoilers, but prepare to laugh non-stop as you join Borat from one uncomfortable minute to the next. <br/><br/>I find it hard to believe that some of the action is not scripted, but a majority of the film feels absolutely real to life. <br/><br/>High five!"

In a poor mountain village... where people live their lives as they can. And he depicts them as being bad and prostitutes and rapists... When actually those people are the most hard working people i know, and they are very friendly and happy to see strangers. I believe they were taken advantage of when this movie was shot. It's just a shame how someone can make MILLIONS off a movie like this, most people can't tell where it was filmed but i know ROMANIAN, because i was born there and THE PEOPLE IN THE VILLAGE THEY SPEAK ROMANIAN...

"msmith-56","10","3","15","5 November 2006"," Blazing Borat
","While not at the side splitting-level of Mel Brooks' Blazing Saddles, Borat clearly delivers as the best laugh-per-production-dollar movie in the history of bathroom humor. It is a nice combination of literally in-your-face slapstick and sidebar sight gags that can send you back for a second look. Mr. Cohen is excellent as a Hebrew-speaking Jew hater, but it is really the supporting cast that turns every lesser joke into a gut-busting wedgie. While never an academy award winning performance, every supporting role begs the question ""are they real or central casting""? I still have no clue.<br/><br/>One role, Miss Pamela Anderson's, was clearly her best movie performance. I suggest everyone go to the theaters to see this. Part of the film's experience is feeling the tension build in the audience as Borat sets up a joke that could easily start wars in thin-skin parts of the world."

","I was laughing throughout this movie, it is hilarious. There are so many memorable jokes, my favourite was the scene at the dinner table.'In my country men would go crazy for these two', says Borat gesturing at 2 of the guests wives. 'Not so much for...' He points at the pastors wife. However, every now and then it did make me feel uncomfortable, especially when he talks to what seem to be average American Joes' who turn out to be either racist, homophobic or just ass-holes. There was one scene when i had to literally close my eyes, the fight between the naked Borat and the naked producer Azamat was disgusting. 'Eat my ass hole' says Azamat as he rubs his behind on Borats face. I think the film could have done without that.<br/><br/>Despite that scene, i thought the film was the best comedy i've seen since Dodgeball and Anchorman- much better though.] Whatever the critics say about Borat being a crusader exposing the Americans as being bigots like himself, that is a load of rubbish. it is just a comic going to America and getting a phenomenal movie out of it. whether or not all of it is genuine or staged is another topic altogether..."
"balkanboy","10","3","15","5 November 2006"," WHOA! A new standard for comedy was set on Nov. 3rd, 2006
","I've known about Sacha B Cohen's Ali G show, which I never thought was funny. Idiotically funny, sure, but not funny in any sort of sustainable way. Right from the start, it was obvious his show couldn't stay on for more than a season (or two at best). Having witnessed the type of humor displayed on Ali G, I came in with lukewarm expectations of seeing a comedy on par with Beavis & Butthead do America or Southpark the movie. Basically, I did not think I was going to be laughing so hard, that I would damn near fall off my seat...<br/><br/>Alas, to my surprise, that is precisely what happened. I nearly choked twice during this movie, due to excessive laughter. My cheekbones were hurting because my face had frozen in much the same way Jack Nicholson's was in Batman as the Joker.<br/><br/>Cohen has taken extreme bad taste, sheer offensiveness, raw unadulterated humor, male chauvinism, bigotry (and a few other ever-present human traits :) to a new level. He has raised the bar on what comedy is, and more importantly, the power comedy has in delivering a message through satire - about how we are as humans today. While laughing maniacally, I could not help but think of all the ways certain parts of the movie applied to me. Perhaps that is what made it so funny - being able recognize one's self (or a part of one's self) in Borat.<br/><br/>Cohen delivered in an hour and a half what Bill Maher, Noam Chomsky & Andrew Sullivan combined could not deliver in all their writings, appearances and speeches. The satire in this movie has become an art form. I believe we're in for a long wait before we can see someone shake up the standard of comedy as well as Cohen did with Borat. Nothing else he's done before this movie comes even close to being so funny.<br/><br/>Go watch this, and hold on to your seat."

This film really breaks the norms and exposes many deviant ones that are still inherent in the U.S. Though many will be offended, they can't help but laugh out loud in the process! Cohen plays the character so well, that anyone that watches the movie can sympathize with him at some point and be a little understanding when he commits such brash and offensive acts he's so culturally unaware of. One of the best things about this movie, is when he comes across one of his unknowing victims and we can intently watch their candid yet uncomfortable reactions. It's hilarious to see how squeamish and taken aback they become, yet try not to offend Borat in the process because ""the cultural differences are so vast."" I recommend this movie to anyone who loves satire and a little slap-stick thrown in! I can't wait to see it again! ""It's nice!"""

While in New York, he is not exactly welcomed with open arms. His ignorance and woman and Jew hating mindset is not something that is looked upon very favorably.<br/><br/>While in his hotel room, Borat is flipping through channels and comes across the television show ""Baywatch"" and immediately falls in love with Pamela Anderson. He desires to travel to California and marry her, but before he left Kazakhstan, he was told by his wife that she would ""Snap his cock"" if he cheated on her.<br/><br/>Later that day, he receives a telegram informing him that his wife has died...Borat is overjoyed! We are then led on a cross-country road trip to California as Borat learns about the US of A. He takes us on adventures into the ghetto of Atlanta, a hostile group of rednecks at a rodeo, an uncomfortable dinner with a pastor and his family, a naked wrestling match that spills over into a Dallas banquet and so much more.<br/><br/>Borat is most likely going to offend you at some point. Cohen makes sure of that. If you can stomach the parts that are tailor made to offend you, you will laugh your head off at the other parts of the movie.<br/><br/>Unless you are a god fearing, Jewish, woman who is uncomfortable with nudity, in which case the entire movie will offend you, then I recommend seeing this one.

In fact i don't really think i stopped laughing the whole way through....well maybe a few times just to catch my breath or feel uncomfortable for a moment.<br/><br/>Its not there just to either attack Americans or people from Kazakhstan.

As an actor who is totally in control of his character, Cohen never breaks from Borat in situations he easily could have. Whether he is riding around in an ice cream truck with a bear hanging out the window or meeting with a feminist group, Borat is hysterical."

","If you haven't heard of Borat then you must have heard of Ali G, if you have managed to miss both of Saha Baron Cohen's comic creations you have either been living in a box or just don't care. The first thing to say about this film is its not politically correct, it shouldn't be offensive and it's damn funny. Borat a Kazakhstan reporter is part Mr.Bean part South Park, the only people that won't get it are either bigots, anti-Semitic or racists themselves and this film is holding up a mirror and showing you YOUR failings. Following Borat as he ventures on a trip to the US of the A to document what life is like we meet all manner of characters from the lowest (and highest) gene pools the west has to offer. A scene that really stuck in my head was when at a rodeo Borat told the crowd how his country supported the war in Iraq, cue load cheers and whooping, he then goes on to sing his country's national anthem to the tune of Americas, cue boos and hisses. This scene although funny as hell gives us an example of what Cohen is trying to achieve, how he was never shot or arrested more than he was is unbelievable. As far as the humour goes there are far too many funny moments to mention and I promise I haven't laughed that much in a cinema for a long time. An amazing thing to come from the whole thing is that some US students are trying to sue for there part in the film claiming they were duped into the scenes, when really they thought it would only be seen in a very poor country in Eastern Europe, so spoke their unbelievable sexist, racist, nationalistic bile. They are suing now because they are being shown as the idiots they are in one of the biggest box office smashes of recent times. If there is justice in the world it will be thrown out of the nearest court. If you can't tell the difference between satire and truth then this may not be the film for you, but if you can go and laugh like a drain to what I'm sure will go down as a big cult classic."
"Lechaise","8","2","9","17 November 2006"," Close to the bone, intelligent comedy
","Due to the publicity of this film and also the previous television appearances of it's main character, many people will already have a rough idea of what they're letting themselves in for when going to see this film. Usually limited by the confines of his ""sketch"" show, Sacha Baron Cohen's character is here allowed more freedom which leans towards a situational comedy rather than a constant flow of set-up situations. This definitely helps to break the monotony of what might otherwise have been a fairly claustrophobic-feeling movie. I saw this film on the first day of it's UK general release and, although there were only 10 other people in the cinema, the laughter really was so loud that I missed parts of the dialogue. Yes this is a familiar story but it's doubtlessly one that will be repeated by people going to future screenings. The racism and perceived social ignorance of he character perfectly exposes the small mindedness, arrogance and bigotry of the many of the targets of his comedy, sometimes scarily so. If you appreciate Borat and know his works already or are just able to appreciate close-to-the-bone humour without being offended then yes go and see it. HOWEVER if satire, irony and even in some parts, toilet humour, are really not your thing, I suggest you avoid this like the plague. Me? I loved it. Funny yet shocking: it's the film equivalent of watching two clowns in a car crash, yes its horrific to watch, but you can't deny the comedy value!"

In general I oppose humor at the expense of specific groups, however I feel that most of this movie's humor drew upon American culture.

If you have never heard of this character named Borat then this movie probably did nothing for you. You really have to be used to what Sasha Cohen is all about when it comes to his character Borat. I mean, if you have never heard of him than avoid the movie. If you are looking for a smart comedy, then avoid. If you are concerned with political correctness, then definitely avoid. Sasha had to be escorted from the Rodeo because by the end of the performance they literally wanted to kill him. That did not appear in the movie but is true, check it out. <br/><br/>lighten up and have fun with this."

","I think this movie will become a classic. Cohen has created something quite unique. The most horrific moments are not Cohen's jokes, which are clearly just that, but the unbelievable stupidity of some of the characters he encounters like the rodeo director. As soon as it ended I wanted to watch it again: this is the highest accolade a film can receive. Questions I did have: Was the prostitute who Borat marries at the end a real actress? Were the village scenes filmed in Kazakstan? And the biggest question... WHAT HAPPENED TO THE WOMEN AT THE RODEO WHEN SHE FELL OF HER HORSE?! In conclusion this is a very fresh, ambitious project that works on a number of levels and keeps the audience's jaws dropping to the very end."

Then again....so did the rest of the cinema. Borat and his Producer, Asamat Bagatov, set off across the USA on a mission of enlightenment. Meeting an extremely varied mix of Americans along the way. From a group of disgruntled feminists, ""c'mon baby give me a smile!"", to a rodeo crowd who don't enjoy Borat's Kazakh National Anthem being sung to the tune of theirs!

I would like to mention some quotes but am not allowed to. In conclusion, the film is a masterpiece and i would advise all who can to see it. Look past the obscenities and see class! The humour develops throughout the film and gradually becomes more and more funny. Although I feel that the script may have gone slightly too far with the insults on Jews, women, and black people, the film is still generally on the button with its humour."

"jpriest75","1","1","3","1 July 2009"," Most Overtly Anti-American Non-Comedy Film Ever Conceived
","Borat has to be the single worst comedy film that I have ever had the displeasure of sitting through. Full of unfunny actors speaking unfunny lines written by unfunny comedy writers, and shot in a sloppy, documentary-esquire style that gives you a headache in the process. The problem is not that the jokes are racist, prejudice, or just down-right offensive to any person (although that doesn't make them any funnier): it's just a terrible movie.<br/><br/>There are three things that make Borat the worst comedy of all time...<br/><br/>1.) Sacha Baren Cohen overdoes the racist comedy to the point of me wanting to actually e-mail him a death threat. I am not Jewish, nor am I of any other ethnicity or creed that he offends in this film, and I still wished a horrible demise upon him. If a person is Jewish (like Cohen is), that does not grant that person automatic ability to attack the religion for the sake of comedy. If that person, however, does proceed to make a film about a character telling such jokes, at least make an honest attempt to do a few that don't suck. (The Jew-Egg scene comes to mind, and the scene where the elderly Jewish couple rent out their room to Borat, have to be the worst part of film, except for the golden egg that is reason #3.) 2.) Borat's accent was actually more painful to listen to (no, I'm not exaggerating), than running a cheese grating over my eyes. But, the most annoying part is that it became a fad, like ""lol,"" and ""brb."" Part of the reason people think he's funny is because they know he sounds nothing like a real Kaszakh native, which is the ultimate oxymoron.<br/><br/>3.) As I mentioned above, the film is not even an hour and twenty minutes long. For around seven of those minutes, Borat and his more-than-slightly obese Kazakh friend fight and chase themselves through a hotel... butt-naked. This unforgettable scene is complete with the aforementioned accent and a censor bar placed and sized to make Borat's business seem larger than that of a walrus. Hah-ha. Cough-cough.<br/><br/>For any of those who read this that actually liked this film, I am not insulting you, though I will be more than happy to never meet you. If there were only a rating lower than zero. Perhaps a holy s**t would suffice. I'm not kidding. It's that bad.<br/><br/>My rating: Holy S**t/10.0"

","I've been on the floor with laughter quite a few times when watching Ali G on TV, and given the generally ecstatic reviews of Borat, I had high hopes of this movie. While there are a few good gags in the first half (e.g. the feminists' reaction to Borat/the kids' reaction to the bear), most of the film is simply a succession of puerile teenage pranks and/or variations on 'you've been framed' TV humor: present unsuspecting people with a weird situation and film their reactions. If your idea of humor is, for instance, to enjoy watching two stark naked men wrestling on a bed and then racing around a hotel, still stark naked, and laugh at the surprised/shocked/amused reactions of the onlookers, you'll enjoy this movie. But of you like humor that contains a little more artistry and nuance, stay well away. Oh, and as for the supposed social commentary, this is very very lame. Everyone knows that there are some narrow-minded, bigoted people in the US (as there are in other countries). The movie could have done something creative, and funny, with Borat's encounters with them, but instead there only a few brief scenes like this, and they're just facile."

Cohen is brilliant. The real message behind the movie is just to show how racist and ignorant people can be. He tricks people into showing their true colors. For instance, when he went into the Rodeo and tricked some guy into showing how homophobic he was. People just make asses of themselves and he records it.

Sure, Borat's crew knew what was going on, but you just can't predict just how (hilariously) stupefied people will become by the main character's dizzyingly-funny political incorrectness (a horse also falls over). Borat famously came under fire and was sued by some of his unwitting subjects after the movie's release. Many enraged folks, young and old, were shocked by this incredible humor. Me? I just say the lawsuits gave LEGAL proof that this movie is hilarious! All this attention gave ""Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"" some much-deserved promotion, and left viewers in either the loved it/hated it camp. I say it is the most fantastic comedy in many years. I give it a 9 only because I think there was probably a funnier movie made at some point, I just don't remember what it was right now.

Sure, some of the gags are cruel. Sure, some of the stuff sort of laughs at a ""stupid"" America. But it's still funny. Does the anti-American stuff bug me some? You bet.

","Borat (Cohen) a TV reporter, leaves his home in Kazakstan and goes to the United States to learn the culture there and report back.

However, once you see it, you cannot figure out what the celebration was all about in the first place. This is not a funny film. Many sketches can be considered offensive, but the way this was done, I can't see anyone taking offense because anyone watching could tell it was a comedy bit and not to be taken seriously. The words ""comedy bit"" is used loosely here. I mean Cohen's big toothy grin is always looking at you, the audience, during the sketch, to get your reaction to what he thinks is hilarious. Many of the sketches were clever and some were mildly funny for me, but on the whole, not that funny, no belly-laughs as many claim. Admittedly, there were a few funny lines, or questions rather, and they cannot be repeated here as rough language was used to shock. <br/><br/>As mentioned some of the sketches were mildly funny, but if you really took a serious look at them you could see where they rushed the sketch and had they taken more time, then the sketch would have been funny. But, this was all too spontaneous, too fast, and when a sketch is rushed, the results are going to be mixed as you can tell by my reactions.<br/><br/>The best part of this movie, for me, was when Borat was learning dining etiquette, and I must admit, this was a fairly funny bit. If only the rest of the movie was along these lines, but they departed from this. <br/><br/>I like subtle humor and if this was done more along those lines, then yes, it could have been funnier that what I witnessed. But, this was too much in-your-face comedy (term used loosely), and hence not funny for me. And, I do like physical comedy when it is funny however, there is a point when physical comedy is just physical motion, and this movie achieves that. <br/><br/>Violence:Yes, Sex: No, Nudity: Yes male frontal, not erotic, Language: Yes"

","Sacha Baron Cohen has maintained a moderately obscure profile on Australian TV but Da Ali G Show ran long enough that a reasonable percentage of people would be familiar with his work. I was never really a ""convert"" but it usually managed to not be cringeworthy enough for 10 minutes or so of viewing. Borat was one of the characters that made me warm to the show, as I wasn't familiar with the aspect of UK culture that Ali G was parodying, and the German guy was too over the top. Cohen's interviewees seemed to be in on the joke most of the time but I'm sure this wasn't the case in the early episodes.<br/><br/>After a few year's absence, a movie-length feature has been given to Borat, to be unleashed across the Atlantic on an unsuspecting populace. There's something about the Americans and the way they react that makes them such an entertaining target for obnoxious behaviour. When Tom Green (and Jackass) went to Japan I couldn't help but feel they were an undeserving target, given their politeness and large amounts of patience. The American culture is built on assertiveness and unmitigated self-expression, resulting in some fairly eye-opening reactions.<br/><br/>From New York to Los Angeles Borat charts a range of U.S. attitudes and behaviour. What comes as a surprise is how in a few instances Borat's behaviour is the least outlandish. Luckily violence is not threatened (that we see) but you could still say Americans seem to be practiced in dealing with trouble makers. Generally any American production I see on TV is undiluted (maybe with a Brit thrown in for good measure) but Borat provides a good yardstick for American behaviour, especially when he gets picked up by a group of students on an alcohol-fueled road trip.<br/><br/>As painful as Borat can be at times (a remote control can alleviate this) it's the most purposeful and sophisticated Jackass-style comedy you're ever likely to see."

","This is it: the most outrageous, offensive, unbelievably hilarious movie that has come out in the last 100 years -- since the inception of movie-making itself. BORAT isn't just a film: it's the reinvention of comedy per se. Looking at one surreal scene unfold, splatter the screen with its sheer insanity, and then gleefully move on to yet another moment that manages to top the previous one (a hard thing to do in comedy since the majority of them have the mandatory peaks and valleys -- some with more valleys than peaks), is practically a health hazard. There were times when I had to grab my stomach because of the pain of so much laughter. One particular moment was the one when the children run towards the ice cream truck as a black bear comes out roaring through the window, effectively sending the kids screaming back in terror. Is it correct? Not quite, but that's what the movie is about -- skewering every belief we the viewer hold dear and never bothering to apologize. When Borat and his camera-man run away from the bed and breakfast in terror because they're Jews, it's Borat's own clueless belief that we're laughing at. This also takes front stage when Borat gets a lesson on how to go to the bathroom by some very ultra conservative folk who are blind to the surprise he has in store for them. If the movie slows down a little, it's only when Pamela Anderson -- the object of Borat's obsession -- appears. However, by then I was spent in laughter, and oddly enough, for such a balls-out funny movie, its ending was quite sweet. One of the best of 2006."

","I know a comedy's working if I can't bear to laugh anymore because of the pain. Borat is the only movie this year that's had that effect on me, and it's not because I have a particularly puerile sense of humour, or enjoy watching fat, hairy, naked men wrestling. One thing I do like is to see pretentious people have their pretensions tested in the face of such a formidable adversary as Borat, who will push their airs and PC-pretences to the limits of endurance. The etiquette coach, the society diners, the humour coach (honestly! The very IDEA of a guy getting PAID to explain the subtle nuances of the 'not' joke offends ME!) are all exposed for the highfalutin buffoons they are.<br/><br/>Along the way, we also get some painfully honest opinions from ordinary Americans (the rodeo organiser - the only true racist in the movie - and the misogynist frat boys come immediately to mind), which were the only bits I found really offensive, because they were obviously true. Rather than suing the producers, perhaps these people should treat the experience as a lesson: If you don't want people to know you're an a-hole, don't behave like one in the presence of a movie crew.<br/><br/>As for Borat's antisemitism, sexism and other offensive personality traits, they are aspects of a CHARACTER. Borat is not a real person. The things he says are simply designed by SBC to elicit responses from those he encounters. If anyone should be offended by this film, it is the population of Kazakhstan, who are made to look like superstitious, incestuous bumpkins. Perhaps Sacha could have INVENTED an '-istan' (a la Austin Powers' Creplakistan) as a point of origin for his character, meaning he could have done all this without offending ANYONE (at least anyone with intelligence enough to see what is really going on in this film) Of course, by 'offending', I mean offending them personally. Anyone who gets squeamish easily or doesn't like seeing people in embarrassing situations might justifiably run screaming for the hills after watching a few minutes of this movie.<br/><br/>As for me, there were a few moments when I was thinking 'that is SO wrong' - but I was laughing too hard at the time to really care.<br/><br/>The humour in the movie is not for everyone. As (I'm sure) the humour coach would tell you, everyone's sense of humour is different. But most of the stuff people seem to find offensive about this movie is stuff they really shouldn't, because it is the opinion of a man who does not exist, who comes from a culture that probably does not exist (despite his claiming to come from a real place). He is there as a device to upset the sensibilities of some, and to bring out the bigotries of others - to cut through the crap and show people as they are. <br/><br/>Naked. Hairy.

","For those of you who are not familiar with Sacha Baron Cohen, he is the Jewish comedian behind the characters Ali G (a white man who thinks he's black, Bruno (A gay fashion expert) and of course Borat. The theme he has with these characters is an interview based environment with unsuspecting subjects that are unaware the interviews are set up. Borat is a journalist from Kazakhstan, a a country that stretches over a vast expanse of northern and central Eurasia. His cultural differences between him the interviewee's are vast making for some interesting conversation. He has a lot of jokes reflecting around the characters misinterpretation's of Hebrews, gays, women and pretty much everything else. This sometimes lets out the interviewers opinion reflecting their 'ignorance' rather then Borat's. What makes the character so special is the amount of integrity Cohen has for this character. Even if someone has complained about it (The Kazakhstani government) he will come out and give a statement in character. He has no shame, he takes it as far as he can and doesn't apologise for anything. It's a fantastic little character.<br/><br/>Apologies for rambling, I'm at about 18 lines already without even mentioning the movie that much. This movie is NOT safe for kids. It may be a 15 in the UK but it must have narrowly missed an 18 rating. It has every lewd, crude, sick and disgusting jokes you could ever wish for. Though that is one of the charms of it. You'll be better off sticking your kids into Flushed Away or Open Season. If you are easily offended by ANYTHING, you may want to see Open Season with the kids. There is something in this film to offend most people (not me included by the way). It may not be the best comedy film ever made, or the smartest. It may not have the artistic integrity of The Great Dictator or Clerks, but it is definitely the funniest film I have ever seen.

As someone of the Jewish faith, Sacha Cohen should be ashamed of himself in participating in such nonsense.<br/><br/>The scene with the feces is vile. I had to run out of the room when this is shown.<br/><br/>From the first scene, I expected a far better movie. Once he comes to America, the film goes downhill rapidly. A monumental mess."

","The first time I watched this movie was in Spanish and I laughed so hard the neighbours banged on the walls. Immediately I'd finished I stuck it on again in English and started laughing just as hard and continued the whole movie through. Fantastic dialogue that can best be described as one long practical joke on the sensibilities of the movies many unwitting stars. Some come of worse than others.<br/><br/>Some people just can't take a joke and some people are so stuck up in their prissy little vacant conservative ideals and family values culture that they can't even recognise one. This movie is pure funny in a way that some people are just never going to get. That's probably why this movie has 101 pages of terrible reviews posted, no doubt, mostly by exactly the sort of people this movie is laughing at. They don't like being laughed at  simple as that.<br/><br/>The humour is course and sarcastic. The ""racism"" that some complain of is hilariously caricatured and anyone that's genuinely offended by it needs to keep in mind that many of the racist jibes are against the Jewish and Sacha Baron Cohen (Borat) is Jewish. It's humour without the artificial limits of the politically correct and the obscenely limiting illusion of conservative, family values, American Culture. Not one second of this movie takes itself seriously and the drive, from start to finish, seems to be to make the people and the events as ridiculous as possible with great success, but of course it is actually the reactions of the people themselves which provide so much of the humour  the fear and aggression they show to this smiling and unusual visitor. Borat is a make believe idiot springing from a racist and vacuous culture. The other stars, the unwitting ones, are a variation on the same theme but without the excuse of being comedic characters to fall back on. I'd classify it as genius.<br/><br/>From Pat Haggerty, the stultifyingly dull and unoriginal humour coach, to the guy on a New York street that runs away screaming simply because some one tries to say hello to him, the movie is slice after slice of reactions that are simply incomprehensible to most Europeans and I'm sure a matter of concern for many free thinking individuals in the USA. It's laugh after laugh at people that take themselves too seriously with the added charm of a few who just don't know how to take the unbelievable things being said to them. It's got some of the funniest dialogue I've ever heard and some scenes I'll just never forget.<br/><br/>It's brilliant - a hilarious look at the elements of the great mixing pot that never learned how to mix."

","All the hype is just that. Either you will be shocked, insulted and repulsed or dumb-struck by hilarity...maybe just cheaply entertained by tasteless humor. Borat Sagdiyev(Sacha Baron Cohen)is a TV personality that is dispatched from his country Kazakhstan to visit and film a documentary on the US of A. This crude, albeit hilarious and oblivious of political correctness character criss-crosses America to interview the real people he meets in this land of so many freedoms and the body delicious Pamela Anderson. Borat is smitten by the buxom star and will stop at nothing to meet and maybe marry her. Male nudity, masturbation, pseudo-sex and lewd laden language are just a few of the R rated elements that may make you feel like an idiot for watching. I would hate to think of a sequel."

","I'm easily won over, and easily amused. I still laugh at stuff like Van Wilder when it comes on re-runs. <br/><br/>I expected this movie to be hilarious, and I went out after work to watch it. I have to honestly say that I laughed maybe 2-3 times in the movie. The parts that could of been the funniest, were all shown on previews on TV. <br/><br/>It was a major budget film, which is OK if well done, which this one wasn't. Nothing in the movie was offensive to me, so I'm not writing with that motivation. I was highly disappointed and would recommend a rental on this one."

","I thought the movie was excellent in its own right. People who were never introduced to the character of Borat on Da Ali G Show will find originality like none other. Sure, it's basically a hidden camera gag show.. but with offensive, vulgar, and repugnant interviewing.<br/><br/>That said... the film is hilarious. I'm quite familiar with Cohen's humor from watching most anything I can ever find on the fellow, but instead of complete laugh out loud moments, I just had a great smile and a chuckle inside. (Save for one scene that had me elbowing my buddy next to me and covering my mouth to prevent the Pepsi from dribbling out) The humor can and will be deemed offensive by people of all race, religion, or creed. All it takes is a sense of humor and the ability to laugh at one's own faults to see that Borat is not only making us slap our knees but also should force some to reach inside and maybe exorcise some sleeping demons of their own.<br/><br/>Also, I was interested in how Larry Charles and Sacha Baron Cohen were going to make a 7 minute segment of a TV show into a feature length film, and was very pleased with the outcome. Interjected with reality, the scripted scenes were fun and added to the 'plot' of Borat seeking California."

Anyway, there is plenty of good ol' fashion Borat-style interviews and skits that really make the movie worth seeing. Any true Borat fans will not be disappointed, but I personally could have used a few more of his unscripted interviews. That is what Borat is all about! Let me just say this... At one point Borat has the balls of a 300 lb. man in his mouth. If that doesn't encourage you to go see this movie, I don't know what will."

","I can't believe all of these scathing reviews and comments about this film. I am a history professor with a doctorate in religious education and I see this film for what it is, a hilarious and ribald series of ""skits"" both improvised and staged, that is meant to elicit laughs using mostly uncomfortable situations, and nothing more. Yes, Sascha Baron Cohen is injecting a bit of social commentary and racial juxtaposition, but it is being used as a tool to make the audience at once uneasy,shocked and then entertained. I think by assuming that because our American society has become desensitized and jaded to all that is shocking,violent,racist etc,Cohen knew that people who would see this film will become aware that they really HAVE'nt seen it all. I can understand how some uptight people might find this movie disturbing, but if anyone has ever seen interviews with the real Sascha Baron Cohen, they would see that he is a very intelligent man with a gift for satire. Did he go overboard for some people? apparently so, but I laughed my ass off. This country would be a much better place if everyone wasn't so uptight about who they are, and we all need to have dialogues with each other and discover one another's differences and the stories and facts behind them. The lack of knowledge about our fellow human beings is why there is racial strife."

Sacha Baron didn't really have to look very hard, but he still found some of the most ignorant bigots in America for a bunch of his scenes. I have always hated rednecks because of their blind views on life, but now people all over the world are going to think all Americans are like these people. One man Borat found at a rodeo, went into a rant on how anyone with darker skin should shave their mustache, so they won't be viewed as terrorist. The same man went on to proclaim how people like him are trying to get homosexuals hung from a rope until they are death, just for being born gay. At the very same rodeo Borat praised America and hoped Bush would be able to drink the blood of the people from Iraq, which in turned, caused the crowd to clap and hoot in pride! How sad is it that we live in the greatest country on earth, but those who will only know about America from the bigots they see in this movie, for those people, the image of America will be of hate. Like I said before, I love this movie. It incorporates the right amount of script and improve. It is sad though, that the main thing that stands out, is that there is still Americans who are so blind to evolution, blind to the workings of the human mind, blind to any kind of acceptance, that will hoot and holler at the thought of a simpleton president, drinking the blood of people living in chaos. You can rag on me for bashing these people, but come on! We need to get past all of this bull ****! And seeing the rednecks in this movie, just make me feel so ashamed to live in the same great country as they do.<br/><br/>Great movie, but I think people from other places that see it, will think all of us are that stupid."

Absolutely amazing!!!!! The soundtrack to this movie is also amazing, featuring the hit single ""Throw the Jew down the well!"" Borat is from a crazy little town in Kazahkistan that hates jews. This brings much humor to this film, also for the fact that Sascha Baron Cohen is Jewish. Pamela Anderson's role in the film is incredible and Borat's passion for her is absolutely hysterical.

"SteakSalad_101","9","2","12","2 January 2007"," Wild, unpredictable, and genuinely hilarious: the funniest film of 2006
","Well, here's the moment of truth: my review of BORAT, one of 2006's most controversial films. Sacha Baron Cohen, originating on HBO's ""Da Ali G Show"" stars as the delightful Kazakhstani journalist who has been sent to America to make a documentary on cultural differences. Borat starts out with a bang, from the very first line which is ""Jag sez mais! A-my name a-Borat!"" In Borat, the ACTUAL country of Kazakhstan is made out to be a dump full of prostitutes, animal rapists, town abortionists, and a country that has yet to discover DVDs and Music CDs, and are instead stuck with the ""VCR recorders"" and ""play cassettes."" The first five minutes of the movie is filmed in a studio. Then, for the remaining 75 minutes, Borat travels to America in an absolutely uncut, uncensored, unscripted, and completely unexpected and daring film stunt. Throughout the movie, Borat talks to American citizens: normal guys off the street of New York, rich home owners, slums, even a pair of old Jewish people owning a bed and breakfast. And, then, Sacha Baron Cohen does what he does best: makes people look stupid. Eventually, Borat falls in love with Pamela Anderson and sets off on a cross-country journey to California to make her his wife. The movie is disgusting, revolting, shocking, vulgar, crude, full of sexual jokes, intentional racial prejudice, and is just about insulting to every person in the audience. However, it is without a doubt, the funniest movie I have seen in 2006!! While watching the film you really have to put all the crude scenes and jokes beside you and just appreciate the sheer genius of Sacha Baron Cohen and see that actually, behind all the crude childish stuff, this movie is SMART and ultimately RIGHT! I laughed so hard my throat hurt and head ached after leaving the theater, plus I had a Cherry Coke stain on my pants that appeared sometime during the movie, as the drink had come out of my nose. I can see why some people don't like it, including the Kazakh government, but you need to relax and just take it for what it is: a movie. A movie filmed with no script, no rules, no boundaries, and a bunch of unexpecting and unlucky Americans. And you know what the best part is? After leaving the theater, the first thought to run through your head will be ""Wow. America truly does suck."" See it for yourself. You may or not be disappointed, but I loved it, and I hope you will too!"
"tgee-4","10","2","12","25 November 2006"," Genius. Just plain genius.
","Never having seen Cohen, I didn't know quite what I was in for. However, the word 'genius' seems mild. Outrageousness, offensiveness and brilliant sucking-in of 'patsies' are marvellously intertwined to drive home many social truths that I'm sure many Americans find hard to swallow. Canadian viewers who remember Rick Mercer's ""This Hour Has 22 Minutes"" scene where deadly-serious Americans in Washington DC offer their welcome to ""King Sven and Queen Svetlana of Canada"" through his CBC ""news crew"" will find this expose of their rather frightening neighbours to the south most delicious, despite the extremes to which Borat, um, Cohen, takes the humor. It's Michael Moore on steroids. Well, and probably more than a little Viagra... I wanted to buy another ticket and go right back in."

I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good laugh. His incorrect use of English and desire to learn about American culture was so well done. He is truly a talented actor. Even for those that are easily offended, I think you would see past it for the sake of humor! His quest to meet Pamela Anderson proves that he too wants to follow the American Dream. And the scene with him wrestling naked with an overweight man proves how far he is willing to go for humor. I am thankful for subtitles at time when they are speaking in their Khazah language because you can't hear anything over the audience laughter! Please please please see this movie!!"

","I finally saw this for the first time, and before I watched it, I thought this would end up as one of my favorite comedies. I watched it, and I almost turned it off. I was expecting to laugh a whole lot at this movie, and I only laughed hard once. It had a few decent jokes, but I expected a lot of great ones. I only got one great joke. It was during the part after Borat bought a bear for his protection, and he was driving an ice cream cart. Many children run after the car, and the bear was right there to growl at them. That was really funny. Almost everything else was very bad.<br/><br/>My other issue is that they make Borat an idiot in the movie. He thinks Jewish people would kill him, he tries kidnapping Pamela Anderson, and he and his friend go running through a hotel naked. We get a whole scene with them naked and fighting. It's completely unfunny and disturbing, but I'm just getting sidetracked. Borat reminds me a lot of Buddy from the movie 'Elf'. However, with Buddy, he thinks he's an elf, and was raised in a different environment. It makes sense for him not to know. But with Borat, he is from an Asian country, so why is he unaware of what people do? Just because he's foreign is no excuse. I would forgive it if it was funny, but it is not.<br/><br/>This is not only unfunny, but very disturbing at the same time. 2/10."

I was bored senseless through most of the stuff,with his attack on all of the American people getting quite irritating. I am not familiar with Sacha,nor have I seen any of his skits,but from viewing this film,I certainly didn't like what I see. I'm not an American,I'm a Canadian,but why is it just because people wanna make fun of the Americans,it's an automatically funny idea for a movie?. It honestly gets tiring for me after a while,I mean how many times have we seen this kinda thing?...plenty if you ask me!. Sacha himself is really hard to get into. Most of his humor was not to my liking at all,all the stuff Borat goes through to go see Pamela Anderson,was unfunny and crude. Thankfully there are a couple of howlers in this film. One is when Borat goes into the hotel lobby talking all hip,the other had to be when he finally meets Pamela Anderson at a signing,that was definitely a scream. But I just couldn't get into this,it wasn't my kind of thing,others will probably love it.<br/><br/>The Performances. Sasha Baron Cohen to some is a beloved icon for this movie,I on the other hand fail to grasp why he's so funny. He's often arrogant,crude and dis likable,maybe my opinion will change if I enjoy Bruno.<br/><br/>Bottom Line. Borat is an unfunny piece of entertainment if you ask me.

I did choke twice, but this was not laughter, it was a hahaha moment (you know when you laugh about scatological jokes because you're drunk). How can people compare this to Monty Python is beyond belief. This ""actor"" is insulting people living in poor conditions in Romania (that's where the beginning of the movie was filmed), he's making fun of middle America in a way that has been done way better by American comics all over the years. There is absolutely nothing funny in this movie. You know, sometimes a movie is so dumb that you laugh at it because it's so dumb, well this one doesn't even qualify for it.

Borat is as quotable as Airplane or The Holy Grail but the film itself is nowhere near what those films are. Brorat quotes are more like Napoleon Dynamite Quotes. If you want to think that there funny then you will but if you want to be offended then you will. At the same time though Borat is not the to crude to be funny movie that the other people have been calling it. yes some scenes are crude. Some jokes are too crude to be funny for some people.

"michael_the_nermal","7","1","4","3 July 2007"," Hilarious Toilet Humor Movie-Film Masquerading as Satire
","This movie is not, I repeat, NOT, a satire of anything. It is about as intelligent and finessed as anything Tom Green and the ""Jackass"" boys could churn out, and just as funny. Personally, I think this stuff is the cream of the crop; I love no-brow, sick toilet humor as much as the next Tom Green fan. I consider ""Freddy Got Fingered"" a veritable masterpiece, and wish Steve-O would sign a ten-picture deal with Warner Brothers. With that said, I must express serious misgivings about the ""Borat"" movie, namely its attempt to show itself as something more than what it is: a disgusting gross-out comedy that relies on shock humor for laughs.<br/><br/>Sacha Baron Cohen's admirers would have you believe that this film merits plaudits from critics and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for its searing mockery of American racism and prejudice. Such victims of Cohen's venom include the promoter of a Virginia rodeo and drunk frat boys in an RV. Both make blatantly homophobic and sexist remarks, with Borat apparently nodding in approval. Now, other than that, what more is there to this? The comments of the prejudiced people are buried in a sea of graphic nudity and scatology that overwhelm and over-awe anyone who tries to find anything remotely redeeming about this movie. Cohen's attempts at satire and mockery of prejudice are hollow at best. This film isn't about making the world a better place; it's about humiliating unsuspecting people with gross antics, and cashing in on their humiliation.<br/><br/>Cohen is no more brilliant than Tom Green or Johnny Knoxville, who do candid, reality-TV antics very similar to Cohen's ""Borat"". His ""foreign-man"" character hearkens back to a long and shopworn tradition trod by such luminaries as Andy ""Latka"" Kaufman and Bronson ""Balki Bartokomos"" Pinchot. Cohen even directly imitates one of Green's least-funny antics: breaking the merchandise in a shop. Cohen is less likable than Green, who also targeted innocent bystanders, in the mean-spiritedness of his humor. Green never relied on anti-semitism or blatant sexism to make a point. Cohen does seem to have a mean streak about him. I felt very sorry for the shop owner who had his merchandise trashed by Cohen, and was rewarded with some of Borat's national---ahem!---""currency."" <br/><br/>Still, as an admirer of gross-out humor, I did enjoy this film for what it was. The best scene was when Cohen wrestled with the morbidly-obese Azamat, and when he cheered the messenger for informing him of his wife's death by an animal attack. Cohen was very creative in forming a story-arc of searching for Pamela Anderson, and using unsuspecting people as characters in that fictional plot line. He did do some good in lampooning Pamela Anderson's status as an international sex symbol, as well as ""Baywatch's"" alleged international appeal. Of course, the ""not"" joke with the joke instructor was actually quite clever and humorous, and ironically much lighter and sweeter than the gross-out antics that proliferate the screen.<br/><br/>In short, I have very mixed feelings about this film and Sacha Baron Cohen's standing in Hollywood. I enjoyed the gross toilet humor, but was irked with Cohen's attempt to make this film into something more than a variation on the ""Jackass"" variety of reality TV shock humor. The critical praise for this movie is suspect, as this movie, quite literally, is the emperor (and his obese assistant) without clothes."

Is it really that good? Its humorous but Sacha Baron Cohen seems all to willing in this film to try and be too outrageous. The TV shows were great and I was a big fan but I found this repetitive and cringe-worthy.

Anyone can raise a laugh through insulting others, it's just that most people don't try it because it's not very inventive comedy and basically just makes you look like a moron, quite frankly.<br/><br/>It's interesting that many of the reviewers have commented on the fact that the movie relies on this type of humour in the main for it'a laughs but even that is a con. When you actually watch it, it's patently obvious that, in fact, most of the scenes which apparently involve winding people up are clearly scripted and well rehearsed. Obviously a few aren't but the majority are.<br/><br/>I didn't like this movie one bit, it was just garbage beyond belief. I wouldn't go as far as some and say that it's was particularly offensive, although it was crude, it was just cringingly bad in places.<br/><br/>JL.<br/><br/>p.s. did anyone else notice that when Borat was in the gun shop attempting to buy a gun ""suitable for protection against Jews"" he was actually shown an Israeli made pistol?

Of course, this movie is a satire of American life style but it is neither funny nor original, the only original thing about this movie is the character Borat, but that does not give him the merit to win a golden globe or any other award.

","First of all i was unable to find reason for Kazahstan people to get pi**ed off about this movie and i guess they are not, because only nation which could get angry about this film is Americans and, as we see from comments, they do so. However, the jokes at the beginning were not quite successful, because they sounded like they were intentionally prepared and the visual image was added after, thus they became technical and reason-in-it-self like.<br/><br/>The good parts were those episodes similar to Bunel's masterpiece ""The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie"" where Borat shocked well tuned bourgeoisie society and mocked their numbed customs and lifeless attitude. The same was with feminists - the only reason why Borat so successfully mocked them was because they took themselves too seriously. It doesn't mean, that feminism is wrong or something, it just showed how funny people can become when they are so righteous and assured about the relevance of their ideas.<br/><br/>Generally Borat project resembles the idea of Southpark - whether we make fun of everything or nothing at all, so it's kind of hypocrisy to laugh at the beginning of the movie but then after you see reflection of your nation, refuse the film by denouncing it as unethical.<br/><br/>So this film could bee seen as another call for stop being so self centered and finally being able to laugh about yourself and about the ""sacred"" things like country, god, nationality and many others. Because when people or nations are unable to laugh about themselves war, hatred and other social malfunctions can emerge and it's good when someone reminds us about that."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","1","4","6 January 2007"," Funny, but that's about it
","(Watched in Toronto) <br/><br/>There is no argument that this nominee for Golden Globe Best Picture (comedy/musical) is funny. Comedy icon Sacha Baron Cohen's (alias Ali G) crack at a Khazakstani TV reporter's expedition to learn American culture is obviously another success. But then, each person's funny bone is different. There will no doubt be some who would prefer a more subtle form of humour, such as the British version, or Woody Allen's edition.<br/><br/>Nor is there much in the movie beyond funny, such as insightful. At this day and age, pokes at cultural difference and intentionally offensive quips are nothing more than common place. The movie does score on it's crisp, cryptic pace in handing out the jokes Â– punch line, move on, punch line, move on. There are quite a few funny touches, such as suggestions of going back (from the cross country trip) to New York for there are at least no Jews, or throwing a bag, in frustration, on the ground followed by a muffled sound reminding the audience that there's a life chicken inside, the hero's pet (or food reserve?). On the other hand, I am not sure if Khazakstans would appreciate the way they are reflected in the movie, obvious farcical intentions notwithstanding."
"watcher-99197","1","2","13","3 June 2018"," Borat - my spoiler is that this film is rubbish (oh, what a give away)
","I recently wrote a review of Dad's Army (2016) and was shocked to see that film offered up as the worst film ever made. I hated it; it was a poor movie in every respect, but I watched it for about 10 minutes longer than I watched the abysmal Borat - and I will never get those 20 minutes back either. <br/><br/>I won't lie - I didn't pay to see this sorry excuse for entertainment at a cinema. It had actually just appeared on Sky Movies (pay to view) or whatever it was at the time, so this had to be way back around 2007, and my wife really wanted to see it because of the reviews she had read somewhere. Me, I knew of Sacha Baron Cohen by his reputation and what I had heard was enough for me to suggest we watch something else (or poke cocktail sticks into each other's eyes, for fun) but no. So she watched with enthusiasm and I watched with a heavy heart and Samaritans on speed dial. After 10 minutes she was rather less enthusiastic, and at the 20 minute mark she actually apologised to me (a rare occurrence) for choosing to watch something so moronic and suggested we watch something a little more entertaining instead. I forget what we did watch, but it was infinitely better (and, whatever it was, be it Schindler's List or whatever, it would have been funnier) than watching Borat. <br/><br/>Borat was infantile. It was crude. It was offensive - and that was just the 20 minutes that we watched. <br/><br/>We both agreed on these things the following day when discussing why we quit a movie we had paid good money to watch, and when talking with friends we discovered we were not alone - in fact we had difficulty in finding anyone who would admit to having watched the thing to the end; those who did mainly said they had paid to see the film and that walking out was not an option. No one said that it was as funny as we had all been led to believe it was and, 11-odd years later, not one person I have spoken to recently has good memories of this shameful movie. <br/><br/>Incidentally, today I was looking at DVD's in a charity shop and there was Borat (99p). Interesting to note that, apparently, there is even more shocking footage that is included as bonus extras that didn't make it to the original edit. Just imagine how much worse it could have been... Also interesting that the bits taken from reviews, telling us how fantastic this production was, are from what would have been regarded as 'lad's mags' that have gone to the wall. <br/><br/>Baron Cohen has said something along the lines of he uses his characters to expose the prejudices prevalent in society. I would ask if he isn't perhaps waving a red cape before a bull and when the bull charges he tells us that this demonstrates that bulls are obviously monsters whose violent and antisocial actions he is exposing. Maybe he could be persuaded to poke an angry beehive with a stick, naked, to show that bees can also be provoked, rather than giving us anymore of his lame characters. Either way, he is not someone whose films I will rush out to watch. In fact nearly anything with the name Sacha Baron Cohen in it means that, generally, we will not watch it - although the kids love the Madagascar series, but were indifferent to Hugo - so there will be no chance of deliberately watching anymore of his crass output.<br/><br/>In summary: this is absolutely the worst film I have ever had the misfortune to pay money to view. I gave a score of 1 because there is no lower figure, but this production - to me - would seriously justify there being a minus score opportunity for IMDB reviews."

","Thank you Sacha for this wonderful picture. I thought you had fizzled out after HBO aired season 2 of Da Ali G Show and Indahouse went straight to DVD. Now we have this great Borat movie, a Bruno movie on the way, and a supposed third Season of Da Ali G Show. God Bless Da U S and A! Sacha Baron Cohen is one of the greatest comedic minds alive today, followed by the likes of Ricky Gervais, Dylan Moran, Simon Pegg, Larry David, Steve Carrell, and Joss Whedon. If you love any of these people then you probably already love Sacha Cohen. If you haven't seen any other Sacha Cohen besides the Borat film, first slap yourself silly for not knowing about him sooner, and then seek out Da Ali G Show on DVD from HBO. Only twelve half-hour episodes, but there is more comedy and brilliance in those five-six hours then 99.9% of all other comedians combined. Oh yeah, ever since Borat's sexy time explosion all over the Box Office, I feel trendy wearing my Borat shirt and my sporting my vanity RESPECK license plates. That's my only complaint. Aiiight!

"bufador-1","8","2","13","19 November 2006"," Recognize the significance
","The hilarity of this film rests in the exposure of prejudices: those of the viewers, who are treated to a Kahzakhi village that is pure nonsense, but which we are really quite ready to accept as a reflection of reality, and those of some of our country men, who display their bigotry and condescension with disturbing lack of self-awareness. The car salesman discussing the lethal use of his product, the gun dealer neutrally discussing the best gun to kill Jews, the frat boys advocating slavery, all remind us of an undercurrent in our country, that is rarely so blatantly displayed as here. We laugh, and believe me we laugh a lot, but we are also made a bit uncomfortable by what we are seeing. It is not just people being made fools of, or doing it to themselves, it is that Borat, by shining a light on some of our hidden parts, releases us from the tension of knowing they exist, but never acknowledging them. I literally laughed until it hurt."
"indecident","10","2","13","15 November 2006"," The funniest film I have ever seen, and yet still so culturally exposing
","First things first. Let me get this out of the way. This is the funniest film I have EVER seen. I went to see it last night, and I didn't just laugh, it was the sort of laughter which has you jumping around in your seat. Warning, if you don't like seeing embarrassing cringe humour, then this movie will be painful for you, but if you don't see it you are missing out.<br/><br/>Borat's greatest strength is the fact that while the movie is more than capable of delivering a string of belly laughs with daft humour and fictional scripted bits, it draws mainly upon having the American public making asses of themselves and delivering the humour for on its behalf, much in the same way the TV programme did of the British public. For all its humour though, it exposes a shocking amount of prejudice, racism and down right barbarism amongst some people in America, and that is the beauty of this film.<br/><br/>The ability to have you rolling around on the floor in laughter one second, and then have you gasp in horror at some of the comments made by some people Borat talks to in the film. This film has its lovers (me for example) and its haters. To me the only people who could hate this film are the people who identify with the narrow minded fools that Borat seems to seek out in the film.<br/><br/>This film is quite simply a work of genius, and Borat far overshadows Sacha Bora Cohen's other characters. Rip roaring laughter coupled with political significance make this a winner."

"sullibrandon","10","2","13","6 November 2006"," A Scathingly Brilliant Comedy
","In his new movie Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazahkstan (you'll only see me use the full title once in this review), Cohen sets a comedic milestone in film history, soaring above everyone else's heads, leaving all other films in the dust, with its genius blend of documentary, slapstick comedy, sharp political wit, intelligent social critique, and all-out gut-busting hilarity.<br/><br/>From the slums of Borat's home village in Kazahkstan all the way coast of California, nothing is off-limits. Filmed as part mockumentary, part road trip, the movie follows Cohen as he travels across the country as Borat, a Kazahkstani journalist who is on a mission to America to learn more about our culture so that he can better aid the Kazahkstani government. The catch is this, though: everything in the film is real. None of the people, as they were being interviewed, knew that Borat was actually Cohen, allowing a full-out range of comedy to unfold.<br/><br/>The kind of comedy this movie gives has been questioned - many people find it horribly offensive and can't laugh at it. Comedy survives, it thrives, when people take chances. Cohen has taken these chances, and the result is a comedy that knows no bounds. This film is the funniest film of the year, probably even the funniest film that I've ever seen. It is the kind of movie that will have you laughing literally every two minutes or less. More than likely it will be every thirty seconds. You'll burst out laughing, your sides will begin to hurt, you'll be bent over in stitches, but you'll have to compose yourself so that you can hear the next joke that comes along. You can choose to be offended by what Borat says and does, but you'll only miss out on the most amazing comedy in years. I can laugh when Borat is terrified of a couple of Jews that he ends up needing to room with, I can howl with hilarity when he slowly realizes that some gay people may have taken advantage of him, but this doesn't mean I'm homophobic or anti-Semitic. I am laughing at the character. I am laughing at the poor soul who unwittingly plays right into Cohen's clever comedic traps. Cohen is the heart and soul of this film. He inhabits his character so thoroughly and so believably that if you met him on the street you probably wouldn't question him either. People who are offended by this film cling so desperately to their previously conceived notions of decorum, politeness, and properness, that they themselves are revealed to be prejudiced, the very target of Cohen's brilliantly aimed comedic missile. It is precisely our ideas of what is offensive and what is not that make this movie so devilishly hilarious. Lighten up, people - some things really aren't that important.<br/><br/>The low point of the movie occurs when it delves into near Jackass quality with a scene of extensive nudity. But that's just about the only thing that's ""wrong"" with the film, and it isn't even really wrong. It is hilarious, though, and it works for the scene. It doesn't feel contrived at all.<br/><br/>With Borat, Sacha Baron Cohen has crafted an intelligent, sharp, witty, comedic masterpiece, one with bite, brawn, and scathingly intelligent and clever satire. It has no equal. Nothing can compete, and nothing will stand in its way. Even its detractors only enhance its genius. Merciless, smart, and above all, hilarious, this film heralds a new age of fearless comedy."

His character is the best ever played in a while. The film was so well done and was so funny I was literally on the floor laughing at some scenes. The plot was hilarious and the movie did not fail at all. From New York to the South or to Los Angels the movie kept me laughing always. Borat is a hilarious comedy that will be heard about for years to come. It is controversial, but it handles it so well and proves to be a smart comedy. The writing was brilliant! Some of the lines, even ones that were in subtitled were too funny for words. The film is racy but it makes you laugh and is a real good comedy."
"Hairy_Lime","9","2","13","6 November 2006"," Gut-wrenching laughter
","It's hard to know how to describe or review Borat. I mean, how do you describe a movie that gets huge laughs from the Running of the Jew, or two hairy men wrestling naked? The movie has some of the hugest laughs I've ever experienced in the movie. At one point, I was literally bent over in my seat, pounding the chair in front of me with my fist (thankfully, a moderately attended morning showing and the seat was empty).<br/><br/>The movie relies on pretty much every funny trick in the bag; physical humor, verbal humor (Borat's fractured language), sight gags (check out Azamat's fridge!), in-your-face rudeness, ethnic stereotypes used in a way to defeat the stereotypes (Even Borat is a spoof on how Americans view foreigners), a little politics (the rodeo), and even the jokes that you have to think about (watching the pentacostalists suddenly start speaking in tongues, and realizing that this is pretty much what Borat's been doing the entire movie). Almost all of it is fresh, audacious, and hilarious.<br/><br/>Easy to decide if you want to see the movie, by the way. If it sounds like something you'd like, it delivers everything you'd expect. If it sounds like something you'd hate, it delivers everything you fear."

","Borat is, without a doubt, the funniest movie I have ever seen. I don't think I ever stopped laughing. Whereas there were certain parts that were at least partially staged it does not take away from the movie at all. The scenes ""in Kazahkstan"" are obviously staged but still very funny. I would recommend this movie to anyone with a sense of humor. Though for those of you considering taking your kids to see this be forewarned there is some nudity. Also, some of the scenes, though funny, are rather disgusting, i.e. the scene where Borat uses a toilet for a wash basin. Though this is mild compared to a later ""wrestling"" scene. Regarless the movie is absolutely hysterical and the anti-Semetic jokes make it all the funnier since Cohen is Jewish. Even so some of them teeter on the lines of good taste. More than once I found myself laughing but commenting on how ""wrong"" the statement was. Bottom line is, if crude humor, American ignorance, fecal matter, and male nudity don't bother you go see this movie. You are guaranteed to have a side-splitting good time."

Borat is a being created by Sacha Baron Cohen. Sacaha is Borats father. This movie was made by comic diligence and impeccable courage. This was a very bold move for Cohen, he took a very high step and really showed the world. He exposed anti Semites and taught the world that you have to be able to laugh.

Sacha's performance is completely solid throughout and you can be completely forgiven for believing that his Borat character is real. His accent never wavers and there is no hint on his face that the extreme real situations he finds himself in, are in any way phasing him. This is a 'must see' film, I have never laughed so much (sometimes painfully so) even the credits section of the film is good. I was still breaking out in a smile and a laugh an hour after the film had ended.

"motegiracing213","10","2","14","25 November 2006"," A must see for any Borat fan or not.
","Before seeing this movie, I had no previous exposure to Borat, who he was, and what he did. When I saw the movie, none of that mattered. It immediately throws you into what he's all about, you're immediately up to speed. Borat, a television journalist in Kahzakstan, is sent to the USA to report on the culture of ""the greatest country in the world"" (USA) accompanied by a documentary crew and a fat side-kick to educate themselves and the Kazhakstan nation of American culture. As Borat watches television in his hotel room in New York City, he comes across a rerun of Baywatch and notes Pamela Anderson and her beauty. Distracted from his documentary, Borat persuades his fat friend to trek across the country to California in search of Pamela Anderson, his ultimate goal: ""gaining entry to her vagine"", and marrying her. The movie is full of hilarious scenes, most of which carry you to the verge of wetting your pants. The film makes many racial remarks against Jews, and some black heritage. When Borat stops on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard to ask for directions, he takes tips on how to talk and dress ghetto. Borat is then seen walking into a hotel lobby with sagging pants, and a new dialect, stating to the bell man, ""we need a place to put our black asses, n*gger."" Overall, Borat is a must see, no matter if you know who he is or not. You'll laugh so hard your sides are guaranteed to hurt afterwards. 10 out of 10."
"jacktreese1","10","2","14","25 November 2006"," Walked in not knowing what to expect... walked out trying to catch my breath!
","I was in town when Borat opened at the local mall's theater. I decided to go and see it, because I had a lot of free time on my hands and enough money to get a movie ticket. I walked in expecting to be pretty funny, not knowing the laugh-a-minute comedy feast, known as Borat: Cultural Learnings For Make Bnefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan. As you know, the story revolves around Borat (Sacha Baron Cohen) and his producer going to the United States to shoot a documentary about American culture. There wasn't a single moment in this film I wasn't laughing. Matter of fact, I was laughing so hard, I actually had to walk out of the theater for a couple minutes because I couldn't control my laughing. I highly recommend Borat to anyone who wants an extremely good laugh at the movies. Easily the funniest film of the year! 10 out of 10"
"shop_a_holic","10","2","14","6 November 2006"," Insanely Hilarious
","Borat originally got his start on ""Da Ali G Show"", quite the funny HBO show starring Sacha Baron Cohen, who also plays Ali G, an English rapper/thug, and a gay television reporter from some European or Asian country. Many at first assumed Borat was a real person, not an actor, but he's exactly the opposite.<br/><br/>The plot of this movie is one of the simplest ever, which is one reason why I think it's such a success. Not that it's a bad thing, but you don't have to think deeply about the moral of the film, what's going on, or any deeper meanings the movie might posses. It goes basically like this...Borat Sagdiyev (Cohen) is a Kazakhstan news reporter sent to America with his friend, Azamat, to learn and experience different cultural styles of ""The U S and A"" so that Kazakhstan can become more culturally knowledgeable. Simple plot, huh? Borat is originally sent to the Big Apple to fulfill his cultural duties, but stumbles upon a ""Baywatch"" collectors book at a garage sale, and sees his true love, Pamela Anderson. Yes, I know, that's a little if not VERY dumb-sounding, but all of this makes that movie absolutely hysterical! Now Borat's journey is set for California, the only place where he can find his true love, Pamela.<br/><br/>Along the way, Borat winds up at an Evangelist church, dining with the South's finest (among other things bound to get laughs), taking driving lessons, being deathly terrified of a bed and breakfast, adopting a wild bear, getting hold of a cruddy ice cream truck, and hanging with some new-found Atlanta thugs. These scenes are just some that got laughs from everyone at the theater I attended, there are many more.<br/><br/>But, there is one BIG scene that ""takes the cake"", beats the rest. I will only say it involves some grossly nude wrestling, that is actually quite disturbing, but in a hilarious way! If you see this movie, you'll know what scene I'm talking about! Everyone I know that has seen this movie agrees that it was the funniest one they have ever seen, especially this scene here. I laughed myself into tears, as did many others. It was such a simple scene, but it was so crazy and absurd that it was extremely funny.<br/><br/>So to state it simply: Go see Borat! Funniest film ever! (By the way, that is not just an isolated opinion, MANY critics (newspaper, television, magazine employees) have said this too)"

His perspectives on the movie are unique to those from Kazakhstan and we hope that you enjoy his review.<br/><br/>(Note: the commentary by Dorat is in no way supported or condoned by us, and do not necessarily represent our world-view opinions.)"" Hello! Is Dorat here. Can you hear me? Hello? Oh. I guess this is one way conversation, so I talk at you and you listen. Okay? Hello? Okay. I come to speak today of movie, Borat. My second cousin from Kazakhstan make this documentary and I love it. It touch my heart. I need say, too, that Borat's sister now #2 prostitute in all of Kazakhstan. Her trophy bigger now. She kiss like Juicy Fruit gum. You know Juicy Fruit? Hello? Okay.<br/><br/>When Borat leave Kazakhstan, we all worry he make us look stupid. But he did great job. His house nice place, too. He show how it stand almost straight and have room for beautiful cow in livingroom. I need say, too, there was rumor Borat's wife die. Is not so. She fall in love with man from Siberia and go north with him. She may be dead now but don't think so.<br/><br/>Borat come to New York City on plane with Azamat, other Kazakhstan man who help Borat along way. It scary Americans on subway not kiss Borat back when he greet them. What wrong with America? Hello? You still listening? Okay. I worried, too, that Borat's Kazakhstan chicken get stomped on subway when she got out of bag. But not happen. Whew! It nice to see so many good places to relieve bowels in America. The flowers in front of place called Trump Towers was pretty and open.<br/><br/>On early visit, Borat run into man who teach him about jokes in America. It strange, too, that Americans do not joke of retards. They so stupid, you must make jokes. And what is happening with feminism. Is that right word? Hello? Okay. Borat speak true about womans smaller brains. Scientific study in Kazakhstan prove it. Don't know why those womans so upset with Borat for speaking true.<br/><br/>Television in America look very nice. And is place where Borat fall in love with Pameela Anderson. I would sex her up as good as my own sister, too. But Borat should not have lie to Azamat about why they go to California. He should have said to Azamat, ""We go California so I can sex up and marry Pameela."" The trip across America was fun and scary. I love bear they get for protection. Too bad Azamat get so hungry later on. Poor bear. At least they no have to clean up bear poop now. I not know, too, that American Jews no have horns. Is most scary! When Borat and Azamat stay at Jew home and not know until too late. Brrrr! I thought documentary turn into horror film. But I cheer when Borat and Azamat get out of Jew home safely in middle of night.<br/><br/>When Azamat and Borat get into huge fight, was sad. But Azamat should not been masturbate to Pameela's picture. They wrestle and fight and run through hotel. Naked fighting is tough, because no clothes to hang on to. When Azamat pinned Borat to bed and make mustache smell like testicles, was sad day for Borat.<br/><br/>It good that they return to friends soon. I surprised, though, that Azamat dress like Hitler in California. Was he trying to hide? When Borat finally meet Pameela, it sadden me that she not understand Kazakhstan way of marriage proposal. Kidnap is natural courting. I sure Borat would explain that to Pameela if given opportunity.<br/><br/>I happy to see Borat return home to Kazakhstan. He bring Luenell back with him, too, and she now #1 prostitute in all Kazakhstan. Borat sister now have competition.<br/><br/>I take away from movie pride all Kazakhstan people now feel for country. We have representative in Borat. He a man who know the cultural learnings of America for make benefit glorious nation of Kazakhstan."

","If you happen to be a fan of the Ali G show well before he crossed the pond, you will be pleased that everything which made the show special then was kept the same in this movie (with a bit of recycled material to acclimate new fans). Sacha Baron Cohen aptly grasps the mentality of a third-worlder with first world intentions in ""Borat."" He creates uncomfortable and unbelievably funny situations by simply keeping his character consistent throughout the film. His cross country travel is marked by precise observations that explain how politically, racially, and culturally diverse (and volatile) the United States is. You will definitely be squirming in your seat for several scenes, but each part is specially crafted to get a laugh, few of which were cheap. More importantly, Cohen deserves credit for restraining his laughs during the filming, since some scenes could never possibly be scripted (though you will see that some most likely were.) For those who can appreciate how much cleverness it takes to elicit ignorant reactions from the general public by playing a fool, this movie is for you."

","Sacha Baron Cohen unabashedly turns the tables on every strand of American culture. From evangelicals, racist college students, jingoists, homophobes, pretentious southerners, idol- worshiping star stalkers, insanely violent New Yorkers, ugly rodeo patrons, morally compromised car dealers and the generally materialistic, unforgiving idiots that make up much of this country. The only beautiful scenes of America are the landscapes Borat and Azamat cross, devoid of Americans.<br/><br/>The true meaning of the film materializes in the end, when the only redeeming American Borat meets is a prostitute and he hands out 'iPods' to his family in his village (where before, they couldn't afford a clock radio).<br/><br/>This is a masterpiece of unflinching, courageous comedy-satire that should leave a bitter taste in American audiences mouths. But don't be angry with Sacha Cohen, take a look at the American Dream, so to speak. Is it really a dream, because for many, in America and mostly external to the nation, it has become a nightmare.<br/><br/>High Five though!

It hurt so much, the comic genius overwhelmed me so much I could not drink anything because I was too afraid that I'd end up shooting it out of my nose. Cohen portraits a journalist named Borat who is sent to American from the glorious nation of Kazakhstan (long live Kazakhstan!). While there Borat becomes sidetracked when he tries to hunt down and marry Pamela Anderson. WIth a documentary crew capturing the insanity that entails, Borat learns the lessons of America and the big city. Looking back ""Borat"" is depraved and disgusting, the humor is filthy and wrong all the time. But Cohen delightfully changes the outlook and makes it side splitting.

He left me wondering how in all its complexity and multi-layeredness can Monty Python be fully grasped by the age of 25, let alone outgrown. Since then I realised that few people tend to look beyond the surface and the slapstick (the Pythons had to modify their sketches for their performance in the Hollywood Bowl so that the audience would be able to appreciate them).<br/><br/>Borat, although it could have been better, strikes at the heart of the problem of perceived democracy, equality and freedom of speech. By playing the primitive, biased rustic, he unmasks. People patronise him, they reveal their hidden beliefs, which they would never have otherwise made public. So much for the effectiveness of political correctness. It is true that not all the pranks are equally effective (e.g. the feminist HQ) but that only goes to show that his seemingly slapstick humour scathes but also spares those that deserve to be spared.<br/><br/>What I believe is the most important aspect of this film is the fact that it reveals plainly the condescending, deeply disrespectful attitude of the world's most powerful nation towards their less McDonald's-ish fellow humans.<br/><br/>For the record, though, I preferred the Borat bits in the Alli-G show, hence the nine."
"igorbroersen","8","1","5","25 July 2007"," Borat is a bad movie *pause* NOT!
","Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan has raised controversy all over the world. Moviegoers seem to be split into two groups: the ones that loved the movie and thought it was absolutely brilliant (there are a lot of 10s and 9s in the IMDb vote history) or it was a piece of junk, full of racist and sexist jokes (1 star seems to be a pretty popular option amongst IMDb voters too).<br/><br/>The answer to the question who is right is simple: it's a bit of both. Yes, Borat is a movie that's full of sexism, racism, anti-Semitism and it's often really rude and disturbing. Does that make it a bad movie? Not at all! A lot of people complained about the ""toilet humour"" and I have to say there's quite a bit of toilet humour in the movie (literally jokes involving a toilet). On the other hand there are scenes that are nothing short of brilliant, such as the ""Running of the Jew"" (lighten up people, Borat AKA Sacha Baron Cohen is a Jew himself, so it isn't an attack on the Jewish society at all), the scene with the Feminists and scene near the end where he says Kazakhstan is much more civilised and less cruel - you'll have to see for yourself what his idea of more civilised is.<br/><br/>Truth is this movie uses stereotypes in order to show how close-minded some people are: Borat himself is a stereotype of how Western people view people from the Mid-East. Funny thing is the stereotype is totally wrong; Borat (or rather Sacha Baron Cohen) uses stereotypes to show the darker sides of the Western community. It's not an attack on our society or the Western society at all, nor is it one on the Eastern. It's a warning to show we need to lighten up and need to stop having all these images of the East as being evil  the scene with the rodeo guy telling Borat to shave his moustache because it makes him look like a terrorist is evidence of this. In short: Cohen uses stereotypes to warn us of stereotypes and the dangers they hold.<br/><br/>Borat is both a warning and an advise to stop taking things so literally and so seriously. Yes, Borat is a sexist and a racist (and much more) but that doesn't stop him from being so funny you need to be rehabilitated when you're done watching  you've simply laughed yourself to death.<br/><br/>That is, as long as you're willing to stop taking things so seriously."
"tarchon","7","1","5","2 July 2007"," Over-the-top quasi-ethnic comedy with a keen eye for the ridiculous
","If you hate ethnic jokes, you really don't want to see this movie. Two things set it apart from the average ethnic stereotype spiel though. The first is Cohen's spontaneity and timing as the main character, Borat, and the second is the way that the ethnic ""stereotypes"" being ridiculed are often actual people. It's hard to argue that the ""drunken college boy"" is an unfair stereotype if they're filming real drunken college boys. The single funniest thing I found in it is Cohen's brilliant send up of anti-Semitism, which is all the funnier because it is so close to the mark on the absurd way Jews are often mythologized, as if they're mysterious beings from another planet. I think a lot of people who were really put off by this film were put off by it because they don't realize how much of the off-the-wall ridiculous stuff in in it is perilously close to reality. There really are people in this world who believe that Jews have horns, for example. There are also a lot of instances where at first glance, it might seem as though the movie is making fun of a particular group of people (urban black youths or charismatic Christians for example) but really the humor is not so much in what they do in their own social context, but in the way that Borat interprets what they do. It is often not gentle humor though, and it intrudes on the boundaries of a lot of comfort zones."

The differences are just different ways to interpret the reality, trough the culture. This movie explores this concepts. Some people said this movie is racist. IT ISN'T. It only shows a racism that isn't the most common. It can result insulting for American people, but only for those that can see beyond their noses. The film tells the story of a young foreign (Borat). He lives in Kazakhstan, and go to the EE.UU. to learn the marvelous life standards and culture that this country constantly tries to make universal for all people around the world, no matters what they think, or what they need. This parody, is trying to show how can any culture be influenced by ""new models"" that seems better, but that only can be applied to an specific region or people.

Borat is a brutal, absolutely limitless and endless waterfall of humor that is so cynical, so unrestrained, and so dark, that any weak-hearted person may get crazy. Borat is a Kazakhstan TV-persona (as the story goes), who lives in shockingly poor village and then is sent to the USA to ""teach Kazakh people lessons"". The whole film is a non-stop, multicolored, multi-dimensional assault of crude, vivid, cruel gags and jokes, where there is not a single topic left that is forbidden in the States. Jews, gays, Afro-Americans, patriots, Southerners, Mr. Bush, Iraqi war, disabled persons, Charismatic churches, The Baywatch  everything is mocked at with no limit and with no boundary. Borat speaks this terrible, wrong American and makes such horrible mistakes that it only multiples the effects by a mile. And it works. The film is one unstoppable burst of laughter, and the pun, the sarcasm, the irony hit the aim. Sometimes, you have to rub your eyes in utter disbelief, so hilarious it all is. Borat, in fact, is a marvelous movie equivalent of Frank Zappa with all his caustic jokes and disdain, and he is a great follower of South Park tradition where no sacred cow is left untouched. The very fact that this film is prohibited in Russia and Kazakhstan to appear on wide screens speaks tons for it. Do not watch it if you lack sense of humor or if you are painfully touchy. This is a dish not for the weak stomachs and it will feed you with thoughts and ideas to ponder for days and days."

","I've been familiar with the Borat character from Cohen's Ali G shows in the UK, so knew what to expect. He's at his very best with unsuspecting members of authority, from small gun clubs through to government figures, where he can cajole them into saying things they'd rather not, or certainly wouldn't say on national TV. There are some Borat clips available from his time in the US which were not included in the film and I wondered why, because some of these were much funnier than what was included. However, the confrontations with the unsuspecting were still good and worth watching. Maybe not enough of them for me.<br/><br/>There are pieces which are obviously set up, and this is where it falls flat because you know the 'unsuspecting' are actually in on it. OK, it needs a rolling story, and the hotel naked fight with his adviser was funny/ridiculous and parts of this made me wonder why on earth he'd put his naked frame up against the anger of a big hotel security guard who may not have had the opportunity to bash someone in a while. He does suffer for his art in places here.<br/><br/>In one of early encounters with a genuine 'unsuspector' it's funny that he gets the guy to state that he wants homosexuals hanged!

","Off the wall,in bad taste, politically in-correct...all these things and much more can be used to describe Borat. While it won't appeal to everyone, there is no denying the creativity, audacity, and near anarchic zaniness of Cohen's latest film. Maybe ""comic genius"" is a bit of an exaggeration, however there is no question that this is a great and very original talent. A must see...even if not totally enjoyed,any semi-serious film buff will find his/her time and money well spent.The fact that Cohen is not himself an American adds a nice touch to the ""outsider's"" look at U.S. culture and society. Besides the rather extreme and outlandish humor, it is the choices of who and what to meet in America that make this a film that has more than entertainment value. It does, believe it or not, provide plenty of food for thought. That adds up to a much higher than average night at the movies."

","Rushed out to the cinema after hearing this is one of the most shocking, offensive, and hilarious movies ever made.

Oh, it's a decent movie, but after having my expectations pegged that high, it was a HUGE letdown. I think this is perhaps the most over-hyped movie ever. I think I'm pretty unique in giving this movie a 7 - it seems like everyone either loves it or despises it, but the reality is it's just OK.

","An unprepared viewer of ""Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"" would interpret the movie as offensive, vulgar, and insulting to our country. But, if you look at it another way, it is a gift for our country. By acting uncivilized, antisemitic, ignorant, and rude, Borat proves to his American audience the flaws in U.S. society. It is not Borat, a Jew himself, who is to be laughed at but the unbelievably uncivilized citizens of the United States. Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius. Preceding our mid-term elections, Cohen has exposed our country, so that we can make educated votes on November 7th. It is a shock to see first-hand the antisemitism and atrocities of this country. Because of Borat's documentary, Americans have seen what we did not expect to see in our first-world United States. But we can fix it. ""Borat"" is an absolutely hilarious film, but it is also an important warning. Therefore, we must tell our friends to see it and enjoy it so that America can rise above its flaws and become a better country."

","Cohen is a comedian. His intent is to make you laugh. And that's what he does with this movie. Yes, it's completely disgusting at times. There were times I was groaning as loudly as I was laughing. But I was always laughing. Throughout the entire movie, without stopping. During the wrestling scene, I thought I was actually going to have a heart attack. It was so funny that I went back to see it again two days later and laughed even harder. Both times, the theater was SRO, and I've never had a theater experience like that--where everyone laughed nonstop and groaned at the same time. When it was over, we were all holding our sides. My cheeks hurt. Just as so-called ""scary"" movies are rarely scary to me, most ""comedies"" don't make me laugh. But Borat succeeded wonderfully in doing that. I was still laughing hours after the movie ended. Even though I think the movie had a great deal of biting social commentary (like another of my all-time favorite movies, Team America: World Police), sometimes it's just good to laugh really hard for a couple of hours. After all, we Americans don't have much to laugh about these days."

","One suggestion for the non-English speaking, don't watch the movie if you don't have a good English. The way you perceive the movie will change drastically, if you have lived for a while with citizens of the former USSR in a English speaking environment. I don't know if Kazakhs speak like that, but Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian have this kind of accent. The main character imitates very well this. The unreal grotesque of the presented cultural difference must not be taken as it's face value, like some people do. The grandfather of a friend of mine, who fought in the Second World War and suffered the invasion of the Red army in Bulgaria, was telling me that some of the Kazakhs in the ranks of the Red army haven't seen a hand watch by that time. I don't know what Sacha Baron Cohen was trying to present, but the movie ridicules the outdated view of many Americans for some parts of the World, who only left their home towns to go on a vacation in Florida for Christmas and New Year's. The singularity of the movie creates huge disapprobation, like most of the unique productions do."

","Borat is outrageous, and when you see this you think Sasha Baron Cohen must be out of his mind too. In fact, he's just very brave. The man knew what he wanted to do and he went all the way. Bravo! The funniest jokes are always the ones that contain some not-so-funny truths and this comedy is a great example: mentalities that are frightening to us liberals are mainstream in some parts of this country. Personally I most enjoy when it is patriotism that comes under attack, and I doubt I'm misinterpreting Borat when I say he tries to show the ugliness and immorality of the concept of patriotism. To those who are offended because this burlesque masterpiece could be misconstrued as a negative portrait of the people of Kazakhstan, I say you're wrong if you even consider taking home any information about that culture. I knew nothing about Kazakhstan before I saw this movie and I still know nothing now. This movie is about America and people who hate homosexuals and Jews but love Jesus and the flag."

I admit that I laughed one or more times but it was not my laughter. Most of the scenes are offensive, gross, grotesque.

This film is great because it shows how stupid and prejudice among people out there , the fact these people will voice their real views when thinking that its a small documentary from some far away country that no-one will see. We've had Sacha Boren Cohen in Britain for years where his characters all do the same thing show people will open up honestly to characters they believe are stupid.

","Borat is a deeply disturbing but extremely funny movie; I guess that's why the only other comment on IMDb so far, has been so very negative.<br/><br/>It's a great movie, but if you're racist, nationalist, or not able to laugh at yourself then don't bother because this movie will just make you angry & you'll hate it.<br/><br/>The point of this movie, what he was trying to do (apart from trying to make a funny film) was to highlight many facets of the ingrained cultural bullshit / implicit bigotry that we endure constantly, without even thinking about it. Naturally, breaking/bending cultural barriers will always cause a lot of offense.<br/><br/>So that means that making this film was a risky business. The film was a lawsuit magnet - i think i remember reading somewhere that there were over 70 suits against the company at the final count. Not least is Pamela Anderson's suit as a result of her attempted kidnapping, live on camera (probably unrehearsed, unwarned, etc) by dropping a sack over her head.<br/><br/>Regardless, if you are capable of watching this movie with an open mind, and are prepared for some pretty shocking scenes (including graphic humor in very, very bad taste), then prepare yourself for some non-politically correct laughs. It really is very, very funny! Personally, I thought it was brilliant. I have nothing but respect for Sacha Baron Cohen, having seen him as Ali G previously. I give this movie the 9/10 that it deserves, the man is a genius. From Wikipedia's page on Cohen: ""His work has been recognized with several Emmy nominations, an Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay, a BAFTA award and a Golden Globe for Best Actor for his work in the feature film Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan.""<br/><br/>This is a seminal work and in future might be considered a pivotal point in cultural evolution; while the humor is mostly of the lowest sort, it only makes sense as humor if you have a balanced, non-bigoted point of view. This attitude has always been Cohen's genius.<br/><br/>As a side note, I found it very interesting to look at the age restrictions across various countries -- Scandanavian countries by far the lowest, followed by South America, then the rest of the world."

Sometimes the joy of movies is just sitting back, relaxing, and picking up what they're putting out. And ""Borat"" is nothing, but comedy and a few cringes here and there. I honestly there is nothing racist about it because it portrays America as America, and sometimes the best way to get over things is to laugh about them. ""Borat"" gives you the perfect opportunity to do so. So many people call this movie ""The Worst Movie of All Time"", but I label these people ""The Ones Afraid to Laugh.""

But, never have I seen the situation turned around. Since Cohen plays Khazahstan reporter sent to USA, he fools around and proves the point: that there are all sorts of people in any country, anywhere in the world. The situations are so everyday and believable, and yet so funny and surreal, that I can't believe someone didn't think of such a concept a long ago.<br/><br/>The fact is: It is a great movie.

","Sure this is funny. Hilarious. But underneath that overwhelming layer lie two others that are actually more interesting and in fact highly intelligent.<br/><br/>Cohen has mastered the skill of almost forcing his subjects into brutally honest reactions to his antics. Normally, people will only offer as much of their own prejudices as they deem will be acceptable, given whatever situation they happen to be in at the time. But what he has learned to do is to create context in which ANYTHING is indeed acceptable, thus freeing his subjects' opinions from their formerly oppressed state. That, along with putting them on the spot with extreme unpredictability enables him to draw out their opinions in a stream-of-consciousness manner.<br/><br/>The other (and most interesting) layer is that of uniquely ambiguous narrative. Is this a Kazahkstani documentary? A ""making-of"" the documentary? A feature film about the ""making of?"" A video travel journal? <br/><br/>Truth is, it's bits and pieces of all of these and more, complete with stock-footage, pseudo-stock footage, etc. I feel that this narrative mish-mash lends an air of reality which results in an extremely engaging experience. And that's the trick that makes it so side-splitting. Footage of a comedian accidentally destroying valuables in an antique shop can be enjoyed in multiple contexts: <br/><br/>---Fully-staged movie scene in which all players are acting their parts <br/><br/>---""Candid Camera"" style prank in which a put-on is staged and some actors are used while others are unknowing <br/><br/>---Caught-on-tape incident in which an authentic accident is recorded <br/><br/>We get the humor of these levels simultaneously, and it overwhelms.<br/><br/>I'd like another example of a film in which almost every ""character"" was played by an ""actor"" who was actually oblivious to his own role. Pretty unique stuff here. It's enthralling to watch someone step outside their own movie and into someone else's, especially someone this foreign to them.<br/><br/>The template for this was surely Henson's ""Muppet Movie,"" another landmark in narrative ambiguity (and another road movie). See the two back to back."

Now, I must admit that the film definitely did make me laugh and that it did make me laugh quite loudly a some points, but I wonder if the laughter was a product of the actual comedic content of the film or to what lengths Sacha Baron Cohen would go to entertain his audience and after viewing this film it is quite obvious that he will go to some extreme lengths for some laughs even if those lengths can turn out to be quite tasteless and crude.<br/><br/>Playing the character Borat from his popular cable television show Da Ali G Show, Cohen's character embodies every stereotype held by a number of Americans for individuals from a ""third world"" country: heavily accented English, unfamiliar with a number of modern appliances, and quite barbaric in issues concerning equality of women, etc. Add to that a thick mustache and black, curly hair Cohen comes across as ""Muslim"" which is an image that is oftentimes synonymous with ""terrorist"" in the minds of a number of Americans. To add an even stronger sense of realism to his character Cohen does in fact speak in a foreign language, Hebrew, at various scenes in the film and his partner Ken Davitian speaks Armenian adding gloss to the two men's already impressive acting jobs.<br/><br/>The film itself is quite simple. Borat along with his producer Azamat, Davitian, travel to the U. S. and A. to acquire knowledge in order to benefit their home. These problems include economic, social, and Jew (Cohen was called anti-Semitic by a number of individuals, but he is Jewish himself). After arriving in America after a lovely tour of his home village, Borat hits the streets of New York and tries to introduce himself to a number of individuals which often result in open acts of hostility towards our lanky host. Such scenes continue throughout the film when Borat visits Washington D.C., Atlanta, GA, etc., which results in a number of people revealing their prejudices unawares on camera, and some of their sentiments can be quite harsh especially the owner of the rodeo and the frat boys.<br/><br/>Did Cohen play fair when he and director Larry Charles or can Borat be seen as a film in which a number of Americans expose their warts and all on film for an audience of millions to see? It is hard to say, but with all honesty, some of the individuals showed a great deal of patience with Cohen's character when he was pushing them to their limits. An interesting film that could be viewed from a number of perspectives, Borat definitely is not a film intended for wholesome family entertainment, but one that might show the prejudice and bigotry rampant that hides beneath the wholesomeness"

He does so even when there are no joke targets, thus making the joke on him as well as on the participants.<br/><br/>==Mixed reviews== <br/><br/>Now, you may wonder why so many people are applauding it, whilst a whole lot are opposing it. The explanation is simple, it's too new of a concept to grasp. <br/><br/>When ""Da Ali G"" show came out, I was puzzled. It wasn't ""ha-ha"" funny, but more like ""is he for real?"" At this point in time, the humor is too new for a newbie viewer. However, after a couple of viewings and understanding the logic, flow and humor behind it, you find it to be a pretty clever work. The puzzlement placed by the ""ignorant"" participants and the absurdity of the comments by Cohen is just great.<br/><br/>If you are used to the new humor, you will love it. If you have lived in a nutshell in Death Valley reading the same book over and over again for the last 30 odd years, you may have no idea why this film is funny. To those who are that, it is important to look at the new things in life, for humor does and needs to evolve.<br/><br/>==Andy==<br/><br/>People may find him in relations with Andy Kaufman, the dada-esquire comedian of the 70-80's. No one gets the joke, unless you are in on it. Thus Cohen/Borat has revived the strange humor from the dead, and has succeeded it brilliantly.<br/><br/>By the way, this film contains one of the best fight scenes ever, in which I would like to award Ken Davitian for ""Best Supporting Actor"" for not breaking out of his role."
"gelman@attglobal.net","9","1","6","15 January 2007"," The ratings surprise me
","I know a number of people who enjoyed Borat hugely (my wife, my daughter and I laughed until our sides ached) but I also know many who found the whole thing offensive. I suppose the vote distribution on IMDb demonstrates that this site is not representative of the movie-going public, because my observation is that fully a third of the people who've talked to me about the movie found it thoroughly disagreeable or stayed away altogether knowing what it was about. All credit to Sasha Baron Cohen for conceptualizing and executing the cross country adventures of a Kazakh TV newsman creating a documentary about America. Frankly, in addition to admiring what he did in this film, I also have to wonder about the wisdom of allowing people to make fools of themselves without apparent consideration of the personal risks that might be involved. I could easily imagine one of his victims going after him with a baseball bat or a revolver."
"stryker1121","9","1","6","28 December 2006"," Crazy, courageous, sad, hilarious, wonderfully un-PC
","I've never had a movie experience quite like the one I had with ""Borat."" It may not be as hysterically funny as billed, although it is at times screamingly hilarious, but to me ""Borat"" is more disquieting social commentary than straight-out comedy. What a strange, eye-opening film this is. Just go into it with an open mind: As a Jew, it was very weird to hear a theater full of people (and me along with em) laugh at Borat's superstitious dislike of my people. However, it was also strangely liberating to hear Cohen's buffoonish Kazhaki TV reporter's matter-of-fact utterances of nasty Jewish stereotypes that go back centuries. And guess who Borat blames for 9/11? I say ""liberating"" b/c people in real life truly believe the Jews are money hungry, have big noses, and we're responsible for the 9/11 terror attacks. What cracked me up (and shocked me a little) about ""Borat"" were not the statements themselves as much as a fellow Jew having the stones to say them for the purposes of mainstream cinema. Cynical, smart and unapolgetically offensive, the whole movie is a gut punch, and while plenty of minorities get jabbed in the process, nobody gets a worse beating than the good ole US of A. ""Borat""is an American roadtrip showcasing our casual prejudices."
"LydiaOLydia","9","1","6","28 December 2006"," An analysis of the negative reviews
","I agree with everything the positive reviewers say, so there's not much point in rehashing there.<br/><br/>However, I think it's pretty interesting, taken as a whole, to see what the negative reviewers here have to say (or, more accurately, the sorts of things that they are hung up on). Their words, ironically, only strengthen Baron Cohen's whole 'point.' Looking through the bad reviews, many people are hung up on the scene with the naked fat man and Borat. Fair enough. That was to be expected. But read through them and see just how many people seemed fit to mention a tiny, insignificant moment in the movie where a static picture of a penis is barely shown.<br/><br/>The movie overflows with examples of racism, sexism, and tons of other nasty things that other reviewers will have described to you. But the one thing that comes up over and over again in the negative reviews is the basically non-sexual, very brief, static portrayal of a man's genitals. The sexism and racism barely get a mention.<br/><br/>I'll let you draw your own conclusions."

","Borat (Sasha Baron Cohen) is a television reporter from a country, near Russia, whose name nobody can spell or pronounce. As the nation is somewhat backward, in some ways, Borat is sent to the USA. There, Borat is to learn ways and ideas to improve his own country's situation. As Borat lands in NYC, he first learns you just don't kiss everyone on the cheeks, especially on the subway. Then, at the hotel, Borat discovers Baywatch on the telly and is instantly smitten with Pamela Anderson. Forget about shooting footage in the Big Apple alone. Borat now wants to go to California and meet Pamela. The only vehicle he and his partner can afford is a postal-type delivery truck. Nevertheless, Borat and his companion set off to learn from America. What will he glean from American society that will benefit his homeland? Not much, you say? This is a funny, funny film, although the humor is definitely on the raunchy side. Just watch Borat interview a group of feminists or visit a garage sale and you will be chortling mightily. Cohen has perfect timing and knows exactly how to make the audience laugh at the same moment he is getting in his digs about American culture. In fact, despite the supporting cast, which is quite fine, this is movie is Borat, Borat, and more Borat, with Cohen carrying the film with ease. If you are easily offended by humor that is a bit off-color, do not see this film. You probably would laugh at the antics but may experience guilt later. But, if you want to laugh your head off for an evening and are the adventurous type, you simply must see Borat. No one will remain poker-faced in the face of Borat and giggling to the point of tears is what lies ahead for anyone who sits down to watch this fine film."

","Finally, one of the most talked about films of the year has arrived! 'Borat' is everything you never dreamed of and then some. Critics have praised the shameless audacity of comic genius Sasha Baron Cohen, who stars as one of his three alter-egos Â– the Kazakh news reporter Borat. There is no film more blatantly crass, vulgar or chauvinistic than Baron Cohen's 82 minute escapade.<br/><br/>The film tracks the journey of a fictional TV reporter from Kazakhstan, to the US and A. Sasha Baron Cohen, aka Ali-G and Bruno, plays the bungling, anti-Semitic, vulgar character of Borat as he traverses the United States in search of Pamela Anderson. The film exemplifies one inescapable reality of life, that it is a journey and not a destination. Indeed the film Borat is more a testament to the uncanny ability of Baron Cohen to extract the innermost feelings from his guests without them having a clue that he is having them on. The Americans expose their contemptuous feelings towards Jews and Muslims and gays, in a film formula which highly effective.<br/><br/>Borat is an uncompromisingly uncouth character, devoid of Western airs and graces. The Freudian references to the male genitalia, a measure of his masculinity are constantly displayed in the film. Phallic symbolism is displayed in abundance in Borat and the hysterical irony of his endeavors with many gays, prostitutes and Jews drives home the point of a prevailing prejudice in all inanity. This is film which will have you in stitches throughout its duration. At times you will be wondering how on earth Borat has the gall to defecate in the Trump gardens, or how he nakedly wrestles his compatriot for what is an uncomfortably long time.<br/><br/>Either way, this film which cost $18 million to make will realize unbelievable returns. Borat could only be done with someone of the ilk of the inimitable Sasha Baron Cohen.<br/><br/>Be warned, there is explicit nudity, innuendo and strong language."
"smolensk","9","1","6","15 December 2006"," special
","Cohen is the Michelangelo of comedy. Perhaps due to the change of director there are some glitches in the filming. Logic goes missing. When Borat talks into the camera is it a Spinal Tap moment or a soliloquy? Pity....cant tell... so one is dragged out of the pleasurable experience. Most impressive is the discomfort Cohen puts himself through to make this film.... Beckett puts his characters in mounds of sand, Cohen nearly swallows a co-star's balls. Genius. The actor who plays Azamat gives what is probably the greatest 'enabling' performance in the history of comedy. Who knows what he has done before but it cant possibly match the contribution he makes here. His genius matches Cohen's... with the special exception that he was not part of the creative process. Nevertheless without this character's total believability, Cohen - Cambridge-polished - will gag at such a word - the film would have missed an important ingredient. Perhaps this great comedy will introduce the sort of hard-hitting 'entertainment' which will expand the horizons of narrow thinkers."

But, was is truly very important it is not a movie about a poor country Afganistan, nor about a stupid guy moving trough Unitedstates and making report for government of Kazachstan, but it is a joke from ourselves. Truly, we can see our way of behavior in the eyes of person from other part of the world. And we can, actually, be pushed to think about it. We are not alone on this Earth, there are lots of nations living with us and they do not have the same roots or historical values as we have. In the same time this nations see, that we are leaving wealthy lives in our countries and they are, mostly poor. .... you will see a lots of humor, action and jokes. It is not static, nor boring.

"Antagonisten","6","1","6","4 December 2006"," Not as enjoyable as it should be
","Sacha Baron Cohen is a very unique comedian in my opinion. He is undeniably intelligent, can be very very funny and he seems to have no single ounce of shame in his whole body. While that is his strength, it's also his Achilles heel.<br/><br/>For those who have watched the Ali G-show and other Baron Cohen-outings, Borat is not a new character. I have often found the Borat-segments to be among the funniest in his shows. The happy and easy-going, but always misunderstanding, Kazak brings out both the best and worst in the people he meets. Cohen does a good job of bringing out peoples prejudices and strange (and often ""forbidden"") opinions through the seemingly ignorant Borat. In this movie we get to see him provoking people at a rodeo, at a dinner party and at several other public events.<br/><br/>The thing with this movie is that i don't know if most of it was really that funny. Most of the time i was just shaking my head in disbelief. Sure there are a few laugh-out-loud moments, but most of it is just so embarrassing it's hard to watch. He does so many ""forbidden"" things that he soon becomes a walking faux pas. Which is funny for a while but becomes more painful after a while.<br/><br/>In the end this becomes one of those cases where i can see what they were thinking, can appreciate the effort, but in the end the result is not as enjoyable as it should have been. After all, there are just so many times i can hear him call people retards, bashing homosexuals and Jews before it becomes old. Borat is a funny character but i think i prefer him in smaller doses, this becomes almost overpowering. For those who can't get enough of the embarrassments this should be a treat though. For the sensitive people it's, as always with Cohen, best to stay away. I rate this 6/10."
"powerfull_jedi","8","1","6","2 December 2006"," Oh, boy, this is such an unfunny movie...not!
","British actor Sacha Baron Cohen has made a name for himself in his Ali G show in which he plays up to three different characters, the main one, Borat a reporter from Kazakistan and Bruno, a German homosexual. Since Ali G already had his own movie, it was only a matter of time, before the foul-mouthed and perverted Borat got his own movie, however this time the movie gets a special twist, unlike the previous movie, Chohen decided to approach the character with a mockumentary. The plot is pretty straightforward, all the way from the wife-abusing, incest-prone, neighbour-bashing, rapist-dwelling, awful ping-pong playing, inept disco-dancing, sexually-suggestive sunbathing, Jew-hating, and rundown country of Kazakisthan, mild mannered reporter Borat is sent by his government to do a documentary about the United States so that he can learn lessons for his glorious nation. However during his trip, Borat falls in love with Pamela Anderson and embarks on a journey across the country to find her and marry her(don't worry there's a specific plot point that clears all confusion given by the synopsis). The movie is a laugh riot from start to finish, however some weak jokes emerge from time to time, but I'll get into that real soon. Perhaps the closest thing Borat resembles most would be Jackass Number Two and,of course, most of the stuff(scripted or not) you'd find on Youtube and other video-hosting websites. Of course, has you'd likely expect, most of the time it's obviously scripted as so is the nature of a mockumentary and as a comedy it's pretty funny. Sacha Baron Cohen is amusing as he makes this anti-Semitic and amusingly disgusting character look heartwarming to the audience, Ken Davitian also provides some great laughs as Borat's traveling partner and producer of his documentary(his fighting scene with Borat is both hilarious and gross). Most the cast, be actual people playing themselves or actors obviously playing regular people(I doubt real Kazakistanni's were used here) do a pretty good job in making this look like a true funny documentary. The jokes are pretty good, the weakest ones, however, are the ones we had already seen countless times on The Ali G Show and the US version. Why? Well, because, like I said, we've already seen them and the ones in this film do not provide anything new, which indicate perhaps a lack of fresh material. The dinner scene and some interviews(insulting the feminist society, for example which was used in the earlier Ali G movie) were pretty much rehashes of the same material, not to mentions the movie drags a bit before the end. Since I enjoyed laughing my butt off over most of the movie, I didn't have time nor the patience to separate the scenes that were in fact scripted from those that weren't, but as the movie obviously labels itself as a mockumentary, you probably shouldn't bother taking it seriously in the first place. Congratulations to Cohen for making a raunchy and bold comedy. Here's hoping for a second Ali G movie and/or maybe a Bruno movie."
"stripytiger","9","1","6","29 November 2006"," Emotionally exhausting: agony, ecstasy, irony all at once!
","I was almost dreading seeing Borat, I knew it would be like emotional extreme sports. It was impressive to watch Sacha Baron Cohen at work, it must have been difficult and demanding to make this film (at least as much as it was for me to watch). It seems like an entirely new genre of film. And, ""Borat"" definitely captures the spirit of our times with Cohen's poignantly sad-masochistic style of humour and domination of the ""quasi realtv"" world. Mythic themes for me included the employment of confusion to conquer, the tarot card's fool, and the trickster. Why nobody has beaten Cohen to a pulp yet? Probably he's quick on his feet, but he also manages as Borat to be somewhat naively likable and surprisingly fragile. Overall, not for the faint-hearted, but to my way of thinking, an important film because it challenges. From the first NY scene on the train, you just know you might as well throw all movie rule books out the window and sit back and take it. Genius on some level!"

But I have to tell you that this is definitely a movie worth seeing. There were so many parts that were so ridiculous I just couldn't stop laughing. Borat is a pretty funny character, especially with his accent and feeble attempts at speaking English. The one thing I didn't like about the movie was that Jews were made fun of a lot. Honestly I have no problem with the Jewish community, or any other religion for that matter, and I'm surprised that the movie continuously insulted the Jews, for example, blaming them for the attack of 9/11. Overall though I really enjoyed this movie and if you're into stupid comedy documentary movies then this is the movie for you to see.<br/><br/>WARNING***: There are 2 naked men seen in a scene of this movie, and what they are doing may not seem very SOPHISTICATED to some."

","Cohen comes up with some superb scenes here-- the ""polite"" Southern racists who live on Secession Drive (really!), the wrestling match, and of course the religious scene near the film's end-- but the film is unfocused and often playing for little more than body-humour laughs. Cohen's very thoughtful satire makes the familiar very foreign, but troubling questions remain: skewering people who don't speak English and who have no experience with the uber-irony of Western media (the film's unwitting Romanian village stand-ins for Kazakhstan) lowers the bar hugely, and there is the cardinal offense of attaching a moral to the ending of the film.

It's a cross between the best of the Inspector Clousseau movies and Mississippi Burning, played for laughs in front of a group of completely clueless yokels who never quite get that they're the joke. Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately, since they're always a letdown) there won't be a sequel; Borat's been doomed by his own success, and will probably never again be able to get away with the stuff he does in this movie. Favorite bits include turning a hyperpatriotic rodeo crowd against him with his own version of the national anthem, presenting the hostess of a ridiculously formal Southern dinner party with a fresh bag of his own feces, and chasing his obese producer through a hotel lobby and into a crowded elevator, both of them stark naked and hairy, after catching the man masturbating to a photo of Borat's beloved Pamela Anderson."

Most troubling for me as a Jewish person is the many scenes and statements that are offensive in the extreme to Jews, and include some of the worst stereotypes. I can't believe that other people, even of other faiths, have not picked up on these instances and denounced the movie for that reason. Can you imagine any film that included similar ""jokes"" about African-Americans? I cannot, which makes this one so intolerable. In his politically incorrect interview with feminists, at least they're given a chance to reply, unlike the Jews<br/><br/>OK, there were some funny and imaginative episodes but they lacked subtlety, good taste or redeeming social value. Very few sequences made me laugh, since they were somewhere between amusing and mildly funny. I rated this film SEVEN for being creative and fast-paced, but would put it near the bottom of the scale if judged strictly for sensitivity to Jews. <br/><br/>I realize Sacha Baron Cohen is Jewish, but that does not justify for me how he portrays and characterizes fellow co-religionists."

","BORAT is a film that I had been heavily prepped for. I had been told it was one of the funniest films ever made. I had also heard that it was pretty much the most offensive thing ever made. Well, both counts are wrong. Borat is a funny movie, there is no denying this, but it isn't the funniest movie ever made. In fact, it's not the funniest movie of the year (which, in my opinion, was Clerks II). However, it is very original and enterprising, two qualities that movies recently have very little of (Employee of the Month, I'm looking in your direction), so I have to appreciate it. If not, we might never get more of those kind of films! The plot (if you want to call it that) consists of this. Borat Sagdiyev (Sacha Baron Cohen) is a minor Kazakhstani TV personality. He is sent by the government of Kazakhstan to the United States in order to learn more about the prosperous country in the hopes that the lessons he brings back could transform Kazakhstan. Once in the United States, Borat sees Pamela Anderson on a rerun of Baywatch and decides that he must make her his bride. So he sets off on his way to California, with his camera crew and producer. That's all there is. It's pretty much a way to set up uncomfortable situation after uncomfortable situation featuring Borat as interviewer, talking to everyone from a feminist women's group to a dinner party of conservative southerners.<br/><br/>Now, if you consider yourself a ""blue-stater,"" you'll find a lot here to laugh at. If you're a ""red-stater,"" you might find yourself the butt of a couple of jokes, as Cohen skewers many of the midwesterners he comes across, satirically pointing out racism, homophobia, sexism, conservatism, hatred, bigotry, etc. Granted, he probably used the best footage (as he stays in character and much of his ""on the spot"" interviews are not scripted), but it still certainly leans in one way. You have to give him credit though, because it is very funny at times.<br/><br/>My friend, upon exiting the preview screening, summed up the film like this: ""That movie was out of control,"" he said to me. ""But did you think it was funny?"" I asked him. ""Yeah, but it was out of control."" Cohen is not afraid of anything, and that's certainly to his benefit - he pretty much has to be fearless to play this character. As for the ""is it funny"" part - yes, it is funny, but it isn't as funny as I had hoped it would be. The set-ups are great, and the satire is spot-on, but often times I found myself smiling more than laughing. When I did laugh, it wasn't from the gut, but more a chuckle. But I'm nitpicking. This film is so much funnier than any of the ""frat-pack"" movies. The problem is, I think I'm a little too hooked on Cohen's fellow Brit Ricky Gervais's THE OFFICE and its brand of humor. Yes, they share a lot in common, but THE OFFICE is less satire and more character humor. DA ALI G show had more of this character humor, but with Borat Cohen aims more towards satire, which is funny in its own way, but not quite as much as it could have been.<br/><br/>In the end though, I would gladly pay $8 to see it again. I shouldn't be so picky. Perhaps the amazing quality of DA ALI G show and the advance reviews gave me too much hope. BORAT is a ridiculous film -- it is indeed out of control, as my friend said. And don't believe the hype -- it's not nearly as offensive or controversial as some people might want you to think. They just don't get it.<br/><br/>Review by Ross Putman, written for http://www.boxofficefanatic.com"

"cultfilmfan","8","1","6","11 November 2006"," Borat: Cultural Learnings Of America For Make Benefit Glorious Nation Of Kazakhstan
","Borat: Cultural Learnings Of America For Make Benefit Glorious Nation Of Kazakhstan is based on the Borat character from the television series Da Ali G Show. For those of you who have never seen it, Borat is a journalist from the country of Kazakhstan, who in sketch for the show would be in America interviewing different Americans and trying to learn about their culture and what makes their country different from his. In the television show everyone Borat interviews is real and for the most part much of what Borat says is unscripted and the response from the interviewee is not scripted either. This is very funny because Borat is so ignorant of American customs and always says and does the wrong thing which in our society may be deemed unsuitable, so it is very interesting to watch the person being interviewed squirm because they are uncomfortable and just their reactions to this unknowing and anti Semitic character. This movie is a full length feature of the Borat character who travels to America to make a documentary for Kazakhstan and along the way offends and makes a lot of people uncomfortable and at the same time exposes their ignorance and bigotry. A side story to the film is that while in America, Borat watches an episode of the television series Baywatch and instantly falls in love with actress Pamela Anderson, so he plans to go to California with his producer Azamat and marry her. Some of the film is probably scripted in certain scenes, but a lot of the scenes where we see the genuine reaction of those Borat interacts with is very funny. Sacha Baron Cohen who plays Borat and co-wrote the movie does an excellent job of playing Borat and he is so good at playing this character and doing on the spot comedy. A lot of the things Borat does in this film is outrageous and in our culture just so very wrong and he has a knack of picking the best people to pull his jokes on and with their reactions and Borat's crazy behaviour they are all pulled off very well. I laughed often during this movie and the audience was laughing a lot too. I don't think I have seen a crowd laugh at a movie this much in a long time. Because of Cohen's brilliant portrayal of Borat and the way this film works so well in the laugh department whether the film is scripted or not I ended up really liking this film. I must also note that I was a fan of Da Ali G Show and of the Borat character on there as well, so when I found out about this film I was very excited. Fans of the television show and the character will definitely like this film and even if you have never seen the series you can still enjoy this movie and you don't need to have seen the film to see this movie. I would also like to add that many may find the film offensive, but I personally found the film to have a message and I think this movie is against bigotry and trying to show the ignorance of people and that it needs to stop. Cohen himself is Jewish and he is definitely trying to make a point here. For a great comedic performance and non stop laughs with a great satirical kick to them I definitely recommend Borat and I hope when the Golden Globes come along that they will nominate this film for Best Comedy/Musical and Best Actor in A Comedy/Musical. If this film were to be ignored it would be a shame. I also look forward to other projects Sacha Baron Cohen will be involved with and this film if it hasn't already will definitely make him a star and he is one comedian who really deserves that honour."

Don't get me wrong: I loved the character on Da Ali G show - I have been watching the episodes since they first appeared on cable. That is why I was anxious to go see the movie. But he went terribly wrong in the opening sequence. His shtick as being from the most backward place in the world works as long as he doesn't make it real. When he uses it only as a reference in his skits, to make the situations even more humorous, it creates a surreal, abstract idea of that ""Weird Kazakhstan"" country. It works because this detached and abstract image is obviously not meant to offend Kazakhstan. Rather it is a tool to make fun of U.S. and A. BUT, making it real, making us actually a witness to the going-ons in the village of Borat - well that kills it for me! That opening scene made me so embarrassed, so surprisingly uncomfortable, that I suddenly had a jolt of fear rip through me: Is this the sign of things to come? This is going to be horrible! Well, thankfully I was wrong, 90% wrong that is. The movie went on with the usual wit and prickly humor that made it so special in the first place. I loved most of the scenes that dealt with bigotry, hate, and uproarious naked spectacle that is human nature. At its best, this movie is a study in sociology, psychology, and anthropology all at the same time. Unfortunately, at its worst it is gross physical humor more suited to fraternity boys. This occasional swing to the realm of ""Jackass"" marred the otherwise flawless intellectualism of this movie. I also felt that most of the editing that was done to emphasize the point - i.e. make it seem more exaggerated than it really was (such as ALL New Yorkers were shown as rude and unfriendly - as if he didn't encounter a SINGLE one who was nice to him) - should have been done in moderation. It was obvious that scenes were edited to serve the purpose of the movie - which would have been fine - to an extent. However, the dosage we get in this movie puts everything Cohen did in America in doubt. A sort of ""How much DID they cut out to make this scene work?"" Thus DEFEATING the very premise of the movie - that we are supposed to BELIEVE that everyone in the represented group would always behave in the same exact fashion. Nonetheless, what makes this movie work on the whole is it's ability to create an urgent need for someone in the movie to go ""Borat, what the heck is WRONG with you?"" But no one ever does! And that's the greatest thing of all! Well - one star off for the wrong opening, one star off for the frat boy comedy, and one star off for the editing. And this movie is getting the most solid 7 stars - leaning towards 8."

","With all of the discussion of the political incorrectness of this movie, one of the best things about it is being overlooked, the timing.<br/><br/>Like Spinal Tap, producers have mastered delivering the joke and cutting immediately to the next establishing shot which makes the laugh even bigger.<br/><br/>Also the biggest laugh of the film came not from some anti-semitic, racist, sexist or similar offensive comment but from when a saddened Borat drops his bag and you hear a muffled chicken cluck. The audience had forgotten about the chicken in Borat's bag at that point. Great timing.<br/><br/>Yes I know I'm over analyzing this dumb movie but it's that good. Comedies are going to be measured up against this one for a long time."

","Fav line: Bilo the rapist......naughty naughty! This film is worth a see and has some very funny moments. The ending of the film is a bit of a anti climax as it seems to just run out of steam. I feel that he goes a bit too far when offending people who have invited him into their home in good faith. Where he goes to the southern dinner party he makes the assumption that they're racist without any evidence of it. Sure he gets chucked out when he brings along his 'lady friend' but this is probably due to the fact that it's late and she's unannounced! I also felt that the naked fight went a bit too far perhaps done for simple shock value. I'd go and see this film but it's not the funniest thing I've ever seen."

","I'll get this out of the way first. I loved this movie, it was hilarious and I laughed harder than I had for a long time at the theatre. The only thing that bothered me is valuable screen time was wasted with the scripted material. I didn't want this movie to end, and knowing how long the movie was, every time more scripted content came on I was wishing 'hurry up and get back to the good stuff' I cant wait until the DVD is released and we get to see all the cut material. If you've never seen the show, you'll love the movie (as long as you like this type of humour...and 'get' the joke that he's making fun of you and not Jews or Kazakh or anyone else) If you've watched the show, you'll still love the movie, but be slightly let down (a whole sequence in the movie is almost identical to one of his topics from da ali g show....still funny, but wish there could have been something new instead.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5, will buy the DVD for sure...but hopefully the coming onslaught of Borat quoting and imitations from all corners of society...friends, coworkers, every teenager in the country...wont sour me on the great Borat."
"jaredmobarak","8","1","6","5 November 2006"," JagshemashÂ…Borat
","About every year a movie comes out that is hyped to the extreme. Buzz around the world causes electricity that you know will fizzle out or not come to fruition in the first place. Snakes on a Plane caused a stir earlier this summer with internet chatter, but never really became a phenomenon nor seemed to strike with the ""so bad its good"" moniker. Well this week saw the opening of the movie that really started being talked about around festival season with its' raucous debut at Cannes and star Sacha Baron Cohen's strutting around France in his man-kini. Yes that movie is the long-winded-title ""documentary"" Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan. And unbelievably it not only lived up to expectations, but also surpassed them to be the funniest movie I've seen in years.<br/><br/>Cohen is a genius as far as I am concerned and must have schizophrenia or multiple personality disorder because he so encapsulates this character of Borat that he is Borat. There is not one instance of coming close to cracking up or breaking character throughout the entire film. The accent and deadpan answers come quick and timely; this is really a foreigner in a strange land. While coming in, I was thinking the film would be reliant on his interviewing of unsuspecting personalities and him getting them to show their bigotry through the false security of thinking he himself was a bigot. Amazingly there are few of these moments as we really are shown a sense of history for our narrator: scripted and hilarious moments of his background in Kazakhstan and his attempts at adjusting to American culture. Yes the moments when he is let loose upon the country are funny, but there is also a story being told and used as a structure for the interviews to work effectively in.<br/><br/>Every detail has been carefully preserved to keep an amazing amount of realism to this work of pure fiction. The low-quality Kazakhstani visuals used for the opening and closing credits could be authentic, I'm not completely sure but from the uniformity of the title's font I would guess that they have been created by the filmmakers. At every instance of a caption or credit we are given words in Russian over-captioned by English to keep the feel of a foreign film being shown in the United States. Yes there is the fact that if it was being made for the Kazakhstani people, they wouldn't have filmed all the cut scenes in English, but I'm willing to overlook it. However, it would have been fantastic if every English speaking part had Russian subtitles to make it as authentic as possible; none of the words need be correct, as I'm guessing the Russian uttered by the film's characters wasn't, but the look would have been great. Besides the aesthetics, all continuity seemed to be carried through perfectly as well. Instances like the gobble when he slams his bag to the ground and the subtle showing of what really happened to the pet bear add to the reality being fabricated and help keep the audience involved with the film.<br/><br/>Of course the movie would not have been possible without the eclectic cast of bigots, kooks, and occasional human being shown on screen with impossibly received consent. Every one of them are frank and honest and so offensively funny that there are moments when you can't believe you haven't heard news of lawsuits being filed even if their lawyers told them they had no case. We are treated to an exotic array ranging from the evangelical (comic genius), the feminist, the secessionist, and the college frat variety. Sure some it might have been staged, but even so, each encounter is priceless. The naked romp/wrestling match with his producer, played by character actor Ken Davitian, is perhaps the most disgusting yet hysterical moment I've seen in a theater, and their intruding on a business meeting it is absolutely priceless. I would like to believe each time they are accosted by security guards it is real, but I really don't know. Hopefully even if the people they abuse are planted, the security is kept out of the loop for authenticity sake. Especially the encounter with Pamela Anderson, the holy grail of the story who is friends with Cohen and most certainly knew what would happen, I will continue to think the security thought she was in real danger."

","funniest movie I've seen all year, maybe funniest movie in the past 2 or 3 years! My body was hurting after laughing so much at some of the skits and some of the things Borat would do. This isn't a movie for everyone, if you are easily offended, don't even try it. If you are a fan of the Borat character in any way, you will be loving it all the way through, most of the things he does in the Ali G show, he does here but shows no remorse for anyone he comes to meet. You should not watch it if you are a Gypsie or a Jew because he just tears them a new one in this movie.

","Borat: Cultural Learnings Of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan is not for everyone. That said, if you can take it, it's a hilarious, offensive romp through everything wrong with today's America.<br/><br/>Borat Sagdiev is Kazakhstan's 4th most famous news reporter, and is called upon by his government to create a documentary about America's culture, so his people can grow. Borat then ends up traveling cross-country for a new reason, feigning that he and his manager should see more of America than just New York. Complications quickly ensue.<br/><br/>Borat, played brilliantly by Sacha Baron Cohen, is an offensive, yet lovable facsimile of Kazakhstan's finest. Meeting such people as a humor coach, women's rights activists, and even a nice Jewish couple (whom he is terrified of), Borat's shenanigans are not to be missed."

","I saw a preview show of the movie, and I spent most of the time rolling around in my seat with laughter. In fact I laughed so much, I missed some of the movie and will have to go and see it again. From the very beginning to the closing credits there was hardly a slow, non funny moment. As borat leaves his beloved Kazakhstan, along with its crude and open culture, he encounters the true American in many of its forms. He whips up the audience at a rodeo into a frenzy, and in the process discovers the inner mind of American rednecks. Some of the humor may be offensive, but it's worth it. This movie will end up being the highest grossing movie ever, I'm sure."
"freddoboi","10","1","7","7 September 2007"," Borat is a purely British comedy
","Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan is probably the funniest film i have ever seen! it is a very British film as it takes the Micky out of the American way of life which most Brits find hilarious. Being a Brit myself, i do find it hilarious but i don't know why some of the Americans find it SO offencive, cant they take a joke? there are many films that take the Micky out of the British way of life and we don't care too much. Anyway, back on the film, Sacha Baron Cohen is the perfect man for the Job as he himself is Jewish, and in the film, the Kazakhs are scared of Jewish people which adds Irony to it which sends us off laughing from the off! He has also been in other side-splitting British films such as Ali G Indahouse which was also a big hit with the Brits, mainly the younger generations found it the funniest as it was about a teenage 'chav' that found himself as the Prime Minister's 'left hand man'. If your have seen these two movies then you should agree with me that Sacha Baron Cohen really IS the perfect British Comedian."

","Its not Kazakhstan his making fun of. In the end of the movie its the U.S.A. In fact the movie sold best in Kazakhstan. Now when I read some reviews from Americans who did not like, understand I can see where Cohens coming from. People really need to calm down. The U.S.A exploits hundreds movies a year with dumb Eouropeans, just look at Euro trip, Beerfest, Boat trip etc and in to many films to mention there is a joke about them. What about the Russians that was a good wasn't it. <br/><br/>I thought it was really funny and playing on funny and relevant ideas of Americans (and the rest of the world, but mainly U.S.A) idea on ""third wold countries"""
"c-kelsall","9","1","7","8 May 2007"," Culturing learnings make benefit my funny bone
","Sacha Baron Cohen's humour tends to divide opinion, which is probably true of any humour. Suffice to say, some people find his work puerile and shallow, but I am not one of those people. If you enjoyed Ali G Indahouse, this film will make you cry with laughter (I know I did). You may just need the proverbial band-aid for your splitting sides. The basic plot is the documented trans-American culture trip of Khazakh journalist Borat, who seeks, along with his producer, to ""make benefit glorious nation of Khazakhstan"". Of course, in true Cohen style, it is a great opportunity for him to use his alter-ego to embarrass, annoy and perplex the various facets of the American public. He sends them up, and his Borat persona, to hilarious effect. The only plot-related device I will allude to is Borat's infatuation with Pamela Anderson, which develops after he sees a snippet of Baywatch in his hotel room. This results in him expanding his itinerary to a trip along Route 66 from New York to Los Angeles. To summarise, if you're a Cohen fan, you'll love it, but even if you aren't you should give it a try....unless you have no sense of humour, in which case you might find yourself in there."
"rodericko","9","1","7","14 April 2007"," Outrageous, but 'cringingly' hilarious
","If you like the outrageous and the absurd you will probably like this movie, a quirky mixture of satire and slapstick (Norman Gunston on steroids). Despite the in your face style and lack of any substantial storyline, it is comes together quite well and is largely carried to great heights by the ability of S.B.C. to immerse himself in his bizarre Borat creation, purportedly a Khazakhi journalist on a cultural fact finding mission in the US, but in reality a degenerate clown whose real nationality is irrelevant other than being out of reach for most Americans. His acting is so well disciplined that SBC does not let any amount of social discomfort perturb his portrayal. The resulting outcomes from a series of inappropriate interactions with unsuspecting Americans are illuminating, and hilarious in a cringing way.<br/><br/>The foundation of the movie is that very few people (at least none that made the final cut) recognize Borat as a fake, and his behavior either elicits the caveman in them or in the case of the more genteel, being at a loss with how to cope. These failures are an attempt by the creators to indict the US for being ignorant, bigoted and pompous, and to some extent this succeeds. Nevertheless, Borat is so outrageous that you're left with little doubt that most peoples would stumble under the onslaught of his antisocial proclivities. Understandably some of the 'victims' become very upset and this adds to the tension that SBC plays on so well. This satirical slant with a liberal lashing of ridiculous situations and comments, the competing Kazaki neighbour, the cow in the house, the sister, the chicken, the bear, 'the shape shifting jews', the wrestle, the attempted kidnapping; all make it a silly but great overall package.<br/><br/>Well done, good laugh. My favorite bit...the national anthem..'Kazakhstan number one exporter of potassium Other countries have inferior potassium'...magnificent."

There were huge, loud bursts of laughs through out the theater. I was not offended at all and I am African American. I didn't find the comments offensive because after all-this movie is a comedy!

"valadas","6","1","7","10 January 2007"," Kazakh who?
","We must begin by saying that this movie's director was surely never in Kazakhstan nor has he ever seen a Kazakh in his life. The character impersonated by Sacha Baron Cohen shows only the stereotype that Americans imagine when they think about Mediterranean popular characters, from his physical appearance to his way of talking and behaviour. This movie is only a succession of gags of which a few are funny indeed but whose majority is not funny at all and sometimes even disgusting. The story of the Kazakh journalist who went to USA to learn about American way of life is poor indeed. The best parts of the movie are those episodes where some idiosyncrasies of American society are shown like for instance a religious meeting near the end of the movie and the behaviour of white and black young people. But even those are almost only commonplaces we have seen much better treated in lots of other movies. This movie is a real disillusion."
"brodie_kashmir","9","1","7","31 December 2006"," Brilliantly funny, wickedly smart
","""Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"" not only has one of the longest titles recent cinematic history, but it's also one of the funniest and most offensive films I've seen. And I love it.<br/><br/>Borat Sagdiyev (Sacha Baron Cohen) is Kazakhstan's top television reporter, and he's sent to America with a film crew to learn about American culture, and bring his findings back to his beloved homeland, with the hopes of bringing Kazakhstan into modern cultural relevancy. He is naïve in the way of American manners, decency and political correctness, saying or doing whatever comes to mind, and has clearly never heard the phrase ""when in Rome."" The people he interacts with are either offended by what he does or oddly accepting. It's like when adults interact with a three year old who does something wrong. They turn their heads and say ""oh, isn't that precious."" But Borat isn't content with that; he has to take it to the point of offensiveness.<br/><br/>The hilarity is that the joke is on us. He isn't making fun of Kazakhstan, as they're government believes (they event went so far as to taking out a four page ad in the New York Times denouncing the film). He is making fun of American ignorance. He goads people into saying things on camera that makes them look stupid or bigoted. In the South, at a rodeo, he gets one of the riders to admit that America should to make homosexuality punishable by death. In New Mexico, he hitches a ride with some fraternity boys from California, and gets them to say that everyone should have slaves, and women are beneath men.<br/><br/>He doesn't trick them by asking them leading questions. These are candid conversations with the subjects. It could be construed as a trick, since it is Cohen in character, but I would hardly feel any sympathy for the subjects, as they were being honest in their bigotry. That and laughing at the clueless is just good old fashioned fun.<br/><br/>Cohen has proved himself to be one of the finest comedic actors of our time in just about everything he does. His devotion to his craft is unrivaled. He never broke character when he was doing his television show, ""Da Ali G Show."" In the movie he never breaks character. In the weeks and months leading up to the premiere of the film, he would only appear in character, in order to keep the illusion and the joke going. He really makes his subjects, and at times the audience, believe that he is, in fact, a Kazakh journalist.<br/><br/>I'd have to say the best moment of staying in character was the fight in the hotel Borat had with the producer Azamat Bagatov (Ken Davitian). They take it from the room, down the hall, into the elevator, through the lobby and crash a Mortgage Bankers conference in a ballroom, never breaking character. It is pure dedication, and I have never laughed so hard in my life.<br/><br/>The mockumentary gets bogged down by an actual (and very thin) plot. Originally the documentary Borat was shooting was to stay only in New York City. But he falls in love with Pamela Anderson after seeing an episode of ""Baywatch"" and decides he has to travel to California to marry her. It's an obvious ""deus ex machina"" that sets the action in motion, but is totally unnecessary. The Pamela Anderson meeting wasn't really that funny when compared to the rest of the film, and the cross country travel could have been easily explained another way.<br/><br/>But silly plot lines aside, it's one of the smartest and most intriguing comedies in a long time. I really can't remember a movie where I laughed this hard, at least not since 2003's ""Bad Santa."""

"Rogue-32","8","1","7","29 November 2006"," This movie is so offensive, I could barely stand it. NOT.
","Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan is, quite simply, one of the most hilarious films ever released on American soil. Armed with nothing but brilliant inspiration, Sacha Baron Cohen (SBC) goes fearlessly into the mockumentary realm, emerging triumphant where many, MANY others have failed. Why? For one thing, he knows his territory: his character is perfected, going in - he understands who this guy is from the inside out, he's thoroughly comfortable in his skin, which allows the audience to instinctively relax, sensing that collectively, it is in good hands.<br/><br/>Ironically, although this film has been called offensive by a lot of people, I thought it was not offensive at all. Why? It's too over the top to be offensive, and it's done with such obvious tongue-in-cheekery and glee, that it automatically diffuses the sexism and bigotry, replacing it with a subtle and wise knowingness which only a few can pull off. I was reminded, in fact - and this is a supreme compliment - of Woody Allen's earliest films: Take The Money And Run, Bananas, and the like. Not because of the material but because of the tone, which rendered me giddy, as very few films are capable of doing. High five, SBC, high five."
"roland-104","8","1","7","29 November 2006"," Hilarious movie, in which a Leningrad Cowboy meets Lars von Trier while traveling through America
","The British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen earns his living performing as one of several zany characters of his own invention that pander to ethnic and national stereotypes. His repertoire includes Ali G, a British junglist musician (an electronic musical style featuring a mix of reggae and hip hop breakbeats); Bruno, a flaming gay Austrian fashion reporter; and Borat Sagdiyev, a Kazakhi television reporter, who is the featured character in this crazy movie.<br/><br/>It's a road movie in which this oddball guy from another country makes the rounds of America to film a documentary intended to enrich the culture back home, his encounters here highlighting the quirks and contradictions of American culture, to comic effect. Of course this is far from being a new film conceit. Its ignoble predecessors, in varying shades of humor, include Werner Herzog's 1977 film, ""Stroszek""; Aki Kaurismaki's ""Leningrad Cowboys Go America"" (1989); ""Road Scholar"" (1993), starring Andrei Codrescu; and the recent ""Schultze Gets the Blues"" (2003). Mix equal parts of these four films thoroughly and you'd come up with something akin to ""Borat,"" though the latter film is a lot edgier: it's got more attitude than the other four combined. Thinking more about the recipe, to get ""Borat"" right would probably require that you add in a liberal sprinkling of Lars von Trier's slant on America, as seen in films like ""Dancer in the Dark,"" ""Dogville,"" ""Dear Wendy"" and ""Manderlay."" So much for film comparisons. <br/><br/>It's more important for me to report that for fully 85% of the time, this movie just plain rocks with hilarity. I laughed out loud often, not my usual style. In terms of comedic momentum, it does bog down for a while in the second half, though it finishes well. I must also warn you though that the level of humor is unremittingly earthy, full of boyish sexual preoccupations, and also chuck full of racist and misogynistic overtones. It will surely offend many viewers. Borat himself has the sexual temperament of a horny 16 year-old, with judgment and taste to match. In fact he's more like 40, a strapping 6'3"" tall, thin and angular. He walks with a shambling, gangly, and at times almost mincing gait. He tries to strike up conversations with men on the street by reaching out to kiss them. He's a guy you notice right off. And probably want to avoid.<br/><br/>The film begins and ends in a small, deeply impoverished, rural Romanian village, Glod (means ""mud"" in English), standing in for the Kazakhi village that is Borat's hometown. Apparently Cohen, Director Larry Charles and company did not tell the locals how they were planning to use the scenes they shot there, and much later, upon viewing the completed film, a number of the good citizens of Glod were highly displeased, feeling that the film misrepresented, humiliated and slandered them. (See details in the article, ""Borat film 'tricked' poor village actors,"" by Bojan Pancevski and Carmiola Ionescu, Daily Mail, November 11, 2006.) Indeed, the folks of Glod are made in the film to appear seriously anti-Semitic, anti-Romany, incestuous, and generally debased. Apparently some Glodians are planning a lawsuit against the film production company.<br/><br/>The questionable ethics of the filmmakers have even caused a stir here: it was the subject of an op-ed piece in our leading news daily a couple weeks ago. So what are we to do about a very funny movie made in part at the expense of some unsuspecting participants? Well, the associate editor of our newspaper suggested a boycott of the film. Hmmmm. I suppose that, while the farcical nature of the humor - the exaggeration, comic distortion, hyperbole, whatever - in Borat is absolutely clear and obvious to a viewer like me, it might seem like something quite different, more serious and insulting, to a resident of Glod.<br/><br/>Another notion: because of the fragmented, non-sequential fashion in which movies routinely are shot and edited, often even seasoned film actors have little idea what the final product will look like. Directors often prefer not to tell players ahead of time how the details of the story will unfold, how certain scenes, including the actors' own conduct, will be interpreted in the context of final editing. So if the Glodians didn't know how footage would be used, so what? This may seem a cavalier take on the matter. But I cannot, personally, justify putting down or boycotting this wildly funny movie because of the Glodian episode. Maybe Cohen's company should simply acknowledge the hard feelings of the locals and mollify the Glodians with cash. It's all right with me.<br/><br/>With Ken Davitian, enjoyably cast as Azamat Bagatov, Borat's porcine documentary film director, and the likes of former Rep.Bob Barr (R-Georgia), perennial Presidential wannabe Allen Keyes, and Baywatcher star Pamela Anderson as themselves.

","This movie is a really great piece of work. Before my critique, I would like to mention that I recently read an article about how some of the ""locals"" that appear in the movie were upset that they were portrayed in such a negative light. I can see how they were offended, and how they could feel as if they'd been mocked. While this movie is in bad taste, it was done purely for comedic value and not as a direct attack on the people in the village. Some people can't take a joke.<br/><br/>In any case, back to the actual movie...there was a great mix of ""toilet humor"" and ""semi-witty humor"" as I saw it. The low-brow humor was great, and is never a bad thing to have in a movie. And while most of the movie's humor is low-brow, there is also so much more. Listening more closely to the dialogue in some parts, you can pick up on innuendos and implied satire that is a bit more intellectual. I wouldn't go so far as to say that it was Highly intellectual, but I felt that there was more than just mindless silliness. The combination was successful. Its definitely one of the funniest things I've seen in a while."

That fact notwithstanding,B:CLAMBGNK is definitely a superbly acted, well directed and creative piece of comedy.There were certain scenes from the movie that rocked me out of my chair, almost praying for the comedy to stop lest my stomach turned inside itself.B:CLAMBGNK also presents a very introspective look at the narrow blinder view many Americans have when it comes to 3rd world nations and their people.Borat expounds this naiveté tendency brilliantly albeit controversially. The scene with the frat boys in the RV was pretty telling that racist undertones are very much present even in the 21st century in modern America, yet subtle. Overall this is a new kind of comic genre, sadly one that can be done only once, and then the gig is up and it becomes rote if repeated.On the other hand if it does get repeated, then it just further establishes how stupid and naive people can be.

","'Borat' is a film about a man who travels to America and who ends up in all sorts of odd situations, fueled to travel to California to find and marry Pamela Anderson. Along the way, he ridicules America (without meaning to) and the American people, irregardless of ethnicity or religion. Some of the situations he finds himself in include singing the anthem (badly) at a rodeo, attending a meeting with feminists, learning (or trying to learn) etiquette at a dinner party, and trying to be cool with a group of black youths and wanting to be like them.<br/><br/>The film is low-budget, and if you dislike 'offensive' humor or do not have the same sense of humor, then you will not enjoy this film. A lot of the humor is what I would consider very American, but there's also a lot of humor that some sensitive people may find offensive. (However, the film does not just pick on one group of people, but it makes fun of everyone, and it should be taken light-heartedly.) I found the film very funny. It's not a great film, but it serves its purpose in making me laugh. I wouldn't want to sit through another viewing, however, as I would know what happens and I don't think this humor would hold through a second viewing. (Some of the humor is 'shock value'.) Good for a comedy, but I wouldn't call it a classic."

My favorite scene (spoiler) is when the kids run up to the ice cream truck and get scared off by the bear (end of spoilers).<br/><br/>I found Borat's cultural differences and jokes as somehow offensive, but still downright funny. For a movie that had the #1 spot at the box office, it deserves such a profit.<br/><br/>So I recommend this movie, if you aren't easily offended, because odds are you will be offended by at least one scene.

","I went into Borat with absolutely no expectations. Having seen one of Sacha Baron Cohen's other creations, Ali G in his feature film, I did hope that this would be better. And it was. Much better. But not the best film I've ever seen. It did crack me up in many places, every time Borat interacted with random American public, but some places were incredibly cringe-worthy. The bit that crops up every time in reviews I've seen about the film is the nudity, and I must say that it is pretty gross - the 5 or so minutes of naked wrestling made me want to shut my eyes more than when Christ was pinned to the cross in Mel Gibson's epic. I think that Baron Cohen's prominence in American cinema is going to continue - his character Borat was very cleverly created and for that he did good, I hope that he continues to create clever but funny films in the future - which Ali G In Da House was not."

It was disturbing but at the same time I nearly fell out of my seat laughing.<br/><br/>There are comments on whether or not the movie and the encounters were scripted or not - it matters not.

The running time of 84mins is spot on, as soon as it runs out of steam it finishes. But before it does, it generates enough steam to power the Flying Scotsman ! Of course the toilet jokes are funny, they always have been and always will be. But the obvious humour is balanced by sharp observation - coloured mini i pods are for girls, and subtle laughs like when he throws down his suitcase in despair, - then we remember what is inside! The joke is not on Khazakstan - its on the United States which is mercilessly lampooned. It is difficult to decide which shots are ""reality"" takes and which are set up. The humour rests not only with Cohen, but with the Americans who don't realise that their genuine reactions are the butt of his wit.<br/><br/>Surprisingly sophisticated and subtle, whilst simultaneously being base and crude.This film made me laugh out loud more often than I can recently remember.

","As a longtime fan of the comedic alter-egos of Sacha Cohen, I knew that I would love this film, and I was right. Throughout the movie I laughed so hard that tears were literally streaming down my cheeks. The scenes in New York were absolutely priceless, as was the ""etiquette"" dinner sequence, the newsroom interview, the Atlanta hotel scene, and the interrupted business meeting.<br/><br/>But the film is more than just situational comedy. It is also an expose of American attitudes toward foreigners, women, people of alternative sexualities, and people adhering to faiths other than Christianity. As one might guess, the results are not pretty. Particularly in the Bible Belt, Borat reveals the incredible bigotry and ignorance of many Americans. While these segments were sometimes painful in what they were revealing, in the end the joke is on the people being filmed as we watch Cohen make fools of them.<br/><br/>The only reason I didn't give this film a 10/10 rating was because, in my opinion, the Pamela Anderson subplot was fairly weak and detracted from the overall power of the film. Other than that, this is by far one of the best films I have seen in a long time. Cohen does not disappoint."
"Elori","4","1","8","6 November 2006"," Lowbrow humor: not that funny of watching being worth
","I went in to see Borat completely oblivious of any reading on what the movie was supposed to be about. My brief glance of a few review excerpts led me to believe it was going to be a political satire, but in the end, it was a very tired and unimaginative brand of lowbrow humor.<br/><br/>The trouble is that Borat really never does anything outrageous. I guess this is because it's supposed to be documentary, but other ""real"" movies, like South Park (and of course, the series) and Austin Powers: Goldmember have done it so much better and gone so much farther.<br/><br/>Borat is mostly just a string of boring scenes, and Borat himself isn't very funny. Most of the best humor has to do with Ken Davitian's Azamat Bagatov, especially one infamous scene that truly pushes the boundary of comedy. Unfortunately, it is one of the few scenes in the movie to be outrageous enough to be funny. Most of it is just blah, amusing at best. To Borat: Try harder."

He's not going anywhere, and doesn't seem to be gasping for breath either. Maybe it's nothing new, and Tom Green may be owed some dues, but he's still freakishly good at getting the laughing stock award of the year. Jackass? Johnny Knoxville? Make room for Borat, because if you don't, he may make sexy time with you without you even being aware.<br/><br/>As an actual, living, breathing, walking around type of person, Sacha Baron Cohen is probably sure to surprise you as evidenced in his out of character interviews. He graduated from Cambridge University with a degree in history before entering the world of comedic performance. His show ""Da Ali G Show"" on HBO was a cult hit in post 9/11 America, where he imitates a hip hop style interviewer in an effort to intimidate experts in many social and political fields. His Hebrew is pretty good too, despite what the film Borat would lead you to believe about his opinions.<br/><br/>The film Borat is the story of a young ambassador from an Eastern European country in the United States. It follows his path along from New York City to Hollywood, and all the pitfalls along the way. It is an extremely edgy mockumentary that hearkens comparisons to many films of coming to age in America, but without the sappy side stories, excluding Borat's obsession with Pamela Anderson which fuels his journey across the country, by way of a Baywatch magazine and eventually as an unwitting saboteur in the form of a DVD. It is a story that makes little sense, but brings attention to many stereotypes we take so easily for granted when living here in the U.S.A.<br/><br/>""What's up with it, Vanilla face? Me and my homie Azamat just parked our slab outside. We're looking for somewhere to post up our Black asses for the night. So, uh, bang bang, skeet skeet, nigga. Just a couple of pimps, no hos.""<br/><br/>Borat and his manager of sorts, a chicken, and a bear are all that we get for main characters. But the amount of laughs more than make up for any shortcomings that one might foresee. Much of the humor is very dry yet jolting. You will probably actually find yourself wondering how a man could be so under cultured, and totally lose track of the fact that this is indeed a comedic character portrayal, and not a real human being sent from Kazakhstan to learn the ways of American life.<br/><br/>The best scenes are back-to-back, and the wheels keep rolling, even while our eyes are. His inept fear of Jews and Gypsies alike, are fairly unsettling, but his reactions are so outrageous that we can almost overlook the prejudice inherent in much of his ""foriegn"" viewpoints. My personal favorite scene is towards the end at a Church where Borat finds himself stumbling in to be redeemed and saved by an overzealous evangelist. But everyone will more than likely have their own moments of complete comedic satisfaction while being entertained by this film.<br/><br/>The acting by Cohen is phenomenal, as stated before we can easily subdue our objective view and find ourselves as lost as he is in not only the plot but dialog of the film. The dialog is undoubtedly the stronger point of the picture, even amidst the tom-foolery of an overgrown man with a child's heart.<br/><br/>Borat actually caught a big bit of flak from the actual government of Kazakhstan when he toured the States for interviews in character as Borat. On the white house lawn, Cohen threw an impromptu press conference touting the downfalls of the Kazakhstan government, which they retaliated to with a spread in The New York Times that intended to shoot down statements made by Sacha. However, despite these factors Borat managed to break records at the box-office.<br/><br/>Consider yourself lucky to be part of a time when mockumentary film making is at such a high standard of success. Borat is definitely one of the more refined and professional attempts in the genre, and an unmissable contribution to comedy.<br/><br/>""May George Bush drink the blood of every man, woman, and child in Iraq!""<br/><br/>Actors: Sacha Baron Cohen, Ken Davitian, Luenell<br/><br/>Producer: Monica Levinson, Dan Mazer, Sacha Baron Cohen, Jay Roach Cinematographer: Luke Geissbuhler, Anthony Hardwick Music: Erran Baron Cohen Editor: Craig Alpert, Peter Teschner, James Thomas<br/><br/>Borat (2006) 10/10"

Comedic acts are the one thing; they can be spontaneous and brilliant. However, it's very hard to put that comedy and energy on film. Cohen has done this here; it's a masterpiece on several levels.

","Borat Sagdiyev (Sacha Baron Cohen) is the top journalist from Kazakhstan's very own television network. His latest assignment requires him to travel to the United States. While there he must learn about American culture and what makes it so ""great"". Along the way he encounters people from almost every walk of life, all the while shocking and amazing those very same people simultaneously.<br/><br/>First off, I must warn you that 'Borat:' is not for everyone. If you can't take a joke or completely have no sense of humor, stop reading this review right now. Please then proceed to kill yourself. Okay, don't actually commit suicide, but at least hurt yourself in some way.<br/><br/>Now, having said that, it must be known that 'Borat:' is hands down, without a doubt, no matter what, the funniest film of the year. Prior to seeing it I knew it would be hilarious. I figured though that once settled in and it ran for a little while the jokes would become annoying. Then of course there'd be a few cases here and there that were laugh-out-loud funny, but nothing major. How wrong I was. Wrong indeed. From beginning to end its outrageously hysterical. Each time you think it couldn't get any better, it proves you wrong over and over. Cohen deserves much praise for being able to keep a straight face through each scene.<br/><br/>Despite being positively entertaining beyond belief though, there will still be those who insist on disagreeing. It's true, a lot of people probably will be offended by some of the things shown in 'Borat:', but don't let them deter you from seeing it. They're simply too busy trying to get the three foot stick they have up lodged up their ass out, that they can't possibly see its humor. My friend Clay put it best yesterday when he said, ""I think its too smart for Americans"". For the most part, that's correct. The irony presented won't be noticed by hardly any American because they'll be too busy laughing themselves to death over how they think Borat ""doesn't get it"". I'm not trying to say everyone in America that sees it is a dumb-ass either, but that's just the truth.<br/><br/>Well I guess its about time I wrapped this review up. Indeed it was short, but really, there's only three things you need to know about 'Borat:'. One, it's side-splitting, two, it's brilliant, and finally three, Jews can't really turn transform themselves into cockroaches. Or can they?"
"malevolentmuse","10","1","12","16 January 2007"," Absolutely Brilliant
","The brilliance of Borat is lost on so many because so many people are ready and waiting to be offended by something rather than take the time to look a little deeper. Yes, Borat is offensive, disgusting and outrageous, but what it also is is one of the greatest satires to ever be put on film. By creating a totally likable and outrageous character, Cohen allowed people to let their guard down and reveal their own hidden (or not so) prejudices and in doing so disarms it by proving once and for all how how stupid that kind of narrow-minded thinking really is. People ripping the film on behalf of its ""victims"" are completely oblivious to the fact these are the very type of racist, anti-Semitic, homophobic people the movie is trying to expose, and acts as a reminder these qualities are, even in the 21st century, alive and well, and all around us. Just because we haven't wanted to notice them doesn't mean they're not there and Borat, gross jokes and all, makes us face what we don't want to face: our own prejudices."
"jake-414","10","1","12","4 January 2007"," Real Comedy at its finest
","I feel the people that hate this movie with a fiery passion cannot just handle humor as raw as this is. I'm not saying they don't have a sense of humor. I'm saying they have a mild, weak sense of humor. They can't handle real comedy. But they enjoy harmless movies such as Date movie and Little man because there to afraid to see real. And they don't want to show people from America that are like them, close-minded and ignorant about whats going on in front of them with one of the funniest men of this generation, Sacha Baren Cohen. Some scenes were so raw and shocking i could not believe at what I was seeing on the movie screen. He crosses boundaries were probably no other comedian will ever go again. This guy will do anything to try and get a laugh out of someone. Maybe take a dump by the Trump building in NY or make cheese from his wife's breast milk for a very important man. Surprisingly, the story for the movie fits Borat's character perfectly, tying in all his small crazy antics he does on the side. But still on search for his man prize, ""the lady in the red under-panties."" Stopping at nothing to get her to marry him. And boy did I ever laugh my ""back p***y"" off during this one. :)"
"fhormozd","10","1","12","4 January 2007"," Extremely funny
","This movie was one of the funniest movies I have seen for a long time. Some parts of the movie was so funny that you would get scared from the way the person sitting near you is laughing. Although, the main characteristic of this movie is being hilarious, however, in my opinion the way that some stereotypes of US society was portrayed was amazing. In addition, showing how silly those people that group all the people in a minority in a same way are was brilliant.Also the comments made about women,which any person with right mind understands is just a joke, is trying to show how stupid those people who don't believe in gender equality look. I would like to add that the situation is not a total hypothetical one, as we know there does exists countries which women are treated as second citizens, and what better way to make fun of them than this. Although I don't think this movie is on the top 100 best movies, however, I believe it has made a great impact and we will see more movies coming out which are somehow inspired by Borat's movie. In nutshell it can be said if you enjoy comedies and don't get offend by jokes like the ones made in ""south park"" for sure go watch this movie(or rent the DVD).<br/><br/>I really was amazed with this movie and hope this good work continues."
"qormi","10","1","12","2 January 2007"," Nonstop Hysteria
","This movie crossed the line several times, but I couldn't stop laughing long enough to rationalize. From beginning to end, I laughed involuntarily and tears were streaming down my face. This Borat guy is absolutely nuts! The parts where he brings a plastic bag to the dinner party, walks through an antique shop, refers to his next door neighbor, wrestles,...I could go on and on . This comedy was completely original and wouldn't let up. The semi documentary format contained some unsuspecting accomplices as well as perfectly staged routines. I know there's gonna be a Borat II. This guy is the Peter Sellers of the 21st Century."
"gocougs12","10","1","12","2 January 2007"," Exposed
","I have never seen any Borat shows prior to attending the movie nor did I speak with anyone who saw the movie. I found the film to be brilliant. It completely exposed this country for what it is...sexist, homophobic, racist, crawling with religious zealots,anti-semitic, and dripping with hubris. Cohen put a mirror up to our faces. Some did not like what they saw, others did not even understand the deeper meaning of the movie. Fear and ignorance are rampant in our culture, and Cohen shown a bright light on what weakens and divides us. Citizens around the globe will now see us for our true colors. Our politicians preach democracy. Our religious conservatives spew Jesus' love as they hold up ""God Hates Fags"" signs. We are a country which is dangerously influenced by bigots and hypocrites. The facade has crumbled thanks to Cohen!"

"bottomline","10","1","12","7 December 2006"," funny until pants you wet
","The funniest satirical movie.... no the funniest comedy full stop I've seen for a long time.<br/><br/>The nude wrestling scene alone is worth the admission price.<br/><br/>There is one problem with the movie - the audience laughs so hard that you need to see it more than once to hear all the lines... or as Borat would say - ""Funny until pants you wet. Niiice!""<br/><br/>Some may find Borat offensive, but the reality is that all he is doing is pointing out the stupidity and utter redneckedness of a portion of the American populace.<br/><br/>The nice touch is that the minority groups - the Jewish couple, the black Americans and the prostitute are the ones who come out as the honest hearted, open minded decent folk."
"reinventingm","10","1","12","3 December 2006"," ""There isn't a person in this room here tonight who isn't wearing a uniform.""
","Two things have left me somewhat in a state of surprise regarding this comic masterpiece - and make no mistake. It is a comic masterpiece. The first being that people both on 'net and IMDb as well many people I've spoken with, purport not to have laughed whilst watching it. The second thing (and perhaps the morality tale of the film, if it has one) is the ""relentless indictment of America"" angle.<br/><br/>It's out and out funny and fearless and reminds me quite a bit of the TV comedy we grew up with, here as kids in Australia back in the 70s. Namely, ""The Norman Gunston Show"". Irreverence, in the hands of a genius, is such a rare thing that when it comes along, I have stomach cramps for days and tears streaming from my eyes recalling scenes. In this respect, people like Sacha Baron Cohen, Christopher Morris with his Brasseye series and radio shows and Garry MacDonald of the aforementioned Gunston show, are three such madmen. Go and see it. It'll keep you talking and laughing well after it falls into the oblivion of the bargain basement DVD racks. It'll endure as well as Monty Python or any of the other high water marks of comedy for a long time to come. Because (did I mention that?) it's funny. Straight up pee-funny.<br/><br/>I've got to say I seldom watch TV and only caught perhaps two episodes of Ali G. And didn't enjoy it. With the exception of the Borat sketches. They were so ruthlessly well executed, I thought they were a different show altogether. And as for the hype surrounding this flick, I was out and out put off in no small way. But go, I did (thank god for friends, eh?).<br/><br/>Back to the second point then - the dreaded, ""Look at those kooky, redneck, blissfully ignorant Americans"" take. This reminds me of the anecdote about a Frank Zappa performance in New York at the height of the Vietnam War, in which the worked up crowd started yelling out, ""Kill the Fascists, kill the pigs"" etc, etc, in reference to their own troops and the Nixon regime. Zappa stopped the show and uttered, ""Don't fool yourselves, people. There isn't a person in this room here tonight who isn't wearing a uniform!"" As I sat and watched this film through tears and an aching jaw from the relentless laughter, I saw a bit of myself - all of the crowd in the cinema, actually - in each of Borat's stooges and straight men. The Southern genteel upper crust, the Frat boys and their 'tit'n'ass' misogyny in their Winnebago milieu, even the paranoid guy Borat chases through the streets of New York. What strangely wonderful people. Well... To be honest , the Rodeo organizer (61 channels of American Gladiator, anybody?) and the used car salesman escaped my empathy completely. (Oh that poor lass on the horse after Borat finishes the Kazakhstani anthem in the rodeo to the loudest silence I think I'll ever hear). And the televangelist politico! Hahahaha! Proved to me that some people even manage to fall of my map of weird.<br/><br/>BUT! This is the beauty and strength of the flick, at large. It's a scalpel slice at this almost intensely (ill?)informed and overly introspective age in which we live. And I thank any or all of the powers above for madmen like Sacha Baron Cohen for making madmen films of this caliber."
"rugbydog","10","1","12","29 November 2006"," Super funny good time movie!!!
","If you like Da Ali G Show, you will love Borat! This movie is a must see for all fans of Da Ali G Show. I laughed so much during this movie. Sacha Baron Cohen is absolutely brilliant. He has such great insight and the movie is filled with hilariously executed social commentary. Don't worry though, there is plenty of ""stupid"" humor thrown in for good measure. I absolutely love the way he refers to normal everyday things in such a way that you have to really listen to figure out what he means. Then you realize what he is referring to and you have a funny time explosion of laughter.<br/><br/>I can not wait for Sacha Baron Cohen to make another movie. I highly recommend Borat! if you need a good laugh, or thirty. In fact, I am going to see it again right now!"
"urbanspaceman","10","1","12","26 November 2006"," Missing Scenes?
","My wife and I saw Borat last weekend and we give it a 10. This post is more of a question than a comment. We saw the film in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The film that we saw did not include the sing-a-long scene in the Arizona bar. Was this scene deleted from the movie before it was released? Did viewers in other areas see this scene? Also, in the trailer there is a scene that shows some sort of US Civil war re-enactment. One review that I read mentioned this scene but we did not see it. We do not have film censorship in Ontario except for certain illegal acts so I don't understand why we didn't get those two scenes here? Comments?"

Contextually there is almost nothing offensive about this film. Well, perhaps that's not true. But it is amazingly funny. Literally I was laughing every couple of seconds, it's that good. Not often does a film come out that keeps you laughing all the time.. but this has managed it. It's probably the biggest continuous laugh since Blazing Saddles.<br/><br/>Some of the stuff that's featured is literally, unreal. The hotel scene is perhaps the funniest thing I've ever seen. It's shocking but my word, it's funny.<br/><br/>I'm impressed at the number of US reviewers who have seen the funny side of this film and can take someone taking the mick.. rather than being offended.<br/><br/>Did you see what was in the fridge?"

Its amazing to to see the rodeo scene in which the older man is clearly a racist and yet Borat is the one who is seen as offensive. Something of a paradox.

","Borat is a brilliant and funny movie but it's also very depressing and sad.

Just review the rodeo sequences, the preachers sequence (those preachers always frighten me 'cuz they turn people intro obedient sheep), the sequence with the frat kids (i actually thought that that scene was fake but i found out that actually it wasn't, and that's very sad 'cuz those kids are really f-ed up).It's depressing 'cuz people like these Americans portrayed in the movie exist and that makes me ashamed to be on the same planet as them.

At one point, I got the giggles so badly I couldn't stop. You are either screaming with laughter, groaning, or covering your eyes in disbelief at just how far he goes.<br/><br/>Borat's hilarious antics aside, you begin to see him as a very clever mechanism for drawing out and highlighting bigotry and hypocrisy. No matter how offensive someone is, Borat will top it - with a charming, polite smile. And that's his trick - he is a lost traveler from a different (though invented) culture, speaks choppy English, and everyone wants to help him out, or not offend him. And then he comes out with a zinger, and nobody knows what to do. Some are in shock, some agree, and some are encouraged to take it even further.<br/><br/>This really is an amazing movie."

"ragazzi3","10","2","46","7 June 2007"," Raises controversy...
","First, I would like to start off by saying I found this movie to be extremely funny, and I believe that Sacha Baron Cohen is brilliant. I was also very happy (and surprised) to see him rewarded for this groundbreaking film by winning a Golden Globe for best actor in a comedy.<br/><br/>One of the main reasons this film is so good is the fact that it is unlike almost anything that has been made before it. I have read comments where people compare it to Tom Green or Jackass, and while some of the stunts he pulls do stoop to he level of these comparisons, there is a very distinct difference for the majority of the movie. In most cases, the things he says or does are meant to create some sort of reaction from the unknowing people he is with, and in a large number of cases, rather than being offended, these people agree with what he is saying! This is what makes this a political/social commentary, rather than just a guy running around doing stupid things to get a reaction.<br/><br/>Being Canadian, I can compare this to a t.v. show, called Talking to Americans, with Rick Mercer, in which Rick Mercer goes to various places in the United States, pretending to be a legitimate news reporter, and tells people ridiculous things about Canada, to see if they will be naive enough to believe him, and to recognize the ignorance that many, NOT ALL, Americans have of their closest neighbour and largest trading partner. ""Congratulations Canada, on legalizing staplers,"" or ""Congratulations for getting your second area code,"" are some of the statements that have been made on this show. Harvard professors and the Governor of Arkansas, among others, have made appearances unknowingly on this show. However, it uses much less offensive language and does not approach the topic of racism and sexism as Borat does.<br/><br/>Before anyone starts criticizing my comment as being stereotyping all Americans as ignorant, I want to make it clear that this is not what I am saying. And neither is Sacha Baron Cohen. Although he does show cases where he is supported in his prejudices by the Americans he is with, he also shows cases where people behave as any ""normal"" person should respond, with outrage and disgust. I love that so many people are offended by his treatment of the people who are trying to teach him etiquette at the dinner party, but almost nobody got the point that this is how people should be responding to him! Why are there so many comments that show disgust at his treatment of these people, but so few that show disgust at the gun salesman who supports his desire to kill Jewish people, or the college students who make disgusting comments about women? These are meant as a comparison, and as a way of showing that he is in NO WAY stereotyping all Americans in with these prejudices.<br/><br/>If nothing else, this movie created controversy, and made people talk, more than any other movie I have ever seen. This alone should make people realize that it is a great film, and even if you didn't like it, at least have the sense to recognize that it has affected you in some way. The fact that there are approximately 50 pages of comments from people who hated this film shows that it had enough of an effect on people to cause them to take the time to comment on it, whether they liked it or not.<br/><br/>And to the two or three people who have gone through and marked every comment that gives this movie a good recommendation as being not useful, I commend you on your patience and stick-to-it-tiveness. If you had put that much drive toward something useful instead, like helping those less fortunate than you in your community, the world would be a much better, if slightly less opinionated place."
"Claw_Thorn","10","1","15","19 May 2007"," A Character You can Love to Hate!
","Sacha Baron Cohen's well-developed character Borat Sagdiyev is definitely the type of character that would make you laugh, regardless of how evil you felt for doing so. A faithful and justified movie incarnation of the character most famously from Da Ali G Show, Borat's biased statements (reflecting the fictional portrayal of Kazakh culture), perverse behavior, and total bastardization of the English language make for a sense of humor that is palpable, yet still hard to digest.<br/><br/>The film will probably shock and disgust you in several areas, yet it will most likely have you looking back at the horrible scenes with amusement, even as I write this, I can't help but giggle at the oafish behavior of Cohen's character as he goes about the United States skewering culture and beliefs, all the while testing the limits of others.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm just a sucker for public nudity, maybe I'm just amused at Borat's ridiculousness, outrageous public displays, and overall awkward and gaudy appearance. Regardless of those things, I can;t help but want to see ore of this character, and I highly recommend the mockumentary to anybody with an open mind and an appreciation for improvisation."

While on the surface is a sexist, anti-semitic reporter from Kazakhstan, the responses people give to his fake questions show just how ignorant and backwards some of our fellow citizens are. A combination of Mockumentary/Reality Show/Expose, Borat travels from New York to Los Angeles in search of the American Dream, which according to him equals having sex with Pamela Anderson. The truths it exposes are only in part due with Borat as his behavior causes some of the most honest, and yet shocking reactions from the heart of America.

","One of the funniest and most engaging movies I have ever seen. I wouldn't have posted anything if I hadn't seen the recent slew of negative reviews this movie got and the ridiculous amount of hateful, disagreeable people agreeing with the reviews. ""Borat"" is a daring comedic achievement. It is just, simply, comedic brilliance, genius, but, most of all, guts. Sacha Baron Cohen put life and limb (forget reputation, that was the least of his worries) on the line to put this madness together and it works beautifully. True, Cohen may have mislead some unsuspecting people into his comic mayhem, but, historically, that is the gist of comedy: ""candid camera"" anyone? Borat is raw and funny and an honest look at not just America, but people in general, and the social dynamics that shape their behavior and their lives. The range and layers of Cohen's humor is extraordinary. He is capable of physical comedy, spontaneous wit, and humorous social commentary all in one fell swoop. Amazing. I recommend ""Borat"" whole-heartedly and object to the ""haters"" who are either too dense or too mentally disturbed to appreciate this film."

","Borat, has to be one of those films where I literally couldn't stop laughing and where I laughed so hard, tears constantly streamed down my face. If a movie can make me laugh that hard, then damn it must be a funny movie. Borat stars Sacha Baron Cohen in his first mainstream feature film, where he pretends to be a journalist from Kazakhstan. Borat is sent by the govt. of the glorious Nation of Kazakhstan, along with his assistant and friend Azamat (Ken Davidian) to do an investigative report on the American culture, but is later distracted from his mission when he discovers on TV the most beautiful woman he's ever laid eyes on..Pamela Anderson on Baywatch..this motivates Borat to instead, go on a cross country trip in order to meet, and according to him, marry Pamela Anderson, whom he believes is a virgin. The movie is like a reality show (think Jackass) except with a lot more creativity and comic genius from Baron Cohen. The way he preys on those unsuspecting Americans is just to die for. Some people might say the movie is anti-Semitic, misogynistic, racist, sexist, blah, blah, blah. But what the movie truly shows is just a mirror for American people to look at themselves at. The stuff in this movie is shocking, and not just the stuff coming from Baron Cohen and company, but also from some of his victims as well. I say if you're a person who gets easily offended, especially if you're Jewish or from the glorious Nation of Kazakhstan, don't go see this movie, but if you have an open mind and want to laugh your ass off with a movie like you haven't with any other movie in your life, then you're ready for ""Borat"".

I felt as though I'd die laughing. <br/><br/>No wonder it's been receiving rave reviews. <br/><br/>One of the hilarious aspects of the film is that there is so much truth in it. Stereotypes are humorously laid bare. One can't help wondering if there are actually some people like Borat in this world...<br/><br/>This movie is a must-watch."
"JimD73","9","1","18","18 November 2006"," Borat is the funniest movie ever (no exaggeration)
","Had I seen Da Ali G show even once before in my life, I may have had some inkling as to what to expect when seeing Borat. Having thus far avoided all that is HBO, I had no idea. It just had a funny name and lots of good press, so it seemed like it was worth a shot. It was on the cheap night, so I really couldn't be too disappointed. Now the word 'disappointed' being even remotely associated with Borat seem like pure lunacy. Borat elevates itself above even the slightest comparison with fellow gutbuster Jackass Two, proving itself to be simply the best comedy made in years.<br/><br/>If you never watched the show (like me), Borat makes sure to get you acquainted relatively quickly with a tour of Kazakhstani TV talking head Borat's world. Borat lives in a poor village, associates with the town rapist, is considered rich for having a clock radio and occasionally plays ping pong at the local rec center. He is dispatched to America by his producers in order to bring back information to benefit his country. Along the way, he catches an episode of Baywatch, and makes it his mission in life to steal the virginity of Pamela Anderson.<br/><br/>If that last sentence didn't clue you in, the movie is not meant for the plot. It boils down to a horny Kazakhstani guy wanting in Pamela Anderson's pants. That's the whole fun of the movie. We follow Borat from place to place as he chases Pamela Anderson and tries to get footage for his documentary at the same time, all the while exposing just how stupid the American public is. We have him exposing pretty much every person in the South as a gay-hanging bloodthirsty redneck in just one scene, for example. If this movie wanted to be completely political, it could do so and be quite riveting.<br/><br/>However, Borat hardly tries to be political. It tries to just be as funny as humanly possible, and it does that incredibly well. This is basically all due to Sacha Baron Cohen, who plays Borat as such an absolute idiot that you still love him despite him being a completely racist and ignorant prick. How he manages to completely disappear into the character, I may never know. Even more amazing is what the reactions he manages to get out of people (all supposedly unaware, although common sense tells us that there was some staging involved), which are all absolutely perfect.<br/><br/>What exactly Borat does is best left to you to find out, as giving it too much of a description might just ruin it. Suffice to say that Borat is the flat out funniest movie I have ever seen. I have never laughed so hard in my life, and then still been able to laugh at it simply by remembering the gags. Some of it is pure lunacy, but a lot of the movie is borderline genius. There's a lot of it in bad taste (such as Borat talking about vaginas or wrestling with a naked fat man with little superimposed black bars), but if you can stand it, those bits prove to be the funniest in the entire movie.<br/><br/>I know this review is shorter than normal. Simply put, I don't want to spoil anything. The movie is all the better if you know as little as possible. I have seen Snakes on a Plane, Accepted and Jackass Number Two in theatres this year and I laughed more at this than all of them combined. Hell, this is comparable with Airplane and Blazing Saddles, basically becoming an instant comedy classic. Don't waste any more time reading reviews, get out there and see Borat immediately. Just don't forget your friends, because that'll make it all the better."

Of course I had great expectations on this movie since you had heard so much about it, but this movie was also excellent. It didn't get better the further it got but although you laughed through the whole movie. The problem with a movie like this is of course that it's basically made for people aged 25 or below.

","This movie is howlingly funny. Although a (very) few parts seemed staged and the narrative is scripted to connect Borat's ""real"" encounters, the entire movie has a bizarre charm of being both very familiar while blindsiding you with the most outrageous moments ever committed to celluloid. I have heard minor criticisms ranging from the film's crassness to uncomfortable moments over Borat's prejudice against all things Jewish. Well poo on them. Yes the movie is crass, yes the anti-Jew gag is unnerving, but that is the whole point. The entire movie is a subversive comment on us Americans while exploiting our weakest flaws. Also, you have to give Cohen the award for the most committed comedian/actor ever. Those who have seen the movie know what I'm referring to and those who haven't will know in an instant when they do see it. Wow, let's see Mr. Robert Deniro do that! I'm rambling because it is impossible to describe how funny this movie is without ruining it for those who haven't seen it. Go see this movie!"

","You could say that the movie itself was a rather big success, even in Belgium. I found the movie very nice, as Borat would say, and I had more then one good laugh.<br/><br/>The movie portraits a Kazak Reporter that makes fun of the US and A, but he can do this rather subtle, so most people think that his Hebrew gibberish is Kazakh, but in reality, it is more then one tongue...<br/><br/>I liked it very much, a real must see, but you have to see it big screen. My brother, sister-in-law and myself went to watch the movie, and I can say that for the next few days, we didn't stop laughing, just couldn't. The site of Borat, dooming in our face, and thinking of the marriage without consent being planned, well, it just kept on coming back.<br/><br/>I hope that there will be a sequel, not really one of Borat, but just, some more 'cheap' movies like this, but with enough humor to last for another year."
"dudebeitner","10","1","21","9 January 2007"," I loved it
","Borat was a great movie, in my opinion. It was crass, rude, vulgar, contained nudity, and was very well done.<br/><br/>This was probably one of the most pro Semitic movies i have ever seen... the stark contrast between the sweet older Jewish couple in the B&B when compared to Borat's racism showed just how silly racism really is. Bigotry was a source of humor in this movie because it shows how petty it is, and so don't be so easily offended. <br/><br/>Sometimes, it's good to have a movie that allows us to laugh at our prejudices, as a means of cutting them down. And it was the hardest I have ever laughed in my life."

It didn't bother me at all. You definitely must have an open mind. It was only a movie for God's sake! Yes, it was tasteless, crude and offensive, but I loved it. I do, however, have a question about the very end of the movie. The last scene of the movie everyone is lined up going into Borat's house. Men and women alike. The camera slowly panned through the line and by the time the camera got to the front of the line, the scene was so quick, I couldn't figure out what was going on. Can anyone answer this for me?"

It's an original idea that is sure to be copied in the near future... I encourage everyone of suitable age to see this movie, and to also take it with a grain of salt. There are a few nude scenes and in no way the ones anyone would want to see. There is a wrestling match between Borat and Azamat, over a Baywatch magazine.

"Concertina4321","10","1","22","7 November 2006"," Stop whatever you're doing and go see this movie!
","I have been a huge fan of Sacha Baron Cohen since watching Ali G back in the United Kingdom. During the ""Ali G Show"" there would always be a segment with his character Borat. Borat was completely outrageous, anti-Semitic and hugely offensive. His comments were demeaning towards women, homosexuals and children. There was no stone unturned in the mind of Borat. If there was something in this world people would find offensive, Borat would find it, and then use it to his comedic advantage. This man is nothing short of genius when it comes to comedy and shock-value. The movie promises the same. Although if you are easily offended, I wouldn't recommend it. When I first learned they would be releasing a ""moviefilm"" about Borat I was more excited than anything else in the world. I was determined to go see this on its opening night. And that is exactly what I did. Going to see it on the opening night was good for the Production Company and theaters, but bad for me. Every theater was jam-packed, full for all the evening showings except the last one. Even then I had to resort to sitting in the front row from a packed seating area. But boy was it worth it. I laughed so hard during this movie I swear I almost had an asthma attack. The crowd cheered and laughed, even during some ""awkward"" parts of the movie in which Borat crossed the line in what is ""acceptable"" behaviour. The movie is the tale of Borat along with his obese producer, Azamat. They travel across the country in a used ice-cream truck in search of Borat's true love, Pamela Anderson. Along the way they stop for various interviews and appearances, all of which are ridiculously funny and will have you in tears. If there was room I would have been rolling on the floor trying to contain my breath! The audience was in the same frame of mind. It is the only film I have EVER been to where some people gave a standing ovation. The only reason I didn't give it 10 stars is I felt the film could have been longer."

Everything under the sun was mocked in the film. Some privates were exposed and there were dirty jokes, but it was the funniest thing I've seen in forever. Everything was so original.

It is a travesty that at last nights Golden Globes ""dreamgirls"" at half the gross and 4 times the cost beat Borat out out. Shows how absolutely meaningless the globes are. I cannot wait until this movie comes out on DVD, as every scene left in the movie is hilarious I expect some treasures had to be left on the cutting room floor.

","It is actually quite difficult to even get past the title of Sacha Baron Cohen's latest venture without laughing out loud, and the film itself certainly lives up to the laughs of the title.<br/><br/>Cohen, made famous for his portrayal of west-side bad man Ali G, re-invented himself in 2002 as the overly-inquisitive and incredibly politically incorrect Kazakh reporter, Borat. 'Cultural Learnings' marks Borat's first Big Screen outing and is set to make a huge impact on movie-goers worldwide!<br/><br/>The film starts in Borat's Hometown as he embarks on his journey to the 'US and A' to learn about what it is that makes America the greatest country in the world. After filming his experiences, he hopes to bring back that information to his country to allow his people to reach a new level of greatness. However, as the film progresses, Borat does get slightly distracted from his original goal and attempts to track down Pamela Anderson (And the twins!) with the intention of marrying her!<br/><br/>The tone of the film is set within the first few seconds, and as Borat introduces members of his village you start to realise that no punches are going to be pulled with how offensive this film will be. I consider myself to have a very dark sense of humour but this film even managed to shock me! Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying this in a bad way, as what I experienced was one of the funniest events of my life. I, along with the entire audience in the cinema, laughed to the point I thought I was going to throw up!<br/><br/>I am well aware that some of the scenes in this film were set up, but the dialogue between Borat and the people that he meets is so funny, it just doesn't matter. As the film moves on from scene to scene, the antics get more daring in nature, none of which I am going to disclose however, as you simply have to see them to believe them!<br/><br/>Cohen is so at home with the character of Borat that even though his material contains some of the most politically incorrect ideas ever to make it onto a cinema screen, he still manages to seem innocent in his demeanour. This of course makes his 'victims' want to believe him and also want to help him reach his goals. In turn, this makes for superbly funny watching for us the viewers.<br/><br/>This film, since its release has caused almost as much controversy as the 'Michael Jackson' court-case, and I imagine as time goes on will continue to cause more. I think people need to take a step back and see it for what it is. It is probably the funniest film ever made! Don't go and see it and expect to come out un-offended as I imagine it was created to offend as many types of people as possible. If you are going to see it (As well you should!), I recommend that you turn off your brain, watch the chaos that ensues and enjoy it!<br/><br/>Ronson's Rating: 10/10 - Probably the funniest movie in the world!<br/><br/>To read more of my reviews, please visit my blog-site at http:\\filmcell.wordpress.com"
"MaxBorg89","10","1","27","27 March 2007"," The most outrageously hilarious movie in recent years... A comic triumph!
","Having shamelessly offended anyone he could find on his Ali G Show, it was about time British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen moved to the big screen. This proved a bit hard, though, as the Ali G movie tanked and the politically incorrect actor was forced to accept smaller roles in mainstream comedies, often turning out to be the most memorable thing in those films (case in point: his ace vocal performance as the lemur king in the otherwise hardly inspired Madagascar). In 2006, however, Baron Cohen took the world by storm with the big-screen version of Borat, another famous creation of his, and its impact on modern comedy is likely to last.<br/><br/>Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (while hosting an MTV program in character, the actor jokingly said ""That's the abridged title!"") follows the misadventures of Kazakhstan's most famous (?) reporter, Borat Sagdijev (Baron Cohen), a man who's really proud of his country, even if, according to him, every town has its own rapist, it's all right to have sex with 12-year olds and his sister is ""the number four prostitute in all of Kazakhstan"". All he has to say about these things is ""Nice!"". Soon after-wards, though, he admits not everything is fine. In his own words: ""Although Kazakhstan glorious country, it have problem too: economic, social, and Jew. This is why Ministry of Information have decide to send me to US and A to learn a lessons for Kazakhstan"". Accompanied by his producer Azamat Bagatov (Ken Davitian) and carrying nothing but ""clothings, US dollars and a jar of Gypsy tears to protect me from AIDS"", the wild journalist sets out to make a documentary about the American values his country could benefit from, only to change his mind once he sees Baywatch on TV and decides to make it his mission to ""uncork"" Pamela Anderson. This still won't prevent him from upsetting as many people as possible on the way...<br/><br/>In most comedies, the protagonist has one bad characteristic, which he will compensate in some way throughout the movie. Borat, however, is not going to compensate a thing, since he incarnates all bad sides of mankind. Racism? Check (he describes an African-American interviewee as ""a real-life chocolate face. No make-up""). Anti-semitism? Check (he refuses to travel by plane ""in case the Jews decide to repeat their attack of 9/11""). Misogyny? Heck, yeah (he claims women have brains the size of a squirrel's, and when he's told his wife just died, his reaction is ""High Five!""). And let's not forget his problems with the English language (he mistakes ""retired"" for ""retard"") or misconceptions about etiquette (""What do I say when I need to go to the sh*t hole?""). This is a man who has plenty of (wrong) things to say and isn't afraid of saying them. And while most of his ""victims"" would rather lynch him, the film's funniest moments derive from the few times people actually SHARE his ""beliefs"". The standout? The now legendary rodeo sequence, which sees the audience (totally unaware of the fact Baron Cohen was just acting) cheer as Borat makes statements like ""May George Bush drink the blood of every man, woman and child in Iraq!""<br/><br/>Some have found Baron Cohen's style inappropriate, since most of the people who appear in the film were made to believe Borat was an actual Kazakhstani reporter doing a documentary about the USA. That's actually the whole point: if those men and women had known the truth, their reactions wouldn't have been so real and undeniably funny, and the movie would have been much less effective. Beneath the tons of bad taste and crude humor (including a naked wrestling match in a hotel room) lies one of the sharpest satires of all time, using the defects of its ""hero"" to expose those of an entire nation. The truth is that, like it or not, we're all a little bit like Borat (although I doubt most car salesmen would seriously say a Corvette or a Hummer is the best vehicle to seduce ""women with a shave down below"").<br/><br/>Ultimately, despite all bad stuff he says and does, Borat is a very charismatic guy, and most certainly one of the most brilliant comedic creations in recent history. Chances are viewers might even want to join in when the (fake) Kazakhstani anthem starts playing over the end credits: ""Kazakhstan greatest country in the world/ All other countries are run by little girls...""<br/><br/>Chenquieh!"

But while his Ali G movie wasn't as good as the TV show, the Borat movie is as good as anything I've seen previously from that character. It is incredibly refreshing to FINALLY come across a great comedy, the genre being virtually dead since the 90s. (And, not surprisingly, it is once again not a Hollywood product that is this hilarious.) The film will offend many, but probably only those who take themselves and life far too seriously (and, of course, many Kazak people). The film lasts only 80 minutes, which is a relief, because it offers a non-stop barrage of terrific verbal and sight gags, and any longer than that would have been unbearable. I quite literally had to watch the film with pauses, in order to calm down a bit and catch my breath. It isn't just a silly movie. It is a far cleverer satire than some people may realize at first. Sascha Baron Cohen, himself a Jew, has exposed the stupidity of (newly rising) anti-Semitism, and in the best and most original way I have ever seen. In fact, some of my personal favourites from the movie are precisely scenes dealing with hatred and fear of Jews. The movie is also politically incorrect, and this is a great part of the reason why it's so good.

","I was always a big fan of the Borat skits on 'Da Ali G Show' and loved the shockumentary style humour. Borat doesn't have the same incisive ability to destroy his subjects as Ali G but his clumsy slapstick act is very witty and strangely charming. Overall though, the film fell a bit flat. It kind of felt like Baron Cohen had used all his best jokes on the TV show and, as a result, the movie felt a bit stale and repetitive.<br/><br/>I appreciate the fact that there was an attempt at an actual storyline (however flimsy) rather than just presenting a collection of unrelated clips like in the Jackass movies. I found some scenes to be highly entertaining, particularly the naked fight with Bagatov in the hotel and the Jewish bed-and-breakfast escape.<br/><br/>What Sacha Baron Cohen does best is to humiliate deplorable people in a wonderfully subtle manner. The scene where he travels with the repulsive frat-boys is probably the best example of this, but the Virginian Rodeo and the Pentecostal church intervention were also quite shocking. I generally found these scenes more uncomfortable than entertaining, but I guess if the goal was to expose bigotry and stupidity, this is perfect execution.<br/><br/>I must say I strongly disagree with the idea that this movie is bold, daring and outrageous. The people Baron Cohen goes after (religious nuts, upper-class toffs, feminists, frat-boys etc) are low-hanging fruit for an act like Borat. There is a certainly an element of danger when it comes to potentially being attacked in public, but there is nothing edgy or outrageous going on here. It's not a problem for me (I'm just here for the comedy) but it irks me that people think Baron Cohen is some kind of taboo-breaking social anarchist.<br/><br/>Borat certainly provides a good laugh but it lacks ingenuity and gets a bit tiresome in places.

"johnnyboyz","7","0","1","26 September 2018"," ""That would not be funny in America, OK?""
","Much water has passed under the bridge since ""Borat"" was released: America elected its first black president, before going on to reject his would-be heir in 2016 for somebody else...; the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have somewhat thawed, with fighting giving way to elections, international cricket teams and would-be Islamic States. The economic situation tanked, social media exploded and the lines between men and women were greyed. Sacha Baron Cohen himself moved on to other characters in other productions - one of which, 2018's ""Who is America?"", even had its title double up as it hypothesis.<br/><br/>Interestingly, during the closing montage of ""Borat"", the titular character himself even asks, having undergone a coast-to-coast trek across the United States, the similar question 'What did I learn?' Well, what DID we learn about America at the time of the film's shooting in the summer of 2005? <br/><br/>Viewing it now, and forgetting one or two of the set ups and comedic beats, it is still at least a very funny film: Borat's haggling over the price of a hotel room; his belief that all people in the city of Atlanta speak like those on the poverty line; his interview with a group of feminists; the way the film plays with the long-since established musical cues of ""Easy Rider"" to reveal a very different method of transportation to that of a Harley-Davidson - each of these make me smile just listing them here. <br/><br/>Baron Cohen plays the eponymous Borat Sagdiyev, whose very beginnings as a character made-flesh, I seem to recall from a documentary on the actor, actually began in the late-1990's as a Moldovan migrant who would walk around London asking people whether they were Cockneys. A few years later, he was the rounded character we all know now playing undercard to Ali G on British television before then making his first foray into America in 2004 with ""Ali G in da USAiii"". Sagdiyev is a television journalist living in a backwards Kazakh village seemingly characterised by incest; child soldiers; anti-Semitism and technological retardation. The village is a microcosm of the nation itself, so the government have Sagdiyev and his obese producer Azamat (Ken Davitian) traverse to the world-famous New York City to learn about culture and so-forth to try and boost the country's standing - hence the subtitle ""Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"". The results are to be shot on film and, it seems, conveyed in this very piece... <br/><br/>What follows is, broadly speaking, a series of incidences consisting of Baron Cohen involving his character with a number of real-life people in a set of curious set-pieces which, I THINK, is trying to get to the bottom of what kind of place America is. To describe the film as a documentary; neo-realist or a piece of Dogme '95 cinema would be misleading, but it borrows heavily from each. Initially, the film takes a noticeably minimalist approach to answering its hypothesis: it depicts Borat, quite literally, greeting people on the train having just landed; unpacking his things in what he thinks is his hotel room in front of a bellboy and then walking around Times Square interacting with passers-by on his first full day.<br/><br/>By chance, a conversation with a panel of feminists ('listen pussycat, smile a bit...') the night after accidentally happening upon a ""Baywatch"" episode on TV forces him onto the road and to the opposite end of the country to seek out actress Pamela Anderson for marriage. The manner about which the film incorporates Sagdiyev's innocent enquiry into the feminism conversation is both fascinating and hilarious: Who was the blonde on the television last night? Where does she live? Noting down Anderson's locality, one feminist quips 'Oh, he's gonna look her up(!)' Was any of this planned? Did the producers merely have Borat watch TV with the intension of filming Baron-Cohen's reaction, before pushing him off in that direction anyway?<br/><br/>Many of Borat's interactions with an America his trek across to Los Angeles takes him through are cleverly woven into the film in this respect: initially, they refuse to fly and so must drive, and this leads Borat to, firstly, a driving instructor and then a used-car salesman. Later, an interaction with some Jews, Borat's mortal enemy, leads him to a gun store for protection and a terrifying conversation with the staff. In Washington DC, a gay pride rally suddenly becomes part of proceedings. Once on the road, and as the money dwindles and his friendship with Azamat is strained, the adventure turns into a bit of a nightmare...<br/><br/>But what did anybody really ""learn""? Writing in Slate Magazine, Christopher Hitchens seemed to think the film, inadvertently or otherwise, more broadly exposed the tremendous tolerance America has of outsiders and how calm and understanding many often are in dealing with outsiders. For this, it was a success. Others lamented as to how it was too keen to attack conservative targets, while a more general gripe seemed to be as to how the film was little more, when all is said and done, but a few candid-camera skits.<br/><br/>Seeing it now, we learn America is a diverse nation split by class and culture: at a rodeo, it is a place of bigotry; in many of its hotels and mansions, it is a place of affluence; in Atlanta, of poverty and potential hostility; at a Jewish run B&B, of immense kindness and whilst on the road with a crew of frat boys, of disturbing sexism. I think ultimately, the film tries to make a correlation between some of America and the village at the beginning - we chuckle at those supposedly living in the stone-age, but the joke is on us when the next 70 minutes reminds us of how some of this stuff is already in the West."

","Borat is a surprisingly hilarious comedy that uses a unique concept paired with crude and offensive humour to make fun of racism, sexism and bigotry in general. It combines documentary-style filmmaking with scripted scenes to tell a short, but entertaining story with some very memorable moments and quotes. Sacha Baron Cohen is probably the biggest reason this movie works so well, due to his commitment to the character and the ability to make one of the most racist and just horrible people in film history so likeable. There were some scenes that were kind of unpleasant to watch, but the rest of the movie was very funny and made me laugh out loud almost constantly. It's nice!

"MaccyXpert","8","0","1","1 December 2017"," No jokes held back here, folks, and it pays off
","What can sort of be described as live-action South Park, we have a freely offensive and comedic mockumentary (look it up; Borat is the first photo you get) with a wonderfully stereotyped depiction of American and especially Kazakhstani culture. <br/><br/>This is one of those production-inside-a-film movies (e.g. Synecdoche, New York, The Disaster Artist, Birdman, etc.) where Borat - a wacky and uncensored reporter - is sent to the US to bring back knowledge that can be used to improve Kazakhstan, which you can tell from the full title. It maintains its documentary feel, despite being an overall joke, while 'reporting' (making fun of) on any aspects of America that Borat stumbles upon, from feminism to the South to the most devout Christians one can find in the country. <br/><br/>The biggest aspect of this is the humour, of course. They held nothing back while writing this and coming up with ideas, which is kind of evident from the amount of stuff under 'Controversies' in its Wikipedia article. They go after (along with those mentioned above) Jewish people, Southerners (he screws with their sense of tradition and conservatism), feminists (those who think women and men should be equal, an idea which Borat mocks with comparisons to Kazakhstan), rednecks/hillbillies (showing how they give in to nationalism), and more. The humour is a mix of subtle (less people will understand it), obvious and ridiculous (you laugh due to his randomness and stupidity). I didn't get offended by any of the jokes; I just sat back and enjoyed the ride. <br/><br/>The character itself is expertly created, but doesn't seem that hard to perform (i.e. you don't see layers to him or every aspect of his psyche), mainly because that's not being examined here. His friend, Azamat, is also well done, incorporating the stereotypes and worst parts of Kazakh culture (unnecessary drama, over-the-top reactions, constant blaming and complaining, etc.). My main criticism is the fight scene between Borat and Azamat, which is just...horrific and maybe the only place where they went too far. <br/><br/>I was going to give this movie a lower rating, but it had the balls to venture into timely and debatable topics, which ultimately paid off (not without consequences, though), and I respect Sacha Baron Cohen and everyone else for that."
"maxpaikin","10","0","1","26 October 2017"," Great Expose
","Sasha Baron Cohen is an actor who challenges political correctness using crude humor coupled with carefully crafted interviews. In his series and movies, which include Bruno, The Dictator, and Borat, Cohen mocks people from different backgrounds with no regard for consequences. In the movie Borat, Cohen portrays a character who travels to America to learn about local culture and bring what he learns back home. In this movie, no ethnic group is spared his crude jibes and stereotyping. A comedy strives to make people laugh whether or not they agree with the content. Borat achieves this goal and is also very effective in exposing the lack of education of lower class Americans as well as the prejudices of Blue Collared Americans through ""misunderstandings."" In one scene, Borat, visits a car dealership with the goal of purchasing a Hummer with a ""pussy magnet."" He portrays an uneducated Kazakh and asks an empathetic salesman at what speed he would have to drive into a group of gypsies in order to kill them. Shockingly, the salesman dryly gives an answer and adds that he should be careful not to break the windshield should one of the gypsies fall on to it. Their conversation then segues into the reliability of the car. Borat compares the Hummer to his wife when he first bought her. He gives a very vivid portrayal of how his 15 year old wife developed a low voice, grew hair on her chest, and ""her vajine hang like sleeve of wizard."" The salesman remains unfazed with chuckles and smiles that signify empathy with Borat's plight. This encounter appears to show that blue collar American workers are generally indifferent and will do anything to make a sale. If Borat's claims were factual, he could have killed many people simply because the salesman did not question his intent. Another scene that portrays a total lack of ethics of blue collared workers in America is when Borat visits a Texas rodeo where he is asked to lead the crowd in singing the American national anthem. Beforehand, he gives a very passionate speech about the war in Iraq during which he says, ""May George Bush drink the blood of every single man, woman, and child of Iraq."" Surprisingly, he receives a standing ovation from the crowd. Inspired by the support he receives, Borat continues with his anti-Muslim rhetoric. Every time he shouts, the crowd cheers and applauds. It's as if the crowd and Borat share the same goal of destroying Iraq. He portrays Midwesterners as willing to destroy Iraq, regardless of the number of innocent women and children casualties. During his American road trip, Borat drives through a poor neighborhood while looking for a place to spend the night. Unfazed by his surroundings, Borat gets out of the car and attempts to befriend a group of young adults. Tentative at first, they soon realize that he is harmless and they attempt to assist him by teaching him how to speak like ""Real Americans."" He continues his search and finds a hotel where he can stay. In an attempt to be more American, he uses his newly acquired lingo. He says, ""What's up with it vanilla face, me and my homie Azamat just parked our slab outside. We looking for somewhere to post up our black asses for the night. So bang bang, skeet skeet nigah, we just a couple of pimps, no hoes."" This scene sadly portrays the lack of education of impoverished teenagers in America. While continuing his journey through America, Borat visits a gun store in order to experience what it is like to be a real American. He browses the stock and asks the salesman what type of gun would best to defend against a Jew. The gun specialist calmly replies that a nine millimeter or 45 caliber would do the job. The merchant seemed not to care that he planned to use the gun to ""defend against Jews."" As a foreigner, Borat was not able to purchase the gun, had he been an American Citizen, the storekeeper would have sold him the gun, which Borat could have used to kill Jewish people. The movie Borat is a comedic exposé of the prejudices of narcissistic blue collar Americans. Whether suggesting the merciless killing of women and children in Iraq, or implying that he will cause harm to others, Borat's interactions highlight the indifference of some Americans towards others as well as their lack of education. And although this movie makes people laugh, it reminds us that we need to look at ourselves more often in the mirror and learn to be more tolerant of others."

","I remember that this film caused a lot of buzz when it debuted and everyone was talking about it. Obviously, in front of such a film its difficult to remain indifferent but, whether you like it or hate it, truth has to be said: it's a funny movie that uses (abuses) non-sense comedy but it's very hard to digest. Despite having the laudable courage to break hundreds of taboos and talk about things that would never be addressed in a movie in other way, it does so with a deeply offensive comedy, ungrateful for those who are subject of the jokes. In this film, the target shot down by Sacha Baron Cohen is the ""politically correct"". The character himself, a pseudo-journalist from Kazakhstan, is brilliant because he can convey to reality all our preconceived ideas when we think of someone from that remote region of the world. Unfortunately, he does it in a very offensive way for Kazakhstan itself, which earned the British comedian intense (and understandable) criticism, coupled with criticism of the film's anti-Semitic humor (Cohen himself is a Jew). The film also criticizes the US and the American way of life. I was always unsure if the people who came out in the movie were aware that they were being filmed for a humor film but, whether as non-sense humor or as severe social criticism, the film works.<br/><br/>The movie is good for anyone who likes non-sense comedy and does not mind being the subject of some jokes. For all other audiences, it may seem indigestible for several reasons. Kids, in particular, should not watch this movie. Only an absolutely clueless father would let a child watch a movie like that."

","When this film released to theaters, reviewers were literally falling over themselves to give the picture a ""two thumbs up"", check Rottentomates.com for an impression of the critical response to the movie. You can also find TV interview segments on Youtube where Sasha Cohen, the star of this comedy, admits freely that the film is overrated.<br/><br/>Why? Well, for starters there's a tendency to put too much gloss on everything in the world of Hollywood, as if production technique is as important (or clearly, more important) than having an original idea. Also, much of the sentiment and emotion in US cinema is generalized at best, or grandstanding propaganda at worst.<br/><br/>""Borat"" the movie follows a Kazakh TV journalist on a voyage around the United States, discovering American lives via interviews that often derail or become awkward due to his apparent foreignness. His real- life interviews reveal the cultural inconsistencies, classism, racism, sexism, religious bigotry in modern society, an image that's often ironed out so its 'best view' is on display in cinema etc.<br/><br/>That said, ""Borat"" just isn't very good comedy. His acting chops are great, and there's clearly a number of memorable situations, but I personally only actually laughed two or three times during the film. It seems like the daring, no-holds-barred nature of the comedy and its underlying social critique are what film critics held up as great comedy, regardless of its actual humor value.<br/><br/>With a title like ""Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"" and such an almost-iconic character that Cohen created for this picture, I very much wanted to like the film, but felt it often reveled in awkwardness and bad taste rather than any deeper sociological comedy. Commendably the film does put in a very touching moment on the senselessness of war, also the film makes some point about the inherent 'not-grown-up-ness' of popular culture. Much is made of the films 'mercilessly un-PC' approach, but to be honest I just thought the jokes were kind of gross."

","Sasha Baron Cohen's Borat is quite a unique character. The comedian/actor portrays Borat, a Kazakhstan television personality. He goes to America to film a documentary. He starts off in New York City to Washington D.C. to Los Angeles, California in pursuit of Pamela Anderson. The film has some funny moments but they are overshadowed by the anti-Semitism in the film. Apparently in his village, there is a running of the Jew annual event which is not funny but offensive. When he and his partner Azamat stay with a nice older Jewish couple in America, they are so afraid that they leave in the middle of the night. The Anti-Semitism is bad enough for me but it's tasteless and offensive to actual Kazakhs who aren't' Anti-Semitic. Then there is the scenes in which naked Borat and Azamat are fighting naked and chasing each other throughout the hotel in Texas. It's gross and disgusting rather than funny. They are so afraid of Jews that they drive across country in an ice cream truck and they can't get a gun to protect themselves from the Jews so they get a live black bear. It's not funny but just offensive to Jews and to Kazakhs. If Sasha Baron Cohen wasn't Jewish himself, they wouldn't have gotten away with it in the first place."

And as for how unfriendly Americans are, well, what would you do if some insane guy with a false accent  who claimed to believe in rape walked  up to you and tried to kiss you? And the contrast between the black prostitute and southern dinner party was ridiculous. The southerners were actually being extremely open minded considering his behavior, up until the point where Borat tried to give them a bag full of his excrement and invited a prostitute into their home unannounced. And he didn't insult the prostitute, show her nude photos of his son, and hand her a bag full of poop, either. He took her out to the fair, bought her lunch, and brought her home. Obviously, she would act more welcoming than the people at the dinner party. And as for the frat boys, yes they were stupid. But did you really expect more from drunk frat boys? No revelation there. And the gay parade, notice how none of them were filmed speaking? That's because I doubt they were really that much better than the other people being filmed in this movie. To my knowledge, dancing with a total stranger, touching their dick, and going home with them to have sex, along with several other people, does not make you ""nice,"" so I am left wondering why people seem so impressed by the ""openness"" of the gay pride group. Overall, the whole thing feels very contrived. I'm not offended or shocked, just rather unimpressed and wondering why this movie is such a big deal.

This movie is masterful, almost amazing, but It doesn't really show the spectacular level.<br/><br/>The story, in this movie, isn't meant to be interesting, is meant to be dumb, because of It's ""laugh out loud"" moments. It's crazy, and really shows how to make a comedy film. And, what really amaze me, is the fact that the whole movie is a true story. Borat really kidnapped Pamela Anderson, he really did all these embarrassing things in front of the people, that they thought he was crazy. <br/><br/>Voice acting is really the Kazakhstan accent of English. It really captures it, and they really did a great job to it.<br/><br/>Well, I recommend this movie for the people that likes dirty laughs, but for them that take the movie for serious, than that's probably not recommendable.<br/><br/>8.5/10"

","Sasha Baron Cohen is a comic genius. Borat is as funny a movie as I have ever seen. He is so convincing as an innocent from Kazakhstan who no one uncovers as a sly, undercover Englishman, that I am still amazed at the temerity of this lunatic.<br/><br/>The opening scene where Borat is introducing his sister as the #1 prostitute in Kazakhstan is so over the top that I still haven't stopped laughing. <br/><br/>He is equally adept at skewering religion, nationalism, and racism. Pamela Anderson becomes a quest after an episode of ""Baywatch"" on television. Our hero must find this perfect woman and marry her. The sequences that follow are brilliant, and Mr. Cohen risks his life frequently in this docudrama/comedy. Anyone who has had a really bad day should rent this hilarious film for a great escape from reality."

It's funny but you can't laugh at people being made to play the straight man.

","Well lets face it, too much freedom isn't good, and that's why we have religions and laws that uphold these religions. Religions are here to stay it is a by-product of humanity, spawned from humanity. Possibly it was a last gasp way of controlling people and that is what religion is to isolate into groups the people who follow it.<br/><br/>Religion is basically a way of taming an uncontrollable and wild people. Excessive sexual urges, excessive eating and drinking and smoking all are not good in the long run. Excessive unrestricted sex with a number of partners leads to a variety of sexually transmitted diseases. Excessive consumption of alcohol results in liver cancer in the long run. Smoking daily is a proved way to get lung cancer which spreads to all parts of the body. <br/><br/>Both Christianity, Catholicism, Islam and Hinduism prohibit gay/lesbian sex, adultery and abortion. Islam does NOT PROHIBIT POLYGAMY but encourages it. However Islam praises those who are monogamous. <br/><br/>In Islamic religion you can marry more that one wife at a time. In Christianity and Catholic religion and Islam there is DIVORCE and this is the same as polygamy. Basically means if you are not satisfied with your wife divorce her and marry another. <br/><br/>Also note that religions are normally present in a DEMOCRATIC CAPITALISTIC GOVERNMENT. Religions are not present in a DICTATORIAL, COMMUNIST and UTOPIAN society. <br/><br/>Face it we have reached the digital technological age and we are making smaller mobiles, computers and vehicles every day so WHY THE NEED FOR RELIGION WHEN WE CAN LEARN FROM OUR PAST MISTAKES? <br/><br/>Humans can hold THEMSELVES TO BLAME FOR ALL THE PROBLEMS IN THE WORLD. All humans have accomplished so far is to hold two World Wars and to plunder the resources of the Earth and totally destroyed its ecosystem. <br/><br/>A capitalist society has prostitution and pornography, drug trafficking,legal abortion, plastic surgery and gender changing surgery for money.<br/><br/>Basically you can do what you want if you have the dough.<br/><br/>Well this film doesn't poke fun of all aspects of the capitalist society. It is more centered on the media and open sexuality in America. Also we see a mockery of the Jewish religion which I feel is uncalled for. We have a goofy look at how the live weather forecast is conducted. And we see Azmat and Borat having a fight in the nude.<br/><br/>In other words this is just another adult comedy film. This could have been an instructive film to the youth but S.B COHEN blew his chance. He could have should AIDS sufferers in USA and cancer patients dying from excessive smoking and drinking and unwanted teenage pregnancies and abortions. Also should have showed the open gay and lesbian bars and teenage prostitution.<br/><br/>If humanity continues to follow perversions and destroy the earth, which is the only planet capable to supporting life in this solar system it is doomed and that's my message.<br/><br/>ONE WORLD,ONE LOVE,ONE PEOPLE. <br/><br/>Signing Out..."

","""I had learned that if you chase a dream, especially one with plastic chests, you can miss the real beauty in front of your eyes.""<br/><br/>Reviewing Borat is a bit of a conundrum, because I had to decide on a score based one either how funny it was when it originally came out, or how funny I find it to be now, after I've seen it about six times. The latter won out, which is why my score is a little lower than it would have been four years ago. <br/><br/>The first time I saw Borat still ranks among the top two funniest theater experiences that I've ever had (Team America: World Police holds the other spot). The whole theater was in stitches and gasping for breath, and my group was no exception. There may be a method to Sacha Baron Cohen's madness and a genuine message about intolerance and bigotry underneath this movie, but the humor is crass, low-brow, raunchy, and absolutely hilarious. <br/><br/>I won't bother to explain the Borat phenomenon, because I'm sure anyone who's in any way remotely interested has known about it for several years. The movie still holds up pretty well, and while some of the shocks and audacity of it don't make as much of an impact any more, Cohen's bumbling, anti-Semetic, misogynistic, gleefully offensive character still does. If you have somehow missed seeing this and you enjoy comedy like South Park, watching Borat will make your face turn blue. And I mean that in a good way."

","I keep this DVD on it's own shelf away from my collection because there are still studies underway to determine if it is contagious to other movies.

If you look at the DVD cover and expect you are going to see comedic refinement in this film you really should have your eyes checked. Taken for what it is, it is a worthwhile watch, maybe it isn't for some people and that is fine. What you must understand that all of the jokes in the world are at ""someone's"" expense. Maybe that isn't fair but that is the way it is. I rated this as high as I did for some fall down funny gags (that wrestling match with the censor bars had me crying-like Borat is John Holmes or something-I was crying)and for a weird kind of originality.

"tmpj","7","0","1","16 August 2010"," And I Thought I Knew What Crazy Was !!!!!
","Borat is complete insanity. It is intensely funny by way of the appearance of crudity...not of polish. He is an un-sophisticated, backwards character who means well, but always manages to screw things up just the same. The policy of the comedy is essentially ""no holds barred...nothing is sacred...and no one is safe or immune"". He exposes prejudices, phobias, racial attitudes, sexist attitudes...he just brings it all out into the open while you stare at the screen in utter dis-belief at what you have just seen, heard, or experienced. It is all cleverly orchestrated by Sasha Baron Cohen and his co-horts, and many a public figure has been suckered into falling for his gags and his persona. The movie...even the DVD...looks homemade, and the look is the look of film from the 60s or 70s...but the comedy is current, up to date, and you will need to fasten your seat belt...it's all funny and all fun, but it's bound to make people uncomfortable, and the secret is...that's exactly what the creator of Borat set out to do. The hand of Jay Roach, director of the Austin Powers trilogy, can be felt here and there in the production. Not for the feint of heart or the easily offended. But if you're a gambler, give Borat a try. It's guaranteed to offend and entertain."

","In this spoof, Borat Sagdiyev (Sacha Baron Cohen), a Kazakh TV presenter, is ordered by his government to travel to the US and report on its way of life. He interviews Americans about feminism, sex, etiquette, humour, politics and religion. He also falls for Baywatch star Pamela Anderson, who he tries to kidnap.<br/><br/>Borat has a clever premise, with a straight-faced, apparently naive foreigner coaxing outrageous, embarrassing comments from innocent, well-meaning Americans not in on the gag. Yet the film trades on gross-out humour, and picks on easy targets: evangelical Christians, rodeo rednecks, unsmiling feminists. Essentially, this is Candid Camera - with the unwelcome addition of anti-Semetic jokes. One wonders at Baron Cohen's motives: is this a smug in-joke, a tilt at political correctness, or a cynical attempt to shock? Exasperatingly, it's a little bit of all three. The film was criticized by the Kazakhstan government, Jewish and gypsy groups."

","Borat (Larry Charles, 2006) is, of course, one of the most popular - and most widely-loathed - movies of the last decade. Sacha Baron Cohen plays the Kazakhstani TV reporter of the title, who travels to ""the US and A"" in a bid to understood his American cousins and finds that while they'll put up with rank bigotry, they're not so keen on you bringing a bag of poo down to dinner. Though Cohen is acting, the bulk of his encounters are with real-life folk, from drunken, misogynistic fratboys to strait-laced politicos. The movie doesn't have a coherent viewpoint, deliriously lampooning anti-semitism whilst ripping the proverbial out of poor eastern Europeans, but it does shed some light on the prejudices apparently ingrained in several strata of US society, and offers a dozen big laughs. Most come from stunts and interviews, rather than the straight-to-camera material, which is often smug and obvious.<br/><br/>Happily, Cohen's quick wits and use of a well-judged pause can turn even the most unpromising chat into a goldmine: witness Borat's effortless misunderstanding of ""...not"" as a comic suffix. Intriguingly, some scenes are cut off almost as soon as they begin, suggesting that a few of the subjects may have been onto him. That heavy editing contributes to the general bittiness. The film's highlight is Cohen's performance at a rodeo, in which he turns the entire crowd against him in four appallingly cringe-worthy minutes. The sequence ends with him singing the 'Kazakh national anthem' to the tune of the The Star-Spangled Banner: ""Kazakhstan greatest country in the world/All other countries are run by little girls/Kazakhstan number one exporter of potassium/Other countries have inferior potassium."" Personal taste dictates that I found such silliness more engaging than all the rubbish about ""retards"", however post-modern the comic might claim it is. I also felt uncomfortable at his needling of perfectly reasonable folk, like an unfailingly polite driving instructor and some friendly feminists.<br/><br/>While Borat is neither a great film nor an important one, and is saddled with myriad shortcomings, it is often deeply funny. The sight of Cohen sprinting along a crowded New York street as he attempts to kiss a very unhappy all-American man on both cheeks, his crashing of a mortgage brokers' dinner stark-naked and his whipping up of the rodeo crowd (""May George Bush a-drink the blood of every single man, woman, and child of Iraq"") are considerable compensations for moral inconsistency, some duff jokes and a mock-introspective narrative (featuring Pamela Anderson) that really sags in the second half."

If you think the character Borat is sexsist, racist, anti-Semitic, homophobic and rude, you are kinda right. But NOT Sacha Baron Cohan.

","It's gonna take a lot to ever top Borat as a comedy. It is a masterpiece. Having seen countless films in the past 30 years with all sorts of comedies, Borat is the icing on the cake.<br/><br/>Sure, there are a few other truly funny comedies out there. There are some OK ones. And there is a lot (and I mean a lot) of really bad and overrated ones (""The Hangover"" for instance).<br/><br/>Borat came out of nowhere without too much unneeded hype and expectation. It took the world by surprise and wasn't marketed ahead of time with talk show appearances of cast and crew (which is the common norm these days with the cookie-cutter wannabe-comedies).<br/><br/>Borat may seem like a somewhat childish movie at first, but watch it again - and you will start seeing it work on many levels. It takes great intelligence to create truly funny comedy that lasts a lifetime. Anyone can make slapstick or fart jokes and get a few laughs there and then. But to create something that sticks to people's minds for years, to be quoted and imitated, to have catch phrases and social lingo left as its legacy - that takes effort!<br/><br/>This movie accomplishes all that. It's one of those few gems that gets funnier and funnier for every time you see it. It feels good to laugh so long and hard that you're almost tired. Like, your stomach muscles got a healthy workout. And you feel better afterwards. Just like after a good day in the gym.<br/><br/>Borat sure delivers. People who rate this movie low are either: A) way too sensitive about ""provocative"" subject matters B) brought up to think only cookie-cutter ""accepted"" commercial comedies are funny C) not understanding the hilarity in how humans behave when placed in awkward situations with an awkward man that they really don't know how to handle D) all of the above.<br/><br/>Cheers to Borat - the funniest comedy ever made."

After a brief introduction to his village and its ""charming"" inhabitants, the primitive fellow explains his task: he is being dispatched to the US to report on the country. That, he hopes, will help Kazakhstan become a better country, by having an example. But Borat doesn't fit well among the Americans, always causing trouble or behaving improperly. The report turns into a journey across the US when Borat falls in love with Pamela Anderson after watching Baywatch.<br/><br/>Borat is a hilarious character, the image of a village man, who doesn't know much about manners, high society and life in general. With his accent, conversation skills and goofy moustache, Borat became a symbol of comedy.<br/><br/>The movie is anything but flawless. First of all, the village doesn't resemble a Kazakh village at all, none of the villagers look Kazakh, not even Borat. Well, believe it or not, the village is Romanian. It's funny (if you understand the language) to listen to what the people are actually saying, since the translation is different. The movie is controversial, Kazakhstan is not populated by Borats, but the movie wants us to believe so. It creates the image of a country populated by anti-semites and unintelligent brutes.<br/><br/>Most explanations are in Russian – most of the word are spelt wrong. Apparently nobody proofread the script It's a daring movie, it's hilarious, it's clever, it's controversial, it's not a perfect cinema piece, but it still is great.

I chuckled occasionally and laughed out loud two or three times, but other than that I found the movie to be boring, repetitive and irritatingly sophomoric.<br/><br/>It seems like I watched a very different movie than all the people who called it ""original, edgy, intelligent"" or any other such adjective. I found it to be yet another base, uninspired movie the makers of which are under the impression that simply being tasteless and gross is in itself funny. The whole concept was nothing more than an extended Tom Green Show skit, just raunchier and admittedly more outrageous.<br/><br/>The only scene in the entire movie that made me laugh heartily was the scene in which kids run up to Borat's ice cream truck, unaware that there is a bear inside that he has bought as a guard dog. The bear roars at the kids who run away screaming. The scene is funny as hell, and it's a purely slapstick moment with no hint of nastiness. Imagine that? Similarly, the only really funny scenes are the more innocuous jokes such as Borat discovering his partner working as an Oliver Hardy look-alike in Hollywood or the pair mistakenly believing that their hosts at a bed & breakfast have transformed into cockroaches. Other than an undeniably funny nude wrestling match, the more tasteless ""jokes"" fall flat.<br/><br/>The most interesting thing about BORAT is that most of the people in it were unaware that the movie was a mockumentary, believing ""Borat"" to be a real person. This leads to many people revealing a very ugly side of themselves (which, along with the prospect of making some money, led to many lawsuits against the filmmakers), such as a coordinator at a rodeo commending Borat's homeland's treatment of homosexuality as an offense punishable by death.<br/><br/>Overall, BORAT is simply not very funny. It's too long, loses steam very early on and then just keeps going. Yeah, it has its moments, but I don't believe Sasha Baron Cohen to be the comic genius that many are calling him. He's funny, he's clever, he's certainly fearless. But he doesn't know when to quit. That's a problem with quite a bit of Hollywood product these days, regardless of genre. Cohen probably thinks one cannot take things too far. I suppose that's subjective, because I definitely think there is such a thing as too much."

To turn anything hateful and disgusting into some kind of humorous item from the big trick store round the corner is not easy, but is it funny? What's more I had already seen many of these gagging choking gags in other films, like drinking from the toilet bowl, bringing your feces in a plastic bag to the dinner table for disposal, inviting a street lady to a dinner party in a middle class home, and so many others. In fact Schwarzenegger is more effective in that line of the cultural gap or shock between the good old Soviet culture and the American lifestyle when he plays the KGB officer in New York running after a couple of Georgian Mafiosi in Red Heat if I remember well. It is amazing how they have, through advertising, made this film into what it is not, a funny film whereas it is sad and even very sad to see the thickness of disrespect they accumulate and pile up in order to produce a shocked little laugh. But one thing is sure. This film represent the spirit of its time, that end of an eight year tenure that was getting so stale and so full of carbon dioxide and poor in oxygen that we were dying like a poor fish thrown on the grassy bank of a dried up river. Even the bush of the rose garden were severely wilted and close to death from drought, the drought of the absence of basic honesty and truthful freedom of speech.

The dialogue is also very funny at time, but it was the acting that brings out everything.<br/><br/>Sacha is practically Borat so what else is there to say, he was awesome, his acting and confident is very believable, and his accent is brilliant. He makes Borat standout like anything, making him a very iconic figure.<br/><br/>Well most of the gag is very much controversial in nature tacking topic such as racial, religion, female, social status, homosexual, and so on. I guess because most of the time Hollywood don’t really have the gut to bring those topic to lime light so when it finally came out it is pretty funny. Just like South Park. But unlike it this movie doesn’t seem to hold on anything and just go ahead with the gag; and that making it pretty refreshing.<br/><br/>If you’re not the one that gets like offended (Jew, gay, etc) then I see no reason of complaining. People need to loosen up. This is all for humor. I see some people take this so seriously, I was very surprise. They should have known this is ain’t that type of movie that one can take it seriously, still they watch it and complain about it. Why of the sudden people so righteous? Last Words: I would recommend that people would loosen up and try to enjoy the movie; I still understand this is absolutely not for everyone taste. Do not expect any sophisticated joke.<br/><br/>Recommendation: Yeah, It Worth a DVD.<br/><br/>Reason To Watch: Awesomely Funny From Time To Time.<br/><br/>Reason Not To: Very Offended Jokes.<br/><br/>Rating: 7.5/10 (Grade: B+)"

","I'll be very brief on this one: If it wasn't for the unnecessary hotel room gay-like scenes, this would be a 9/10 for me; as it is there (without serving any greater purpose (I expected the manager to enter the room due to the noise or something, at least), it doesn't fit there very well and will probably chase away some viewers.<br/><br/>Borat succeeds in revealing the hidden anti-semitism and bigotry in many of the victims; and surprisingly, even though the film begins with jokes about Jews, in the end it's exactly the old Jewish couple in the rent-a-room house that comes out of the movie totally unscathed by Borat's jokes.<br/><br/>Since I'm from a country not that far from the supposed Kazachstan, I loved the supposedly Kazach scenes; because it very nicely shows how an average West-country-citizen thinks of Eastern European and post-soviet countries (even though we actually have better cell phones than an average American ;-) ) Thumbs up!"
"sme_no_densetsu","7","0","5","10 February 2008"," A truly irreverent mockumentary
","In this film Sacha Baron Cohen plays Borat Sagdiyev, a Kazakhstan native sent to the United States to film a documentary that will show his people the way to prosperity. As you might expect, Borat experiences a major case of 'culture shock', leading to numerous humorous escapades.<br/><br/>Cohen demonstrates some sizable comedic chops as he basically carries this film on his own. The character of Borat has an endearing naïveté which causes him to repeatedly get himself into trouble.<br/><br/>If there's one thing I can say about the humour in this film, it's that it pulls no punches. However, while no-one should take anything that Borat says seriously some of the 'enlightened' Americans come off as more disturbing than funny. Maybe it's just me, but unscripted statements endorsing misogyny, racism and homophobia delivered with utmost sincerity are not funny in the least.<br/><br/>Most viewers will probably alternate between laughter and slack-jawed speechlessness like myself but if you can take it all with a grain of salt then you'll get a kick out of this unrestrained mockumentary."

","When people were telling me about the jokes in Borat, my immediate instinct was to watch this film, because it sounded hilarious. Critics, comedians and cinema lovers alike heaped praise on this film for being the funniest thing in 2006. So did it deserve the hype it got or was it just sheer over-rated fodder. I can tell you it's neither. Whilst being outrageously funny the film does repeats its jokes a bit like sexytime. Also if you are easily offended this might not be the ideal comedy for you as the laws of political correctness are completely thrown out the window as it makes the likes of Team America the patron saint of being polite. Hopwver if you think rules are stupid then you will love this film. For me personally it did push my boundaries and I am quite sweary so it's basically a two way street. If you love gentler comedies then you will detest this if you love insults then you will be quoting this film for a long time. It's like marmite, you'll love it or hate it."

","Jak sie masz! My name a 81Sorp! Well, not really, but let's not sweat the details.<br/><br/>Borat, a reporter from ""Kazakhstan"" travels to the U.S and A to learn about the great country in the west and hopefully learn how to deal with his own country's problems who he himself says are: ""social, economical and jew"". In the U.S and A he sees a TV show called ""Baywatch"", falls in love with the voluptuous Pamela Anderson Lee and descides to travel all over the U.S and A to meet her and her very appealing bosom. On the road to his dream girl many cultural misunderstandings ensues.<br/><br/>This ""Documentary"" has some funny moments and some half funny moments that are OK. If you've seen Sacha Baron Cohen's earlier work it's the same old stuff he has done before: interview people who don't know it's a joke and get confused and/or angered. It's built on a lot of improvisation from Cohen's part which has its good and bad sides. The good is that it's spontaneous reaction from his interview victims and the funny misunderstandings from these people who think it's for real. The bad is that more than a few improv-jokes become very lowbrow and potty-oriented. Many times it relies on shock, testing the boundaries and obscenity to create laughs, like nudity and aforementioned potty humor. Maybe it's just me but I grew up with and expected a slightly more clever British humor than this. However, all in all it's not all bad. Half the humor comes from his interview victims who fit the picture of the conservative American, out of touch with the rest of the world. THIS was was more of the cleverness that I had expected and wish there had been more of. <br/><br/>Cohen could have toned down Borats acted craziness and given more room to these peoples real craziness.<br/><br/>That's all from me.

","Firstly, I think it's important to point out that the actor/comedian starring in this film is in fact Jewish himself. I know several members of the Jewish community who have seen this film and couldn't stop laughing from start to finish! If people choose to take this as a 'real' documentary, then that is where the problems of viewing pleasure will start. If however, the viewing public accept that this is a film that discovers the raw heart of American views towards the rest of the world, then the film is one to be enjoyed over and over again! I won't name scenes (no spoilers remember!), but Sascha had the nerve and audacity to follow through some scenes which are very (very) close to the knuckle, yet managed to entertain throughout. However, I imagine the American viewing public will have problems watching certain aspects of this film, as it eats away at foreign policy and views on the rest of the world. 9/10 for me!!!!"

","Firstly, Cohen is a smart man, and his humour propelled him very quickly to the forefront of UK TV comedy, ingratiating himself with younger people (let's say 15 up to 40) in the UK. I am one of those people.<br/><br/>This film is an extended spin off from the popular 'Borat' character, originating from 'da Ali G show' on a trip to find out about the country his character looks up to the most, America.<br/><br/>His character is racist, prejudiced and sexist, not to mention an outright Bigot and Homophobe, and quickly engages in some truly fascinating mini interviews with various sections of American society. His innocence is sold to the unwitting interviewees who, much like the subjects of Louis Theroux, are exposed completely and unashamedly for who they *really* are.<br/><br/>For me this is the genius of the film. Slapstick comedy will make me laugh (and this film bore no exceptions) if I am in the right mood, but personally it took a back seat to the insight we are granted. Characters such as the Frat boys / Homeys and the Pentecosts provide a clear window into what to them is an 'everyday' day. Yes, Borat is a movie-film, but every candid scene stands out: you can't make these people say and behave the way they do, they just do because that's who they are.<br/><br/>To say these subjects are ignorant may be a falsehood - some acknowledge either directly or indirectly that their viewpoints may be frowned upon, but carry on regardless.<br/><br/>Cohen is a clever and brave man to visualise this film and carry it off .I bet there were some times during production where he doubted it could be done... I could have left out the toilet humour as I don't find it that appealing, but I don't feel it detracted from what I found to be a very witty, daring and unfettered look at the darker side of real people that I had never encountered before. One last thing - remember, humourising offensive topics is the first step toward removing them from society.<br/><br/>8/10"
"wacky_stu","8","0","4","10 November 2007"," Very Original
","What Borat accomplishes is exactly what it appears it was designed to be: A mock-umentary poking fun at as many different American cultural aspects as possible. While some may regard some of the humor as crude, racist, immature and sexist it does so in total jest and with a sense of originality. Unlike many other comedies featuring crude humour: ""oldschool"" or ""Jackass"", Borat presents its humor in a manner which doesn't make you feel as if you've seen it all before but with slightly different punch lines and actors. Now, I have read quite a few comments which have stated things like ""some of the jokes made me want to leave the cinema"" and while I sympathize with those who felt offended by the humor on a personal level (such as someone from Kazakhstan might) I believe that the crudeness of the jokes are what makes them so hilarious. Those who did not enjoy the humor in this movie should stick to watching 'Blackadder' and other British commedies with audience laughter dubbed over to 'remind you whats funny and whats not'"

","Finally, I decided to watch this movie. At first, The movie seemed rather disappointing and the style was some crude documentary with an attempt to amuse us. But watching more of the movie, I see it was much better. It was hilarious and reminded me of a Napoleon Dynamite style movie. One thing that is odd is how Borat is against jews, gypsies, and Homosexuality. Although, he did make a mistake about the last part.<br/><br/>One thing I thought was just so hilarious was when Borat had a fight with Azamat naked. Also, when he accidentally humped him during the fight and when he accidentally did 69 with Azamat. Some children went to see the movie so I guess they were just traumatized. Also, I liked when Azamat and Borat made up and started towards their dream to get Pamela Anderson again. Borat did and things ended up going the way he didn't want it to go. Heh.<br/><br/>One confusing thing was when Borat was learning how to dine. I think that part of the movie was just pointless because the only amusing part of that scene was when Borat returned to the dinner party with feces wrapped in toilet paper or some type of bag, and the woman was excused and went to the bathroom and taught him how to wipe his bottom.<br/><br/>I don't understand why there are so many 1/10 reviews of this movie. Well actually, I kind of understand. It's offensive and all but I'm none of what this movie makes fun of except Christianity. But I thought that was funny how Borat was being cleansed and was speaking in tongues and just going all gibberish. This movie was clever, amusing, sort of predictable at some scenes but just hilarious. I thank Kayla for telling me about this movie.<br/><br/>What I thought was hilarious was when he returned back to Kazakhstan, he had an Ipod and his neighbor had a Ipod Mini and he said Ipod Minis were for girls. Also, It was just so hilarious that before he went back, he went to Luenell's house. Then when he went back and introduced his new wife, his new wife was Luenell. That is just extremely ultimate funny.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie for.. not really everyone. Only if you are really, really, really, really mature enough because this movie was just too offensive to a lot of people and a lot of scenes were deleted because of that, although it is on DVD I think, I'll check.

","2006's Borat was a hilarious and truthful film. I watched it with my parents and we laughed until our stomachs hurt and tears were coming out of our eyes! Sascha Baron Cohen was so perfect as Borat and he made you believe he was actually from Kazahkstan. Even though it was a very funny film, to me what made it so great was how truthful and realistic it actually was. The people Borat encountered and interviewed were real people, not actors. Their opinions were real. Their ideas were real. That's how real people in the world today think. They hate Jews, they hate Muslims, they hate anyone who is in this country illegally and anyone who is not white or black. And even the whites hate the blacks and vice versa! And to me it's just sad. It's sad that today, in 2007, there are people out there in America who still hate black people. I have an uncle who is so racist that it's just stupid to hear some of the things he says. And even though it's terrible to think about and it's saddening, it's true! And that's another reason why I loved this film. It showed a perfect depiction of how Americans think these days. It showed their opinions about the Iraqi war and illegal immigrants and President George W. Bush. Sure, it was offensive at times but I didn't find it offensive because it was real. And people have to realize that reality can be offensive. But even though it was offensive it was still freaking hilarious. How can you not laugh at two naked men, one skinny and one overweight, fighting over a woman and running down the hall of a luxurious hotel, still fighting and yelling at each other, and still naked!! And shouting Arabic curse words at each other!! That was the funniest part of the film. My parents and I were howling!!! I was highly disturbed over this scene because these two men are naked and each other's genitals are at opposite ends of their bodies (you'll just have to see the film to understand what I just said, if you don't already) and I""m watching this film with my parents!! And I'm 22 years old! But it was still so funny! I laughed until it hurt! Anyway, Borat: Cultural Learnings of America For Make Benefit of Glorious Nation of Kazakstan was a brilliant and intelligent film and anyone who's looking for a good laugh should see this film. But if you're easily offended, I would not advise you to see it. But if you're not and you love to laugh, then you should rent this great film. I enjoyed it immensely.

","Being familiar with Ali G and having seen many of Borat's TV appearances, I went into this movie with high expectations, not least because the reviews were ecstatic. However, overall I was disappointed. There were several moments of hilarity, but too often tempered by long-winded set-ups, tedious plot driving dialogue or let down by the fact that the victims of the comedy didn't really deserve it. Lampooning some cartoonishly clichéd rednecks or genuinely terrifying churchgoers is funny, if easy, but being rude to a sweet old couple doing their best to run a charming guest house just seemed misplaced. Generally, the shorter the clip the funnier (and the DVD extras are some of the funniest bits) but, whilst capturing Pamela Anderson in a sack may sound funny, I thought the execution left a lot to be desired, and was nowhere near as funny as the TV show."

I liked this movie a lot. I think everyone should watch it. It really puts a mirror up to America and the image is not pretty."

","Like a jolt of electricity into the world of cinema, Borat awakened the industry by delivering a shock treatment that can be capable of waking patients in lifelong comas. Controversy, bewilderment, amazement and eventually lawsuits surrounded this movie from the moment the trailer first aired, as a relatively unknown British comedian impacted the American life in a way not seen coming. Dressed as one of his alter-egos in his hit British show, Sacha Baron Cohen would practically fool almost all of America with his wild and crazy antics without ever breaking out of character. Inside the rather short 84 minutes of this picture lies some of the craziest scenes in recent memory, including one of the funniest and raunchiest fights you'll ever see in your life. As long as you can deal with its heavy shock humor, then you'll find Borat to be one of the funniest films in over a decade. But, if you are easily offended, or if you can only take so much sexual content, this must be skipped. And, if you are a Jewwell...let's just hope you have a sense of humor.<br/><br/>In Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan, we follow a homophobic, sexist, racist, unintelligent, cheerful, and social citizen of a country full of problems (economic, social, Jew). To fight these problems, he is being sent to the United States to figure out how to better improve the country. Relying on very little script and much more on improvisation and what fooled Americans say, Borat is a tough movie to make. It is not easy at all to be able to find enough material without giving away the joke or exposing the joke. Nonetheless, thanks to sharp acting and improvising by Cohen and his assistant Ken Davitian, and also thanks to a series of very successful interactions with Americans, we have ourselves an amazingly hilarious film that isn't afraid to push any buttons. Directed loosely by Larry Charles and produced by Jay Roach, every aspect of Borat is silly and humorous; from the soundtrack to the one-liners to the reactions of Americans, leading straight up to the ending.<br/><br/>Sacha Baron Cohen runs the show, steals the show, and prevents it from ever getting stale. With a heavy accent, a willingness to embarrass himself, and unafraid of anything, Cohen is everything Jamie Kennedy, Ashton Kutcher, and other pranksters wishes they could be. He comes off as so convincing; that it seems like nobody that interacted with him could tell that there was even a hint of potential that he was acting. Cohen doesn't lose any touch with his character for even a second; he probably stayed with those same clothes even after filming was done for the day. His acting deserves awards, maybe even an Oscar if the material wasn't such a hot button issue. But, we shouldn't take anything away from his assistant, Davitian, who can be just as funny. Both of them share some sort of comic chemistry that can be compared to the likes of the Frat Pack, specifically Owen Wilson and Vince Vaghan.<br/><br/>While the movie is funny, it is not for everybody. Unlike the great comedies past and present that jumble up multiple ways to get a laugh, Borat is strictly shock humor, with a tiny hint of physical humor and satire. The quantity of shock humor is very heavy, comes is massive doses, and just might be too much for some viewers. Like previously stated, the only punches this film pulls is on time, as it clocks in at less than 90 minutes. This is more like Napoleon Dynamite, you are whether going to love it or hate it. Unlike Napoleon Dynamite though, Borat actually makes an effort (and actually has decent substance--and actually has effort in terms of camera-work).<br/><br/>Bottom Line: If you can take it, watch this movie. Well-directed, well-acted, and just jaw dropping in multiple instances, Borat doesn't hold back and throws shocker after shocker until the movie is over. The film never runs out of material, never drags, and just never loses its edge. Perhaps the only thing it is missing is more scenes of the grief-stricken country Kazakhstan and its citizens, since they were all fun to watch in the beginning and in the end. Cohen fools half of America with his antics, and we receive nothing but pure enjoyment because of it. Highly recommend. It is not one of the greatest comedies of all-time, but does deserve the honor of being among the funniest movies this decade. Watch it, because remember, if this film not success, Borat will be executed."

","I'm as broad-minded as the next guy. (I hate when people say that.) But please. A few moments of amusement, but haven't we taken potty humor almost as far as it can go? My only problem is that there's really nothing fresh or new here - just the same clichés repackaged. If you get the Cohens you get bizarre. I get bizarre - I just didn't get this. There was a real opportunity here for some fresh humor. I am only avoiding referencing any lines because I don't want to have a spoiler problem on a movie I don't think anyone could spoil.

This surprised me, since I've been a fan of ""Da Ali G Show"" from day one. But this movie was vulgar - I thought it made the low-brow comedy classic ""Animal House"" look elegant by comparison! There were parts that made me laugh, but all in all, I was disappointed. Perhaps my expectations were too high. And I really thought the jokes about the Jewish folks were in particularly poor taste (I'm not one of those overly sensitive types either, for racial slams say more about the person doing the insulting than they do about anyone else). The only comedian I've ever seen do racial humor really, really well is Carlos Mencia, and that's because a. he's really funny; b. he leaves NO ONE out, and c. he also pokes fun at his own race. To pick on one group to the exclusion of everyone else is just sometimes in poor taste, as it was in this film. I doubt I'll ever watch it again."

","That said, I have to admit it was the funniest movie I have seen in a very long time. My gut hurt from laughing so hard! The thing that made Borat work was that Baron Cohen stayed totally in character the entire time. If he had broken character even for a second, it would have made the movie a dismal failure.<br/><br/>This is a movie that someone will either love or hate. There is no middle ground. So, why do some folks loathe this movie? Aside from the movie overall being very crude humor, it exposes the true (and oftentimes nasty) underbelly of humankind and many folks prefer to not to believe that people are really like that. The amount of anti-Semitism (and other prejudices) that Baron Cohen seemingly innocently evokes from folks is frightening! Most people would rather bury their heads in the sand and try to convince themselves that they are above that. The truth is quite the opposite! Not many people want to openly admit that they are a bigot! <br/><br/>This movie is sick yet it makes a statement about mankind that cannot be ignored. It is also incredibly funny!"

Other stuff though fell flat. One thing that was distracting though was who were the suckers into thinking this guys is real and who are the actors acting a part.

","My guess is that if you've never seen the Borat character before (on ""Da Ali G Show"" on HBO or DVD), you'll probably think ""Borat"" is hysterical. However, as one who was already familiar with the character, the movie was a bit of a letdown, especially considering the hype around it.<br/><br/>Yes, there were some very funny scenes, but there were also stretches of not-so-funny or I've-already-seen-this scenes. What really works is when Borat is interacting with ""civilians"" who *know* they're on camera and have *agreed* to be on camera. To me, that's always been the beauty of Cohen's comedy. What's much less amusing are innocent passers-by reacting to Borat imposing himself upon them. The staged scenes between Borat and the people of his village (including his producer ""Azmarat"") don't work as well, either. (A notable exception takes place in a hotel room, but I don't want to elaborate with a spoiler.) I rate this movie 7 out of 10. If you equate outrageousness with humor (as did, in my opinion, the people who *loved* ""There's Something About Mary""), you'll like it more than I did. I, however, was raised on Monty Python, so while outrageousness can be part of the package (e.g. the Black Knight scene in ""Holy Grail""), for me, there's got to be a little more behind it than simply shock value. Sometimes, ""Borat"" succeeds in this, but just as often, it doesn't."

When he pooed in the plastic bag was funny. Other bits were funny to.<br/><br/>In conclusion, it is slightly disappointing but it was still pretty funny. The problem is it could've been better.

","I have immense respect for Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan. I have never seen a movie that took the line of what's acceptable and pushed it so far, intact Borat took the line and violated it in every way possible. I think what made me respect this movie so much was the fact that it was incredibly Anti-American. It took the flaws of the cultures of America and exploited them for all its worth. However every American I know that has seen it has loved it. Not many movies that make Americans look so bad are loved as much.<br/><br/>No matter how much I loved the idea of Borat, it really was a bit much for me. Not often can humor be too crude for myself, but points of this movie are so incredibly inappropriate that even I became a little uneasy, some very shocking methods were used to get reaction out of the audience, some of it was great, however a few scenes were a bit much for me. Everyone has their levels, and a few of the scenes scraped upon my levels.<br/><br/>This movie however did its job. It makes you believe the entire time its an actual documentary, you believe that what you are seeing actually all happened. You never think ""its just a movie"" you think ""this is the most screwed up documentary I have ever seen."" The fact that the documentary atmosphere was done so well made all the humor that much more crude and shocking, everything seems that much more real.<br/><br/>I did love this movie, It took all the flaws in American society and making all the social classes able to come together in the same theater and laugh at each other, with no one insulting anyone else, or anyone getting offended because this movie makes fun of every possible class that anyone can fit into you cant help but laugh at yourself.<br/><br/>I would recommend seeing this, however be warned, it is incredibly crude, and some may think disturbing at points.

The humor does mock some people yes, but if you have to be so politically correct that you can't enjoy this movie, you just haven't gotten the point. This movie is made in order to reveal other peoples prejudism, rather than creating them. This prejudism is show through various characters like a conservative rodeo cowboy, the general man on the NY subway, a party of Christian over class people, a group of feminists, etc. The most funny part is watching how all these people take themselves, and their causes so seriously (espessialy those feminists. <br/><br/>So if you can't see the humor in this you are just TOO politically correct in your mind, and a double moralist, as everyone carries these prejudice thoughts shown in the movie.

There were no new catch phrases or scenes that didn't strike me as being very similar to a scene from his show. It feels like Borat is basically selling out, he is giving up the innovation you could see from episode to episode of the show to a bigger budget film with nicer camera shots, editing etc... One could say that this is simply the evolution of his style, people often use this argument to say that Miles Davis never sold out, but I digress.

But I like, vair nice!<br/><br/>I liked the shock and awe tactics used on unsuspecting folks on the streets and various other locales in this mockumentary, never mind if some sequences were scripted, versus the spontaneity of others. There's slapstick, witty lines, double entrées, sight gags, toilet humour, fact is, the filmmakers threw in everything from the humour genre, save for the kitchen sink.<br/><br/>If there should be any semblance of a plot, it would be Borat's adventures to the United States and America, at first to learn the culture and good stuff that the Americans can offer, make a documentary for make benefit glorious nation of Kazakhstan. From NY to Los Angeles, it becomes a road trip of sorts, with each city or town along the way made a pitstop for his madcap antics. Borat has a hidden agenda of course, and that is to track down and marry Pam Anderson, whom he fell in love while watching an old episode of Baywatch. That's all I will say, and I'll not even suggest anything in particular which I enjoyed for fear of ruining the pleasure for you. Word of advice: if you haven't seen the trailers, DON'T!<br/><br/>I shan't attempt to go into supposed deeper insights as I refuse to believe that this was made with the intention insulting others or find wicked pleasure at laughing at ourselves, or laughing at our own inner prejudices, blah blah blah. It's a god-damned crazy movie, and you must admit that Sacha Baron Cohen had the guts and gumption to pull off something like this with his Borat character. The only gripe, if I should have, would be the pacing of the movie. It's rather jarring as episodes are presented one after another, and the pace naturally goes whacked, especially with the slower bits. Thankfully, they were not allowed to drag on for too long, before another lighter moment takes over.<br/><br/>So if you're allergic to the sensitivities of the less fortunate, or cannot stand making fun of various self interest groups, then give Borat a miss.

The character of Borat is genius. The movie of Borat is hilarious. It is one of the funniest, if not the funniest movies of the year. I guarantee that you will be laughing for the majority of the movie. Despite me already hearing half the jokes from people that have already seen it, the movie is still insanely funny. It's a little hard to decipher between what is real, and what is staged, but it doesn't really matter, because either way, you'll be pissing yourself with laughter. I feel obligated to warn you: there is a naked wrestling scene that is very graphic and more disgusting than many of the things that you can find on the internet. Although nauseatingly nasty, it is one of the funniest parts of the movie, except possibly the scene involving Pamela Anderson and Borat's attempt for her to be his bride."

","The movie is a disarming view of a local villager from Kazhakstan who is an absolute fool that somehow exposes the most deepest taboos in America, from feminist, evangelists, gays, blacks etc. He shows the dividing country of U.S. stiffness by exposing his own sense of cultural stupidity. This is one of those rare gems that should exposed America's deepest problems a long time a go and that the idea of ""political correctness"" and liberalism is just a pie in the sky. Done quite well in the style of Monty Pythons' movie and a pure comedic movie that I wish should earn an academy award for its disarming honesty - a rare trait in these times and something that should have been done a long long time ago. Only All in the Family came close, but that was just a lip service, here we see a cultural shock, U.S. cultural shock rather than the other way around. Brilliant and unique in its approach, and likely to be of a cult movie in years to come."

Pamala Anderson...sure she is having some problems in her personal life but this will no doubt revive her career.

"peteratyeo1989","9","0","8","17 December 2006"," This is funny, get some damn perspective!
","Firstly I would like to say that sometimes I genuinely worry about the world today. I admit that I went to see this film with very low expectations, I thought that this film was going to be, quite simply, a typical ""American"" comedy*, and yet, I still went to see it. This is because I am not so full of myself that I can't enjoy a film for what it is. A bloody good laugh! Not everything has to be deep and meaningful. As I've said above get some perspective, ITS JUST A FILM!<br/><br/>*slightly slap stick with little or no respect for subtlety or wit (no offence, this is sweeping but far from applies to all American comedies) <br/><br/>I take media studies and am therefore required to suffer such ""classic"" films as Citizen Cain week after week and I can tell you now that some mindless entertainment can go a long way. I believe that many of the people that claim that they are the only real film fans because they can appreciate such films only say it for affect. They're just another of the unwashed mass that really just wants to enjoy a die hard film once in a while. The same group of people that make it so that I cant go into a restaurant without having to order something I wouldn't want to pronounce let alone eat.<br/><br/>Films are not a status symbol, just watch what you want and let others do the same.<br/><br/>sigh anyway my main point is that many of the people that claim to not find the punch lines funny appear to have missed the joke all together. I didn't find that the joke was Borat (the ignorant foreigner) not understanding the complexities of America. The joke is at the expense of those he meets. Not because they're female or Jewish but because by putting the person in front of someone that appears ignorant, you allow that person to expose themselves and their own ignorance and that's exactly what happens, at one stage he even convinces a car dealer to tell him what car is best for running over gypsies. If anything, you're upset because the joke is at your expense, and mine, normal people and they're perceptions of others. Sasha is a very clever man and I would say that this definitely comes through in the film. Comic Genius!"
"butterflyamy7575","10","0","13","15 December 2006"," Outstanding!
","I think it's a lot of fun that this movie either seems to get a 10 or a 1. I can totally understand it. You either get it or you don't. If you take it seriously, you will be offended. However, if you are willing to watch the movie realizing that it is exposing people for who they REALLY are (sometimes positive, sometimes not so much), you will probably enjoy it. Yes, a lot of the characters made ""fools"" of themselves. Some of them I felt a real disgust towards, and to be honest, people with opinions like that deserve what they get. But most of them were sympathetic as well, and I felt that ""Borat"" (not a REAL guy, by the way) treated most of them very nicely. <br/><br/>By the way, here are comments from the sweet Jewish couple that owned the Bed and Breakfast. <br/><br/>""Mariam and Joseph Behar, the proprietors of the kosher bed-and-breakfast, tell Salon that they rented out three rooms to what they thought was a Kazakh documentarian and his film crew. The location had been scouted and photographed, with the Behars' knowledge, prior to the taping. Speaking on the telephone, Joseph, with Mariam chatting in the background, says they saw the film and thought it ""was not anti-Semitic at all. It was outstanding. I think (Sacha Baron Cohen) is a genius."" <br/><br/>So . . .maybe sometimes the rest of us are so ready to jump on the ""P.C."" bandwagon and PROVE we're not racist, sexist, homophobic, etc. that we forget to just relax. Sacha Baron Cohen makes fun of himself more than anyone else, and only people with hate in their hearts come out looking bad. Maybe people who question their own feelings regarding the issues in the film are those who are most offended. The reason it is funny ISN'T because he makes fun of Jews (for example). The reason it's funny is the pure RIDICULOUSNESS of a person who would actually act that way and say those things in public!!! You laugh at the ignorance and idiocy of the man, not because you agree with his statements. <br/><br/>Oh, and btw, the people at the dinner thought it was very funny when they saw the movie, as did the feminists. Even the homophobe at the rodeo wasn't upset with how he was depicted, because that is how he really feels (sad, yes). In fact, the only people who seemed too bothered by their portrayal were the drunk frat boys, and again, they deserve what they get for making those kind of statements. <br/><br/>Finally, the true comic geniuses have never been afraid of controversy. Look at the Marx brothers, Andy Kaufman, Richard Pryor, Bill Hicks . . .these people always pushed the boundaries. Comedy should be dangerous. That's how it changes things. Comedy requires bravery. True pioneers of comedy push buttons, get under people's skin, and cause chaos and controversy. Thumbs up for people like Cohen. If they disappear, we're left with mediocrity."
"Chris Knipp","7","0","4","14 December 2006"," A cutting edge that's pretty soft
","Borat is a film-length foray into character-driven shock humor. From reports, in real life there's something quite harmless and sweet about its star, Shasha Baron Cohen, a tall, thin Jewish comic from England who adopts satiric personas. But once behind one of his masks, he acquires enormous chutzpah. As Borat, Cohen becomes a mustachioed, in-your-face TV reporter from Kazakhstan who naively and freely pursues pornography and sex and indulges his taste for scatological humor and his sexism, homophobia and anti-Semitism. Needless to say, Sasha Baron Cohen doesn't share these ideas and tendencies. He's an Oxbridge history man who did graduate work on Jewish involvement in the American civil rights movement. In this movie, Borat goes to America with a fat aide (Ken Davitian), and presumably a cameraman, and has a series of filmed meetings with locals. <br/><br/>What's additionally of note -- and this is essential to Cohen's working method as a comic --is that these sequences involve real people in actual situations who've agreed to appear on camera but are unaware they're being used as the butt of a joke. Many of them are good humored or clueless about being duped but some are not. Strangers on the New York subway repel ""Borat's"" efforts to kiss them on both cheeks and a group of polite diners disburse rapidly when he brings a black prostitute to the table uninvited. But Borat shows that in today's America a bigot with weird manners can seduce you at first if he has a tidy mustache, a glib smile and a prepossessing appearance. Revivalist Christians speaking in tongues welcome him, and so do some drunken frat boys, who agree they want to wipe out all homosexuals too. At times his feigned bigotry brings out the bigotry of others.<br/><br/>Cohen's Borat is a boor-naïf, probably the only kind of boor this basically gentle comic could assimilate. The mean, knowing ones are more dangerous. Cohen lacks the 'savage indignation"" of a powerful satirist like Swift. But what Cohen may be getting at is the danger of apathy and passive ignorance -- the way a person without an awareness of malicious intent can do harm by being a conduit for bigotry, or just looking the other way. He's said in an interview that he's fascinated, if horrified, by the idea that ""the path to Auschwitz was paved with indifference."" <br/><br/>The path to Borat the film is paved with the best of intentions, and to judge by the extremely positive critical reaction to his (and Larry Charles's) movie from public and critics alike, those intentions have been well received. But though Cohen may be sensitive, intelligent, and sophisticated, his humor is crude, made up of things like talking about excretion at the dinner table; soul-kissing a woman who he then announces is his sister and the best prostitute in town. The way homophobes and Jew-haters are made fun of makes you wonder if anybody intelligent enough to watch this movie and grasp its ulterior motive -- to agitate for compassion  needs these messages. Along with the laughs comes an easy self-satisfaction. Does this take us anywhere? And Cohen's depiction of Borat's home village in Kazakhstan is heavy with its own bigotry and condescension. <br/><br/>How does Kazakhstan feel about all this? Unless the New York Times and other big media are victims of another one of Cohen's hoaxes, a top Kazakhstan official has just declared the country indebted to the movie: ""any publicity is good publicity,"" he's said, inviting Cohen to visit his country (to which the comic has never been). Ultimately the movie, though widely celebrated as ""hysterically funny,"" isn't very smart. It's bold, and numerous lawsuits against the filmmakers by their previously willing dupes are a tribute to that; but its ""originality"" is restricted to saying the unmentionable, like a pubescent boy trying to impress his buddies, or all the post-pubescent boys who enjoy Jackass or Ashton Kutcher's ""Punk'd"" or the National Lampoon. The whole idea goes back forty years or so to ""Candid Camera."" Maybe the reason why Borat has been so well reviewed is that this isn't a stellar cinematic year. The critics are just a bit desperate. But the peculiar circumstances of Cohen's and Charles's film-making are something one would like to know more about. It appears they're making fun of the naivety of Americans, not just of bigots, but his working method simply takes advantage of how polite people are  especially when then know they're being filmed."

All the way through, it is one shocking, bazaar scene after another. Despite showing our ignorance, as a Southerner, I actually wasn't offended at how he portrayed us. OK, so we know so little about the world that we think Kazakhstan is so primitive that they don't know how to use toilet paper, and use a sack to wrap their droppings and don't know where to dispose of it. But, you have to admit, the people throughout the South were very polite, very hospitable. The Southern Jews seemed like very nice people. It took bringing a prostitute to get him kicked out of the dinner party, and even when he kissed a man at the rodeo, the man politely explained to him that that sort of thing isn't done here, unless, well, you know. Wait until you see how the black rappers treat him.<br/><br/>I should warn you though, there is a very disturbing scene with two naked guys fighting and crawling all over each other. You can imagine what they can do with that, but its best not to. Yeah, that about made me vomit.<br/><br/>After laughing and being disgusted, I can't deny how brilliant and unique this is.

But then as I head home, I stop and try and figure out why even that rarest of breeds, the entertaining new Hollywood film, leaves me wishing I hadn't enjoyed it so much. Borat, the absurd but hilarious tale of a bigoted chauvinist Kazakh immigrant's quest to marry Pamela Anderson while filming a discover-America documentary for his homeland, triumphs at the box office, and earns the raves of critics across the board. This in a society which has recently added diversity to the noble virtues of truth, justice, freedom, equality etc. But...this is now also a society where double standards of acceptability have become the norm when observing race relations. One group can at the expense of another make merry, where another group most certainly cannot. Herein lies Borat'a winning secret. For Borat perfectly demonstrates and even perfects this weird phenomenon of inequity and does it so well that at first glance, it's hypocrisy is virtually transparent. Borat's Archie Bunker like prejudices seem to be aimed at all creeds equally, and in fact, for Borat the character, it holds true. Yet, look closer and you see that this is not so for Borat the movie. The film is by no means innocent of prejudice any more than its main character is, as we see the same tired modern stereotypes lurking not particularly far beneath an 'everyone is fair game' veneer. The same groups we have become accustomed and even inured to see lampooned and actually insulted get their usual treatment in this film. While with equal predictability, other groups are elevated from misunderstood victims of prejudice straight up to goodness personified, which by this movie's standards is tantamount to beatification. Borat makes it quite clear that for whatever the reasons, racial and ethnic jokes can still be surefire laugh-getters even in todays politically airtight environment provided that said jokes are delivered by an ignoramus and also and more importantly provided that in the end, the 'right' people get the last laugh. Disagree? Why not ask Seinfeld instant has-been Mike 'Kramer' Richards, who's very own Borat impersonation and subsequent circus/apology/coup de grace public execution, was Hollywood's politically insane and all too expectedly difficult to digest contribution to the American Thanksgiving table this year. Yet the million dollar question remains; Just who exactly has the right of decision in this magnificent quandary we've built for ourselves?

","Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan, starring Sacha Baron Cohen as the title character, is becoming one of the most talked about movies of the year. Borat, one of the three characters from Cohen's Da Ali G Show, is a completely naive and moronic character that Cohen plays with so much conviction that it's actually scary. One even wonders whether Cohen is a genius or a madman.<br/><br/>Borat is directed by Larry Charles, whose previous efforts were the disappointing Bob Dylan vehicle, Masked and Anonymous, and several episodes of Curb Your Enthusiasm. All these projects had major creative input by their respective stars, Bob Dylan, and Larry David, as does his new film.<br/><br/>Shot in a mockumentary-style, the film chronicles Kazakh reporter Borat and his overweight producer (Ken Davitian) in their adventures in the ""U.S. and A."" They are sent to create a documentary about our globalizing culture. However, Borat quickly falls in love with Pamela Anderson after seeing her on a rerun of Baywatch, and the plot ultimately turns into Borat's quest to California to marry Anderson. What's interesting is that Cohen, a Jew, is actually speaking a combination of Hebrew and Yiddish with a Polish accent in his subtitled mumblings. The film's plot is very weak. However, it's extremely doubtful that anyone in the audience would actually care, as they would be too busy laughing hysterically.<br/><br/>Cohen finds humor in the reactions of everyday people in response to Borat's antics and candid inquiries. Cohen seems to never stop, as the movie is basically funny the whole way through. Cohen and Charles even accomplish the unthinkable in this film by creating sympathy for such a repulsive and clueless character. Completely broke, lonely and out of gas, Borat creates a fire for himself outside a building, and one actually feels sorry for him. Though Borat appears like such a despicable character, in reality, he is far too moronic to hate.<br/><br/>Cohen might actually be making a statement concerning racism with this film, because beyond his tongue-in-cheek shtick, Borat unknowingly reveals what kinds of people are actually out there, the nice, along with the bigots and sexists.<br/><br/>Even Borat himself proclaims he hates gays and Jews, but it becomes apparent that he has never even met either until his voyage into America. The bottom line is, no matter how stupid the plot is, and how politically incorrect it may be, this movie is completely hilarious all the way through."

","ALthough people are complainig that the movie is offensive to both Khazaks and jews but the real joke is on the Americans. The film highlights the American people's stupid views and to watch the way they react is both funny and very intriguing. The bit that amazed me the most was when Borat was at the dinning club and the snobby woman said ""i'm sure it wouldn't take long for him to be totally americanized"" y wud he want to b ""americanised"". y do Americans assume every1 wants to be like them and why do they feel the need to change every1 into them? the real joke is on the Americans and i personally though this was one of the funiest points in the movie.<br/><br/>""I like you,I like sex, Is NICE!!!"""

","It's hard to tell someone else what's funny and what isn't.<br/><br/>For me, I found that only about 15% of the movie got me to actually laugh. But that's not too bad because I almost never laugh in movies. Plus, in that 15% were some very funny and memorable moments.<br/><br/>The movie is basically done as a travel log documentary of a fictitious Kazakhstan TV reporter (Borat) who travels to the United States. In the movie we watch his crude mannerisms and commentaries emerge with unsuspecting interviewees. This is where most of the humor comes from.<br/><br/>Borat interviews / interacts with personalities ranging from evangelists and cowboys to etiquette coaches and gun dealers.<br/><br/>For me, most of the jokes were misfires or familiar, predictable scenarios (esp. if you've seen the 'Ali G' TV series). However, in the areas where the skits did succeed - well, it's hard to put a value on a good laugh. I would describe the humor as crude - but creative and fresh as well.<br/><br/>Be forewarned - there is a lot of material that deals with areas like racism, gender-bashing and homosexuality. Depending on how it comes across to you, it will be either vile and offensive or humorous social commentary.<br/><br/>See this movie with a friend - sharing / recalling funny moments from the movie is a fun way to spend some time afterwards."

","Borat film is good for United States and America. Peoples make fannies even though Borat has no fanny sometime. For to make smile me and peoples under me. Nasty Borat is sometimes peoples all circle the world. Is nice to see make fanny of selfs. Helps to make for understand good peoples. I hope Borat not execute. Abortion not for him bring him to us. Execute for to do Borat not good. May the butterfly of paradise fly up you... Children's may not understand Borat fannies. Some adults and politicians do understand Borat fannies. Borat sees United States and America from end-to-end but did not see Pamela Anderson's end. Perhaps Borat come again United States and America and begin with the end first. Chatpah!"

","i saw this movie last night with a couple of my friends, and one of my friends mom. from start to finish we could not stop laughing and neither could anyone else. this movie was so great i couldn't even begin to explain. Sasha Baron Cohen gives America his funniest role as Borat, a Kazakhstan news reporter traveling through America to teach people of Kazakhstan what life is like in America. this movie is truly the funniest movie i've seen in a while (and believe me i've seen a lot of movies). i definitely guarantee anyone that sees this movie will laugh their ass off. but you might not want to see this movie with one of your parents considering awkwardness would follow you for the rest of your life."
"Stampsfightclub","6","0","6","9 November 2006"," Controversial, unfunny but amazingly issues driven black comedy
","spoilers maybe.<br/><br/>The narrative.<br/><br/>Shot from a biography perspective, the Ali G actor Cohen travels to America to film his life as an American. The film definitely fulfils the black comedy genre with many racist, gay, sexist and nationality jokes, prompting controversy into current society issues. It is slow moving with many repetitive jokes. Short scenes are used to make it simplistic but it's perhaps too basic and needed a bit more.<br/><br/>The direction is interesting with many captivating shots of the travelling Borat.<br/><br/>It is poorly constructed unfortunately and if it had more realistic context and laughable jokes it would have been outstanding because the preaching on different issues was outstanding. The 'dream' of Borat's is definitely superficial and never realistic at all, especially the ending. The jokes are repetitive and poor, mainly jokes against Americans and Kazakhstan. Physical humour is often encoded but is often more disgusting than funny.<br/><br/>Culture.<br/><br/>The film is definitely engaging with many issues about different cultures, genders and religions encoded to emphasise society as it currently is.<br/><br/>Borat also presents an in-depth view of what, quite possibly, how Kazakhstan residents act and if so, is presenting them in a negative light, bar the ending maybe, making them appear slightly mad. The film is controversial for the way it represent Kazakhstan, as a poor Country but has more love values to their names. They are juxtaposed with American citizens and lives. The part on the train is especially interesting, showing Americans as exceptionally rude people. Is the film trying to preach, to make them stop being cruel to people with different social values? It certainly appears it throughout as Borat meets new people and present his take on life and acts in a way that is normal to him, e.g. kissing strangers.<br/><br/>I believe the film is tying to establish that there is currently something wrong in America, why? It appears to be the way society currently appears. By encoding a stranger into the country allows a view of what other nationalities will think of the country.<br/><br/>i give it such a low mark for the horrid humour mainly. the acting too is poor. context wise.. possibly realistic but i didn't see it, especially the ending.<br/><br/>watch it if...you like lame jokes with no meaning at the end of the day, issues surrounding different religions, cultures etc"
"jokercard88","7","0","3","8 November 2006"," um... so what if it's funny
","Um... So what if it's funny. The humor is only based on him being a outlander and it isn't clever (save a couple laughs like **him jerking off outside of Victoria's secret**). However, the plot is nearly nonexistent. The noticeable plot links involve **giving up on marrying Pamela Anderson and being broke in the streets of California for one day (both underdone and clichÃ©).** And as for the fortunately (yet slightly) edited climax it wasn't funny and it creeped me out.....but granted it WAS pretty funny to the point of redemption. The comedy suceeded in keeping from getting old. The narrative was alright and I did keep my expectations high for a thirty minute period (about the middle for when my judgement starts kicking in. Should've seen THE PRESTIGE or FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS and just rented Borat."
"bedfordholdings","7","0","3","8 November 2006"," Funny, funny, and then some not so funny
","Sasha has mixed many moments of humorous genius with some that should have been taken out of the oven and thrown onto the editing room floor as just too much...the hotel room wrestling scene and some others. What arouses my curiosity is the lack of acknowledgment in the credits or elsewhere as to the contribution to the film made by seemingly ordinary citizens such as the Southern hospitality group, the alleged Jewish Bed & Breakfast couple...and even our good friend Pamela Anderson.....was that all real? was it staged? what was it? and why no acknowledgments? Overall... Borat is timely...outrageously funny at times...and recommended for infusions of caustic humor in an otherwise over-serious world."

","I see that a lot of people have written many good things about this film so I cant say more... All I want to say is GO and watch it and after years to come you ll tell your children or grandchildren ... ""Yes grandson...

I believe you guys don't have a sense of humour u must be nerds or something.. Cant explain it. Borat makes fun and gives a message to the American culture and people who think that he is making fun of the Jews.... u are all wrong! It is the opposite, and I m no Jews, instead I dislike Jews people. A must see film probably the best comedy of all time with several todays life messages. 10/10 definitely"
"borrln","6","0","3","7 November 2006"," Good film but missing a little bit of atmosphere.
","I watched this film yesterday after a great deal of expectation and found myself laughing at a lot of the jokes because I felt I had to. I was slightly disappointed and the film just seemed a bit of an extension to an existing formula. A bit of slapstick and a bit of humour and several embarrassing situations for Borat and the people who he involves in his visit to the ""U S and A!"" I felt that the cause of this was probably because I had this expectation from watching the trailers and seeing Borat on TV a lot it would be a film that I would be constantly laughing as many of the reviews stated.<br/><br/>However, this was not the case for me. It was a quiet cinema which lacked a lot of atmosphere, so it might have to do with the people you watch the film with. But overall I expected a bit more from the film.<br/><br/>I would recommend that people go and watch this film, as it may just be the case that it is dependent on your mood and of those people around you!"
"ljarsonbeck-1","6","0","2","6 November 2006"," funny but not worth owning
","Despite all the hype this movie is very funny in parts with a not so new approach to making a movie or comedy sketch- the unwitting victim or the inside joke. Candid camera did a solid job most of the time while others like Andy Kauffman failed miserably (I found Kauffman uncomfortable to watch). Saccha Cohen does a much stronger job of the put on, some visuals are in fact inspired, however I don't honestly think many of the people on the screen were out of the loop in terms of the punchline. There were too many camera angels in spaces where a camera would be too conspicuous. Also many characters are in fact character actors and the entire scene with Pamela Anderson is unrealistic if it were not a put on. Now the fact that it is not completely unscripted is fine with me (just as Blair Witch was not really a lost student film) however because of this Cohen turns a film seemingly about American culture vs third world culture into a long journey about finding real love over infatuation. It is just so uneven- so much of the film is about culture clash that he completely missed the point of his own premise. Yes this is a funny film yes some parts are very funny but after you've seen it there is nothing extra to make you want to see it over and over. Cohen could have added a bold observation like CRASH or taken us on a journey for love (instead of Americans looking for internet brides we have a 3rd world man looking for an American bride) but instead he takes us from 60 to 0 in 2.1 seconds. It's not that I didn't like the film I just didn't love it."
"opulentus7","6","0","5","6 November 2006"," More of the same stuff rolled into under 1.5 hours.
","I AM a Borat fan but this is pretty much the same type of humor he does with his smaller clips on Da Ali G Show. I did like the movie though. Scripted for over an hour's endurance, just think of some of his smaller clips with variances of Borat's humor rolled into one. The only real difference is that in the movie, he had a sidekick touring with him throughout the U.S. and A. Sascha Baron Cohen a.k.a. Borat/Ali G did a little better putting together his Ali G movie. New characters (plus more inside Ali G's character), gangsters, skits and an actual storyline is what made the movie. As for Borat? Come on Sascha. Put something together with a little more story and a little more shocking this time... I look forward to it."
"schmelmiphartz","8","0","4","6 November 2006"," A man dedicated to his craft, but...
","All of its flaws aside, ""Borat"" was an enjoyable 90 minutes and is worth dropping $10 to see, but buyer beware.<br/><br/>Sacha Baron Cohen's dedication to his craft is most obvious in the fight scene with ""Azamat,"" but be warned: this movie is not for those who are easily offended. If the sex, nudity, racism, or religious mockery doesn't offend you, perhaps the toilet humor will.<br/><br/>This is why I cannot give this movie 10/10. While it is certainly good for a laugh, there is no ""wit"" behind the offensive nature of the film. Recent films like ""Team America: World Police"" and ""Idiocracy"" did a much better job of adding significance to the offensive nature of their humor. Some might say that the significance of the humor in ""Borat"" is to display the ignorance of Middle-America, but any idiot should be able to distinguish that much of it is extremely exaggerated or fabricated.<br/><br/>With that said, I do recommend you see this movie. It's VERY funny and Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius. BUT - do not make the mistake of calling it anything other than just a funny movie. This is not the way people from Kazakhstan behave. This is not the way most Americans behave. It is not a poignant commentary on either the state of affairs in the U.S. or in Kazakhstan.<br/><br/>Please do not prove me wrong by attempting to make some sense out of the madness that is ""Borat.""<br/><br/>Ladies and Gentlemen, my edit...I was so amused by this film, I decided to see it a second time and I have a couple of things to say. First, yes, Borat did lose a bit of his luster. Second, when are we going to see a ""retard"" fat, loud, American tourist go to Europe and make fun of them? I think it's LONG overdue."
"jed-estes","7","0","4","6 November 2006"," Funny
","This movie had many laughs and it made me feel gross for watching it a couple of times to, but that is what you knew you were getting into when you sat down to watch this. For my generation, people 15 to 35 this movie is awesome, but for people over or under that age this movie I am almost sure would not play well. I had a good time tho. I however did find there to be to many genitalia shots. But since most films avoid that I guess it is okay. I can also see how Jewish people would be offended as it goes a little far with that joke, but not being a Jew I was able to laugh, maybe that is wrong I don't know. All in all this is a fine edgy film, just know what your getting into beforehand."
"lorenckoci","7","0","2","6 November 2006"," Chaplin of Modern Times
","I must say I'm a great fan of Borat, despite the fact that i came to see him only recently. I liked the Movie despite the fact that I expected myself to laugh all the time. Instead, some parts of it made me really sad- - i still think that he is a genius in terms of understating the nationalistic and ego-massaging nature of state propaganda (""all other potassium is inferior"") in the Newly independent states. On the other side i liked how he plays around with the 'ingorance' of the west about the 'backwardness' of the east. What makes him funny is that he drags it to the extreme, yet being earnest but not brainwashed. Cohen tries to establish himself as a contemporary Chaplin and in many ways the parallelism between the characters is there: like both are Jewish comedians portraying a totally naive character and his adventures.The character has a very specific, almost idiotic body language. The only difference is that Chaplin was mute and black-and-white."
