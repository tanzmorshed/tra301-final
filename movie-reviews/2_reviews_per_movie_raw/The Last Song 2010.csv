"Organic_6","1","377","522","30 March 2010"," Miley's most honest display of human emotion since deleting her Twitter account.
","Most writers would sell out by repeatedly writing screenplays that are vastly different from one another. Take Christopher Nolan for example; going from a psychological thriller where the storyline is paced backwards to an Oscar-winning blockbuster in which a world renowned superhero faces off his arch nemesis. Talk about a lack of consistency. A true writer gracefully keeps revisiting the same story over and over and OVER again and a great example for that kind of writer is Nicholas Sparks.<br/><br/>If recycling is healthy for our environment, it has to be with movies too, right? Never before has this man forgotten to add a romantic scene at the beach of an Eastern Seaboard sunset where two lovers mutely stare at one another. And who else can gorgeously stir up a tear-inducing ending as much as he? Forget 500 Days of Summer trying to explore the complexities of falling in love with a Hall and Oates dance sequence and an Expectations vs. Reality analysis. Instead he always remembers to kill off a protagonist at the end. M. Night Shyamalan calls HIMSELF the master of unpredictable twists? Puh-lease! Mr. Sparks's death sequences are so surprising, that you could almost say they're completely unrelated to the genre that the previous two hours were aiming to be.<br/><br/>And when a movie like Precious thinks its portrayal of a teenage girl in emotional turmoil is accurate, it's alarmingly mistaken. There, the leading lady is impregnated by her own dad, sadistically beaten down by her mother, all while dealing with obesity and illiteracy on a daily basis. Ha! Like THAT happens in real life. It's really the Last Song's Ronnie who deserves our sympathy. I mean, she has to spend the entire summer in an intimidatingly adorable Georgia beach house, embrace the pressure of getting accepted into one of the country's most respected art schools and endure the creepy smile of her overly kind father. Now that's plausible drama – I only wish I had the guts to sullenly disregard MY dad whenever he greets me with genuine concern. This vision of teen angst fantastically brought to life by none other than Miley Cyrus.<br/><br/>Now there are those jealous haters out there, determined to bring her acting career down. But they don't understand the effort it takes from a performer to purse your lips and cross your arms for 90% of a film. Like me and my fellow Miley fans said – she's just playing herself. It's really those hacks like Johnny Depp and Meryl Streep who are destroying everything classic cinema stood for. Who do they think they are to disappear into the heart and soul of characters they don't relate to or resemble in reality? When I'm watching a character on screen, I want to see the actor playing them. That's what made the most recent, Valentine's Day, so brilliant was that I could watch Jessica Alba being Jessica Alba the whole time yet grow blissfully unaware to her character's traits, abilities...heck, I couldn't even remember her name.<br/><br/>And mad props go out to Greg Kinnear in the role of a lifetime as the ""antagonistic"" father. A previous family drama of his called Little Miss Sunshine featured too much family and likedrama. It acted like each member had their own ambition and obstacle to deal with at the same time. What a load! This movie knows better, rather by making every other character's problems bow down to Ronnie's. In the Last Song, he delivers this performance, deserving the praise that Mo'Nique received playing Mary Jones. Never mind the fact Ronnie frequently shoplifts and snubs Julliard just to make a point. It's really him who's to blame for everything. How dare you fall out of love and pursue a career that makes you happy, only to have the audacity to want to mend the wounds of your broken hearted family? I rooted throughout for Ronnie as she continuously tried to reconstruct the layers of guilt and avoidance upon his shoulders. That leads me to my one grievance of this movie; a rebellious teenage girl visiting her estranged dad and blames one of her separated parents for breaking the family apart. Really Nick? That's all just too unfamiliar of a premise for me. At best, the closest Ronnie ever came to resembling a character from one of your previous features was Diane Keaton's daughter from Nights in Rodanthe (pauses) Ohhh!"
"blueeyedbeauty776","1","181","267","31 March 2010"," Waste of time and money
","I'll admit I was excited at first to see this movie. I had just finished the book a couple days ago and was psyched to see such an incredible book brought to the theater. The book was amazing: funny, romantic, sad, cheerful, pretty much everything you could want in a book. Well, everything that made the book great was taken out in this appallingly horrible movie. It felt torturous to watch what with Miley Cyrus absolutely slaughtering the character of Ronnie. After finishing the book, I realized I couldn't see her as the character, but I figured she couldn't be too horrible. Oh how wrong I was.<br/><br/>I didn't believe Miley Cyrus for a second during the real pivotal scenes in the movie. Her tears/crying scenes were laughable. Her attitude problem phase was obnoxious. The only relationship I believed was the one between her and the guy and that's because they're dating off screen. Oh how difficult it must be to act like you're in love with you're real life boyfriend. I wouldn't even call her performance mediocre.<br/><br/>And then comes the fact that this movie didn't even somewhat resemble the book. They took out the best scenes. They changed nearly EVERYTHING. They cut the preacher and the important back-story of her father. They didn't introduce the slightly similar sub plot with Scott very well at ALL. It was hinted at throughout the book, but in the movie it was sudden and not very well done at all. Actually, the majority of the scenes were done opposite of how they were done in the book, making them really bad.<br/><br/>Scott was more important in the book. Marcus was WAY more important in the book and he was one of those characters that was really kind of creepy. He was supposed to be a sociopath in the book, but in the movie he was just an annoying jerk. <br/><br/>They completely changed Ronnie's reasoning,the reason Will fell for Ronnie, and many more things. In the book they really showed how Ronnie was different than other girls. In this movie,Miley Cyrus made Ronnie seem like every other girl but with an attitudeproblem. Miley played her as such a clingy, needy girl instead of the independent, self-assured, and intelligent girl she was.<br/><br/>Then again, they changed more than they kept. If you want to know the GOOD story of The Last Song, do yourself a favor and buy the book. This movie wasn't worth the time and money."
"lilholik","4","91","135","3 April 2010"," One thumb down, One as confused as Miley Cyrus
","Alright, first I shall note that I have not read the book. I hadn't even seen a trailer for this film before I had gone. I went with my mother and sister who had both read the book and more than enjoyed it. I really had no idea what this story was even about. I walked in with a completely open mind.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie was wonderful. On almost every account also. Greg Kinnear was amazing in the movie and the boy who played the son I was even impressed with. Miley Cyrus seemed to be the only exception. I hated her acting from the moment the movie began. As the movie went forth, I started to change my mind at times. She had no problem changing it back though. She was so off and on through out the entire film. She looked confused at times and when she actually had to show emotion like anger it was as if she didn't know what to do. But enough of that.<br/><br/>The story at times seemed rushed and misunderstood. Everything was predictable. The portions of the movie where I actually felt as though I was supposed to cry seemed to happen so fast that I felt like I didn't have time to understand how the characters felt. There were major holes in the plot that I still had questions about and it drove me nuts at times. There were a couple of times where I actually felt like I was enjoying it but they came and went quickly also. The whole movie, and please remember that I absolutely knew nothing about this story before hand, I felt like I had nothing to look forward to.<br/><br/>In the end I would say that I wouldn't suggest paying to see this in theaters. I definitely wouldn't buy it on DVD and I probably wouldn't even recommend renting it later. If by some chance you get an opportunity to see it for free and you're curious then go for it. I'd also like to mention that, from what I understand from my mother and my sister, this movie completely differs from the book so don't expect what you've read and definitely don't get to excited for this."
"tylerkaiser","10","50","71","30 May 2010"," Seriously people?!
","Grow up. The only reason why this movie has an average of 3.1 is because of Miley Cyrus. People wont give her a chance and they feel they can only bring her down is by sitting behind a computer screen. But guess what people - I'm sure she don't care! There is people who love this movie, like myself. People are going to watch it and people are going to buy it. So you giving it a 1 star rating is no harm. This movie needs at least a 6 or 7 star rating.<br/><br/>For the people who actually want this real review, this is it. Miley Cyrus isn't that bad, weird facial expressions at time but no harm. It's a really good tear jerker and a good story."
"diogodiassilva","7","24","33","8 May 2010"," This 3.0 star user rating is due to Miley Cyrus haters! Quite great movie!
","That's why sometimes I really should ignore IMDb's ratings! My parents went to see this movie last week and told me to watch it. And so I did it tonight. OK, Miley Cyrus isn't the best actress in the world and she's stuck to the Hanna Montana and so on kind of roles that she did. Even considering that, I don't get why do people hate her this much! She had a quite acceptable performance in this movie. I'd give her a 6/10 stars rate, honestly believing that she'll improve a lot through her life as an actress. BUT WAIT! I really think we should rate this movie considering all the other things that compose it: a well-written and really moving story, an amazing soundtrack, a BRILLIANT Bobby Coleman's performance (WOOW! this kid will get very far in his career!) that almost made me shed a tear, a respectful cast, great landscapes and beautiful scenarios... There were some tiny moments with lack of total sense, and some slight errors of continuity, but totally harmless to the movie itself. Just stop hating the girl like she ruined the movie, because she did not do it at all. (and I swear I'm not a MC fan)<br/><br/>Strongly recommended to watch with your lover!"
"tsmithjr","4","36","53","31 January 2011"," A really poor storyline and poor acting
","Miley Cyrus fans might hate me for saying this, but the makers of ""The Last Song"" should have hired a real actress for the lead role. Miley obviously doesn't have the talent or know how to act. I had nothing against her, but in this, the first role I've seen her act in, it seemed like she was just playing herself and not playing any part that was written for her.<br/><br/>That said, ""The Last Song"" is a bust. It's a set of tired old recycled and clichéd experiences and really isn't worth the 107 minutes it takes to watch it. For the most part the storyline is so tired and old. And after watching it I was also disappointed that Greg Kinnear had signed up for it. That I can remember, I've always liked his acting and the roles he chose. But in this case, the writing was so, so poor that even if the makers of ""The Last Song"" signed up the best actors in Hollywood it couldn't save this film. They'd have to find some writers who were at a minimum mediocre-ish in order to improve this story.<br/><br/>All I can say is save yourself and watch something else."
"goodguy-16","10","31","47","24 July 2010"," How can anybody not be touched by this?
","And how can it have the score of 3.2?<br/><br/>It was one of the most touching and real movies I have ever seen, and I've seen my share of great touching movies (Casablanca, Wuthering Heights, The Notebook, It's A Wonderful Life, Rain Man).<br/><br/>I'm not comparing this movie with the greatest movies of all time, I'm only saying that it has the heart and soul to be a film that you remember and cherish in your heart.<br/><br/>When this world becomes more and more apathetic with each day passing, I think this film brings back the feelings that we forgot and neglected, and that's just not a bad thing.<br/><br/>I give this movie 10/10, because it crawled underneath my skin and into my heart. And that's what a great film supposed to do, in my opinion."
"blackbriar246","4","100","169","2 April 2010"," It was just so..... flat
","I didn't read the book, didn't want to. A bunch of my friends went to go see this movie, and I went with them. There are a few things wrong with this movie. First, Miley Cyrus cannot act. I mean, at all. It's painful to watch. Second, there is no originality. Just mix up a bit Twilight and most of Dear John, and you've got rather predictable The Last Song. Third, the characters. Ronnie is annoying enough without Cyrus, unbearable with her. She was such a brat at the beginning that I felt no pity the rest of the movie. Will makes several idiotic mistakes that cause Ronnie to have another temper tantrum. The little brother is cute, but irritating at times. Overall, this is just a flat, overrated chick flick that has the depth of a Disney Channel movie."
"gradyharp","Null","8","10","6 November 2011"," For Nicholas Sparks Fans
","Nicholas Sparks has found a formula about teenage angst an finding love despite non- supportive parents: from the number of books and films that use his formula it would seem he has hit pay dirt. THE LAST SONG is Sparks' 14th published novel on the same theme as the preceding 13 and was published in 2009. One year later he transformed that sudsy story (with some help from Jeff Van Wie) into another of his formula films and turned it over to TV director Julie Anne Robinson to map out the predictable story.<br/><br/>For a brief outline of the scant story: begin with a divorced family - Ronnie (Miley Cyrus) and her younger brother Jonah (Bobby Coleman) are sent to spend the summer with their father Steve (Greg Kinnear) in an indescribably beautiful waterfront town in Georgia. Ronnie resents her father and has no intention of being friendly or even talking to him for the summer. But after meeting a handsome guy Will Blakelee (Liam Hemsworth) and beginning to fall in love, Ronnie starts rediscovering her love for music, something she shares with her father. Reconnecting with music revives a kinship with her father which proves to be the most important relationship she may ever experience. And there it is. Mix the story with the usual acidic girls in the town who claim Will is a Lothario, overcome that rumor with some all night watches for raccoons who may steal some sea turtle eggs, pop in some father/son meaningful contact, and there you have a Nicholas Sparks formula.<br/><br/>Miley Cyrus is Miley Cyrus - and for fans of Hannah Montana that works well. The light of the film is the screen presence of Liam Hemsworth who looks and acts like someone who will succeed in movies. Otherwise, just be advised that this is another setting for a Nicholas parks familiar story; if that is to your liking you will like this. If not, then pass. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"
"TVfan","1","60","104","19 April 2010"," Where do we start...
","It's been 5 years since I've reviewed a movie on IMDb, but oh... I am compelled! Where do we start? One of the producers has the last name of Cyrus, so I guess that explains a lot. But let's forget Miley's ""acting"" and address the story itself. I've always thought Sparks overuses death to illicit emotion in his readers/viewers (even though The Notebook and Message in a Bottle are two of my favorite films). But that aside, was there a single un-contrived moment in this film? They (whoever ""they"" is) tried to squeeze every type of plot device imaginable into this movie. So many cliché conflicts going on, I laughed more times than I can count. Hope I didn't disturb the other two people (both teen-aged girls) in the theater. However, hats off to Kinnear for an honest performance."
"ifuseekkody","10","25","40","25 April 2010"," Goodbye Hannah Montana - Hello Miley!
","The Last Song is a great movie. It is a coming of age movie but not just a chick flick. All family members will enjoy this movie. Miley Cyrus plays a somewhat troubled teen and blames her troubles on her parents divorce. Her attitude quickly takes a turn when she falls in love and even more of a turn when she finds out that her father is dying with lung cancer. Take a box of tissues to the theatre. Miley plays this dramatic role very well.<br/><br/>In this movie you will be introduced to turtle eggs and you will see them crawl back to the ocean when they hatch. I think this is interesting for children of all ages to watch.<br/><br/>Go watch this movie and go as a family. We don't get many of these type movies so make it a family day and go. You won't be sorry.<br/><br/>Although some young children are upset that the series Hannah Montana has ended, I have to say I am glad. Miley Cyrus has so much more to offer to the entertainment business than her role as Hannah Montana. I think we will see her in many, many, more movies."

","OK. I'll be honest. I am a 19 year old guy who went to see this with a few on my friends(18 years old) and we enjoyed it immensely. Haha. I am quite fond of Mileys little poppy catchy songs(and I like hard rock music, go figure!) I was singing along with my friends and we just had fun. Thats what this movie is about, just have fun with it. The movie was pretty good. Just plain fun. Though, my one issue is I really do not like how Disney exploits its stars at all. But none the less, the movie was just fun. :D Any little Hannah Montana/Miley Cyrus fan will be fond of this, to bad its not in theaters anymore(even though this was Disney just trying to make more millions of its produce i.e-Hannah Montana/Miley Cyrus)."
"kuromicherri55","3","34","57","1 April 2010"," A very pointless and inconsistent movie overall. Biggest problem: plot. Or lack thereof.
","I just saw this movie today with a friend. Let me start off by saying I'm totally impartial toward Miley Cyrus b/c I think a lot of bad reviews on this movie will only make a point of how bad she is. I really didn't find this to be the case. Honestly, the problem with this movie lies in the story. It was very random from start to finish (as my friend pointed out, starting off slowly and then rushing sloppily to an end to try to tie things together) and had very expected 'twists'. During the whole movie, my friend and I kept predicting the next sequence of events. {The perfect 'everyone's-together-Dad-finally-accepted-my-boyfriend' scene: i turn to my friend, ""someone's going to die"". Dad gets up: my friend says ""oh, something's gonna happen to him"", the fact that Will ends up considering Columbia, that they end up together, etc. etc.} Also, this was full of clichés {the fact that Ronnie believed whatever the stupid blonde girl told her and then got all angry with Will for it on a dime, the separated couple gets back together, a child is resentful and rebellious over her parents' divorce, there's a character who's filthy rich but still has problems in his life--all big shocks} And so many random parts of the plot. For instance, Will lost his brother. We can already tell from his mother that his family/life isn't perfect. Why did they even need that? I mean, his father only mentions that brother once during dinner with Ronnie I think. It was very useless to me. And the way that Will was actually connected to the church fire thing through his friend and that's why the stained-glass window is so important and also what eventually causes Ronnie to reject Will was SO sloppily done. It was as if everything was supposed to be connected but it just came out jumbled and messy. THEN we have Ronnie and the acting. I don't blame Miley Cyrus. I don't blame *any* of the actors. Their lines were horrible and awkward. Their emotional ranges were so random I couldn't get in tune with any of the characters. The actors were so close to fitting the molds of their characters but then something would happen and it would get awkward again. And the way they had Ronnie transition from 'rebellious' to softened was choppy and strange. The actors did what they could with their dialogue and characters but in my opinion this was just badly written. I did cry at the end b/c they really do pull at your emotions, what with the song and the light and close-ups of the brother crying, it was hard to watch. But the whole time I was thinking ""this really is a bad movie"". And that's how I left. Feeling that I had just seen a bad movie. What I will say is that I at least appreciated the acting (making due with those choppy scenes) and a few transition techniques of some scenery shots which were actually quite beautiful and artistic. The highlights were definitely just the settings and scenery, as well as Cyrus' piano playing. But not a movie I'd recommend. Just skip it."
"katie-joy","6","40","69","31 March 2010"," 'Last Song' hits some good notes, misses others
","Enter Veronica 'Ronnie' Miller, a recently graduated seventeen-year-old with an attitude problem, divorced parents, a fresh shoplifting arrest and combat boots. When Ronnie is sent from New York to Georgia to live with her dad for the summer, she is less than thrilled and at first resists letting anyone in.<br/><br/>Enter Will Blakelee, a rich small town 'hunk' (if you will), with volleyball skill and charm. Not exactly a rebellious teen aged girl's cup of tea, right? Well... not quite.<br/><br/>Ronnie, played by Disney's princess Miley Cyrus, seems set not falling for anyone over the summer. But she ends up doing the opposite. Will's (Liam Hemsworth, Australian newbie) consistency pays off after just a couple of run-ins. He's writing 'Forever' on Ronnie's converse and playfully pushing her into the ocean before she even comes to fairly good terms with her piano-playing father, Steve. (Greg Kinnear) The fast pace relationship was sweet, considering it's between teenagers. Nothing like cliché summer romance, huh? If only there was more depth to the relationship... (not counting Will's secretly damaged family, and Ronnie's dramatic anger towards her dad) ... then maybe it would have been a more successful movie as a whole.<br/><br/>I'm not going to blame Cyrus' ability to act (or maybe lack thereof) on the low points of the film. I'll actually give it to her, she did a nice job transitioning from little miss Hannah Montana to a darker, not as tween-based character. There is always room for improvement, however, as she seems to get bored of her alter ego throughout the film. But all in all, I did find her likable for the most part.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, I cannot really complain or bash The Last Song. It was a debut in a lot of ways... Julie Anne Robinson's directorial debut, Nicholas Spark writing a screenplay debut, and Miley's debut as someone other than Hannah. So, cut it some slack. Excuse the sometimes cheesy moments and keep your mind open.<br/><br/>6/10, Not too shabby."
"katelawrence95-706-155815","2","28","48","7 April 2010"," Amazingly awful
","Well, I am a pretty big book worm, so when I found out that this was being made into a movie, I made an effort to read the book. I'd already read a few of Nicholas Sparks' books, and their adaptations were typical - missing plot lines etc. - but surprisingly good. But this book was incredible. The plot lines showed major attention to detail, and the twists and turns that this writer takes you on are so convincing.<br/><br/>But enough about the amazing book. Let's just say, my positivity basically ends there. Because the movie was horrible. I was pretty convinced when it began that it would turn out to be a good movie, but as soon as Miley Cyrus appears on the screen, it turns for the worst.<br/><br/>Miley Cyrus just doesn't fit the part. She doesn't actually make an effort to fit into the shoes of Ronnie Miller. Ronnie, in the book, is hardly Miss. Princess, and neither is the character that Miley chooses to play, but there is a huge difference between the two. But overall, I just don't think that she's actually capable of playing a character as deep as Ronnie. And it looks as though she hasn't actually tried.<br/><br/>I give positive reviews for the brother Jonah, and the father. Jonah was quirky and funny without being too dumb. He was funny at the right times and serious at the right times. I thought that the father definitely portrayed the character in the book to a really good standard. In both the book and the movie, these two have a really good bond, and I'm glad to see that this has been maintained.<br/><br/>Now, Marcus and his crew are hardly featured in the movie, which is a real letdown. In the book, Marcus basically stalks Ronnie, but in the movie, he is barely even featured. Blaze is pretty good, but they definitely could have involved her more.<br/><br/>Will, played by Liam Hemsworth, was pretty good, I found. I'm probably a bit biased seeing that I'm an Aussie myself, but as soon as he spoke, I was a bit sad. Most Aussie actors these days ditch their rightful accent, and the only time where I noticed his was when he tried to sing. I suppose you can't keep it out all the time. The way he played Will was... alright. Not brilliant, but probably better than his gf.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie lacked the feeling of the book, as it left out major scenes and plots. It was a real letdown, because I walked into the cinema expecting an experience true to the book, and if it had been, it would have been absolutely amazing.<br/><br/>But without a doubt, this was amazingly awful. My only advice - sit down and read the book instead of wasting your money on a ticket and the unnecessary popcorn."
"laurafuller101","4","5","6","30 September 2014"," A story of summer love and heartbreak
","A fitting quote that speaks volumes of The Last Song, ""The pieces all fit together, yet everything was falling apart"", expresses the opinions of the watchers of the movie. The Last Song, another installation in the line of Nicholas Sparks' novels-turned-movies, centers on a teenage girl, her summer romance, and her relationship with her father. The movie features big names in acting, like Greg Kinnear and Kelly Preston, while spotlighting new faces in acting, for example Liam Hemsworth and Miley Cyrus. Although Cyrus is not a new celebrity name, The Last Song is her first silver screen acting role. Cyrus is a big name among tween girls for her role as Hannah Montana, and her singing career is starting to take off. However, acting in semi-serious roles or in movies at all might not be in her future. While Miley Cyrus does have a popular fan base to support her endeavors, The Last Song proves that Cyrus does not have the chops to be a great or even good actress, as expressed through her demeanor on screen, as well as through the reviews on her acting. <br/><br/>To illustrate the sub-par acting of Cyrus, the audience should pay close attention to how she acts. Even though the character of Ronnie was already a teen with a bad attitude, Cyrus adds the element of bad acting. In a review for the New York Times, writer A.O. Scott claims that Cyrus ""Most of the time she seems to be play-acting rather than exploring the motives and feelings of her character."" Scott is absolutely true. Cyrus mopes around on screen, not really having much emotion or, when she does, it is sometimes exaggerated. For example, when Cyrus and Hemsworth guard the turtle eggs overnight, she does not really delve deeply into the emotions of her character, but rather just seems to be reading the lines. Claudia Puig, a reporter for USA Today, reports that Cyrus ""sulks and sneers her way through her first dramatic role"", and that she has ""shaky dramatic bets."" To counter the harsh reviews, Roger Ebert, a renowned movie critic, believes that Cyrus ""seems sincere"" and ""Her acting is unaffected, she can play serious."" Cyrus may have some parts of the movie where she is serious, like when she and Kinnear finish the song and Kinnear's funeral, but most of the time she is not attached to her character. For most of The Last Song, Cyrus demonstrates how unexperienced her acting truly is. An example would be when she and Hemsworth have a fight around the middle of the movie. Cyrus explains to Hemsworth why she is mad at him, but Cyrus seems to not actually mean what she is saying; like she is just saying it to say it. Another scene in the movie that displays her less-than- stellar acting is another scene with Hemsworth. Again, she seems to be saying the lines, but not meaning them or having an ounce of conviction when the lines are spoken. Whenever Cyrus and Hemsworth have a scene together, which is almost every scene in the movie, Cyrus never gives the impression that she feels a romantic connection between her character and Hemsworth's character. The lack of chemistry could be a result from Cyrus's unemotional acting."

","Having only heard great things about the book, and drastic opinions on the movie, my friend and i thought we would give it a try. Midway through, we are bawling, holding one another's hand. Yes, Miley Cyrus may not be the best, and yes some parts were predictable, but I still loved the movie an incredible amount. Miley portrays an obnoxious teenager, as she should. And the predictability only prepares us emotional people ahead of time. I love being able to feel as if I know the characters, and with the Last Song, I could.

","This is a perfect example of how to spoil a master piece. I am so sorry for Nicholas Sparks who wrote a wonderful book only to be ruined by a bad screenplay, terrible editing and ordinary acting. All those who have read the book should be able to appreciate what I am talking about. Julie Anne Robinson has tried to use her creativity and tweak the story here and there but all she has managed to do is to ruin the whole plot. Some things are just better left untouched is the lesson she should learn out of it. Miley Cyrus is a huge disappointment and it seems she wasn't a good choice in the first place. She failed miserably to do what Mandy Moore did to ""A Walk To Remember"". On the whole, the movie gives the impression that they have just somehow managed to narrate the whole story in the 108 minutes given to them without really worrying about retaining the emotionally charged plot Nicholas Sparks had created.

Even the background music is overdone and obvious, like a bad soap opera. There is nothing about this movie that is original - think of almost any cliché and it is in this movie. I tried to sit through it non-judgmentally, thinking that I may have been too harsh about Miley Cyrus and the whole ""Disney/Hanna Montana"" debacle, and I thought that just maybe, Miley (and her father's choices) might have improved with time... but - no.

Miley brings her own personal touch to the character Ronnie. Yes the film is slightly different from the book but you will never find a film that's exact from the book. I would really recommend this movie it has lots of different emotions in it.<br/><br/>Miley has also changed the way she acts.Now she is more grown up in this movie and she is playing a part where she has never used her acting in this way. This movie just shows how good of an actress she is. The rest of the cast acting is also very good. The music used in the movie is also excellent.I don't think I can find any faults to this movie and think you should really see the movie before you read the book because you will be disappointed but I didn't see the movie based on the book I saw it because of the trailer. If you like sad emotional films I would really recommend it. Best film I've seen this year."
"amber1316","3","34","64","8 April 2010"," So disappointed
","I read the book before seeing the movie. i couldn't put the book down and i was hoping the movie would be just as good but i was so let down. i (as well as another review had said) kept thinking about the book and all of the important things that were left out. I felt like my friend was missing all the major details. I really loved the book, but walking out of the theater i was actually more mad than anything. It could have been a really great movie, it just needed to be more like the book. I wish there weren't major details left out and parts being completely different from how they were in the book. Some characters weren't nearly as important as they were in the book. I would suggest not reading the book before you see it. you'll be disappointed. I would definitely read the book after though."
"theinaniloquent","1","20","35","1 May 2012"," ""The Last Song""
","A drama centered on a rebellious girl who is sent to a Southern beach town for the summer to stay with her father. Through their mutual love of music, the estranged duo learn to reconnect.<br/><br/>Well you could probably already tell I would have no whatsoever 'expectation' for this movie. It did sound like an interesting film, let's get that straight. It had potential to be something at least average. It had potential to be more, possibly. But there's only one reason why this movie doesn't get it right is Miley Cyrus. If your going to try to provoke the audience to feel something, to move them, do not cast Miley Cyrus. She's a gimmick, and she has no acting talent whatsoever. Her antics are laughable, and her ways to try to ""act"" are just so funny. The rest of the cast was a bit of a joke too. Who casts two horrible lead actors? I mean, are they really trying to approach nonsense? Are they really trying to make this a serious movie? Because nothing is done in a professional way. The movie looks as if it was produced my a bunch of whiny teenagers who were such BIG fans of the novel. This was directing by a first-timer, but that doesn't give it any excuse for trying to get past the clichés. Did I forget to mention? If your going to attempt to move the audience, creating something the audience has already seen is not going to do anything. Quite frankly, it's going to make the audience cringe. <br/><br/>This movie will only appeal to your teenage daughter. It's a chick flick, that consists of being as formulaic as most everything today. And that sucks, because maybe the movie had potential. But potential that would never be savored. If you like horribly-acted chick flicks with no depth or emotion, here it is. If you like movies in general, avoid at all costs. <br/><br/>1/10."
"Robert_duder","4","14","23","4 April 2010"," An unbiased opinion...the movie is still not good...sorry Disney
","I am an absolute sucker for Disney films...live action or otherwise. I have also enjoyed previous Nicholas Sparks films and I, unlike many, many other adults have no hatred or dislike towards Miley Cyrus. I think she has talent and is an idol to millions of young girls and has never done anything overtly outrageous to cause scandal so my dislike of this film has nothing to do with the stupidity of hating a film just because Cyrus is in it. In fact I thought the Hannah Montana movie was cute for what it is. The fact is this is one of the most boring Sparks films and stories and this is the first one he adapted himself. Maybe it worked in book form but I won't be rushing to read it because nearly two hours of a story that really could have been told in five minutes around a camp fire is enough for me. The characters were vapid and empty, the sad ending was forced and annoying and the good performances were buried under a long rather boring story, and a love story that happens so fast your head will spin. In fact The Last Song shows why love is so convoluted given the two fall in deep ""real"" love after ten minutes of being together. Its just really silly drivel and its not Cyrus' fault but she doesn't help either.<br/><br/>Tween starlet Miley Cyrus tries her chops at drama and I think she might have some acting talent somewhere in her but this wasn't it. She was far too young for this role and her transformation from wild rebel child to good girl was just silly. They even make her physically look softer throughout the film to get the point across that she is reforming from her ways and 'growing up.' Cyrus doesn't ruin the film but is given nothing, and does nothing to add to it either. Alleged real life boyfriend Liam Hemsworth plays Will. Cyrus and him have okay chemistry but he looks so much older than her. In reality there is only two years between them but they just look awkward together despite their chemistry. His character is okay and he likely will have a decent career if he can survive the backlash from this film. Greg Kinnear is a great actor. He's proved it in As Good As It Gets and Little Miss Sunshine and he gets at least a little meat in this film. He gets a better character than others and he pulls off the Dad role with real style. He has good chemistry with Cyrus and Bobby Coleman who plays his son. Coleman deserves mention as he gives literally the best performance in the film. At thirteen he is not new to acting but he literally makes the film nearly redeemable with his strong, emotional performance as the younger son of Kinnear. Kelly Preston (Mrs. Travolta) makes a cameo as the Mom...it doesn't matter.<br/><br/>I love Television. I think Television has some amazing shows with amazing actors but I have this personal stigma against directors going from Television to big screen films because they never seem to know how to handle it. Director Julie Anne Robinson has had a lot of experience on the small screen but this is literally her move into big screen and it falls flat and part of that must rest on her shoulders. The story is long and drawn out, the romance is weak, the plot is mostly silly...how much time needs to be spent on the stupid sea turtles? I wanted to really enjoy this movie, I wanted to laugh, cry, and love the characters and I did none of that...except laugh but it was for the wrong reasons. I would give this entire cast including Cyrus another chance in another picture but this one is just plain silly. Skip it and wait for something far more touching and well written and directed...please. 4/10"
"monkey_kelstar","3","18","31","8 April 2010"," Miley Cyrus or Nicholas Sparks...
","I don't know who to complain about more. I saw this movie just for fun, not expecting anything wonderful. But I didn't realize it would be absolutely horrendous. And it wasn't just one element of the movie that was horrible; it wasn't just the acting, directing, or writing. It was a combination of all those factors. The screenplay was clichéd from the start. Ronnie, more of a brat than a troubled teen, reluctantly arrives at her dad's house along with her overenthusiastic little brother. Their divorced parents talk, ""We hurt them, you know."" Ronnie walks down to the beach with a pout on her face, ""My dad made me come down here for the summer - not like I wanna be here."" She runs into a hot local guy, who for some strange reason takes an interest in her, despite her attitude. It's already something any 15- year-old who wanted to write a book or a screenplay could think of on their own. <br/><br/>Then, of course, there are little subplots. The baby turtles - I left the theater to go get a snack, that scene was getting too dumb - the friend who doesn't want to put up with domestic violence but has nowhere else to stay; the return to piano playing. Besides all of this, we have a girl who decides she's in love with a sweet, rich boy who's too ideal for real life - he helps the environment, works as a mechanic, is a volleyball star, lives in a huge mansion, accepted to Columbia but bound for Vanderbilt in the tradition of his family. Of course, Ronnie decides she's ""in love"" with Will after only a week of dating him. <br/><br/>The next twist in the story comes when the dad (Greg Kinnear was the best actor in the movie) collapses and is rushed to the hospital. Ronnie, bitch that she is, becomes angry at her dad for lying about his disease rather than supporting him. But she reconciles with him soon enough. Now this is a complete 180 from where the girl was at the beginning of the summer. Of course, a person completely changes in one summer - classic story.<br/><br/>This movie has two plot formulas: two family members who are half a step from estranged becoming gradually closer; and a girl meeting a boy, hating him, liking him, getting angry at him, breaking up with him, and getting back with him. Two formulas mixed together. <br/><br/>All right, so this is a very formulaic movie, you get it. But, as I said before, that's not the only thing wrong with it. Miley Cyrus is very disappointing as an actress. Not that I think she's so talented to begin with, but I thought she might have stepped it up a bit now that she's leaving behind Disney stuff for ""serious"" movies. I was so wrong. She acted like her character in ""Hannah Montana:"" a brat with a sarcastic sense of humor. Her expressions during her dad's death (horrible scene anyway) and funeral made the saddest scenes amusing. She really has to take her acting to the next level if she wants to be taken seriously - or maybe she doesn't have the potential. Either way, her acting was barely mediocre in most parts of this movie. But, if you don't care about the bad acting, inexperienced directing, or cliché screenplay, by all means, watch it."

","This girl has NO talent whatsoever. She cannot sing and she definitely cannot act. I couldn't enjoy the movie because of her. Anyone..and I mean ANYONE would have been better than miley for this role. She is just too immature for a movie like this. I'm obviously not a fan of her music, but I thought hey..why not go see her on the big screen. Big mistake. It was a waste of time and money. I do not recommend this movie to anyone. Miley should not call herself an actress. There are plenty of women out there who actually can act, yet i'm so confused as to why Miley was chosen for this movie. I hope she never gets a role like this again."
"pamelapate10","4","7","10","2 May 2012"," seriously- Miley??
","What on earth were they thinking?? They have completely ruined the book for a lot of people by putting miley as the main protagonist! The movie does not alway need to be utterly true to the book but the audience usually expects the actors to at least try to embody the characters from the book,to try to feel and express their feelings as they do. Now that is something Miley is simply not able to achieve!Her acting is really bad and sometimes you just want to pause the movie and start doing anything else. Anything that might distract you from what she thinks is acting.I almost did that a few times but I surprisingly managed till the end. If you liked the book, I wouldn't recommend you to watch it. It is not worth it. <br/><br/>I rated it as 4 just because I liked the other actors (especially dad) and because I still like the book."
"mrsmarohn","3","7","10","8 October 2010"," The movie was lacking
","I was so excited to see this movie, and even though I was on my way to the hospital I had my mom get it out of the mail box for me. I finally got to watch it today, and I have to say I was very disappointed. <br/><br/>The screen play was written before the book so I thought that Nicolas Sparks would have used more of what is in the book for the movie, but I was really wrong. The two main characters in the movie need to learn how to act. It was so obvious that Miley Cyrus has never experienced real life or the loss of someone very dear to her. Also, it seemed like the guy who played Will was only interested in the kissing in the movie. Another disappointment was how the character of Marcus was portrayed. It could have been so much better, and more like the book where he pretty much stalked Ronnie. The actors that played Jonah and his dad were awesome. <br/><br/>In short the movie could have been so much better if Mr. Sparks had taken some of what he had written in the book and put it into the movie."
"bellebrunetteprincess","2","8","12","17 May 2011"," Who knew Miley was a robot.
","While in my opinion the movie itself had many faults in the story. The story actually wasn't that bad... it wasn't that good either. However the acting in this movie was something out of a classic horror flick. The worst actor in this movie was its star Miley Cyrus. Many times a line would call for fluctuation in tone or heck emotion. But what was give in was dead pan face with monotone voice. The male lead had his moments of charm and decent acting, but then it would seem as though he took an acting tip from Cyrus. And suddenly he to was dead pan an monotone. The only saving grace of this movie is Greg Kinnear as the father. Cause lets all just face it, it doesn't matter what role Mr. Kinnear is playing he is fabulous. Also as a pleasant surprise was Bobby Coleman as Jonah Miller. The kid is an outstanding actor who made his pain, joy, and adorably little brother incredibly believe able. As he said in the movie to Cyrus's character ""you maybe older, but I'm smarter than you"", apparently though younger he is also the better actor."

It's getting old and dare I say expected, which ruins the story, when one is just waiting to see who the grim reaper will come calling for.<br/><br/>Miley Cyrus did an adequate job in this movie. At least she kept it clean. The film was contrived, cliché and lackluster. Kinnear as always shines on screen. Too bad he had so little to work with.<br/><br/>My young daughters begged me to take them to the movie as they are obsessed with Cyrus.

"cardsfan2404","4","8","12","10 June 2010"," Wrong...just WRONG!
","I read the book prior to seeing the movie and because the book was exceptionally outstanding, I was excited to see the movie. BIGGEST MISTAKE EVER! Now I know that all movies cannot be exactly like the book or they could get really long, but you CANNOT expect to take out MAJORITY of the important details from a book and expect to movie to be good. So many details were left out. For example, Marcus basically stalked Ronnie through the book and was supposed to be the sociopath. He was in the movie once, maybe twice. <br/><br/>I was also very upset with the idea involving the fire in the church. In the book, Will believed Scott started the fire and continued to have him confess. However, it was brought to light that Marcus and his fireball tossing gang were responsible, thus making Ronnie forgiving of Will. <br/><br/>Another HUGE detail I feel that could have been included fairly simply was the fact that Ronnie's mom was actually responsible for the divorce because SHE cheated on her husband, so he left. That was not even touched on in the movie. It was just accepted that her dad was the problem<br/><br/>While I'm going, the wedding scene was wrong and the background of Ronnie's father was pretty much missing. His background with the priest was not in the movie, making his appearance at the end of the funeral seem so awkward and out of place. <br/><br/>Overall, I felt that the movie was very choppy and seemed way too rushed and because many details were ignored, it didn't make a ton of sense. I felt that the only acting that was believable was the scenes between Jonah and his dad. The one very touching part of the book that was left from the movie was the scene between Jonah and his dad in the hospital when his dad explains everything. I was crying so much while reading it and then the movie skipped from Miley blaming her dad and pouting as he is dying to her with her BF on the beach. It was very frustrating and I found Miley's acting to be less than true. I felt like the true depth of emotion that I felt in the book was missing in the movie and that Miley's reactions were abrupt and fake. Her relationship with her dad was horrible but seemed to magically fix itself with no explanation.<br/><br/>In the end, I left the theater extremely MAD. I was expecting to cry a lot but only cried when seeing Jonah finish the stain-glass window and at the funeral. I felt like coming home and reading the book again.<br/><br/>I would not recommend that you spend money to see it. If you can see it free, try not to leave part way through."
"iluvedelric","4","8","12","11 April 2010"," Disappointed.. :/
","I went to this movie hoping that even though it had Miley Cyrus in it, it would bring out the certain jena se qua of the book. At first the movie seemed OK. Ronnie was fairly cold to her brother and she almost looked goth. Then around the time of the fair everything started tumbling down.. The way Blaze met Ronnie, the little details... It was all changed. This changing of practically everything continued for quite some time it seemed.. Ronnie wasn't as mean to her dad about the piano, and her romance with Will seemed very out there compared to the romance in the book. Then at the wedding Marcus' crashing of the party wasn't anything like the book, basically just appearing at a high class party. Another thing was that Ronnie didn't hate to play the piano, she played it a number of times in the movie, and I felt this was too out of the main story of the book. It just seemed like they wanted her to show off her piano skills, if it set off the story or not. Then after Jonah left with his mom to go back to NYC I felt that they left too much out. In the book Steve and Ronnie had a lot of father-daughter moments together, but in the movie they didn't spend that much time together and as for the time when the window was installed, Steve got to see it, sure, but it still bothered me. Another thing that was left out was Blaze getting caught on fire, which was a big part of the book. <br/><br/>All in all, this movie was disappointing, and no match for the writing of Nicholas Sparks."

","This is a obvious bad movie. I'm pretty sure everyone that went into the theaters went in and knew this was going to be crap. Everyone at least had doubts about it because Miley Cyrus is given the lead role. If you thought that Miley Cyrus was going to do a good job and show some acting chops then you were probably living in denial. To be fair this movie would had been mediocre even without Miley Cyrus in the lead (although she didn't help things) the reason why is that the book from Nicholas Spark's was crap so the odds were good that the movie was going to blow too. The movie even seemed like it was going to bad after the opening credits. Almost like the movie wanted to be seen as much as the reluctant boyfriends that were dragged to see it."

","After seeing this movie, I don't think it is too harsh to say that I really do hope it lives up to its title. The Last Song is a nearly two hour cliché. An upside is the acting of Greg Kinnear who is quite moving as the ailing Steve Miller. There are moments when the drama within the Miller family is touching but you snap out of it easily as if anticipating Miley Cyrus breaking out into song. I am not even sure whether the casting is right. Miley may have her fair share of fans as a singer but as an actor, she can seem rather stiff. It's a good thing though that Georgia is scenic because there are times in the film that I did end up watching the scenery."
"DICK STEEL","2","12","21","15 May 2010"," A Nutshell Review: The Last Song
","Once in a while, I'm game for a good dose of sappy romance, and what more than one by Nicholas Sparks, who have had a number of his books, from Message in a Bottle to Dear John all being translated from page to screen. But I guess too much of anything rarely work wonders, even if you throw big name stars in the film to shore up and try and mask all the clichés, and frankly off the heels of Dear John, The Last Song just feels like the neglected twin clamouring hard for attention.<br/><br/>Miley Cyrus finally sheds her Hannah Montana persona for the big screen, and it's about time she takes on a role without putting on that blonde wig, or break out into song (although she does for a while here when singing off a few phrases of Maroon 5's She Will Be Loved) and dance. And when I say being too close to Dear John, I mean it through her character Ronnie Miller (Miley Cyrus) being just about the xeroxed copy of Channing Tatum's John Tyree, being taciturn and mean toward the father. But of course with the promise of a budding romantic relationship, all that is about to change, doesn't it always?<br/><br/>Enter Will Blakelee (Liam Hemsworth) as the car technician (some brains) / volleyball player (some topless brawn) / aquarium volunteer (with that heart of gold) / tycoon of a rich son (always helps), whose initial arrogance provided that gung-ho spirit in trying to woo Ms Grumpy, before slowly melting away to reveal surprise after surprise that he's Mr Perfect through his patience and troubled backstory that involves an unhappy household. But that aside, boy and girl spend plenty of time frolicking in the sand, sea, and aquarium even, before jealous parties and ex-girlfriends come spoil everything so that it's not as smooth sailing as we'd like to think.<br/><br/>Being in love probably means becoming a better person, and through that comes the narrative opportunity for Ronnie to bond with her father Steve (Greg Kinnear), who's spending a lot of time with son Jonah (Bobby Coleman) given her daughter's new found relationship and the trouble in connecting with her nasty demeanour slowly unravelled by Will. I found this part about reconnecting with a loved one a lot more powerful than the romantic one, which in part is thanks to Kinnear's superior performance over Liam Hemsworth, who;s like a cross between Keanu Reeves and Hayden Christensen.<br/><br/>For all the real life romance between Cyrus and Hemsworth that came out from this film, I can't deny that it's likely curiosity more than anything else that would put bums on seats, wondering if kisses shown were for reel or for real (I'm inclined to think the latter from what's seen in the film). But the one thing that will irritate, though Twilight fans will come to adore, is the ever-flipping mood swings that Ronnie will have for Will. Oh someone said something bad about you, I'm breaking up with you. Oh wait a minute, your father owns a huge mansion and you're that pained son, I'm so sympathizing with you here's some loving. And it goes on a wash-rinse-repeat cycle. One scene causes problems, the next one patches things back up, and seriously, it's fickle-mindedness and confusion of the highest order.<br/><br/>Trust Nicholas Sparks to include into his story more than just the notion of romantic love, and complete with little saccharine sweet things such as sea-turtle hatching, and to break your heart with some tragedy as always. If it's a card to send, you'll likely make it Hallmark, and if a romantic story, you can rely on a NIcholas Sparks written film if only you can stand repetitive thematic clichés getting thrown at you, constantly. It's not perfect, just what you'd come to expect. For once, I'd beg Miley Cyrus to break out into song and dance to shake things up."

"dharab1996","5","5","7","28 November 2011"," Confusing to connect with and lacks emotional experience
","""The Last Song"", originally a novel written by Nicholas Sparks, is a movie about a summer romance of a rebellious girl. At first you are mesmerized by the touching story of the father-daughter relationship unfolding before your very eyes. The movie takes you into a story that has a great plot just not shown too well. The melodrama is pulled in way too many directions that it is snapped into pieces. As great as ""The Last Song"" is, it lacks an emotional experience.<br/><br/>The beginning was not a great start, Miley Cyrus storms in and out of each scene, to a point where it seems over done. Then towards the middle where it finally seems she's finally found a good medium she starts slacking and the character of Ronnie has disappeared. This could be because of the fact that Ronnie is discovering herself again with the blossom of her new relationship with her dad and boyfriend. While that is going on, on the foreground she discovers her father is ill and about to pass away. We get pushed into that so quick that it's hard to actually grasp the idea and have any emotion towards the Miller family. The ending would probably be the only emotional experience the viewer would receive. We are glad that Ronnie has finally decided to play the piano and finishes the piece her father left unwritten.<br/><br/>In snippets of the film you actually feel wrapped up and involved in the reality of the story. Most of the parts are in the middle of the film. When Ronnie's and Will's relationship is arising you feel as if you're taking part of the relationship as well. The relationship is too cute to not to give attention to. The viewer also seems to be wrapped up in the film when Steve Miller is back home from the hospital and spends time with his daughter. It gives this sort of warm feeling in your heart, that finally they have a close relationship and they act like a nothing ever went wrong. The weakest point in the film would be most of the beginning. It just makes you want to hate Ronnie for the way she behaves, and lacks the charisma she has in the rest of the film.<br/><br/>The only way that the film would create a hard-hitting emotional response is because the film is in some way relatable to the viewer. You can sympathize with Ronnie of her loss of her father, her break up with her boyfriend, or the divorce of her parents. If the film was a bit longer and if many of the elements weren't pushed to the views, the impact of the film would have been much greater. Since everything is just coming crashing without any connections, it leaves us as viewers confused and takes a while to actually follow along with what's going on. By the time you catch on, the emotional parts have probably passed. ""The Last Song"", directed by Julie Anne Robinson, would have gained more effect on the film if she put more of her own twist and if more of the ideas were connected."

Kids itself true in they background , share some similarities with perception of surrounded world, however truly act as teenagers do this days IMHO (Struggling for some one ?? ( like at least TV star) or Ideal Boyfriend / Girlfriend (first physically just instinct, eye contact etc.. (( secondary, interesting not boring new and different person to what they see before )<br/><br/>a.1 It was sell badly in this picture, but if you watching it carefully you will notice both : bad performance and attempt of showing it.<br/><br/>Acting <br/><br/>Well, there was no emotions at the start, good or bad marked strongly by each of character.<br/><br/>Maybe because such a situations are so common this days around a globe, you do not need to show them such dramatically..........<br/><br/>Later on, as movie goes by, there is some sympathy growing to main actors as you do expect there should have been some love from it .<br/><br/>It is not ease play bad girl (Maily Cirus) and half an hour later turn onto in love Babe...<br/><br/>I'm sorry for the director and the closest crew that Maily was not directed to be real in that moment. It was so short maybe 5-7 sec of the movie. I think not she but others screw up to fix it properly.<br/><br/>Did I cry,<br/><br/>I always take a movies emotionally , and use to cry watching love kind' a stories. However it do not come to me automatically because of overall plot .<br/><br/>I try to finding my own situation were I am now or how I will act in similar situation like on the screen. As a parent I do cry when Maily play the piano trying to finish up his father song for her.<br/><br/>It is amazing how ""you"" being in real opposition to everybody ,especially if you are teen and have no Ideal childhood can get closer, when you was told that It is really your last chance to talk to someone you are truly part of. Believe or not once you get older it not happening that frequent or even at all. <br/><br/>It is just my thoughts;<br/><br/>It can't be as bad movie as I could not catch that.<br/><br/>Generally It is a movie for teens , not perfect, but at the end of a day it was not waste of your money. I do believe that many of US teens' pairs, who go to cinema to watch that movie, once the left it after,they get reflectional chat between each other.<br/><br/>And Is it not for what that movie was made for ???<br/><br/>Best regards, Eric Ross"
"jhunt709","8","8","13","22 May 2010"," At least 'The Last Song' was a good one.
","'The Last Song' (based on the eponymous novel by 'The Notebook' scribe Nicholas Sparks) appears to have received much criticism for various aspects of its running time, many of which I can respect, however it strikes me as vicious that viewers are focusing on Miley Cyrus' likability as if it were the overall staple. For a single, external aspect to polarise the audience in such a manner is extremely unforgiving to the bigger picture, and therefore I'll address the Miley factor in a neutral manner. In a leading role separating her from alter ego Hannah Montana, Miley proves she is a blossoming young actress who just needs a few more opportunities like 'The Last Song' in order to find her feet out of a Disney character's shoes. In my opinion her main fault is to play Ronnie, a troubled and troublesome teenager, with a hanging lower lip and fixed gaze for much of the first act, failing to explore why her character is broken. This issue is short-lived however, and Miley plays a happier Ronnie later in the film to a stronger degree, benefiting from her arcing character which should have been developed sooner. In my opinion, the script is at fault for striving to depict Ronnie's demeanour through conventional methods such as bratty behaviour and cocky dialogue. Some may take issue with the watered- down characters (particularly readers of the book) but this is a difficult problem for any screenplay when adapting from the written format.<br/><br/>Besides the sole draw of superstar Cyrus, 'The Last Song' tells a touching story about love, life, family and friendship through Ronnie's connection with her estranged father (a suitably cast Greg Kinnear) and the local heartthrob Will, played by Liam Hemsworth who, like Cyrus, should be credited with rising to the part. The comic relief in Jonah, Ronnie's younger brother, is adapted well by an enthusiastic Bobby Coleman who adds some necessary character to a number of scenes, including the overdone shopping spree montage (which in this instant, he saves). Of course the film generally serves itself as a mechanism driving itself towards its inevitable heartfelt ending, although when the time comes the subject matter is dealt with beautifully, the film remaining uplifting as the credits roll to the inspirational 'When I Look At You'. In my opinion it is moments like these which clarify film's success as a thought-provoking reflection of how we might treat our relationships with significant others; while the novel and its author can be credited with crafting this, the medium of film highlights the concept of fragility for all to see rather than interpret.<br/><br/>'The Last Song' isn't necessarily exciting or remarkable cinema. What it is, however, is a pleasant and gentle piece that touches on the delicate aspects of life that every one of us can relate to."

","The Last Song (2010): Dir: Julie Anne Robinson / Cast: Miley Cyrus, Liam Hemsworth, Greg Kinnear, Bobby Coleman, Kelly Preston: A long repeated concept regarding last chances to do right. Miley Cyrus and her younger brother are spirited off to their father's beach house for the summer where she is reluctant to reconnect. Director Julie Anne Robinson is backed with fine photography but the screenplay is a cliché ridden romantic farce. Cyrus will go through a predicted up and down relationship with some meathead surfer, will mend things with dad, and save sea turtles. None of this is very interesting and it only serves as an opportunity to cash in on Cyrus's young fan base. Liam Hemsworth has the thankless role of pearly whites boyfriend who goes through a xeroxed jerk around relationship that contains all the passion of a punch to the testicles. Greg Kinnear has the one decent role as a father is is blamed for the burning of a Church. He will die, of course, but he at least has the one bit of dignity in the entire film. Bobby Coleman plays younger brother who does his best but the role is more or less a temporary companion for the Kinnear character while Cyrus is turtle sitting and nearly getting laid. Kelly Preston plays the mother who spends most of the film off screen likely trying to contact her agent and find out why her career has come down to this. The Cyrus fan base will love this film until either the fame dies down or they realize what candy coated manipulative bullshit this truly is. Hopefully the last time we'll see or hear of a Last Song screenplay but that is probably wishful thinking. Score: 3 ½ / 10"

I guess the only reason she got a chance was because of her dad since he some how pulled to many strings just to get himself attention from his herd of cows. If she ends up like her twin lohan then I think all of these producers has gone brain dead.

","This movie starts as a teen romance/drama, but then, out of nowhere, we are introduced to Ronnie's (Miley Cyrus) father serious condition and how this, plus her romance and the 'simple life' as a whole, affects her and her rebellious (kinda of) attitude.<br/><br/>The movie would've been fine if we were introduced to Greg Kinnear's character a tad earlier. I mean, he shows up during one or two scenes, basically as a comic relief, and then, all of a sudden, we are supposed to have this big connection with his character and really care for what is going to happen to him. I cared more about what the effect of his disease would take on his children than to the character itself. It was kinda frustrating. Everyone in the movie seemed emotional and all that, but I just wasn't feeling it. I didn't know who he was, so, whatever.<br/><br/>The acting is fine. Miley Cyrus is okay, I guess... I have a big problem separating the character from the personality herself, I'll admit. But after a while I just went along with it. The guy playing the boyfriend though, is kinda lame. They should've cast someone with more range, since he was supposed to have loads of personal issues regarding his family. This guy seemed too confident and out of character, even when he was not supposed to.<br/><br/>Too many morals in one film for my taste. But, if done better, I wouldn't mind them that much.

","I'll be honest with other movie-goers: my college friends and I elected to see this movie during a girls night out, if only ""ironically,"" you know, to see a potentially bad movie and laugh at it. Clearly, 80% of the audience crammed in the theater with us was there for the same reason. <br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>I've never been a Miley Cyrus fan because I feel like she's a poor singer riding on the coattails of her father whilst her family pushes her heavily from behind. <br/><br/>All in all, I've seen more terrible movies. <br/><br/>I never read the actual book and for this I apologize, but be aware I'm grading this movie as precisely that: a film. <br/><br/>The acting was sitting somewhere between Disney channel and Oscar award-winning: not terrible but not fantastic. There were certain moments when I cringed and thought ""really, director? you couldn't fix that?"" But there were also moments when I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>Note to the audience: Miley Cyrus isn't incredible, but the boy who played her little brother was and Greg Kinnear, as per usual, was quiet awesome. Kelly Preston wasn't great but, when remembering that the filming of this movie fell somewhere near the death of her sweet son, she was fine; god bless the Travolta/Preston family.<br/><br/>The relationship between Miley and her on/off-screen boyfriend was rushed; my friends and I were aghast by some of their actions because we couldn't tell how much time had passed since the beginning of their relationship and, we wondered, ""isn't it a little soon for this?"" <br/><br/>The emotional element of this movie was pivotal, as it is with most Nicolas Sparks book-to- screen projects. Miley Cyrus got better as the movie progressed but still didn't quite reach the level that Rachael McAdams did in ""The Notebook."" Not to compare actresses, but Nicolas Sparks is, in and of himself, a completely different genre of ""love movie.""<br/><br/>I felt as though the subject of Ronnie's college attendance wasn't addressed aggressively enough; the movie makes several mentions of it but suddenly she makes a big decision that didn't seem contextual enough. <br/><br/>On a completely rude note, this film was too dramatic and emo for me; I understand if that might be book related, but I just don't think it was; in the past, Mr. Sparks has wanted the audience to connect with him, not feel battered by emotional waves. i thought this movie was predictable and emo; that's not necessarily bad, but there it was. <br/><br/>If you want a good romp through summer romance off your cuff, this movie is quite suitable. If you want to see Greg Kinnear highlighted like the star he is and sent to the Oscars for recognition, this is not it. People who love the metaphorical and subtle essence of film: look elsewhere. Good night with your girlfriends? Checkmate."

Just stop. This movie had some good performances, great character chemistry and a tear jerking story. If you CAN'T feel something during the scene where she finally finishes her Dad's song and it's the last thing he gets to hear before he dies, you have no heart. The songs are great. The messages were great. Yes it's a sappy-chick-flick-romance-tragedy-drama and I know you have to be in the mood for those things.

"LaurenNoir","2","8","14","18 June 2010"," Naive, melodramatic yet wooden. A glorious mess.
","Someone told me that the main character in this film reminded them of me at 13 years old (an insult to this film in the first place, seeing as this character is supposed to be that age I am now) so I watched it out of interest.<br/><br/>I was amused beyond belief.<br/><br/>I loathed the depiction of teenagers. In the weak scene with Blaize and her boyfriend leaving her, I almost laughed, with the ridiculous acting. She looked like she simply had no idea what she was doing so she was simply reading her lines (example, actually saying ""Um"" like it was written, rather than a pause and stutter) and it really trivialised the pain some teenagers go through in that type of abusive relationship. The plot line with Blaize and Marcus could have been very interesting, but the actors were pathetic, I don't even think this was a case of bad writing.<br/><br/>Another scene that annoyed/amused me was the ""revelation scene"" when Will was saying about his past, and why he had all those girls etc. his pain, blah, blah, blah. It could have been done so well, but he went for the obvious, and Ronnie pouted, losing all intensity and connection, for me.<br/><br/>I actually found Will's character quite likable, and the one scene that made me smile for the right reasons was when they were singing ""she will be loved"" even though it was ruined by another ""Oh my God, Ronnie, there are so many things you are good at."" Being a pianist, and seeing how closely it is connected to the soul, I could understand why Ronnie wouldn't want to play after the divorce, but when she played again the relief and transformation was superficial. At the start, when she wouldn't play, she seemed more moody, I would suggest if she was as special as she thought she was, she would have a depression, not teenage angst. So maybe this is mockery of teenagers, oh, God I hope so. The feeling when she played again should have been immense, like it had never changed inside, not just her ability, and that should have been glorious, but no. She was just cute, and happy, so she kissed her boyfriend a little more and stopped being such a moody cow to her family. That should have been the surface, but apparently it was the depth. The hospital scene was painful to watch, because of the horrible action. Though the scene between Will and the little brother was quite touching.<br/><br/>When Will saw Ronnie all glammed up at the wedding, there were even strings and tinkly sounds, which is an example of the glorious clichés used in this film.<br/><br/>The ""Don't touch me"" scene could have been incredible, again, but it was weak. There wans't even a quiet power.<br/><br/>And the turtles. Ridiculous.<br/><br/>The one thing I liked about this film was in fact the music. The way they handled musicianship was horrible, but the music was very nicely used.<br/><br/>Maybe I did like that when she started to play again, she showed emotions, it shows how music taps into you true self and soul, but I'm not sure that was the intention of this film.<br/><br/>""At least you have the courage to feel"" was a ridiculous thing to sayt o a teenager. More like ""Stop whoring out your emotions to make a pretty face and get a bit of attention."" her playing at the funeral was predictable, but quite lovely, another little saving grace.<br/><br/>I suppose true musicianship is something a non-musician will ever understand, and this film does not help to elaborate upon it, so they explore the shallow levels of family and stupid romances."
"TheLittleSongbird","3","7","12","12 March 2011"," Forced and predictable, but better than it could've been
","I saw this movie for two reasons. One is that it is based on a book by Nicholas Sparks. The other is the wonderful Greg Kinnear. I will be frank, the book is much more engrossing emotionally and the characters and story are far more believable. The Last Song isn't completely unwatchable. Greg Kinnear is brilliant and definitely the best asset of the film, the film does look good with pleasant scenery and cinematography and the soundtrack is tolerable.<br/><br/>However, I didn't find myself connecting to any of the characters except for Steve or their situations. Here, the characters are quite clichéd and I found myself frustrated with the titular character so many times. The story is weak and predictable and the script is poor too with any attempt at evoking emotion feeling uncomfortably forced.<br/><br/>The direction is lacking and the pace is sluggish. The acting apart from Kinnear is hardly noteworthy, I do not like Miley Cyrus and I never found her acting and her attempts to come across as sympathetic and honest believable at all. Out of all the movies based on Sparks' books, which includes the wonderful Notebook, surprisingly decent Dear John and the touching Message in a Bottle, The Last Song is my least favourite. On a positive note, it did have one or two good assets which altogether made it better than it could have been. 3/10 Bethany Cox"

She hated her father, wouldn't even greet him, and then THAT girl. It's hard to believe. Not even to mention that what one called ""acting"" wasn't proved so by the two love birds, Ronnie and Will, Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth.

Miley certainly has passionate fans. But movie producers pandering to that narrow audience is not the way to build an audience for a movie. Having seen how extremely badly the plump, chubby out of shape Miley ""acted"" without any acting skills - well,this one movie has so turned me off from her, that I will NEVER watch any movie ever again in which she has even a small bit, non-speaking part.<br/><br/>Greg Kinnear does a very credible job of carrying the movie as far as it can get carried. The plot and writing are acceptable. But who can stand listening to the gravelly male voice of Miley, let alone having to look at her disgusting face and body. It is little wonder that the costumers of the movie did their best to hide every part of her that they could, despite the fact that the movie is set in the south in the summertime, with other young ladies wearing skimpy bikinis.<br/><br/>Even if you like her singing, you have to admit that Miley Cyrus has absolutely no acting skills. In fact they are so bad as to be non-existent, or at least indiscernible.<br/><br/>If producers want to make a decent movie, with any respectability at all, and have a chance of making a few dollars profit for their trouble, this movie, The Last Song, says clearly that they need to stay away from Miley Cyrus. Just look at the vote distribution for the movie, practically all 1's or 10's, with very little in between. With more 1's than 10's. All those 1's are votes against the polarizing Miley and how disgusting her performance was in this otherwise decent movie."

It was hard to put down, and I think I may have finished it in about 2-3 days. It was just that good. I like how Sparks took the time to develop the characters and how nothing in the novel seemed forced (for lack of a better word).<br/><br/>After reading the book, I was very excited to rent the movie (RedBox is amazing!) and watch it after work (as a part of my Wine and a Movie event). I can honestly say that I was a little nervous, especially after the debacle that was The Lovely Bones (great book, horrible movie), but I decided to give it a try. I figured that The Notebook was a great Nicholas Sparks adaptation, so why should The Last Song be? Hmmm...that was a HUGE logic FAIL! The movie was horrible! I found myself not being interested in the first 5 minutes, but I felt it necessary to finish the movie to at least give it a chance to redeem itself (which, of course, it did not).<br/><br/>Although I am young (24), I am not so naive to believe that a movie based on a book can read exactly the same, but my goodness...were they remaking the same book that I had previously read? I was highly disappointed, mad, and confused. There was no character development, and there were sections in the book that as I read it, I knew would be great in the movie...unfortunately, those episodes went untouched.<br/><br/>It just left me asking myself why - why did I rent this movie? why did I not turn it off in the first 5 minutes? why would they waste time and money making this movie? why Miley Cyrus? etc...<br/><br/>In conclusion, I advise you to just read the book and use your imagination.

","This movie may as well go down as one of the worst films of 2010. The Last Song features Miley Cyrus in an uneven and whiny performance as a teenage girl experiencing the love of her life during the summer. There is also a church fire, a pyromaniac, family problems, and other things which you probably should but won't care about. Cyrus does have fantastic chemistry with her co-star Liam Hemsworth, but the movie's pluses truly end there. Characters and plot-lines seem to be pulled randomly out of a hat, and scenes which should be emotionally powerful are paired with conflicting music. The scenes between Ronnie and her father are particularly manipulative and forced. Ronnie and Will seem to be on and off, seeing as they are constantly arguing and apologizing instead of having their relationship develop. It is never said why Ronnie (Cyrus) is in love with Will (Hemsworth). The last third saves the film from receiving a 2, but doesn't save the film as a whole. Ronnie is supposed to be unlikable, but you are eventually supposed to feel for her as well. The supporting characters are supposed to be just as interesting as Ronnie, but aren't developed at all. The film is very superficial, underdeveloped, and empty, and fans of the surprisingly well-crafted novel will be disappointed."
"superbol_1","1","5","8","4 August 2010"," Insulting
","I must say that I might not be objective about this movie. First, I hate Miley Cyrus. She always had the same face whenever there was an emotional moment. You couldn't see any difference in her reaction whether when she learnt about her dad and when she fought with Will. It was the same face. The girl has a nice voice, but no acting skills. She should stick to her Hannah Montana character. Second, I lived a very similar situation in the last year. My Dad had cancer for 7 years, but his state started crashing in September 2009. My Mom was working 80hrs\week, 6 days a week. So, during the day, I had to take care of my dying father for six months and still go to school. I had to drop out of school in the end. I saw this movie the week following his funerals. I cried a lot, I have to admit it, but I was even more angry. Saying the screenplay was awful is an understatement! They didn't do any research at ALL! It's insulting for anyone who had lived at home with someone sick. They made it look sad, true, but taking care of terminally-ill person is hard physically, emotionally and psychologically. You have to help the person doing as simple things as taking a shower, going to the bathroom, eating. In the end, they're not there at all most of the time. A teenage girl couldn't have done it so easily, believe me. I'm 19, and I thank God everyday I had my mom and a nurse to help me through this. Mr.Sparks, next time you write a novel/screenplay, make sure you really know what you're talking about."

I say this: what romantic comedy, or any romantic movie is not predictable? I thought Dear John was more predictable than this one, and what about Leap Year also released this year. Now that was cheesy and soooo predictable. But you know what, I still enjoyed it and so did a lot of people.<br/><br/>So if you want to see a movie that will make you laugh, make you cry, feel frustration, that is beautifully shot in Georgia, then go see the Last Song without too much expectation and I think that you will be pleasantly surprised."

","I was so excited that this was coming out in theaters, since I read the book. The book is amazing, and I do recommend it. But I do NOT recommend this movie. It was the most worthless piece of trash ever. Literally, they cut out a main character, lost important facts about Ronnie, and important things that Blaze does. It's like they cut out things that actually made the book (and would have made the movie) great. Actually, I feel like if they gave the part of Ronnie to another actress, it would have been a little better. I'm extremely disappointed in the acting also. Greg Kinnear did a great job, as always. The actor who played Jonah did too. He, at least, was the comic relief. I can't believe how poor this came out. Like I said, the book was excellent, but the movie was not. Don't waste your money, don't waste your time. I mean, Horton Hears A Who was more entertaining than this. I would heavily recommend the book though."

","I read some reviews that paint The Last Song in a bad light, but I liked it. It was a touching film, well written, well acted and directed, and in my opinion the actors were perfectly cast for their parts.The screen adaptation of Nicholas Sparks' bestseller is a deeply emotional story of young love, the process of maturity, the crucial choices in our lives. have not read the book, and thus cannot comment upon the fealty of this film to Sparks' manuscript, but its emotional tone and import is certainly consistent with his other works with which I am familiar. This is the kind of film where you cringe at one moment from the stilted dialogue and then burst into tears over a love that knows no bounds the next moment."

","Don't like any of the Hanna Montana songs or her early career. So went to this film expecting the worst. the film actually turned out well. Not a chick flick but more of a drama. Miley Cyrus did a pretty good job considering her goofy early dramatic and music work designed for popular appeal to certain kids. This film is actually interesting with good acting by the brother, father and the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>This film had an interesting story and is the kind of film I would not have even gone to had there been anything in the theater I had not already seen. it actually could be liked by any age. I, personally, think that Miley Cyrus may change direction in her career. She recently took her real fathers name in an official name change. I expect that Miley will not follow in the footsteps of other Disney losers like Britney Speers and Lindsay Lohan. This film is a step in the right direction but her recent American Idol appearance was pretty bad. The film is worth seeing."

","Miley Cyrus takes on her first dramatic role and like most of this film's critics, I rolled my eyes. However, she was not bad and neither was Kinnear in his part. The flaw of the storytelling lies in Nicholas Sparks's atrociously sentimental and conventional writing. Nothing here is original and the ending is as sappy as always. Yet this is a lot better than the last Sparks film adaptation, Dear John. I could not sit through that idiot piece. This is much better than that and is more watchable, but it still is nothing that cannot be missed in the long run. The beaches are nice to look at and are more compelling than the story we are watching."

","The Last Song <br/><br/>Like their seasonal namesake, summer flings are sweaty, sleepless affairs that generally last for two-months before abruptly ending, leaving your body covered in strange rashes and bite marks.<br/><br/>Sadly, the summer tryst of the troubled teen in this romantic/drama ends on a much more tragic note.<br/><br/>Forced to spend the summer with her estranged/musician father (Greg Kinnear), the unruly, yet gifted, Ronnie (Miley Cyrus) is disgruntled.<br/><br/>Her gloomy disposition, however, doesn't dissuade a local (Liam Hemsworth) from romantically pursuing her. Unfortunately, his efforts are trumped by news her father has cancer.<br/><br/>Layered with lachrymose love and loss motifs, The Last Song is typical Nicolas Sparks schmaltz made even worse by a lead actress whose awkward jaw is apposite evidence of her scene chewing abilities.<br/><br/>As for the best part of a summer romance: You only have to stay fit and look sexually attractive for, like, 12-weeks out of the year.

"Swagger91","9","5","9","4 May 2010"," Hannah Montana grows up!
","After following the production of this movie for well over a year, (before it even had a title!) I finally got the chance to see it this afternoon and I wasn't disappointed with the final outcome one bit.<br/><br/>I've read so many negative reviews which focus mainly on Miley Cyrus' acting but I think any fan knows, and probably Miley herself, that she was never going to get many fair reviews from movie critics. In this film Miley completely sheds her Hannah Montana/popstar image and plays the role of a moody, troubled teenager exceptionally well. I also found the acting of all the main cast to be of a high standard although I did feel that some of the dialogue seemed clunky and poorly written so certain scenes felt slightly false and awkward.<br/><br/>The death of Ronnie's father was dealt with particularly well, we were made to really connect with both Ronnie and her father over the course of the movie so when we found out he was dying of lung cancer it really came as a blow to the audience watching and by the end of the film there wasn't a dry eye in the house. The only part of the movie I didn't like was the character Blaze. She just came across as annoying, unpleasant and completely unnecessary to the plot. When Miley's character gave her the wad of cash I felt like slapping the girl! I really think that if her character had been cut from the film there wouldn't have been anything important missing.<br/><br/>The Last Song isn't perfect, the direction seems a little jarring at times and the random cuts can sometimes bring you straight out of the story but it is highly enjoyable. The relationships developed between Ronnie, her father and her brother Jonah mean that pretty much anyone can relate the story to the relationships in their own families. It's both funny and a real tear jerker and it might just surprise anyone who doesn't consider Miley Cyrus a particularly good actress.<br/><br/>And talking of Miley, for fans the last few scenes when 'When I Look At You' kick in are simply awesome! Me and my friends ended up staying during the credits just to hear the full song. Excellent."

","I took my 13 year old daughter to see this film. She had read the book, I had not. She did not tell me anything about the characters or plot. I was expecting to see a mediocre move with song and dance. I was totally wrong. The movie was FAR from mediocre. It was EXCELLENT!<br/><br/>This was a very warm and touching family film. When it was over I was already thinking how much I would like to see it again. For me, as a father, the most touching scene (out of many) was the final scene in which Ronnie has packed up all her father's possessions including his old, damaged piano, and is towing the piano out of town in a small trailer. The piano has little if any financial worth, but it is the piano she and her father played and wrote music on. It is priceless to her. After leaving the theater I felt wanting to spend more time with my own lovely daughter, Veronica."

It was like two different things, almost like Gossip Girl the book and the show. Its the same characters and general plot but they altar the details so that your not seeing the same thing twice (once when your visualizing it while reading, and the other the movie, obviously). And for Miley acting which you all seem to dislike ohhh so much, I really enjoyed everyones! acting and I cried all three times I saw this movie in the theaters (I never see movies more than once in the theater). Everyone seems to think her acting was so bad, but i think thats just her character(besides the fact that everyone already has a bias opinion because its Miley...get over it people)!

"martin-riley81","10","7","15","30 May 2010"," The Last Song
","When I began reading The Last Song, my first thought was this is the perfect book to read to finish out the summer. I thought it would be light, but an enjoyable read. To my delight, it became so much more as I read more of Ronnie's story.<br/><br/>Ronnie and her brother Jonah are sent to North Carolina to spend the summer with their estranged father. Their father left his prestigious position at Julliard to pursue his dream of being a concert pianist. His time away put a strain on his family and eventually ended his marriage. He now calls Wrightville Beach, NC home.<br/><br/>Ronnie never forgave her father for ruining their family. In fact, she hasn't spoken to him in three years. She's livid that her mother is forcing her to do this. As soon as she sets foot in her father's house, she's determined to plan her return back to New York. As soon as she enters her father's house, she puts distance between them by spending her first night away from his home. It's on this night that she first meets Will followed by Blaze. It's this night that will change her summer.<br/><br/>The Last Song is told in four differing points of view: Ronnie, Steve, Will and Marcus. Through each perspective, Mr. Sparks reveals more of the story and at times flashing back to the past to provide more history. Each character has something to add to the events of that summer and reading it in his or her own voice adds to the realness of the story.<br/><br/>Early on I had a hint of how the novel would end. As I realized my assumption was right, it didn't prepare me for the emotions I felt as I continued to read. The Last Song isn't only about love. It's also about learning how to forgive yourself for your past mistakes so you can move forward. This is evident as Ronnie struggles to forgive herself for allowing her anger and hurt to prevent her from having a relationship with her father. During this summer, Ronnie realizes despite her behavior, her father's love remained unconditional.<br/><br/>Steve, Ronnie's and Jonah's father, spends time quietly reading his Bible. It's during these devotionals, that Steve has forgiven himself and draws closer to God. Mr. Sparks did a fantastic job of using Steve's devotions to illustrate that through God, new beginnings are possible, despite your past, if you have faith, believe and put your trust in God. He continues to illustrate new beginnings by restoring broken relationships between a parent and child, the destroying and reconstruction of a church and learning to love and respect yourself.<br/><br/>The Last Song is an emotionally charged novel, one that I highly recommend. I suggest you read with tissues nearby. It will grabbed the reader and won't let go until the very last page."

","Now I'm not usually the type of girl to go in for these mushy type of films, but I must say that ""Last Song"" made me feel it whole-heartedly and took me on a very warm and romantic journey about life, love, fate and all of it's fragile complexities. This is perfect as a date movie with the one you love or when you just want to spend a reflective evening with a glass of wine just getting reconnected to your humanity! Both Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth turn in multi-layered performances as two people who are both at a crossroads in their lives and who meet, by chance & fate, to complete each other and share in a rare perfect moment in time that lasts over the course of a long summer. I really think Miley Cyrus gave an outstanding performance in this film. I loved this movie, and I cant wait for it to come out on DVD."
"lrdance17","10","13","34","1 April 2010"," Great movie!!
","I would first like to start off by saying, if you like other Nicholas Sparks films/books (The Notebook, Dear John etc.) then you should go see this.<br/><br/>Miley Cyrus was honestly amazing. I felt that her acting was well done. Her character Ronnie was relate able to, and i could tell that Miley somewhat related to her character. The portrayal of Ronnie was great.<br/><br/>Liam Hemsworth was also great. He was charming, and he was one of those type of characters (Will) that it is hard not to like.<br/><br/>Bobby Coleman brought lots of humor to this movie. For an actor of such a young age, he is very good. Whenever i saw him cry, not only did i believe him, but i found myself crying with him.<br/><br/>If you like romance/drama, then see it. I was aware that this was going to make me cry, but i didn't know how much it would. To me, when a movie makes me cry, you know its a good one. In the beginning it made you laugh also. Although it made you laugh, this is defiantly a tearjerker. I cried for the entire end of the movie, and for at least an hour afterward. I'm just warning you girls.... make sure that if your makeup smears when you cry, either don't wear any, or try a lighter load.<br/><br/>I would strongly recommend this movie. Mostly for women and girls, but it may be enjoyable for men and boys too.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was very well cast, and had a good storyline."

","I read the book first and it was OK for the summer evening reading. I read Miley Cyrus played the main character in the movie. I had never seen her playing before, but I thought, Ronnie could kinda looked like her - why not...<br/><br/>As soon as the movie started, I got so disappointed by her acting. I just could not believe her playing it. I could not believe her lips, her crying, her emotions. Nothing. The only thing I appreciated was the way she looked in the movie - that could be Ronnie :) and Miley's song at the end of the movie. That was nice.<br/><br/>However, the very first scene with Ronnie's brother - I was like, yes! this little one is exactly like in the book. I think, Ronnie's father was OK and Will, well he was OK. Did not have much to say in the movie. But I could believe the actor. <br/><br/>The movie was in many ways different from the book, but I didn't mind it.<br/><br/>All in all, I am happy to have read the book but I could do well without seeing the movie..."
"the-movie-guy","6","14","38","30 March 2010"," Touching story of a father reconnecting to his children
","(Synopsis) ""The Last Song"" is set in a small Southern beach town in Tybee Island, Georgia, where Steve (Greg Kinnear), a divorced father, gets a chance to spend the summer with his teenaged daughter Ronnie (Miley Cyrus) and his young son Jonah (Bobby Coleman). Ronnie would rather be in New York City than be in this hick town, especially with her father, who she believes abandoned her three years earlier. Steve tries to reconnect with Ronnie through their love of music. Steve was a concert pianist who loved teaching Ronnie how to play the piano. Ronnie became so good at playing, that Juilliard has offered her a scholarship. This is a story of family secrets that revolves around first loves and second chances.<br/><br/>(My Comment) This is a touching story of a father reconnecting to his children, and of his children learning the lesson of life. It shows how different types of relationships can end up breaking your heart and giving you pain and what you must do to mend your heart. I thought it was slow at the beginning of the movie, but it drew me in and I began to accept the characters. This is a good movie that shows all the trials and tribulations that teenagers go through in life. And you may even shed a tear at the end.

"WV_Babe_21","10","13","35","2 April 2010"," This was an AMAZING moving!
","I hate that critics are giving this moving so many bad reviews, it don't deserve it! Nicholas Sparks did an amazing job writing this story and the director did an awesome job making it come alive! People need to understand that this is Miley Cyrus's first big role away from Hannah Montana....where I have you she got to play a role that hit closer to home for her. She just needs time and encouragement to break away from her role on that show. She does have a talent at acting. I thought she did a pretty darn good job at this movie, these people who say she can't act....can they act? Have they tried? I pretty much can guess no on that one. As for the the kid playing the brother....he is so darn cute and really brought the brother to life! The dad was amazing as well! Liam he is going places in his acting, he did a great job! As for the people who complain about the movie not touching base very well with the book....what do they expect? They have to turn a story with so many details into a hour or two movie! Duh! That's why they say watch the movie first then read the book so your not so disappointed with the movie. In all I give this movie a BIG two thumbs up! I will warn you of this though, you will cry, so bring tissues with you!"
"emily317","10","8","19","14 April 2010"," One Word: AWESOME!
","As an eighteen year old girl, I am in the target demographic for the book and movie of The Last Song. I think that the opinion of Miley Cyrus here is a 50/50. Some hate her while others love her. I'd tend to fall into the latter category. I can't believe the crux of hate reviews are about how Miley can't act or just general ""Miley shouldn't of played the role of Ronnie"" comments. Just so all those reviewers who wrote that know this: Nicholas Sparks WROTE the character of Ronnie FOR Miley.<br/><br/>Anyway since I'm one of those people that likes to see the real portrayal of a character from book to screen I COULDN'T wait to see it and after it was over see it again (I'm going w/ one of my BFFs to see today even though I'd seen it yesterday. I'd have to say the scene they let the baby turtles go was sweet. I think the portrayal of Ronnie was spot-on because that's pretty much how she acts in the beginning of the book. Another thing was the portrayal of Will's mom. In the book,she was really snobby and didn't approve of Ronnie, but in the movie, it was the TOTAL opposite. Overall, The Last Song was a good breakout role for Miley. Liam was for lack of a better word, perfect as Will. It didn't hurt that he looks good shirtless. The only thing that surprised me was that the whole Blaze getting caught on fire part didn't happen. It was a pretty big part of the book. Marcus was how I thought of him in my head. Bobby Coleman (Jonah) was hilarious! I'm SO getting it when it's out on DVD."
"Missfloratang","10","7","16","18 July 2010"," Awesome movie- awesome book!
","This is an awesome movie!!! After reading the book - which was even better- I was really excited to see it. And the movie, the portrayals everything is just perfect. The characters looked exactly like how I imagined. Miley Cyrus sure looked as rebellious as Ronnie in the book, (just the way I imagined) even though her acting still need more practice. Jonah ( Bobby Coleman) looked perfect for the 'little brother' kind of person in the movies,and I really love his character in both the book and the movie. As for Steve Miller, his character is good but I think he needs to look paler and more artistic,or more musician-ish. Anyways, this is a great movie, the production and everything. And I really recommend everyone to read the book as well, for books are always better and more specific than movies. I really wish that Nicholas Sparks could write more books like this to change the teenagers those days."

","I went into this movie with an open mind. While I am not a Miley Cryus fan I wanted to give her a chance.I had read the book several times, and think it is one of Nicholas Sparks best books. I had read the critics reviews and I think they were all dramatic. Miley did a wonderful job in this role, however I do think the little boy playing Jonah did better.Greg was amazing as the father and brought tears to my eyes throughout the whole ending of the movie. Liam? Well he is good looking and has his shirt off several times in the movie. But you would never know he has an Australian accent. Either way, do not judge this movie before you see it. You may come out just as surprised as I was."
"sbingman693","8","11","29","1 April 2010"," I'd see it again.
","I really wanted to see this movie for two reasons: I am a sucker for chick flicks and don't there are enough of them, so anything that Nicholas Sparks does is just amazing in my book. I found out that Hemsworth and Cyrus were dating. This meant that there would be true chemistry and there wouldn't be awkwardness.<br/><br/>I should say, I was very happy with their chemistry on screen. No awkwardness. Their scenes just seemed to flow with ease and were seemingly realistic to a real teenage romance.<br/><br/>Miley Cyrus's acting could have been better. However, I don't necessarily think it *should* have been better. Hannah Montana is more of an amateur show... you don't have to act well to get a kid's attention. This was Cyrus first 'professional' role and I think that she held her own. Was her performance amazing? No. But it wasn't completely awful. Some parts of the movie she had better acting then others... and I think that is what showed promise. Her acting will improve. I don't think we have to worry about that. Her performance, was none-the-less refreshing. I think that this was a difficult role to fulfill with a non-stop range of emotions. She was able to captivate all of those emotions, even if they weren't all perfect.<br/><br/>Liam Hemsworth... I thought he did wonderfully with his accent. I am from the South (South Carolina). I know my Southern accents. There were some points in the movie where he had a straight Southern accent. (No overdoing... it just sounded natural to me.) Other points it sounded like he just had an average American accent. I think, though, this was probably because of the way they filmed it. My guess is that the more he worked on the movie, the better his accent got. Anyways... he definitely NEVER overdid it, which is something that always bothers me. I was very happy with his accent.<br/><br/>As far as his performance... it was great... I loved it. Yes, it could have been better, but again, I don't think it should have been better. This was his first American film... and he held his own.<br/><br/>As far as the other parts of the movie... I felt the acting was fine. It wasn't awkward or non-realistic. The story line was good.<br/><br/>And my last comment...<br/><br/>They didn't destroy the South! I hate it when movies try to make the south out to be such a horrible place with stupid idiots. This movie didn't do that and I thoroughly enjoyed it.<br/><br/>I'd see it again."

","When I saw the preview to this movie I thought, ""Great. Another movie starring a singer. Troubled and Juilliard-worthy. She's trying to push those CDs out them doors eh?"" I was pleasantly surprised that that wasn't the case at all. Though the soundtrack is good, the movie isn't all about music. In fact, Ronnie (Miley Cyrus) hardly played the piano or sang. There weren't awkwardly contrived reasons for her to sing either. Well, maybe one. But it was done in good taste, and I applaud the screenplay and direction for going that route. I suspect that because the story had much more to it than a pop star lead.<br/><br/>As a grown man (or so I like to think), I'm a bit ashamed to say that Hannah Montana nearly made me cry in public. I had to take a breath. I held it in. Like a man should! :) Don't get me wrong. The acting wasn't mind-blowing, but it wasn't bad either. However, the story invoked feelings of wanting to be great at something and to passionate about it. Specifically, it made me want to be a great father.<br/><br/>Touche Hannah Montana Touche.

I got to know both main characters and found myself relating to each of them. Most of us remember our first love and that strong connection we had with them.

Many people dislike this movie because it stars Miley Cyrus, but people are going to like this movie, so them giving this movie a 1 is pointless because there are Miley fans who are going to watch it and buy it on DVD.

"crazy_rockkids_nothere","5","6","14","7 April 2010"," Pretty decent, it's not like we're dealing with a second round of Gigli or Glitter here
","So I saw this movie with a friend of mine tonight, who is a big Nicholas Sparks fan. Mid way through the movie, she turned to me and said ""If you haven't read the book, this probably makes little to no sense"". That statement pretty much covers this movie. I haven't read the book, so I knew pretty quickly I was watching a cliché and bad screen play. That being said, what seemed like a train wreck in progress turned out being pretty decent.<br/><br/>If anyone deserves something good out of this flick, it is Greg Kinnear (who plays the father character) and Bobby Coleman (who plays Miley's brother). Both did fantastic with their roles. While the movie was filled to the brim with cliché's and excessive montages, these two were able to grab your attention in a positive way. Bobby was exceptional on making you feel for his character on an emotional level, which for a child actor is a rare ability. Greg Kinnear reminded us why he is an underrated actor, eliciting laughter (the good kind) in the most unexpected and emotional places, while at the same time making you feel for his character.<br/><br/>As for Miley; I'll be blunt, she wasn't that great. However, I must give credit where it's due: While she displayed limited range, she did not once overact, even if the scene was 'begging' for it. Miley definitely showed a presence in the movie, and while she wasn't the best thing about it, her performance was hardly the worst. Her performance was fairly uneven; bad at some points, but fairly good at others. I think with more practise/instruction, Cyrus could definitely become a better actress.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd give this flick a 5/10. It was decent. It's nothing to write home about, but it's not an abomination of Gigli or Glitter proportions either. Despite it's weak screen play and abundance of cliché's, it did hit several people in the theatre in an emotional way, which is kinda the whole point."
"j-jarvis","10","9","24","7 April 2010"," I cried like a baby!
","I'm so sick of reading bad reviews of Miley Cyrus' new movie, 'The Last Song'.<br/><br/>Before seeing the movie I'd only ever seen Miley in her Hannah Montana / Miley Stewart role and thought she was funny but never had any strong opinion on her until I saw this movie. I loved it! After seeing the movie I spent that weekend reading Miley's biography of her life to date and now have much more respect for her and understand her way better as a person. She is much more mature than everyone thinks she is. If you read her book I think you would see that.<br/><br/>I think her maturity shines through so much in this movie no matter what everyone has said. How can you not watch this and then watch Hannah Montana and see a difference? It takes a lot for an actor or actress to be able to pull off children's comedy and drama as well. And when I say drama, I mean it! I cried like a baby the whole way through the second half of the movie and that sort of emotion totally comes from the acting. I felt an emotional connection to the character, especially Miley's character Ronnie and her Dad during the hard times. I thought they were great and the father / daughter relationship was so believable. And of course so was relationship between Ronnie and Will. Miley and Liam have amazing chemistry and yeah, it was cheesy in parts but it was a drama / romance so of course it was going to be. I loved it.<br/><br/>I think too many people have just gone into this movie hating on Miley Cyrus or better yet, refusing to dive into the story because she is in it - that is after all, what films are there for, as an escape from reality or what is real. If you sat in the theatre and stopped being so macho I guarantee you would cry, or at least tear up a little! <br/><br/>I look forward to seeing Miley Cyrus in many more movies to come. She's great!"

","Now I read this book to see the movie. Nicholas Sparks is amazing, I love all of his books, this one included. However since he wrote the screenplay first I was kind of confused, that doesn't make sense. He added more parts to the book than in the movie. If you read the book I was upset that Pastor Harris isn't in the film. He played a big role in the book. Always when Blaze catches on fire and Will saves her isn't in the film either and some other things got cut out here and there. Miley Cyrus- is Miley Cyrus. She wasn't made to be an actress, she's a musician even though she wants to become an actress. She was okay, people just need to know that this role was written FOR HER. Her agent asked Nicholas Sparks to write a story with her as the main character, so no one else would've played Ronnie. Will was amazing. Liam Hemsworth is going to be an amazing actor. You wouldn't have known he was Australian, he got the southern accent down to a T. The dad was perfect, I love Greg Kinnear. Jonah was incredible. That little boy is going to have an amazing career. I was bawling whenever he spoke about his father. The mother was okay. They also cut out when you found out that Ronnie's mother cheated on her father. I thought that was a big part of the book. Miley also says the word bit*** in the movie. I was so surprised bahahaha Miles. All in all it was pretty good. I cried a lot, it makes me think of my dad a lot. I love the Last Song."

","The movie actually surprised the heck out of me. I purposely did not watch it because I am not a fan of Miley. But tonight for whatever reason I decided to watch it. It is the first movie to make me cry in a very long time. I thought that she and Chris Helmsworth had great chemistry and the love was believable. Then I look at IMDB and 9 years after the movie came out Miley and Chris are newlyweds. The little brother was amazing, I thought his acting was great. Of course it goes without saying that Greg Kinnear play the part fantastic. I do agree that most of the bad reviews were because they were not a fan of Miley. This was a lesson to a 55 yr old woman to never judge a book or in this case a movie by its cover or to judge it for the girl that has made some poor choices in her life. Shame on me for judging...."
"kriztinoiz_91","6","1","1","8 May 2010"," i'm very disappointed
","first of all, i'm sorry for my English, i'm from Mexico and i just saw the last song on the theathre, i red the book a month ago, so, the first thing i want to say is that the movie is so different than the book, first, blaze never went on fire, the characters of Scott, Marcus and pastor Harris were so important in the book but in the movie they didn't were, miley's acting was painful, the characther of Ronnie had so much potential and miley destroyed it, it was my favorite character, in the movie it didn't show how Ronnie and blaze met, you just had to figured out that they were friends, in the movie they didn't put that Marcus was responsible of the fire in the church, in the book it explain that will and Ronnie had 2 almost time to get intimus but like was a Disney movie and miley was a main character obviously it cut it out, in the book blaze put CD's on Ronnie's bag and in the movie were earrings, in the book at the middle of it, was about Ronnie stoled the CD's and she went to court, but in the movie it did't, the dad just talk to the owner shop and that's it. the few scenes that was a little bit funny, miley killed it, it supposed to be a comedian from Hannah Montana, so, that shows that she's not funny, and the worst of all, the character of Jonah was more believable that the character of Ronnie. in the book it says that at the beginning when will crashes into Ronnie and split her milkshake, Ronnie bought a nemo shirt and in the movie, there was no nemo shirt and i was looking for it. the only thing that saves this movie is Liam hems worth if you are a woman or you're gay or whatever you can see it but he act awful to. so i'm very disappointed of this movie, and other thing, it's supposed to be a breakout performance to miley so what the hell was she singing in the movie? it was an acting performance not a singer performance, it was a romantic movie not a musical."
"acforshage","6","7","18","2 April 2010"," It's never going to be as good as the book...
","Well while I didn't think this was the best movie ever, I thought it was a great tear-jerker and it was a good story.<br/><br/>I do think people need to quit complaining about it not being as good as the book... IT NEVER WILL BE. 2 hours is simply not enough time to develop the characters you know and love or include all the events that happen in the book. So that needs to be put aside, or you people need to not read the book before you go see it. I quit doing that mid-Harry Potter series... I realized re-reading the book right before would only add to my disappointment when I saw the movie. Why not be pleasantly surprised when you read the book after seeing the movie?<br/><br/>On the note of the actors, Miley has her moments in this movie, but her more tearful moments I found to be laughable. Pushing ""Will"" away? What was that? I do think the scenes she was good in, the scenes with Liam where she is happy, were easy for her, considering she's dating him. In my opinion, she should focus more on music, rather than her acting career. Liam did a good job, he was that cute volleyball player that every girl hopes to have a summer romance with. I didn't love the poor little rich boy approach, I feel like that is fairly overused. That isn't his fault though. The dad and the brother I LOVED. I thought the dad did a good job at being funny and being sick. The brother was that great comedic relief that the movie needed. Very cute. ""Blaze"" and her boyfriend couldn't have annoyed me more, I think that whole extra plot line could have been left out. <br/><br/>This movie is a Nicholas Sparks movie, so don't expect something happy, it's not gonna happen. However, I recommend seeing it, but don't go in with all these expectations for it being another The Notebook. It's a good movie, not great."
"xdreamonpink","5","7","18","1 April 2010"," If you read the book, be prepared for a lot of disappointment
","Before I say anything at all, I should say the reason that I read this book and saw this film. I am 24 years old, and I bought tickets to see Miley Cyrus in November of 2009. During the concert there was a part where she basically plugged this movie, and played 'When I Look At You' and discussed how much making it changed her for the better. I, honestly, had so much fun at this concert and felt like I really saw her in her element -- I became a believer. I wanted to go out and buy this book before seeing the film. I loved that her family was involved every step of the way.<br/><br/>Now, I was very moved by this book. I laughed, I cried, I felt genuine emotion. I, like Ronnie, have shut myself down towards other people -- especially my father. And before it was even a love story to me, it was important to me because of the family aspect. I was tremendously disappointed that the reason for her parents divorce was cut out of the film. To me, it was such a humanization in the book that I couldn't believe it was taken out of the film. But, as all books and movies are -- things are changed.<br/><br/>It's a sweet film, it really is. It's quite abrupt at times -- for a film that was delayed being released it really could have used a little more time in the editing department. I actually found Miley to be believable -- HOWEVER, I also wished that the parts that were taken out were put back in if only just to show how deep she could possibly get with this character.<br/><br/>Another part of the film that's not really explained is Steve (Ronnie's father) and his relationship with the church, his religion itself, and the priest (who is also not mentioned in the film.) Greg Kinnear is a fantastic actor, and I would've enjoyed seeing him explore his character more.<br/><br/>The highlight for me was really Bobby Coleman as Ronnie's brother, Jonah. He, to me, was the most authentic in his role. When the film takes it's dramatic turn at the end, he's the one who got me misty-eyed. He has a great career ahead of him.<br/><br/>Liam Hemsworth is fine, and definitely nice to look at. He has great charm, but he also doesn't have a lot of story to work with. Like my problem with Kinnear's part, I wish they had given him more of his story to work with.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a decent movie. It's pretty generic -- not something I'll probably see over and over again, but not anything I'd ask for my money back on either. It's not life changing or poignant in any way -- and I'd almost hoped it would be."
"illybabii87","10","12","36","31 March 2010"," Fantastic movie! Miley Cyrus at her best!
","The Last Song has such a remarkable story and a fantastic cast to go along with it. The summer romance that Ronnie finds herself in is so adorable. The movie is also very realistic and can get very emotional as well. I was very surprised at Ronnie's behavior towards her father at the beginning of the movie but loved how she started shedding her tough girl skin by being a loving daughter towards the middle of the movie. As for the ending, let's just say it's a surprise and twist you wouldn't expect but at the same time, you can kind of predict it. I loved this movie and plan on buying the DVD.<br/><br/>Miley Cyrus did phenomenal. Liam Hemsworth is a major star in the making. They make the perfect on-screen couple and off-screen couple as well.

"geoffgee","7","5","12","3 May 2010"," A moderately sad film with Ms Cyrus giving a surprisingly solid performance.
","I was really impressed with the acting quality of several of the actors and actresses in this film. The young boy who plays Jonah (Bobby Coleman) does a magnificent job of portraying a youngster fighting his own inner turmoil whilst bravely trying to maintain some kind of peace between his sister and their father. Greg Kinnear does a decent job of playing a man delicately balancing his desire to regain his daughter's affection against her determination to remain stubbornly distanced from him. Miley Cyrus also delivers a surprisingly mature performance; one that suggests to me that, if she keeps performances as good as this up, she will most certainly be able to ensure for herself a successful post Hannah Montana portfolio of roles. Other character parts are all adequately and believably played. The screenplay is well paced with plenty of interesting plot details and a there is a good selection of more or less likable characters with whom to empathise (or otherwise). Cinematography is unremarkable and unobtrusive - yet vibrant and colourful. The film also benefits from incorporating quite an interesting theme (one which the Ronnie character in particular has to come to terms with) as events unfold and difficult decisions have to be taken. Please don't be put off by the ridiculously low rating this film has on IMDb for some reason. I highly recommend this film to anyone who appreciates poignant drama, sensitive acting and gorgeous beach settings."

"jimchudnow-1","7","10","32","29 March 2010"," Writing on the ""FULL-SHELL""
","Nicholas Sparks has written a number of popular books made into movies, including ""The Notebook"". This is his first book that he himself has ADAPTED for the screen, & it also is an attempt by Miley Cyrus to break away from her ""TV-show singer"" image  Miley stars as a 17-year-old called Veronica 'Ronnie' Miller, & she is usually an ""ANGRY"" character thru much of the movie. That's caused by the divorce of her parents Kim (Kelly Preston) & her composer – pianist father Steve (Greg Kinnear), the fact that her mom is soon to remarry, & especially because her dad didn't ""back"" her when she was accused of SHOPLIFTING in New York  As the film starts, Miley & her 12-ish kid brother Jonah (Bobby Coleman) are being brought by Kelly to spend the summer at Greg's seashore home on Tybee Island, Georgia. Jonah is very attached to his Dad (& vice versa), whereas Miley acts very cold & ""distant""  Thruout the movie, Greg (who's trying to write a song) keeps trying to get CLOSER to Miley. He's very disappointed in the way she's such a good pianist that she's been accepted into the Julliard School in New York, but she nevertheless doesn't care to GO there (or have any further schooling)  As time goes on, Miley meets various of the ""locals"" in town: a love-obsessed girl named Blaze (Carly Chaikin) who wrongly thinks Miley is trying to make a ""play"" for her miserable punk boyfriend Marcus (Nick Lashaway); a cute blonde-haired guy named Will Blakelee (Liam Hemsworth) who loves to play beach volleyball with his friend Scott (Hallock Beals) who works with him at a car repair place, etc  Initially, irate vegetarian Miley is put-off at the way Liam tries to get to know her, & all she really seems to care about is trying to protect some endangered loggerhead sea-turtle eggs that she has found near her dad's home  When she finds out that Liam works part time in nature-protecting activities for the Georgia Aquarium, she realizes they have something in ""common"" & starts to ""WARM-UP"" to him -- or, you might say, breaks out of her OWN ""shell"" a bit Little-by-little, he starts to become her ""first love"", despite the jealous actions of his ex-girlfriend Ashley (Melissa Ordway) & his arrogant rich mom Susan (Kate Vernon)  Miley's kid brother Bobby happily bonds with Greg, learning from him how to work with stained glass to help repair a church Greg thinks he's caused to burn down But, as time goes on, a CRISIS arises in the household which deeply affects certain family members  Will a SECRET Liam is keeping affect his relationship with Miley? Will the family CRISIS impact Miley & her future plans? Will the turtles HATCH safely and return to the sea? Will Miley get CLOSER to Greg & return to caring about her piano-playing ability? Will the ""SONG"" get properly finished?  Understand, this is NOT a ""musical"", & Miley is NOT playing her long-running ""Hannah Montana"" character. A guy I know felt Miley did a POOR acting job in this-- but, I felt, she played the character as WRITTEN-- an upset, irritated teenager unsure of her relationships & her future, who slowly starts to ""open-up"" when some love enters her life --, & she did that decently Plus, Liam & Greg do good jobs, & Bobby is very good as the kid brother  A number of women in the audience reported that they were near TEARS at times in watching the movie, & thus quite ""affected"" by it. And, even a pre-teen boy in the audience (who happens to play piano) found it interesting  I feel it's true that the film in many ways doesn't have a ""wide-ranging"" story, & is sort of simplistic at times (& somewhat implausible in the way Miley is invited to jump in a main pool at Atlanta's Georgia Aquarium to swim along with Liam near the whale shark & other fishes)  But, the film was ""pleasant"" & ""WORKS"" for the main audience it's likely ""aimed"" at, namely women (particularly young ones) & those who like love stories on various levels (in family situations and with a first love) So, I'm judging & rating it accordingly (tho there might be ""protesters"" marching in front of my seaside cottage as I'm scribbling in the sand)"
"shlinder","10","9","28","2 April 2010"," Great Movie
","I really liked the movie. We will be buying the DVD when it comes out. I really like that there was no sexual scenes in it. It was a very clean and healthy movie. It touched on the pain that children suffer with divorce and showed that it is OK not to give in to peer pressure regarding substance abuse. It had a double love theme. The girl and her boyfriend and the girl with her dad. This was a tear-jerker for sure. The plot could have been fine-tuned a bit and the lines could have been better written. But that is not to take away from the dynamic of the movie. It was very moving. Some things were unrealistic like a millionaire's son working in the brake shop and being quite humble. It was very touching that her father dies as she is playing the song he wrote for her."

"Leahrt","6","4","10","5 September 2010"," Start rating this movie properly
","Usually you're really disappointed when you watch a movie, that's based on a book. I read the Last Song before I saw the movie, and when I heard that Miley Cyrus was going to play Ronnie Miller in the movie-production, I was officially mad. <br/><br/>Therefore I chose not to see the movie, directly I judged that the movie would suck! Basically! I read then the book again, on my way over to USA, and I remembered that there actually was a movie, so I decided that once I'd hit Blockbuster I would rent it.<br/><br/>So I and my friends rented it, and I'd told myself to have no expectations at all, since it was a Miley Cyrus movie aka. Hannah Montana.<br/><br/>But the movie completely surprised me. Miley Cyrus didn't shine in this movie, in fact nobody shined – but there was still something to it. It followed the book so well, like really well – and Miley Cyrus looked like Ronnie.<br/><br/>You can say a lot about the acting, you can say that Miley sometimes sounded a little too Hannah Montana-ish, but I think she broke pretty much out of that shell, or at least she tried. <br/><br/>I have to disagree with all the people who think it's flat? What exactly - This is when I start thinking: I think a lot of people judged this movie by the fact that Miley Cyrus plays the lead role, if it had been Emma Roberts or Emily Browning, I think this movie would have gotten a totally different ratings. I cried, I laughed and I loved some parts of this movie. But it's not a Notebook .."
"DarkVulcan29","5","4","10","12 April 2010"," Miley Cyrus has got a long way to go.
","Miley Cyrus is trying to prove she is more than just a good singer, but she can be a good actress as well, but her acting needs some work, not that it was all bad, but it just was'nt real in spots. Trying to get away from Hannah Montana is gonna be a long road.<br/><br/>Now Liam Hensworth is alright his role, not just being a typical pretty boy. Liam and Miley have good chemistry, but not enough to make the movie interesting. Now Greg Kinnear is quite good as the dad, and so was Bobby Coleman as the little brother, and both of them give quite good performances. And it does have nice scenery. But the rest of the film just does'nt do much, some of the characters are not very interesting. But it was'nt all bad, but was'nt as good as Dear John.<br/><br/>I think in time Miley Cyrus acting skills will improve."

","So I read the book last week because I wanted to read it before I saw it. I watched this movie today and I must say I was blown away at how good it was. I loved all the characters in it and it stayed really close to the book. All these people who say that it's not good are just being not smart because I loved it and thought that it was totally worth it. This is the best Nicholas Sparks movie since A Walk To Remember. I would tell anyone who asked how good it was to go and c it then read the book. I can't believe that some think that Miley doesn't act good in this movie. I thought she was very convinceable in this movie and so was the kid who played jonnah."
"drpakmanrains","8","7","22","4 April 2010"," Better Than I Expected
","I'm definitely in a minority demographic, a 69 year old man who took his long time lady friend to see this because she loved ""The Notebook"", and as we age, we tend to like sweet, somewhat corny, love stories. I have never seen or heard any ""Hannah Montana"" material, but the review in Entertainment Weekly gave this movie a ""B"", so we went. I thought Miley Cyrus did an okay job, and Liam, her love interest, while too perfect, typified these types of movies. However, Greg Kinnear, and particularly, Bobby Coleman, who I later learned was the child star of ""Martian Child"",which I liked, were both excellent, and gave the predictable story some really fine moments. It isn't meant to be a ""great film"", just a pleasant teen first-love story, with a little pathos added, like the Erich Segal stories of the 70's. I think critics that panned this, while praising movies like ""There Will Be Blood"", are writing more for themselves than for most of the people who actually attend movies regularly. I really enjoyed this movie, and while it had some shortcomings, overall we both had a very nice time. I recommend it as a date movie that will make you laugh a little and shed a few tears, while hopefully having a good time too."
"tyler-foreva","7","5","14","12 April 2010"," Definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen!
","What is with the negative critical reception. I absolutely loved this film and I am definitely anticapating the DVD release.<br/><br/>My view on Miley's performance was definitely mixed. All the negative reviews of her performance expected me to find her terrible. She was no where near it. She did pretty well for her most mature role to date. Her voice was definitely noticeable, sounding at times trying to hard to distance her origonal voice. But you could definitely still hear that southern girl inside of her. She definitely brang it with her dramatic scenes and deserved more that what people gave her for. The girl gave me shivers down my spine.<br/><br/>The film's real breakout star was Bobby Coleman. This kid brang it. He was so believable and absolutely had me crying. The kid brang on the tears and definitely outshined his other cast. Him and Miley had great chemistry and absolutely adored the scenes between them.<br/><br/>Another note to newcomer Carly Chaikin as the rebellious Blaze. She definitely made the performance her own and was great. Would love to see more from her in the future.<br/><br/>Other notes to Aaron Zigman for his great music score and managed to make every song go with the film.<br/><br/>I absolutely loved this movie and I wish this film had a more positive reaction, because this seriously deserved it."
"d_mosley","6","6","18","4 April 2010"," The Last Song is impressive, yet seems rushed
","Before I watched The Last Song tonight, I came in with an unbiased opinion of Ms. Cyrus; I came out with the same opinion. I read the novel before I watched the film, so I knew somewhat that was going to happen; Mr. Nicholas Sparks wrote the screenplay before the novel, so something was going to be different right? Of course. Though not much was changed, I felt they could have spent more time with the characters, and shown the audience more of an emotional connection they brought to the big screen. I've got to say though, Miley Cyrus handled herself quite well for her first ""non Hannah"" film. They we're certain parts of the movie that was somewhat, corny? For example, ""How did you become so nice? Nice guy school or something?"" I thought to myself, that's an awful line. Although good for some of the audience that was attending the film.<br/><br/>The end of the film was a beautiful tragedy with a Father-Daughter relationship at it's peak. The connection Kinnear and Cyrus share is believable; and honestly, more equipped than what I thought I was going to see. Bobby Coleman was wonderful. I loved his lines, and the emotional scenes? I was impressed.<br/><br/>All in all, this film was not the greatest of all time, and nor was it supposed to be. It's a film about losing your way, and finding your way back home. It's about first loves, heartbreak, and tragedy; all fit into a impressive Nicholas Sparks adaption. I for one, am glad I went and experienced what this film had to offer."

","The movie is all about the love and affection between people. The story line also covers the mistakes done by a person. It really brings the tears from so many people.<br/><br/>The movie was so nice when we concern about the relationship between family members. It has a deep mixture of emotions. The character Jonah miller played by the Booby Coleman was superb and his deep adieu to his father was the only reason why most of the people cry. The character played by the GREG was so nice which liveliness to the movie.The story is mainly based on the Ronnie character played by the Cyrus who shows different shade in the movie.<br/><br/>Basically most of the people don't like this movie because there are no commercial elements to entertain. The movie was slow in certain areas and it has a great sentimental workout at the ending. It does not have any kind of comedy. We will see the same kind of locations so many times in the movie.<br/><br/>But coming to the conclusion-------------<br/><br/>It is a typical sentimental movie where we can predict story. It is one of the good sentimental movie but doesn't good as ""Rudy"" or ""The Shawshank Redemption""<br/><br/>""IF YOU WANT TO SEE A SENTIMENTAL MOVIE YOU GO WATCH IT ................IT REALLY SATISFY YOU"""

","I have always relied on IMD B before I go and see a movie. I mean who wants to waste their precious hard earned money as well as time to sit in front of a boring and poor movie. IMDb is where I have always turned, but you guys have let me down here. Having got through ¾ of Nicholas Sparks book ""The Last Song"" I couldn't wait to see the movie. It looked to be so good. However, from your recommendations and ratings from all the users, I was expecting a hopeless movie with only the title to recommend itself as being a Nicholas Sparks novel. The amazing author who brought us The Notebook and Dear John as well as many others. I was ready for a disappointment in Miley Cyrus acting. How wrong all of you were. Not being a massive Miley Cyrus fan of Hanna Montana, I was expecting the worst. However, the girl came through. What are all of you talking about? Are you expecting an actress with academy award written all over it, or what? I think that's what all us critics expect these days. We are the critics too. We complain about everything. Are you jealous or what? If the story is not for you, then I suggest you find out what it is about first of all, before you pay for the ticket. And those of you expecting to see a Hanna Montana type movie in the cinema, umm, should also find out about the story. I learnt from this movie too not to stereotype people. I think the story was great. Miley did well. I am just so disappointed in where they changed the story line. Don't like when they change the story. It is the directors and writers fault. When I go to watch a movie on a book. I don't expect for those in the movie world to put there own spin on it. What is so wrong with copying the book. Why change the story? It just makes people upset anyway and the original is usually better. Maybe it keeps the writers in a job, if they feel they can change something of the movie. No, don't do it I tell you! Think all of you how many good books have been ruined by some silly writer changing the story line for the movie. I admit that sometimes it is need to fit into a 2hr block, but please make minimal adjustments."

","I've never seen so much hate because of so much overreactions. Honestly.<br/><br/>And the only reason is Miley. Because she is in this movie. Because, hadn't she been in it, hadn't there been so much hate. Believe me. This is a typical Nicolas Sparks story, and his stories are highly appreciated. Yet... this story doesn't seem to do. And for what reason? For Miley. And nothing annoys me more than people hating a movie because of the actors. How much can you let something affect you? Seriously? How much? Well, here it is. This movie shows just how much. Miley did a fair job. And this comes from one of the biggest Miley-dislikers. I've never liked her, but I wasn't going to let her affect me from watching this movie. And, I can admit to it, unlike many others, that she DID NOT RUIN THIS MOVIE. Sure, I can say that someone else most surly could've played better, but she did good. And the fact that people complain that she made 'Ronnie' an annoying character, is ridiculous. Ronnie was supposed to be an annoying character. She's a teenager, for Christ's sake! And all this annoyance was just to prove that she was going through some hurt. And that was how Nicolas wanted to portray her. This movie was Miley's own wish, and she wanted to play. And, guess what? She played. <br/><br/>I'm not saying this movie is Oscar-worthy, but damn, it's NOT bad! In any way. People are just too blind with their Miley hate that they can't even open their eyes for one second to see the truth of the movie. And it's good. It's a beautiful story. And I find it such a shame that people can't see that. Really, such a shame."

","16 June 2013. This teen pop star Miley Cyrus and Greg Kinnear movie vehicle presents a series of consistently connected family and community life issues that while predictable are intertwined in such a fashion as to make them entertaining, believable, and emotional, and meaningfully relevant. While one could stereotype or be turned off by Miley's character, there is something that seems more significant going here and while the many plot tragedies that continue to build up in this movie, there is oddly enough a rather authentic possibility of such events occurring in with such compelling convergence. This movie deals with the aftermath of divorce and its impact on children, about family, about coming of age, impulsive decision-making, blame and gossip making, jealously, love, hate, making mistakes, and death and forgiveness. There's a whole bunch of stuff going on in this movie in it all something makes sense and never becomes overly juvenile nor nauseatingly repetitive or crisis just for crisis sakes.<br/><br/>What is particularly fascinating is that this popular teen format shot in the traditional classic mass audience cinematic photographic and directorial style found in much movie such as Uptown Girls (2003) or Fly Away Home (1996) Whale Rider (2002) that have at their core a animal preservation themes unlike the more raw and gritty independent video approach such Margot at the Wedding (2007) or The Tree of Life (2011), it nevertheless captures the emotive and intellectual interest by its subject matter and what appears to be a close to reality outcomes of each scene as well as the connections between them. The biggest weakness if one can could it that is that this movie doesn't have the focused emotive intensity as one finds in such movies as Where the Lilies Bloom (1974) or the innovative and dazzling cinematic imagination as found in Moonrise Kingdom (2012) or the scintillating and chilling factor as in The Lovely Bones (2009) or the big screen epic nature as the historical Chinese themed The Joy Luck Club (1993), the more layered emotional diverse comedy drama of Little Miss Sunshine (2006) or even perhaps the singular anguishing search of meaning as Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close (2011). This movie might be more associated with the family dramas as Georgia Rule (2007) or Nanny Diaries (2007)."

When you factor in turtle babies, deadly illness, and stained glass windows (yes, there was a reason for that church fire at the start), and you have a formulaic teen romance with some weird stuff in it.<br/><br/>Miley Cyrus does sulky bad-tempered teen, then executes a 180 degree turn and does smiley happy teen in a movie which saw the start of the off-screen romance with Liam Hemsworth, here executing the teen hunk boyfriend role.

"destinylives52","6","0","0","12 July 2017"," A Substandard Nicholas Sparks Story
","Another offering by Nicholas Sparks, ""The Last Song"" stars Miley Cyrus as a teen girl who, along with her younger brother, is sent to live with her estranged father (played by Greg Kinnear) for the summer. And now, for the clichés: Cyrus has a huge attitude because she hates her father for divorcing her mom; Kinnear is the nice, protective father who is desperate to reconnect with his daughterand he has a secret that will alter the lives of his children forever; the son is a smart-ass who is insightful for his age; Cyrus, despite her anger issues and raggedy looks, will attract the local, young stud (played by Liam Hemsworth); Hemsworth turns out to be more than a pretty face — he is a guy with a heart of gold, and he is looking for ""the one""; Cyrus can't stand Hemsworth — or so she pretends — then starts to like himthen hates him again for withholding a secret from her that affects her father (who she used to hate but now kind of likes)then likes Hemsworth again because she forgives him and she really really likes him andwell, you get the idea.<br/><br/>The worst things about ""The Last Song"" are the numerous clichés mentioned above, Cyrus' lack of serious acting skills, the lack of on screen chemistry between Cyrus/Hemsworth, and the forced, goofball scenes that are supposed to make the audience go ga-ga for these two young lovers. The ""meet cute"" part isn't cute at all, it is corny as hell and made me cringe that someone could write something so bad for a Hollywood movie. Then there is the actor who plays the young son: his constant, constipation face is both funny and annoying. Add the tears and the snot during the dramatic moments and it's just all too much.<br/><br/>Saving this movie from a much lower grade is Kinnear's very good acting. It's natural, subtle in most cases, and very believable. Hell, he was my favorite character.<br/><br/>My most memorable, movie moment of ""The Last Song"" is when Kinnear's secret is revealed. Sparks fans won't be shocked as they know how this writer operates.<br/><br/>Sodo I recommend this movie to Sparks fans? Yes, because I know that fans of Nicholas Sparks will want to gobble up anything he writes, even if many say it is a substandard piece of work. Fans will always need to watch for themselves. So, watch ""The Last Song,"" and see for yourself. Everybody else, there are much better rom-com/dramas out there.<br/><br/>Mannysmemorablemoviemoments"

","Just as Zac Efron did with films such as 'Me and Orson Welles', fellow teen star Miley Cyrus uses 'The Last Song' as a bridge between Disney kiddie films to adult roles.<br/><br/>And while this is admirable I think the fact that she teamed up with Nicholas Sparks, a man who seems quite happy to repeat his 'Notebook' trick for as long as the public can stomach it, for this film.<br/><br/>It's sappy, it's overly sentimental, and overall despite the best efforts of Cryrus, this film isn't that good.<br/><br/>Cyrus does well in her role, and holds it all together well, but I don't think this was the best choice of project."

","The first thing that needs to be done is; getting rid of Miley Cyrus. I don't necessarily have a problem with her per se, it's just that, the role of Ronnie was way above her expertise. She just didn't do that character any justice whatsoever.<br/><br/>Secondly. Change the director and rework the script. Keep, but elevate Liam's performance, and Bobby Coleman (Jonah), either needs to go, or work hard at his overacting.<br/><br/>Thirdly. Keep Greg Kinnear. He could've been better, but was terrific and also, keep the deeper story.<br/><br/>All these changes, and a few more here and there, The Last Song is prime Oscar material.<br/><br/>A story wasted with clichés, overacting, somewhat choppy and unseasoned directing and a lead that just collapsed under what still wasn't, but could've been, dramatic art.<br/><br/>The story was on point, it just needed the right nurturing, alas."

","I have seen many people saying the movie left out so much but Just so everyone know, Nicholas Sparks wrote the movie script before the book. So obviously he had to add more detail and events into the book to make it long ya know. So the movie was good. Yes it didn't have some big events in the book but the movie was written first. So it was a great movie! The book is my favorite book now and i was a little afraid to see Miley Cyrus as Ronnie but she did a wonderful job. Great movie i wouldn't take little kids though All in all 8/10. Nicholas Sparks is an amazing writer and this is one of his better books. The Last Song was 10x better than the movie Dear John."

","Since 2006, Miley Cyrus has capture the heart of both younger or older girls since her famous hit TV series Hannah Montana. But now...as her old show is coming close to an end soon with an upcoming next season, which is sure to be the last and final one, we take a new look on Miley that we haven't seen yet; something that's non-Disney and non-Hannah Montana related.<br/><br/>Based on the 2009 novel by Nicholas Sparks, who is known for making such wonderful love stories such as A Walk to Remember and The Notebook for example, makes something new! More romance yes, but it has an interesting turn about love.<br/><br/>In the movie, Miley plays a 17 year old girl named Veronica, Ronnie for short, whose is sent to her dad's beach home for the summer, meets and falls in love with a cute guy named Will, play by her real-life new boyfriend Liam Hemsworth. As the film goes on, Ronnie re-connects with her dad at a whole new level and learns the true meaning about relationships.<br/><br/>Now I haven't read all of Nicolas Sparks' stories yet, but I can tell that he seems very good at them when mostly all of his classic novels have been turn into movies. I have heard about The Last Song for a while now before the book came out one year ago, and I was happy to hear that the role for Ronnie was written directly for Miley Cyrus. I thought it was sweet! Her acting on the character was very bitchy in the beginning, but I think that's how it is with most of the kids that have to live with one single parent after their folks are divorced and it isn't easy for them to move on. Sometimes the things in life have to change and some of them can't be brought back but it can blossom into something new that's incredible! And I think that's the lesson of it when you're sitting down and watching the movie. The film will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and by the end of it when it's all over, it will put a warm glowing feeling into your heart.<br/><br/>I rank The Last Song a 9 out of a 10! Wonderful work Miley has ever done and I think she will keep making more beautiful stuff for many generations to come as long as she shall live!"

","To be honest i never really considered reading or watching the Last Song. I was just bored and wanted to DO something. Sparks never really interested me, but as i picked up the book i soon found i couldn't put it down. So i just had to watch the movie! The Last Song is about a summer like no other. Veronica,""Ronnie"", Miller is a young women who is forced into seeing her dad for the summer by her mother. Ronnie is far from thrilled. She blames her mom and dad's divorce on her fathers love for music, and therefore hates that she loves it too. When Ronnie and her brother arrive at her fathers house in North Carolina, she is determined to ruin the summer.<br/><br/>On the first day there though, after Ronnie runs away to the fair, she meets two very interesting strangers. The first is Will. The amazingly lovable boy. Then Blaze, the girl who runs with the wrong kind of crowd. Soon Ronnie finds her self mixed into it all, the love for Will, her fear and betrayal from Blaze, and her unconditional love and hate for her dad.<br/><br/>As the story raged on, i found i could guess at parts of the ending. Still i kept reading and again the story became more entrusting. It was painful at the end, and ill admit i cried like a baby, but it goes to show the hardships of life, the choices we don't always understand, and the love of a father. I loved also how Sparks intertwined God into it all. Ronnies dad Steve found God, and in the end, everything turned out better than id have hoped."

I really don't understand why everybody is bashing this film because of Miley Cyrus cause she wasn't that bad. Her acting really surprised me. It's about time she moves on from Hannah Montana. I already preordered the DVD because it is the type movie that I will want to watch over and over again. I especially liked the chemistry between Miley Cyrus and Liam Harmsworth.

","Let me start by saying the book was incredible. Maybe it doesn't have the greatest plot, but it really portrays the progression and journey of love. That was part of the movie's ""problem"", as a lot of scenes were rushed. There were also a few unnecessary scenes...as well as parts that should've been included, such as the father's faith. In agreement with pretty much everyone else on here, the young boy who played Jonah has a bright future ahead of him. He really brought emotion to the film. Miley needs a little work on her serious acting, but it can't be an easy transition from Disney to this. The movie didn't flow as well as it could have, but it was still decent! I did shed some tears - not exactly sure whether that was because I knew what was coming, or if the film itself was the cause."
"DeltaNu","9","6","23","1 April 2010"," Positively Surprised
","Before seeing this movie I wasn't surprised to read negative reviews for it. After all, we're talking about Miley Cyrus here, who is the number one celebrity of her age group and fame often brings overly harsh criticism.<br/><br/>I did not read the book, so I'm just going to judge the movie. I knew it'd be romantic and I knew it'd be sad. That's what Nicholas Sparks is usually all about. If you don't like that, this isn't going to be your kind of film.<br/><br/>That being said, I was very positively surprised by the credit given to the feelings and abilities of young adults in this movie. There is often a kind of prejudice that teenagers' cannot have complex feelings that should be taken seriously. This story is all about a young adult, though, and the movie deals with her first love as well as her relationship with her family, and how she handles loss. There are very few movies that explore these issues seriously and solely from the point of view of the young adult, which was very refreshing to me.<br/><br/>I was also impressed by Miley's performance. Hannah Montana didn't require a lot of serious emotions, so I was curious to see how she would handle this material. Especially in the scenes with Kinnear (who is an awesome actor) she is very believable. Pretty much everyone in the movie theater was crying. If you get that type of response from your audience, you did your job.<br/><br/>I also felt myself smiling and even grinning during the more lighthearted scenes, which also indicate great performances. Eliciting emotions in your viewers is what acting is all about. Unlike many other actresses of her generation, Miley isn't afraid to not look perfect at all times (which would have weakened her performance). She pouts and storms and cries and laughs out loud, all the while assuring the audience of her natural charms.<br/><br/>This movie is not super-exciting or full of action. It's about people's feelings. It's calm and melancholy and cute and sad. If you like that kind of movie you should go see this!"

Usually I don't like movies with low votes but this time I must confess I didn't found nothing I didn't like in this movie. I liked the story, it was emotional and also educational. The trailer was too similar with the older Miley movie Hannah Montana the Movie, but the story is actually totally different.<br/><br/>Also no bad words about Miley and her acting thing and talents. I think she's different kind of person as we have used to with people and the difference is good, not bad :) My theory is that Miley have got much attention from youths so some older or even a little foolish people think it's flat to like someone so famous. Similar case to Britney Spears or Aqua. But it's not a shame to like someone if u really like what you see not just watch and listen what's popular.

Even if her acting wasn't Oscar-worthy, it was a huge step up from her previous acting roles.<br/><br/>I also thought Greg Kinnear (Ronnie's Dad) did an excellent job with his character. Liam Hemsworth (Will) was pretty good in his role, too. It's nice to see a really tall actor on the screen for a change.<br/><br/>I didn't feel that the movie was rushed at all, but actually thought the pace was perfect and was glad the ending wasn't dragged out any more.<br/><br/>For those of you who don't know, the screen play for the movie was written before the book, so it seems unfair to critique the movie based on the book.<br/><br/>I've read the book, too, but I like the movie more. I think a bunch of the bad reviews the movie has been getting aren't fair- they are either comparing the book to the movie (which, as I said, doesn't seem right), or berating Miley Cyrus's acting skills.<br/><br/>But I don't care what the other reviews say.

"mford12","9","5","21","4 April 2010"," The movie was excellent!!!
","I read a lot of negative reviews on The Last Song on IMDb before going to see it in theaters today and I have to admit that I was a little skeptical on how Miley Cyrus would be without her Hannah Montana persona to lean on, but her performance in this movie is sensational and portrays the life of a teenager changing into a young woman when she is forced to grow up quickly and without warning. The performances of nearly every actor in this movie was great and the actor who played Jonah was excellent! The screenplay for the movie was created before Nicholas Sparks even wrote the novel which is why the movie contains some differences than the book, and even without some key parts of the novel the movie was still entertaining and great to watch. The performance of Miley Cyrus was awesome, she played the role of Ronnie exactly how I imagined the character; edgy and mean layering her exterior, but having a soft heart which she shows with the grace of a promising actress. Her costars Liam Hemsworth and Greg Kinnear are equally as charming and great on the screen, completing a great film. If you are looking for a great love story that can make you laugh and cry along with the characters in the movie then this is definitely a worthy watch!"

Ronnie's father seems to be struggling with cancer, and her mother wants them to spend the summer with him before he dies. Although in the beginning of the movie, Ronnie starts off as a disrespectful, unappreciative brat teenager in the beginning, she soon starts to enjoy the island her father lives on, and the time left with her father, and after meeting a young boy that she kiss's for the first time, and that later becomes her first love, realizes how important her father really is to her, and soon realizes how much her father really loves her. <br/><br/>I rather not spoil the movie's ending by letting you know what else happens, but thought that it had an interesting twist. <br/><br/>Jose F.

Miley actually made her best efforts to play Ronnie righteously (That can be told through the hospital scenes). While Liam's lack of acting skill made me feel Will is not so real, the actors who play Miley's father and her brother did a great job. Their performances really brought me to tears.

","'The Last Song' is another Nicholas Sparks adaption and one of the weaker ones. It's also been aimed at the teen angst audience with Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth as the romantic leads. On that note I guess if I was 20-ish years younger I would have enjoyed it more than I did.<br/><br/>The story is predictable and heart-wrenching, because well, Nicholas Sparks wrote it and he loves to torture us, following a father and daughter who after a long estrangement slowly reconnect over a summer in a small Southern beach town through their mutual love of music.<br/><br/>Cyrus plays the bitter wild-child Ronnie who falls for the often shirtless but very employable Will. They both have a lot of secrets and struggle to carry this movie as newbie actors. Miley giggles and squeals her way through the romance while Liam just stands about looking good.<br/><br/>I did enjoy Greg Kinnear as the doomed father and the boy playing his son was like a breathe of fresh air. As with all of Sparks' movies the coastal scenery is beautiful and the storyline about forgiveness, acceptance and family shamelessly manipulative but oh so addictive. 2/14/16"

It was the first of so far 2 writing efforts by Jeff Van Wie when he adapted the Nicholas Sparks novel for the screen. I loved ""A Walk to Remember"", I liked ""The Notebook"" and I have always been a fan of Miley Cyrus, so i was pretty curious about it. My hopes were smashed pretty quickly though. This was a disappointing movie. Cyrus plays her part solid and same goes for Kinnear, but most of the cast are really not good. However, the worst thing about this film is the script. It is packed with enough drama and tragedy for 3 films and at some point, it just stops feeling authentic: Hemsworth's brother, the protagonist's father, the arson plot, Chaikin's character etc. And what was up with that raccoon-turtle story on the beach? I guess that is supposed to be a metaphor on children who want to live after their parents left them alone? It's very pretentious and hey raccoons have to feed their kids too.<br/><br/>One of the worst moments was surely when Hemsworth's character actually turns out to work for the aquarium. Talk about really cheesy and unrealistic coincidence. And sadly, the whole love story did not feel too authentic either, especially when they meet and are not a couple yet. It's not romantic, it is really just cringeworthy. This is particularly disappointing as Cyrus and Hemsworth were a couple for a very long time and they certainly could have made something better with their chemistry. And finally, this movie lacks the great music from other Miley Cyrus works in the past, especially the marvelous ""Hanna Montana"" movie. This will not destroy my appreciation for her as I don't think her performance wasn't bad in ""The Last Song"", but the movie crumbled around her. Looking forward to her next projects, which will hopefully be better."
"aa_man033","7","3","12","6 April 2010"," Interesting Movie, Really Rushed, Miley can(believe it or not) act,
","I just got back from watching the Last Song. It was an interesting movie. Honestly, it's kind of hard to critique, considering there wasn't much you could really ""critique"". The movie was all in all a typical drama/family/romance movie. There is no way this movie will ever win any awards, maybe a teen choice award or something, but it does offer something, and for me, that was entertainment. I'm a guy, and I have to admit, the movie made me laugh at times, and I even cracked a smile or two. Sometimes I laughed at the somewhat corny lines, okay really corny, and sometimes I laughed because I felt it was actually funny (and not in a bad way). It was a nice movie to look at, and sometimes that's really important. The acting, for the most part, being about 60%, was believable. It was by no means completely awful, like some movie critics are making it out to be. The story was really rushed though. That was the big problem for me. It needed to be more dragged out. But, hey, maybe that's what made it entertaining to watch.<br/><br/>People are saying that the first 30 minutes of this movie is embarrassing to watch. I thought it was my favorite part. The scenes I liked most in the movie were with Ronnie and her brother Jonah. I thought they connected more than Ronnie and Will. Ronnie and her dad were believable, but sometimes I felt it was pushed to be too lovey dovey.<br/><br/>Miley Cyrus. I'd give her performance a 7/10, just like this review. I thought she did a reasonable, if not satisfying job at making this movie worth watching. She definitely has acting abilities. Heck, I liked her. My prediction is that she'll get better over time in her acting. I'm not even going to compare her to her previous work. If this was her first movie ever, I'd say she did a good job. I'm sort of eager to see how she does in future movies.<br/><br/>The Last Song is a good movie, despite all the critical reviews. It has it's downfalls, but, it's still very watchable. I'd recommend seeing it."
"terpschick7","10","4","19","1 April 2010"," Only OK.
","I read the book especially for this movie because i am a huge fan of Miley Cyrus. I went to see the first show on opening day preparing to be blown away. I walk out of the theater, and they left so much out of the movie! Miley Cyrus's acting wasn't as bad as people said on the reviews, although, her younger brother ""Jonah"" in the movie did a much better job.The ending also makes no sense, and is completely random, but until then two thumbs up. I'd wouldn't take my child to see this unless ten or older. I would have also liked to see more of Marcus in the movie, and all the drama he brings along. Also this movie's soundtrack is great, i bought it on itunes as soon as i got home. The movie wasn't great, but better than what the strict critics say."
"nic1121","8","2","7","28 May 2012"," Good Movie!
","This movie does not have the most complex or shocking turn of events storyline ever but overall a good movie with a good storyline. No, the acting wasn't perfect but it wasn't bad either, everyone did well in my opinion. Personally I thought the actors in the movie all meshed well together and there was good chemistry. Instead of critiquing it to death I wish people would just see it more for what it is instead of what they think it should be. An enjoyable cute movie with a happy ending (aside from the fact that the dad dies) Not in my top favorite movies but I would definitely watch it again, more of a chick flick than anything else. I will admit I cannot see a lot of guys being overly interested."
"jessyhamza","10","2","7","6 March 2012"," I Loved It!!
","First of all, to everyone complaining about Miley's acting, STOP! It was amazing, maybe not perfect but who is. And the rest of the cast was incredible as well, I was so impressed by the kid as well. The plot may not have been very eventful but its beauty is in its simplicity. Just a normal story that could happen to any of us. Movies these days just tell stories that are too fictional to believe that it could happen in real life. I loved it and it's on my ""Favorite Movies"" list and I just can't stop watching it. I admit I haven't read the book, as I noticed that people who have, have poorly judged the movie, but come one, there is no movie an earth who is 100% fully adapted to its book. So yeah I gave it a 10!"
"jonathanruano","6","2","7","9 February 2011"," The Last Song - A Review
","To begin with, I usually do not like Miley Cyrus' movies because she is too boisterous, too in your face and too silly. But in ""The Last Song,"" they toned all of that down and the result, quite surprisingly, was a film that I actually enjoyed. ""The Last Song"" is not perfect. Miley Cyrus, who plays Veronica, is not yet ready for roles that require depth of emotion. Take the scenes where her character is angry with her love interest Will (Liam Helmsworth) or is meant to be devastated on learning of her father's (played very well by Greg Kinnear) cancer and you will see what I mean. Nevertheless, in those light hearted scenes, Cyrus' Veronica is as likable as she is entertaining. It is this good natured, occasionally funny and always warm spirit, conveyed by Cyrus' Veronica, Helmsworth's Will (who is most believable as the cool, likable guy, but less so as the troubled one), Veronica's dad (Kinnear) and brother Jonah (Bobbly Coleman), and a couple other characters, that makes ""The Last Song"" work. In fact, I think if they edited that part out about the father having cancer, the director and producers would have an even better film on their hands.<br/><br/>As a final note, this teen movie also has wonderful redemptive qualities. There is a scene early in this movie where Will is offered sex by Ashley (Melissa Ordway) who explains that her parents will be out for hours. But Will turns her down because he is not in love with her. What an unexpected and refreshing development: a teen making adult decisions about his own love life! In another scene, Veronica gives a poor girl Galadriel (Carly Chaikin) money because her nasty boyfriend Marcus (Nick Lashaway) threw her out and she has no where to live. Then there are other scenes where Veronica and Will sort out their problems through communication. These scenes are not completely believable, but their morale is undeniable - namely that many misunderstandings can be avoided if two people, who are in love, talk about their problems and how they feel. There are many adults I know who have not picked up on that insight. And I could keep going on. Suffice to say, at a time when so many ""teen"" films are sexploitative and degrade their characters(particularly the horror flics like ""Fear Island"" which tries to get by on sex and gore), it is refreshing to find a film that has the confidence to move beyond that and to actually elevate people who are not perfect, but have the potential to become better human beings when given the chance. It is also refreshing to see a film that has the ambition to portray some teens as adults making adult decisions that affect their own lives and the lives of the people around them.<br/><br/>So ""The Last Song"" is not perfect film. But there is enough good stuff here for me to recommend the film. 6.5/10"
"edwagreen","10","2","7","6 February 2011"," Last Song-The Melody Lingers On ****
","This is a perfect example of a clichÃ© movie that works so well. We have the usual themes of summer vacation and the son and daughter being sent to stay with the father at that time. Everyone is harboring some really difficult secrets.<br/><br/>This is much more than a movie where the love of music allows Mylie Cyrus, and Greg Kinnear, who plays her father so well, to reconnect. It is a story of ultimate forgiveness and redemption after a series of mistakes.<br/><br/>We even have the summer love, no doubt with a wealthy young man whose mother is snooty. Even the wealthy harbor a tragedy in their lives. No one gets away with everything.<br/><br/>Kinnear is fabulous here, especially in his exit scenes. It is about the best role of his career, even better than his Oscar nominated role some years back. (As Good As It Gets?)<br/><br/>Mylie Cyrus is just right for the part. She has the temperament for it and knows how to flow with the punches. Kudos to the young man who played her kid brother.<br/><br/>This is a very good film. It captures the human heart and spirit. A tale of forgiveness, it is well worth viewing."
"napierslogs","6","2","7","22 September 2010"," Only Kinnear is good and he makes it funny and dramatic
","I was wary but still optimistic about ""The Last Song"" and Miley Cyrus's foray into drama. But, oh, I was disappointed. She needs to stick to ""Hannah Montana"" and similar romantic comedies. The film's opening with Cyrus as the misunderstood, rebellious teenage daughter was just painful to watch.<br/><br/>Not being familiar with the book, I wasn't expecting this film to be as dramatic as it was. There was more than just Cyrus and her summer love storyline. Her interactions with her father (Greg Kinnear) were funny, heartwarming, touching, mature, and sincere. That is mostly credit to Kinnear's natural ability. He's genuinely funny and honestly dramatic. His character always comes across exactly as he's supposed to. Perhaps Greg Kinnear is the next great actor of his generation? I'll certainly be watching more to find out.<br/><br/>The movie on the whole, was all rather safe and inconsequential. The development of Cyrus's character was very obvious and expected; the ups and downs in her summer love relationship were rather pathetic; and although her relationship with her father deepened quicker than it was supposed to, that at least was enjoyable and kept me watching the film. Kinnear fans are not the target audience for ""The Last Song"" but his talent makes this film watchable."
"crml4","8","2","7","20 August 2010"," I actually liked this movie
","I just watched this movie for the first time today and I actually liked it. OK it was predicable and as soon as you see that guy Marcus with the fire ball i knew it was him who started the fire and Nicholas Sparks writes the same stories, but i didn't mind it. I thought Greg Kinnear did good. I think hes a good actor to portray a father. I thought the little boy who played Jonah did really well and he was quite comedic too. I was impressed by Miley. I think that people still think of her as Hannah Montana. She isint Hannah Montana. She's not the best actress in the world but its a start! I think in a few years she could be great and i think people need to give her a chance.<br/><br/>I was quite impressed with Liam Hemsworth. He did the accent very well...considering he has quite a strong Ozzie accent.<br/><br/>I thought the scenes with the father dying and that she decided to say was good and i got a little teary when he did die. I hope people will give her a chance in a few years."

","i am a huge Nicholas sparks fan. sometimes i feel the films do not give him the credit he deserves however this film was excellent but not without its flaws.<br/><br/>i thought miley cyrus was brilliant for Ronnie. although at times i felt she did not really represent the Ronnie that was conveyed to us in the book. the image i got of Ronnie from the book is completely different to the image portrayed by miley.<br/><br/>i cannot believe that they left out the preacher pastor harris, he was a huge support to Ronnie and her father.<br/><br/>i would recommended people to read the book. it is an amazing story. the film was excellent too."
"PrincessPeachx","10","2","8","22 June 2012"," I don't understand the poor reviews... I like it a lot!
","I don't understand the terrible reviews and score this movie received! There are some downfalls to the movie, sure, but I think most people are rating this movie poor because it stars Miley Cyrus. I agree that another stronger actor should have been used in the role. In some of her scenes, Miley looks perplexed, confused, and she mostly overacts or underacts. Some of her ""serious"" scenes are laughable which can be distracting.<br/><br/>Mostly, however, the film is extremely moving, especially after you find out the father is sick... I watched this with my own father and he had tears in his eyes, and I cried on several occasions.<br/><br/>PLEASE don't let the lead actress lessen your view of the film, although her performance is a large part of what makes or breaks the movie. The movie also has some great heartfelt moments, especially between the family (little brother, father, Miley), and also between boyfriend and girlfriend (Liam Hemsworth and Miley).<br/><br/>I voted The Last Song as a 10/10 in order to *hopefully* boost its overall score on here, though realistically I would give it a 7 or 8."
"annagabriellexo","8","2","8","2 October 2010"," all in all....pretty good
","i saw the movie not too long ago and it has become somewhat of a favorite. I enjoy the rebel in Ronnie's character and how she grows to be a woman in just one summer.<br/><br/>however, i saw the movie before reading the book.<br/><br/>I thought Marcus should have played a bigger part in the movie. In the book he is a true physco and it makes the book all the more interesting. I feel it could've had the same effect on the movie, but what do i know, i'm only 13.<br/><br/>but all in all i thought the book was amazing and the movie was pretty good so i would recommend it to anyone it has a truly profound message about how love can ""break our hearts...and heal them"""
"lisafordeay","7","2","8","24 September 2010"," To all the Miley Cyrus haters give her a chance she's not a bad actress
","The Last song is a 2010 Touchstone pictures film which is Miley Cyrus's first serious role since her Hannah Montana debut. The movie is about a rebellious teenager who is always getting herself into trouble and she and her brother are sent to live with their father as he and their mother broke up a couple of years ago. Ronnie(Cyrus) meets a local beach boy named Will(Chris Hemsworth brother Liam who went out with Cyrus in real life)while she is staying with her father and as she spends some time with her father she realizes that he too likes music like herself but he is hiding a painful secret to Ronnie & her brother,his got cancer and has a few months to live. I found the beginning of this film really hard to follow because we see Ronnie's father in a building and two firefighters have him by the arms as he was being rescued as the church was burnt down. The charcthers are alright I found Miley Cryus abit self-centered and bratty in this film as she is a troublemaker being sent to live with her dying father,the music was great (Maroon 5,two Miley Cyrus songs I hope you find it which was not a bad song and When I look at you which featured in the ending credits along with the other one. The chemistry between Cyrus and Hemsworth was cute kinda like a Romeo & Juilet thing going on.<br/><br/>Be ready for the hankies as the ending to this will have you crying. Miley Cryus fans will like this film,dunno about the haters though as they will keep saying Stupid Miley,Stupid actress whatever I think she was great as the bratty teenager who's dad is dying.<br/><br/>Verdict: A tearjearker from Ms Cyrus from Hannah Montana fame.<br/><br/>7/10"
"TxMike","Null","2","8","16 September 2010"," Better than its low IMDb rating would indicate, we found it rather enjoyable.
","One thing is apparent, Miley Curus is growing up to be a bit better actress than the usual teen singer-turned-actress. In fact, now I believe she is a better actress than she is a singer.<br/><br/>Here she is Ronnie (Veronica) Miller sent by mom to spend the summer with her dad (Greg Kinnear) Steve on the Atlantic coast of Georgia. Like most of these themed stories she really wants to be back in the city and is determined to NOT have an enjoyable time. Part of that is not being able to forgive dad for leaving her and mom, even though he explains that love is complicated.<br/><br/>She is also accompanied by her younger brother, Bobby Coleman as Jonah Miller, who in fact gets along quite well with dad.<br/><br/>At a beach volleyball game she happens to meet teen Liam Hemsworth as Will Blakelee, as he runs into her and causes her to spill her shake all over her shirt. We, the audience, correctly predict that the two of them will meet again and develop a love interest. Kelly Preston is her mother Kim.<br/><br/>Stories like this are very common in the movies, unhappy daughter and caring dad try to patch up relationships. But this one is done rather well, mostly due to the convincing acting by Kinnear and Cyrus. A catalyst is the nest of sea turtle eggs she finds being disturbed by a raccoon, and she sets out to protect them, with the help of Will.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: Ronnie, like her dad, is an accomplished pianist, and in fact she has been offered a scholarship to Juliard, but she has not played since dad left her and the family, and has no plans to ever play again. But in the end, after she finds out dad is dying and he wrote his last song for her, she plays it at his funeral, decides to go to Juliard, and Will will be transferring from family school Vanderbilt to attend Columbia, also in New York."
"spongebobcheer","8","2","8","27 August 2010"," Truly Moving, and Heart-Touching!
","The problem with the film is people had biased opinions about it before it was even released. The moment people found out Miley Cyrus was going to star as Ronnie Miller, people immediately disliked the film.<br/><br/>To my surprise however, I was truly touched by the film. It's a story about family, finding love, and going through hardships. And personally, I left the theater in tears. In fact, I went to see the film THREE TIMES while it was still in theaters. A lot can be learned from the movie. It's definitely something that a family could watch together.<br/><br/>The character's were so complex, and each actor/actress displayed the plot of each individual character SO well. Truly a good film, no matter what people say!"
"ladygaga8781","10","2","8","22 May 2010"," Loved this movie!
","I can't say enough how pleased I am with how this film evolved. I knew what to expect, 'cause I cheated and read the end of the novel. I'm not a Sparks reader. So I went in with his ending in my head. Miley has grown by huge leaps since her first entry onto the big screen. But it was all the characters who drew me in and yes, Sparks had to have provided the structure for these great characters. I cried and cried. You just have to see the film to understand. Then years ago, I wouldn't have understood the characters motivation, wouldn't have accepted it. But ""Last Song"" sure helped put things in perspective for me. And so, I have to thank Mr. Sparks for part of this new acceptance of reality."
"rdufault","7","3","16","9 April 2010"," It's a late teen summer romance chick flick, but well executed.
","I brought my 13 year old daughter to see this - expected it to be pretty bad, given the low rating on IMDb. It started out fairly predictably, and there were no big surprises, but it was well executed. The kid brother stole all the scenes, and the expected ""serious twist"" gave the film some depth. There were even some tears shed by my otherwise cynical 13-year-old daughter. It was a refreshing change to see the lead girl not portrayed by a plastic blonde with perfect teeth, although the lead guy was probably too good-looking and perfect. Turns out the guy's older brother got the lead in Thor, so that gives you an idea of what he looks like. I give it a solid 7, if only to balance out the Miley Cyrus haters."
"tenmishel","6","2","9","24 August 2010"," Miley Pouts Her Way Through The Last Song
","I read the book and although it wasn't terribly exciting or all that good I enjoyed it. The plot was simple and predictable but had it's charms. Ronnie was a very unlikable character, and I just couldn't help but picture Miley Cyrus as Ronnie because I had already seen the trailer prior to reading the book. That kind of ruined it for me. I was actually somewhat excited to watch the movie and wasn't as disappointed as others. Having been an actress all my life Miley's performance was hard to watch but at certain times I could ignore her pouty lips and try to follow what was actually happening (which wasn't much). Liam, who plays Ronnie's love interest, was not as bad as I had imagined and actually has some potential as an actor. For those of you who know they like sappy, predictable movies with bad actors go watch The Last Song but other than red eyes it will leave you with nothing. If you're really eager to see what Miley can do, like I was, I suggest watching it on the internet rather than renting it. It will save you a lot of regret."
"snickerbar70","10","2","9","30 May 2010"," Story...
","If you're looking for a romantic novel to get lost in this summer, this is the book for you! Nicholas Sparks has done it again. I absolutely loved every second of this story and the way it unfolded. As always, there are lots of unexpected plot twists and multiple stories within the novel itself. It's so easy to connect with any of the characters, from the wanna-be cool dad to his rebellious seventeen year old daughter.<br/><br/>It all starts with Ronnie and her ten year old brother being shipped to their dad's house in a small North Carolina town for the summer. Throughout the novel, secrets are unfolded and strong relationships are formed (including a summer romance between Ronnie and the town's very own teenage heart throb.)Ronnie discovers and learns things about herself as well as how to treat others. She falls in love for the first time, and learns the ups and downs of romantic relationships the hard way. The father that she once despised growing up eventually becomes her closest friend. I loved her relationship with her younger brother. Even though they fought a lot, Sparks made a special connection between the two of them that was really touching.<br/><br/>Don't think it's as predictable as it seems, though. Several plot twists will have you feeling like you can't put the book down. Keep the tissues close!"

I can't wait till Amazon notifies me via email to let me know that this movie is available for purchase because I will be ordering it right then.

"lem06002","8","3","17","2 April 2010"," read the book first
","While the movie did lack a certain element, it was a good addition to the book. The book helps you understand that the reason Ronnie is so upset and resented her parents is because her dad just left one day after working on the road for a couple years. Later you find out its because her dad found out her mom had an affair and left because of it. Ronnie is not a jerk and the book helps you understand why she is the way she is. There was also some other things in the book that weren't in the movie, but that's because Nicholas Sparks wrote the screenplay FIRST and then the book so he apparently did some much needed additions. Still, even if it is a bit predictable in some ways, it is still endearing and feel good. It may not be the most original script, but it is a sweet story..."
"elaine-jade","5","1","4","28 October 2012"," Personal opinion of The Last Song
","A teenage summer romance, very clique. The storyline was typical and fairly straight forward. The actors performances were good although i had the feeling that Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth wanted to laugh on several occasions. The setting was well chosen for the story.I like the fact that there isn't as much talking and arguing as other romantic films and that most emotions are displayed through facial expressions and body language. However, i don't think the film needed to be as long as it was and i found the atmosphere quite boring. The slight twist scenario in this film was the only part that caught my attention.This film wasn't anything extraordinary."
"gilmoregirls47","6","1","5","15 April 2010"," Miley, oh Miley.....
","As Cyrus shows her true lack in talent in this film, the rest of the cast does well. With the drama that happens and the attitude of Miley's character 'Ronnie', they stick their characters very well. Throughout this sad, rough, restless summer, the Miller family shows the dark sides of family's when they get ripped apart, hurting the kids the most. As I entered the theater, expecting the usual summer-love story between Ronnie and Will, but to my surprise, focused on Ronnie and her dad with their problems and situations until the end of the summer, with Will only in occasional, serious scenes. Will, the usual type of guy in these movies, but new and improved with a sweet guy attitude. Yes he's a beautiful, beach-volleyball player, with a perfect tan and whatnot, but turns out much different and better on the inside, making him enjoyable and loved, not just including his amazing looks. Ronnie being played by Cyrus almost ruins the character, with her snagged tooth, bad- singing voice ruins the sweet, fun-loved Ronnie Miller, who might I add in the start of the movie was a, mean, I-hate-the-world 18 year old, that is, until Will comes along, making her fall into a haze of love, helping the space between her and her dad become smaller, which makes them get along much better than before Will came along. To my surprise, by the time the movie was over, I found this movie better than expected and recommendable. Not to the point where everyone in America should see it, but at least those who find it interesting or even how I did, not interested in it."
"kaylenns","9","1","6","2 October 2012"," Enjoyable for what it aims to do
","I subscribe to Ebert's approach to film reviewing: does the film achieve the goals it sets out to accomplish within its own genre? Sure, Nicholas Sparks's plots are never going to wow anyone with their originality and unpredictability, but they're not trying to. He specializes in writing small family dramas with characters that bear some resemblance to real human beings and that endure tearjerker events. Nothing groundbreaking. The question is: does The Last Song work on this level?<br/><br/>Unabashedly, yes. Miley Cyrus does a fine job of making me believe she's a pouty, hurt, self-centered teenager who at least has some sense of self-confidence amidst all her character's immaturity. Sometimes her character does frustratingly immature things, but at least they were in-character. She struck believable notes. There were never any off moments where a lack of acting skill on her part threw me out of the story. Of course, I don't have a history of following her work, so I just took her performance at face value.<br/><br/>Liam Hemsworth did a fine job too. He's got the unfortunate handicap of being so ridiculously good-looking that my first reaction upon seeing him was to laugh in disbelief. Assuming that we can get past that and give him a chance, he made me believe in his character, as well. Again, no off moments that threw me out of the story. (Although there was one scene involving him shirtless and some mutual hosing down that felt utterly gratuitous and annoyed me, but I'm blaming that on the director, not the actors. They did their best not to make that scene seem as barely-plausible as it was.) The scene where Ronnie breaks up with him was particularly well played on his part; his desire to hold her and restore the relationship was so evident and made me ache for his character. His motivations made perfect sense to me. Although I understood Ronnie's motivation and her childish desire to lash out, the breakup unfortunately hit the teen-melodrama button a little too hard and felt a little to mechanical for the plot. Again, the actors did a fine job of trying to make it feel believable and not just formulaic.<br/><br/>Greg Kinnear was excellent, providing a nice, steady, mature background to the teen drama. His performance never felt forced or cloying. He was believable as a slightly out-of-touch, frustrated, but loving father to his two children. His responses felt real and I cared about his character. I ached for his relationship with his daughter to be restored. Nice job on his part.<br/><br/>Bobby Coleman was unexpectedly fantastic! The first time I started to well up was when his character was working on the stained-glass window alone. Phenomenal job from so young a boy! I remember feeling like that as a child and he *nailed* that scene! He was good throughout, but he went from cute younger brother with the usual comedic notes to a real character at that point. He easily stole the scene from the two older actors.<br/><br/>So: for what this movie tried to do, I think it succeeded admirably. Yes, it's not art-house Oscar-bait, but it's not trying to be. If you let yourself settle down, forget your Miley Cyrus baggage, and enjoy this small-family, small-town, everyday-life (except needing to suspend disbelief regarding Hemsworth's appearance :) story, you'll be glad you did."

","Movies are based on books and are not the same down to every detail. When you read a book you add your own imagination to it but that doesn't mean a movie is awful just because you preferred the book. This movie was not poorly acted in anyway from any of the actors and i feel that Miley Cyrus has had her name tainted because of what she does in her personal life, but this does not reflect her acting skills as she is very talented. I enjoyed the movie and it really deserves a watch. The story line in my opinion was good and flowed well and had emotion and laughter. Don't be put off by the movie because of its cast as thats a shame and you'll miss out on a good movie."

Get that out of your head, and what you'll have is a great heart warming movie!<br/><br/>The acting in it I found great (even Miley Cyrus upped her performance) and the story was superb. The characters had great chemistry with each other and it worked really well on screen. There was character development, great script, wonderful scenery... What more could you ask for? A great adaption from a great novel! This story really pulls on your heart strings, just like any Nicholas Sparks novel, and leaves you feeling satisfied.<br/><br/>I would rate this movie 10/10 simply for having the ability of making me cry and smile at the same time!!"
"mustang0802","10","1","6","28 May 2011"," Great Movie
","I loved this movie because of so many different elements. The cast was super well casted and were amazing actors and actresses. They really fit there characters and brought the story to life. Miley and Liam's chemistry really enhanced the story. I love how there was more to the story than a love story. I overall recommend this movie to all ages. It is such a great romance and an overall enjoyable movie. Warning its a tearjerker, but it's also filled with love and happiness. Love the scenery and the music. The music is so amazing. I love the music, it fits in with the story so well! I am a hopeless romantic and I love to see these movies. It makes you feel good about love and life and just because Miley Cyrus is in it, it doesn't mean its just for little kids. Miley Cyrus is a very accomplished actress and if you don't know that you will find out. This movie is amazing for all ages. A movie that will bring tears to your eyes."
"Samiam3","6","1","6","22 February 2011"," Corny, but occasionally cute
","The Last Song is intended for a very particular age group, and I am not among them. Annoying though it can be for corniness and underwriting, The Last Song doesn't end up being a terrible movie. At times it can be cute, but it takes a while to get to that part. <br/><br/>The Last Song falls into a number of melodramatic traps, one of which is the 'break up make up' phase which happens one too many times here, leaving The Last Song a bit difficult to take seriously. <br/><br/>The film kind of bounces back and forth with tones, while following a familiar teen romance structure. Needless to say this is not an adult movie, but it might be better for the kids (just not the little ones)"
"mckinneycn","8","1","6","25 January 2011"," Definitely a Favorite
","The Last Song is definitely a chick flick, but it is one of my favorites. The movie is based off of the Book by Nicholas Sparks. I am a HUGE fan of Nicholas Sparks, and yes, Miley Cyrus. I know that I sound like a 12 year old girl, but I truly do love her.<br/><br/>The story takes place on the coast of North Carolina, where a daughter is forced to live with her father who she is not the biggest fan of. As the story unfolds we see that she hates him and she has gotten into a lot of trouble in the past. Her father refuses to give up on her and finally in the end she realizes how much she loves and needs her father. At the end her father is stricken with cancer and she stays with him until the day he dies. This movie hit home for me because I sometimes argue with my father a lot. It makes me want to put everything aside and tell my dad how much he means to me.<br/><br/>The story was very close to the same as the book which I really like. Compared to Dear John, another Nicholas Sparks' book and movie, it was so much better. I hate when they take extremely good books and ruin them by changing the characters and their actions. This is a main reason that this movie is one of my favorites.<br/><br/>One reason that I didn't like the movie was because of the love part. Miley's character falls in love with a rich boy. They fall in love, she gets mad at him, then they get back together. Even though I am your typical girl who loves a good love story, I get very tired of seeing the PERFECT love. It doesn't happen like that. Life isn't perfect and it will never be like the movies.<br/><br/>Overall this movie is on my top ten list!"
"priyantha-bandara","9","1","6","31 October 2010"," True love will never leave you..
","I have seeing my fare share of love stories, dramas and touching tales for the past couple of years without counting my years of watching movies for the sake of passing time. Some love stories have 'it' while many actually lost 'it' in the name of love. In my opinion Love is a hard thing to understand and experience so portraying it correctly and effectively on screen also is not that easier. ""The Last Song"" is in exception. Right at the beginning it vastly looks familiar if you have watched 'Dear John' recently. The beach places, games, a girl moving in the from the big city, a hunk on the beach get to get in touch with her and so on. But when the story runs it begins to take shape in to a memorable experience and if you actually watch it with your full heart and mind, you may find interesting pieces of puzzles about the things call love and life start to solve by itself. Don't have much to say about the cast. I personally don't think there is anything wrong there. And the acting is not bad as well. The scenes are beautiful; locations are calm and blissful which puts you in the beach mood. What matters most is the story. It's about love and relationships which is so fragile and tends to break off easily and the struggle of life to keep it alive. Making mistakes, realizing it and then forgiving your self do make one strong and then face life with more confidence. ""The Last Song"" is about that mostly. This movie will stay in your heart for a long time if you actually made an attempt to realize it deep enough. And finally I have to tell that the music is just fantastic."

","Before watching this film I had heard mixed reviews about it. When it first came out in theaters I was hearing how terrible it was and not to waist my money. I have never read the book, though my girl friend has, and she considers it her favorite book of all time. Because of this I was expecting the movie to be fairly good, I enjoy all types of genres so a chick flick doesn't bother me. I never got around to seeing this picture in the theaters and ended up renting it. After trying relentlessly to find it, I was finally able to sit down and watch it. I agree with others who say that the story seems a bit rushed, as the viewer you are thrown into a situation without much warning, and it barely has enough length in the scene to make you, the viewer, feel what the characters are feeling. I had heard from others that Miley Cyrus had done a terrible acting job. I disagree with this, I didn't feel as if I was watching a musician try to act, she came across confident and believable. All and all this was a good movie, and by the time it was all said and done my girl friend was in tears, I would watch this movie again."
"carolinapearl246","8","1","6","4 August 2010"," A very good movie full of emotions
","My mom and I went to see this movie, and we both LOVED it. Since neither of us had read the book,i guess we liked it more than those who had read the book. We both cried, i mean SOBBED, through most of it, because it was just so touching, yet there was a very unexpected twist involving Ronni's(Miley Cyrus) father. However, Miley Cyrus always has roles where she is a little over-dramatic, and she had a very unusual role in this movie. I actually liked her acting in this movie, whereas I usually find her acting to be ""cheesy"" and very fake. This movie is full of surprises and emotions, and as far as i remember, its one of my favorites."

I think Sparks fitted the characters really good from the book to the movie."

I saw it when I got it on netflix and then just within a couple hours of watching it for the first time I went out and bought it. It really hit a cord with me in many ways more than any other of his. My dad and I don't have the best of relationships and so I can relate in a similar way. It made me realize how fragil and short life is. So I'm now working on a better relationship with my dad. I thought the acting was well done. By all the cast. I'm not a fan of Miley and this is the first thing I've seen of her's but she was good. You could tell that all the actors but real emotion in their roles. Still there is yet to be a movie based on one of Nicolas Sparks' books that I haven't cried in and this was no expection to that."

"ken_bethell","7","1","7","5 September 2010"," Pleasant chick-flick
","I can't understand why people hate this film so much. Perhaps maybe that the absence of bad language and writhing bodies allied to a half-decent story was too much for some viewers. The film was dominated as it so often is by the performance of Greg Kinnear who was totally convincing as the estranged and dying father of his brattish daughter played by Miley Cyrus. Miss Cyrus was pleasant enough but I fear her film opportunities will recede as she lacks that screen presence so important for a leading lady.The scenery was gorgeous and photography could not be faulted. The film had both a sad and happy ending which pleased my wife - what more could you wish for!"
"phd_travel","5","1","8","29 August 2010"," Story is OK but miley is unromantic
","The story isn't bad of course there are some clichÃ©d things but it is a Sparks romance. This was better than Dear John which was irritating.<br/><br/>Miley's acting has been criticised roundly. I don't think she entirely spoiled the movie. She wasn't bad all the time. She was better in the upbeat snappy moments and not so good at the tear jerking moments. Because she is not pretty (let's face it she has a rather ugly smile and her body is hunched), the sad moments weren't moving. And the romance didn't ring true. It was a rather dry eyed tear jerker at the end. If there had been a prettier better actress it might have been more romantic and moving. The kid brother wasn't that moving either.<br/><br/>Kinnear is good though the didn't look sick enough at the end. Liam is OK but not very facially expressive. Other supporting characters were a bit annoying and unattractive.<br/><br/>The song they played (the Last Song) kind of sucked. Couldn't they get a better composer? As if Juillard would want someone who composed that kind of nonsense.<br/><br/>Overall not as good as the Notebook but better than Dear John."

Her father is divorced from her mother. The girl defies her parents. Then, she meets a good boy. However she quarrels with the boy over some problems. I think some girls at puberty defy their parents for a while and some girls quarrel with their boyfriend. This movie indicates girl at puberty very well. A lot of girls' feeling is so dedicate.

"martudebenedetti","6","0","5","9 May 2015"," The last song
","The last song is a movie based on the novel by Nicholas Sparks. It was directed by Julie Anne Robinson and the principal characters, Ronnie and Will are played by Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth. It takes place in a small coastal town in southern United States, where an estranged father sets out to spend the summer with a reluctant teenage daughter, who prefers to stay at home in New York. The father tries to reconnect with his daughter through all they have in common, music. It is a story of family, friendship, secrets, forgiveness, second chances and first loves. It is a really predictable movie, with a nice story, where we can appreciate the evolution of the main character, it isn't just about a romantic story, it is a dramatic story linked with a love story. It is totally a movie for teenage girls, especially the ones who love to cry."

The story is very moving and touching and will definitely make you cry, the chemistry between Liam Hemsworth and Miley Cyrus is beautiful, the soundtrack is gorgeous and the performance of young Bobby Coleman is exceptional! He deserves so much credit for this part! All together, it's sad to see that the ratings are so bad.

","Ronnie (Miley Cyrus) and her little brother Jonah are staying with their father Steve Miller (Greg Kinnear) in his beach house for the summer. The rebellious teen is not happy and feels out of place. She got in trouble for shoplifting in NYC. She makes a frienenemy in Blaze (Carly Chaikin), and catches the eye of local Will Blakelee (Liam Hemsworth). When she tries to save some turtles, she and Will starts a summer romance. He's trying to move on from a loss and she reconnects with music. The local girls aren't too happy. Meanwhile everybody still blames her father for burning down the church.<br/><br/>It's not a particularly original teen rom-com to start. It's a little too light and too sappy. Then as in all Nicholas Sparks novels, this must have some melodrama. Somebody must die or be already dead! Miley Cyrus is a perfectly fine grumpy teen. Liam Hemsworth is the hot young beach dude. The two leads are nice likable kids. Nobody is winning any acting awards here, but it's a fine little teen melodramatic soap start. However the turn does nothing particularly compelling except to let the little air out of the story. The only hope is to have Liam and Miley on screen together no matter what. It doesn't matter if they're fighting or making up. When Liam goes away, the movie's spirit goes away too."

"emily-choward-96","5","0","5","4 January 2014"," Good but not amazing
","I read the book, and absolutely loved it as I do all of Nicholas Sparks books. I think my favourite character in the book was Will because of his charm and for just how lovely and caring he was and although I do think Liam Hemsworth was well suited to the part, there were tiny details about Will that needed to be added from the book to make viewers see how lovely he is and not some ladies man like he is shown to be in the film. I am not a fan of Miley Cyrus but she didn't play an awful part, I still felt emotional with the film as I did with the book but she was very much angry. The film was rushed, one minute she hated her dad then the next minute she loved him and wanted to talk with him, in the book it takes Ronnie such a long time to let someone in, so that irritated me. Also Miley isn't the best actress she didn't play the part brilliantly in my opinion, she was moody yes but she wasn't great at playing the caring daughter. I believe that Gregg Kinnear played a good role and added humour to the film, as Steve was funny in the book, however it did annoy me when he shouted at Ronnie because he never shouted in the book, he was such an amazing dad and I don't think this is portrayed as well in the film. The character which annoyed me the most in the film was Marcus, and he's not suppose to annoy me, he's suppose to be a sociopath and Ronnie is terrified of him, there was no indication of this at all. Such as him stalking her, trying it on with her, a lot and when Blaze caught fire and he just ran off, it was will and Ronnie who saved her. In addition throughout the book Ronnie is worried about her court date for which Blaze is to blame, it never showed Blaze visiting the police and telling the police what she did and how Marcus was the one who started the fire not Scott. This then led a false sense of why Ronnie was angry with Will and dumped him, she was angry because Pastor Harris (who's not even in the film and plays a large role in the book) was injured in the fire. Lastly I believe the actor playing Jonah was very much well suited to his role, very much how I imagined him in the book. However Ronnie's mum Kim I wasn't so keen on in the book, it never revealed that the reason her parents divorced was because she had an affair and then lied to her children saying that Steve left and had another woman, Kim was to blame for Ronnie not talking to her Dad for 3 years. Overall it is a good film, the book's better, but they always are. I love how they added the stain glass window into the film as that is a very special moment. However they mixed things up, such as portraying Will as a ladies man when he wasn't, he was with Ashley for 2 years and how fast they fall in love doesn't reveal small details of why Will loves her. The film was great and it does have a teary end, but as does the book which I would definitely recommend."

I feel like it wasn't for Miley playing Ronnie, this movie's rate would be insanely higher than just 4.6 stars. However, the book was written having her in mind, in her house, and I feel like it would be stupid to have someone else playing Ronnie's role. That being said, I'm very happy with her performance. The story line is just perfect, what's nothing new given the fact that the movies based on Nicholas Sparks' books are never disappointing. I didn't appreciate the fact that some important facts were left out, but overall it was a very good movie. Steve's illness was very well portrayed, as well as his death. Images are worth more than a thousand words, and no one needed to say he had died for us to be left in tears right by the second when we saw that empty chair. Even almost a year after the last time I watched this movie, I still have that image in my head. I highly recommend this movie, if you haven't watched it yet."

"angel-lloyd","3","0","5","30 July 2011"," Potentially good story, but lacking something...
","I wouldn't say this is a bad movie, I actually quite enjoyed it, but something I wouldn't feel the need to watch too often.<br/><br/>Ronnie (Miley Cyrus) and her younger brother, Jonah (Bobby Colemen) , are dropped off my their mum(Kelly Preston)to stay with their dad (Greg Kinnear)over the summer at his house on the beach. At the beginning of the movie, Ronnie comes off as a moody and rebellious teenager, with a shockingly bad attitude towards her father. As the movie continues, Ronnie meets a boy called Will (Liam Hemsworth). You can guess what happens, because soon enough they start going out together. Ronnie and her dad's relationship improves as the movie continues too, and she starts to feel terribly guilty when her and her little brother are shocked with the news of their dad having cancer.<br/><br/>The acting by Miley Cyrus, at times is quite good, but often over acted. Bobby Colemen (Jonah) and Greg Kinnear (dad) were the best in it, and made the movie as a whole a lot more realistic. Liam Hemmsworth (Will), like Miley, at times could be alright, but then sometimes showed no emotion and made it quite boring to watch.<br/><br/>The relationship between Ronnie and Will was very cute, and really showed chemistry on screen. Ronnie's relationship with her father came off very well, and was acted (more Greg Kinnear) brilliantly.<br/><br/>A good story, with a lot of potential, but just lacking certain elements, probably the acting from Miley and Liam, which as I've said before was quite good at points, but confusingly bad at others.<br/><br/>A sweet movie, with touching relationships. Is also quite funny in parts, with OK dialogue. I would recommend it, but not the sort of film I would be too keen to watch too often."
"Moo2400","5","0","5","11 July 2011"," Don't Let the Rating Fool You
","I watched The Last Song with very low expectations given its low rating and walked away pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>First, the bad points. It's not that great of a film and isn't very memorable; it certainly could have been much better (particularly the pacing, which was slow for the first half and rushed in the second), Miley Cyrus's acting left a lot to be desired for, and the love story itself was rather bland. The overall story at times felt aimless where the only way to move the plot was to add some random surprise, which I think is a sign of poor screenplay.<br/><br/>Despite all of this, the film holds its own and if it weren't for the hate Miley Cyrus receives, I would expect the film would otherwise be somewhere in the 5-range; at least a full point above what it's currently rated as. I was able to identify with the characters, particularly Greg Kinnear's character. I felt the story between Miley Cyrus's and Greg Kinnear's character was rather intriguing and the moral derived from it inspiring (but again, could have been done better, but it's enjoyable enough on its own).<br/><br/>The film itself is okay and worth watching if you have the time and enjoy these types of films."
"sheilajewell","6","0","6","21 June 2011"," It was okay
","I never expect that reading a book and watching a movie will tell me the same story, so I never do both. And according to other reviews, the book and the movie do not correspond with each other. If you read the ""trivia"" for this movie, I believe it indicates that the movie was written first for Miley. However, either way, you have to keep in mind that you have to set a time limit for movies so you will not get as much in a movie as you do in a book.<br/><br/>I watched this movie on Netflix and chose it because I like Miley. I think she is cute and interesting. It wasn't a bad movie, I was just confused about a few things such as why were they sent to live with their Dad. It didn't seem like he had seen them in a while. The shoplifting thing seemed thrown in there as if that was supposed to answer some sort of question. Overall, I liked the characters. As with most Nicholas Sparks books/movies, you know what the ""sad part"" is going to be. Overall it was predictable but I was just looking for a story where I didn't have to think too much and this fit the bill. I liked watching the relationship between Miley and the blond haired guy.<br/><br/>Overall I gave it 6 out of 10. Not a cinematic masterpiece but not crap on a stick either."

I'm neither a fan or hater of Miley Cyrus, and I got to say her acting is far away from the best I've seen, but absolutely not the worst either. People are having way to much prejudices against her. <br/><br/>The story itself is a bit thin and has some clichÃ©s, but it was okay. Ronnie's character can be a bit annoying, but turns out to be a very caring character as she helps both Blaze and the turtles. Otherwise, the other characters don't really stand out very much it's like they're only a part of the story in a way. Although, there is a lot about Ronnie and Will's relationship in the movie, I think that most of the movie is centered Ronnie and her relationship with her dad.<br/><br/>It's a sweet, warm and sad story that I liked very much.

Although some of the more dramatic scenes with her in them are not the best acting shes ever done she does a promising job. The rest of the cast does a great job as well.<br/><br/>I haven't read the book but i hear people talking of the differences. Most people think the movie was written after the book was released, Nicholas Sparks wrote the movie for Miley Cyrus and then preceded to make a book out of the movie. so the differences are simply authors choice.

I am NOT a Miley Cyrus fan. I am NOT fan of formulaic date movie poo. Sadly it does have a date movie feel but I can honestly say I was surprised to see a fair performance made by Cyrus. At times it was forced but she was giving an honest effort. Also this movie was not a ""Miley Cyrus songs vehicle"" either, which I was thankful. By no means is this a breakthrough performance by Cyrus! She has a long road ahead before she can achieve an A-list status. I found the chemistry between Liam Hemsworth and Cyrus ""cute"" if not a little unbelievable. Hemsworth is much taller than Cyrus. A foot taller. It looked like Cyrus was suffering from dwarfism. Kinnear and Preston are good as any veteran actors. Although Preston ""Divorced Mom-I got kids"" bit makes me wonder if Preston has lost her acting focus. There is no need for me to go into a plot summary about The Last Song because if you seen one date movie you seen them all. It's better than most summer love movies. Give it a shot!"

","This movie was much better than I expected. Mylie Cyrus is certainly no great actor but she does a believable job in this once she drops the tough girl act. She plays Ronnie, a girl whose been hurt by her parents divorce. She is very talented at playing the piano, earning a place at Juliard, but isn't sure if she will go since she hasn't played since her dad left. Ronnie and her younger brother, Jonah, are spending the summer with their dad at his beach house. Ronnie has no plans to make nice with her dad. She meets a cute guy, Will, that she blows off at first, but once she loses the tough girl act, they start dating.<br/><br/>Then, as we suspect, we find out everything isn't so great with her dad and he is writing a last song for her. This is where the tear-jerker scenes come in. The movie certainly tries to be quite sad and everything gets wrapped up at the end.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: This movie is for fans of Cyrus and teen girls who want to see a sad romantic drama."

","Some need to hear their song,some need to see their expressions,before they can recognize them. Miley was nothing more than a teenie bopper in my eyes, until I saw her in ""The Last Song"" I have read some peoples comments about Mileys acting and they were harsh. Really people, give her a break. How many musicians do you know who can act? Could Miley have done better? Probably not this time. Does she have what it takes to do better in future films? This, I know for SURE. I cried watching this movie, and found her acting more than good. Not Oscar winning, but very good. I wish her well, and good luck in her double music/acting efforts, I believe she is a talented hard worker with a heart who WILL deliver more and more. Keep on sparkling Miley, you make me smile :)"
