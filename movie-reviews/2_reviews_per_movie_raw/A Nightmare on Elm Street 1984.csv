","I am written this review In Memorie of my all time favorite the best horror director Wes Craven that sadly is no longer with us anymore. On August 30th 2015, Craven died of brain cancer at home in Los Angeles. I am doing this for him. <br/><br/>A Nightmare on Elm Street is a 1984 American supernatural Classic slasher horror film written and directed by Wes Craven, and the first film of the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. <br/><br/>The best horror flick I have ever seen.I love this film to death, I love it!!! It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. It is my number 1 favorite film in the franchise it stays in my heart forever. I am a big fan of this film I even have a poster hang on door in my room, my girlfriend give it to me as gift. I love some other films of Wes Craven that he directed like are New Nightmare, Scream, Shocker,The People Under the Stairs, Scream 2 and Scream 3. A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) for me will be always in the genre the best slasher classic horror film written and directed by Wes Craven. He gave us Freddy Krueger which was followed six sequels one crossover and one remake after success of the first film that gross $26.505.000 in USA. The sequel after the first film A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge was refused from Wes Craven to work on the film because he never wanted or intended A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) to become an ongoing franchise (and even wanted the first film to have a happy ending), and also because he didn't like the idea of Freddy manipulating the protagonist into committing the murders. The sequel for me wasn't a good movie after the original was released. My top 5 films of We Craven would be A Nightmare On Elm Street, Scream , New Nightmare, Shocker and The People Under the Stairs. <br/><br/>The first film is so original, realistic, and overall terrifying horror classic slasher flick that is actually happening in dreams, a sociopath child killer with sharp clawed glove who has knives in stead for a fingers, can enter into your dreams. If he kills you in your dreams, you're dead for real. The main protagonist is Nancy Thompson a teenager where her friends start dying and are killed one by one from Freddy Krueger, she try's to warn people from Freddy coming in to their dreams, but no one listens to her not her father the Sheriff not her mom or her friends. Her parents hold a dark secret from her long ago. She is alone in this and she has to fight him by her self by going back in to her dreams and get Freddy out of her dream in to the real world. Nancy the character was so clever, smart and intense carefully. She was awesome unique legendary heroine did you see how she put booby-traps for Freddy? Awesome!<br/><br/>Tina Grey played by Amanda Wyss, is really good in her role for the short time she is in this film. <br/><br/>Heather Langenkamp is excellent in her role as the main protagonist in this film. She's legendary unique teen heroine a very attractive,and gives 100% as Tina's friend Nancy Thompson who starts to have the same nightmares. <br/><br/>Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger the actor's contribution to the character is 100% superb. I think that Freddy Kruegar IS Robert Englund and vice versa, even though a lot of his moments in this film are about injecting a scary visual presence, he also creates a mystic before the film's revelation: Who is he? Where does he come from? Why is he doing these things? After the third film of the series, Englund would become a Hollywood star and a horror icon. For me Robert Englund will be the only Freddy Krueger I love him in all Nightmare films. <br/><br/>John Saxon as Lt. Donald Thompson, Nancy's dad was fantastic in his role and his performance. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp in his first role as Glen Lantz was awesome, I seriously loved him in 21 Jump Street TV Series and today I still love him in Pirates of the Caribbean film franchise. <br/><br/>I love the main theme Nightmare Freddy Krueger score from Charles Bernstein and I love the song at the of the credits Nightmare by 213.<br/><br/>A Nightmare On Elm Street (1984) is the best classic slasher film,one of the best horror movies ever made. It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. My number one favorite horror film in the franchise and it will always be the best one in the series. I have always enjoyed seeing this film, it is fast paced, entertaining, not boring or over long film, but short and very intense from the beginning till the end. I love this movie death. 10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval"
"Gafke","9","87","102","8 December 2005"," The original and best of the Elm Street series!
","The teenagers of Springfield, Illinois are having nightmares. Tina and her best friend Nancy learn that they're dreaming about the same creature, a hideously burned man in a dirty red and green sweater who bears an odd weapon; a glove with razor fingers. When Tina is brutally murdered in her bed one night, suspicion falls upon her volatile boyfriend Rod, who was the only other person in the room with Tina when she died. But Rod swears he didn't do it, and tells Nancy that he too has been suffering from terrible nightmares in which a knife- fingered man is trying to kill him. Nancy begins to suspect that something evil is happening within their dreams, and that perhaps the boogeyman is real. When Rod turns up dead in his jail cell, Nancy is convinced that a ghostly killer is stalking them in their sleep. Her mother, worried for Nancy's sanity, takes her to a dream clinic where her sleep patterns can be monitored. When Nancy awakens screaming from a nightmare with a bloody slash mark on her arm, she shows her mother and the doctor what she has pulled out of her dream: the battered fedora that the killer always wears. The hat bears a name tag: Fred Krueger. Nancy's mother recognizes the name and soon tells Nancy the story of a brutal child killer who had terrorized the town many years ago. When he was released on a technicality, Nancy's parents and the parents of the other nightmare-plagued children hunted Fred Krueger down and burned him alive. Fred Krueger is dead, but he's found a way to return and wreak vengeance upon the children of his killers. Nancy knows that she must find a way to stop him before he kills her and everyone else on Elm Street.<br/><br/>I just sat down and watched this movie again the other day and it's still damn impressive. The acting isn't always the greatest and it looks just the slightest bit dated, but it's still a really damn good movie. It's power lies in the fact that sleep cannot be avoided. In so many other horror movies, the victims are nothing more than vapid cattle wandering dumbly up the slaughterhouse chute and calling out: ""Is anyone there?"" as they go up. They purposefully get themselves into stupid and dangerous situations and therefore we feel no real pity for them when they are eviscerated. However, in A Nightmare On Elm Street, all the characters have to do to endanger themselves is to go to sleep. Even the most hardcore insomniac (like myself) knows that eventually, sleep will come for you; it is unavoidable. We cannot blame our cast for wandering around doing stupid things in their dreams, because how many of us have had dreams in which we show up for work naked? Very rarely are we in control of our dreams, and in A Nightmare On Elm Street, the only person in control is Freddy Krueger. <br/><br/>Robert Englund as Freddy is flawless. Before this movie was released, the boogeymen of horror films had always been hulking, silent, expressionless shapes usually hidden way behind masks. Not that there's anything wrong with that! But Englund gave us a new kind of Boogeyman - a smartass. Freddy is hideously burned, covered in scar tissue and has all the fashion sense of a wino, but he's cool. Not content to simply disembowel his screaming victims, Freddy has to tease them a little first, flirting, humiliating or showing off. He makes Tina watch him cut off his own fingers and smiles at her like a drunken uncle who's just pulled a coin out from behind her ear. He sticks his tongue in Nancy's mouth via her telephone. He doesn't waste his sense of humor on the guys in this film, but there's plenty of sequels in which he makes up for that. <br/><br/>This is such a great, innovative film, filled with pretty cool special effects, disturbing sound effects (including scraping metal fingernails and baby goats bleating in terror) and creepy music. The boiler room is an especially unnerving set, complete with hissing pipes and dripping chains. A young Johnny Depp and his feathery 80s hair make their debut in this film as well, and though his character is about half a million miles away from Captain Jack Sparrow, the raw talent is still very much in evidence here. <br/><br/>This remains the best movie of the Elm Street series, with a few good sequels and some really crappy ones. But Freddy is always worth watching."

","The ""Nightmare"" has been recently on in our TV and I must admit that even after those fourteen years it made a deep impression on me. I saw the film for the first time in 1989 and at that time I was scared because I was just a teenager then. But now, I can see that the film has got something unique, which makes the film different from other horror movies. I think it`s down to the basic idea of this film - dreams and everything that can happen in our dreams sometimes become true. The authors of this film did not have to be bound with the need to stay realistic and that opens a free way to their wildest imaginations. Charles Bernstein`s music in this movie has become clasic and we can hear the basic melodic motive in some of the sequels. Original music composed by different authors in the sequels to this first Nightmare stays far far behind Bernstein`s masterpiece."

","A Nightmare on Elm Street, one of the scariest movies of all time, and one of the scariest in the 80's. It also introduced one of the scariest villains of all time, Freddy Krueger, one of the ultimate boogeymen that you know who he is just by his name. Wes Craven brought us one of the most terrifying ideas, what would happen if your nightmares were real? That if you died in your dream, you died in real life? He brought us A Nightmare on Elm Street, a low budget horror film that has made it huge in the horror genre's world. The whole concept of the film is just what makes it so brilliant. Not to mention how cool is it that this is Johnny Depp's first film role? Who knew that that kid was going to be so huge one day, right? But the entire cast made this into one of the scariest movies that will always bring you a few nightmares on it's own.<br/><br/>Tina is a girl who has been having tons of nightmares about a scary figure, a man who is severely burned and has knives for fingers. She's so scared of this man that she asks her friends, Nancy, Nancy's boyfriend, Glenn, and her boyfriend, Rod to stay over. But Tina is brutally killed in the middle of the night, the only witness is her boyfriend, leaving him as the suspect of murder. But when he is murdered in jail, Nancy knows there's something wrong and soon she's having the same nightmares as Tina. Soon she knows that she might be next, no one believes her, until her mom reveals a deep dark secret about the mysterious figure, Freddy Krueger. He was a sick child molester/killer who the neighbors burned alive to keep him away, but now he's after their kids and he's not going to take it easy on Nancy.<br/><br/>A classic horror film that's perfect for a sleep over with your friends to watch in the dark. It's such a great film that sparked quite a few sequels and a new icon for slasher films. Freddy Krueger is so cool and extremely scary just for the fact that he's so confident in knowing that he will kill you. He's ruthless, scary, and clever and he's coming to kill the kids in their dreams. A Nightmare on Elm Street is such a great film and I highly recommend it, Wes Craven is an original genius who spawned a new type of terror.<br/><br/>10/10"

","While I love horror films, I am not a big fan of the slasher genre, which has come to dominate and indeed practically to define horror since the late 1970s. While I do love the original ""Psycho,"" most slasher films follow a different, and far more predictable, formula. The idea of a faceless killer going around stabbing teenagers just doesn't frighten me a whole lot, though some of these films do fill me with disgust--a rather different sort of emotion.<br/><br/>I am far more frightened by films that deal with distortions of reality, where it's hard for the characters to tell what's real and what's not. Admittedly, that genre isn't always so lofty either. Dreams are one of the most overused devices in the movies, having a whole set of clichés associated with them. We are all familiar with the common scene in which a character awakens from a nightmare by jerking awake in cold sweat. This convention is not only overused, it's blatantly unrealistic, for people waking up from dreams do not jerk awake in such a violent fashion. Moreover, these scenes are usually nothing more than little throwaway sequences designed to amuse or frighten the audience without advancing the plot.<br/><br/>What makes ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" so clever is how it creates an entirely new convention for representing dreams on screen. The dreaming scenes are filmed with an airy, murky quality, but so are many of the waking scenes, making it very difficult to tell whether a character is awake or asleep. Indeed, the movie never shows any character actually fall asleep, and as a result we are constantly on guard whenever characters so much as close their eyes for a moment. In crucial scenes, it is impossible to tell whether what we are seeing is real or happening only in a character's mind. But the movie ultimately suggests that the difference doesn't matter. The premise of the movie, in which a child-killer haunts teenager's dreams and has the capability of killing them while they're asleep, turns the whole ""It was all just a dream"" convention on its head: in this movie, the real world is safe, and the dream world is monstrously dangerous.<br/><br/>The movie finds a number of ways to explore this ambiguity, including a bathtub scene that invites comparisons with the shower scene in ""Psycho"" without being a cheap ripoff. My personal favorite scene, and one of the scariest I've ever seen in a movie, is the one where Nancy dozes off in the classroom while a student is standing up in front of the class reading a passage from Shakespeare. The way the scene transitions from the real classroom to a nightmarish version of it is brilliantly subtle.<br/><br/>The director, Wes Craven, understood that the anticipation of danger is usually more frightening than the final attack. There are some great visual shots to that effect, including one where Freddy's arms becomes unnaturally long in an alleyway, and another where the stairs literally turn into a gooey substance, in imitation of the common nightmare where it is hard to get away from a pursuer. The movie continually finds creative ways to tease the audience, never resorting to red herring, that tired old convention used in almost all other slasher films.<br/><br/>Despite the creativity in these scenes, ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is still a formula movie, with relatively one-dimensional characters and no great performances. This was Johnny Depp's first role, as Heather Langenkamp's boyfriend, and although he does get a few neat lines of exposition (his speech about ""dream skills""), his personality is not fleshed out, and there is no sense of the great actor Depp would go on to become.<br/><br/>Within the genre, however, ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is a fine work. My main criticism isn't its failure to transcend the formula, but its confusing and obtuse ending, apparently put there in anticipation of sequels, but managing to create a mystery that the sequels were unable to clear up. The climactic confrontation between Freddy and Nancy is weakly handled. The crucial words she says to him are surprisingly clunky, and her father's muted behavior during that scene is almost inexplicable. It has led me to consider an alternative interpretation of the scene, but one that feels like a cop-out. The scene that follows, and where the movie ends, is anticlimactic and unnecessary. These clumsily-made final two scenes come close to ruining the movie, and it is a testament to the film's many good qualities that it still stands as an unusually effective horror film that invites repeat viewings."

"Boba_Fett1138","10","82","104","20 February 2005"," A real horror classic and among the best of all time.
","This movie might very well be one of the best horror movies of all time, together with movies like ""Poltergeist"", ""Dawn of the Dead (1978)"" ""The Exorcist"" and ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974)"".<br/><br/>I didn't expected it to be but this movie was just brilliant. Certainly the best slasher movie ever made. There are several things that make this movie a good horror classic. Of course the classic 'killer' Freddy Kruger is one of them. Another thing is the concept. Yes, the story of course is just simply ridiculous at times but it's the perfect concept to fill a movie with, with some scary scene's and brutal killings with tons of blood.<br/><br/>The movie has the same scary gritty atmosphere like a horror movie from the 70's, when the horror genre was at an all-time high. <br/><br/>The actors are giving their best but some of the dialog is just plain cheesy. Still I think that the actors should deserve more credit then they are getting right now, especially Johnny Depp made a impressive movie debut. The talent was already showing, back then. His role in this movie was way bigger than I expected it to be by the way.<br/><br/>Really entertaining horror classic. Some things might look cheesy, especially the ending (I really laughed my butt off!) and the story in general but the atmosphere, gore and Kruger make up everything! Guess you have to be a fan of the genre to fully appreciate it though.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","The 80's biggest horror landmark was this smash-hit that brought director Craven into mainstream film and gave birth to an unstoppable horror icon!<br/><br/>Young lady discovers that she and her friends are having the same terrifying dreams about a scar-faced maniac, who's about to transcend into murderous life!<br/><br/>Wes Craven's biggest claim to fame, A Nightmare on Elm Street was a far more imaginative slasher film than the numerous others that flooded the 80's cinema scene. Craven's clever premise and inventively shocking story added a kind of dark fantasy element that made this film so much more engrossing (and frightening) than the average slasher flick. It also turned villain Freddy Kruger into the biggest horror icon since the monsters of 50's horror cinema. Craven's direction is truly great, giving this film plenty of feverish atmosphere, tight suspense, and a share of good scares! Adding even more to the movie is the occasional touch of dark humor, who could ever forget that 'tounge phone' bit. The movie also has lots of gruesome special FX as well. The Elm Street theme by Charles Bernstein is a nicely chilling touch too.<br/><br/>The cast is quite good. Heather Langenkamp makes for a terrific and likable heroine. John Saxon and Ronee Blakley are both great as Langenkamp's disbelieving parents. Amanda Wyss, Nick Corri, and Johnny Depp (in his debut role) are also great as some troubled Elm Street youths. Robert Englund is a power-house villain as Freddy Kruger.<br/><br/>A modern horror classic all the way, A Nightmare on Elm Street is still making folks afraid to sleep all these years later!<br/><br/>Followed by numerous sequels.<br/><br/>**** out of ****"
"Jane FlamE","9","72","92","26 January 2001"," Genre defining
","If Sean Cunningham, John Carpenter and Tobe Hooper defined the horror genre in the late 70's, early 80's then Wes Craven destroyed it, not only once, but twice, with Scream. However, before Scream, there was A Nightmare On Elm St and before there was the ghostface, there was Freddy Krueger, bastard son of 100 maniacs. Up until this point, horror was very predictable, most films adhered to the 'rules' of horror (if you have no idea what the rules are, they are simply, the 'virgin' survives, if you have sex, you die, if you drink or get high, you die and never say, ""I'll be right back"" cause u won't, for more details, see Randy in the Scream Trilogy). In 1984, this little film came out about a murderer who killed you in your dreams.<br/><br/>It was a seemingly simple concept, but it was terrifying to see the main character Nancy, (played brilliantly by a young Heather Langenkamp) battling not only her adversary, (the irrepressible Robert Englund) but the trauma's of her alcoholic mother, smothering and absent father, their divorce, her idea that she might be going crazy and sleep, as she deduces from fairly early on that if she sleeps, she dies. Nancy was a character that you cared about. She wasn't devoid of emotion or reduced to simply running and screaming from her attacker, she had emotion, she had issues, she was like most teenagers in America.<br/><br/>The film begins pretty typically enough. Freddy Krueger stalks those who according to the rules, deserve what they get. Freddy himself is frightening, with a very limited dialogue and terrifying persona. In later sequels, he becomes a humourous villain, but in the first of the series is where we see Krueger at his menacing best. But somewhere along the line, it all goes haywire, culminating in the death of Glen (Johnny Depp)Nancy's boyfriend, polite and sweet who doesn't have sex during the course of the film.You find yourself saying,""hey this can't be right, he shouldn't be dead"". But that is exactly the kind of reaction that Craven wants from you.<br/><br/>The horror, doesn't end with the apparent death of Freddy, Craven still pays homage to the typical ending of his genre, with the 'he's-not-quite-dead-yet' ending, but it is the way in which he does it. Craven makes you comfortable by having you believe that everything is ok, that it was all just a lil dream and dreams can't really hurt you, that is until the very end. It shocks you, leaving to come to your own deductions, similar to the ending of The Exorcist, it is up to you to judge who triumphed, good or evil.<br/><br/>When you think about it, what was worse for Nancy, the stalking of Freddy or her gradual sleep depravation, how long can anyone survive in their right mind with no sleep. Plus it also demonstrates that at the core of those sleepy American towns, something is rotten. The image of these surbanites in the form of Nancy and her friends parents, forming a mob and setting fire to Freddy Krueger, is in a sense more frightening than the child molesting, murdering image of Freddy himself. Craven like Stephen King, likes to illustrate in his work that some of the most horrid things happen in small quite towns. Maybe because around these times, America was reeling from the emergence of numerous serial killers. Whatever the reason, this film is a classic for so many reasons, and I dare anyone to tell me different!!"
"CalDexter","10","16","18","26 July 2008"," The classic original is the best in the series.
","I love A Nightmare On Elm Street. Every time i watch this i think it has a terrific energy and strength running through it. I like the way the film starts with Freddy Kruegar making his Finger Knife Glove in his basement cellar, then the music kicks in (what a creepy score) as the first teenager is frantically running around his maze-like Boiler Room in her dream state. Freddy is only hinted at in the shadows or ripping through cloth with his glove and i love the way you can hear animals and creepy noises emitting from all around Tina, as she becomes cornered before Freddy comes out of the shadows. A great opening.<br/><br/>Tina Grey is played by Amanda Wyss, who is really good in her role for the short time she is in this film. I always remember her character in this film the way i remember the Chrissie Watkins character at the start of Jaws, i think you know what i'm coming too. Tina's encounter with Freddy in her backyard is my favourite moment in this film, and it is one of the most horrifying deaths I've ever seen. Its frightening to see and if you are faint hearted at splashing blood then look away because it is a screamer.<br/><br/>Heather Langenkamp is excellent in this film. Shes very attractive,and gives 100% as Tina's friend Nancy Thompson who starts to have the same nightmares. My favourite moments with Nancy are mostly her scary encounters with Freddy scored to an energetic music beat by Charles Bernstein. I would say part of the movie's success is down to his creepy score. I also love the bathroom scene when Nancy falls asleep, absolutely gross and hilarious at the same time. The thing is, these 'funny' moments are actual imagines of how Freddy wants to prey on his victims before killing them, this is done in this first film with a measured discipline, then you watch The Dream Master and Freddy is basically killing kids while being 100% comic about it as well.<br/><br/>One of my favourite other scenes in this film is when Nancy is following Tina's corpse down her School halls (having falling asleep)and runs into a prefect women who states 'Wheres your pass?' Nancy doesn't respond in kind, and as she goes running down the hall, the girl reveals herself to be Freddy 'No running in the hallway' an eerie moment that is funny too.<br/><br/>Finally, special mention must go to Robert Englund as Freddy Kruegar. This actor's contribution to the character is 100% superb. I think that Freddy Kruegar IS Robert Englund and vice versa, even though a lot of his moments in this film are about injecting a scary visual presence, he also creates a mystic before the film's revelation: Who is he? Where does he come from? Why is he doing these things? After the third film of the series, Englund would become a Hollywood star and a horror icon. Rightfully so.<br/><br/>A Nightmare On Elm Street is a classic horror thriller and, along with Halloween, is one of the best horror movies ever made."

Not all of the sequels are bad, for example I am a fan of 3 & 4 but sequels like 2 & 5 ARE GIVING THE Freddy movies a bad name and are shadowing the excellence of this movie in particular.

"eytand94","10","14","16","28 September 2009"," A masterpiece of modern horror! Still the best in the series!
","After such gruesome drive-in flicks as ""The Last House on the Left"" and ""The Hills Have Eyes,"" master of horror Wes Craven wanted to make a movie that would bring the slasher genre back to life, since the genre was clouded by untalented, unoriginal films that shouldn't have been made. So, along came ""A Nightmare on Elm Street."" To this day, Craven's masterpiece of modern horror is the movie that elevated the horror genre. Avoid the awful sequels that followed it. The first ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" movie is still the scariest and most effective movie in the series.<br/><br/>The story revolves around four teens in the town of Springwood: Nancy Thompson, Tina Gray, Rod Lane and Glen Lantz. All four have had horrifying dreams involving a terribly burnt boogeyman in a red and green sweater and a brown fedora on his head with extremely sharp blades for fingers. Sure, they're just dreams. But not until Tina is graphically murdered in her sleep. No weapon was found, but there were four long cuts in Tina's chest. The rest of the group soon finds out that it is the Springwood maniac Freddy Krueger that is haunting their dreams. None of them are safe. If they fall asleep, they will meet their gruesome demise. Now it's up to Nancy to stop Freddy once and for all. But how can she stop somebody that isn't supposed to be real?<br/><br/>""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" created a terrifying villain, a plot that is very original, and a group of characters that you care about. Everybody knows who Freddy is, just like everyone knows who Michael Myers is, or Jason Voorhees, or Leatherface. He is now one of the most iconic slashers in horror cinema.<br/><br/>One of the things that I admire the most is the cast. Heather Langenkamp is an awesome heroine. Nancy is one of the girls in the genre that fought the villain and didn't run. Langenkamp creates a suburban teenage girl that is filled with pizazz and wit, which she has the most of out of all the characters. In a very brief performance, Tina is played by Amanda Wyss of the hit comedy ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High."" Her character's death is uncomfortable and disturbing to watch. Craven shows no mercy during Tina's death, not having an ounce of the scene edited. He makes you watch all of it, and that creeps the viewer out even more. Nick Corri is a very good rebel. And you'll also notice Johnny Depp in his first big movie as Glen. His death is second best.<br/><br/>Nancy's parents, Donald and Marge Thompson, are played by John Saxon of ""Black Christmas"" and Ronee Blakely of ""Nashville."" They are the last of the parents on Elm Street to hold a very dark secret about Freddy, something that they aren't telling Nancy or the others. Not such a good idea, since Freddy never seems to leave them alone.<br/><br/>I can't imagine anybody else playing Freddy other than Robert Englund. Englund is flawless in the role that made him a star. This is where Englund is scariest as Freddy. In the sequels, Freddy becomes a comedian with rather stale wisecracks. What makes Freddy so scary in the first ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" movie is how his dark, macabre sense of humor comes off as frightening. And he's always there, wherever you are. ""Since he's a dream figure, he can basically do anything,"" says critic Aviva Briefel. ""He can transform into anything. That's what makes him so scary. How can you resist sleep? He's everywhere."" If horror movies got nominations, Englund would be first in line to win the award.<br/><br/>Craven's direction is perfect. He films ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" with a great amount of flair and he provides plenty of gore that will satisfy gore-hounds and enough scares to make you jump.<br/><br/>The verdict: ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" still holds up as one of the scariest horror movies ever made. And people are always going to remember it. When kids are off to summer camp or they want their parents to tell them a scary story before bed, they most likely will hear about Freddy Krueger and his razor-blade glove. Nightmares are guaranteed. ""One, two, Freddy's coming for you...Three, four, better lock your door...Five, six grab your crucifix...Seven, eight, gonna stay up late...Nine, ten, never sleep again!"""

","Every small-town neighborhood has an old legend that never dies. For the residents of Elm Street, Fred Krueger is the demonic soul that plagues their nightmares. Krueger was an evil child molester, burned alive by the parents of the children he had slain in the past. Now, years later, he has reappeared in the nightmares of Elm Street's teenagers. Nancy (Heather Langenkamp) continually experiences these haunting visions in which the permanently scarred man chases her through the shadows of a boiler room -- the same room in which he used to slay his helpless victims. Nancy considers her dreams to be typical nightmares one of her best friends is apparently ""sliced"" to death during a deep sleep in her home.<br/><br/>Soon Nancy's dreams become worse, and her boyfriend Glen (Johnny Depp) admits that he has also been experiencing unpleasant nightmares. Together they uncover the truth behind Krueger's death years ago, and vow to stay awake as long as they can and strategize a plan to bring Krueger back into the ""real world"" and kill him once and for all.<br/><br/>Loosely based on true events, Wes Craven's inspiration for the tale originated after he reportedly read that a number of people across the world had died in their slumber. Blending fantasy with reality, Craven wrote and directed one of the most iconic horror films of all time, which -- similar to ""Halloween"" before it -- spawned an inferior legion of sequels and imitators, all of which continue to pale in comparison to the original.<br/><br/>The brilliance of ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is that it relies on psychological fear vs. cheap exploitation tricks. ""Halloween,"" directed by John Carpenter and released in 1978, had re-sparked interest in the Hitchcock-style horror/thrillers, and ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" builds upon this, cleverly channeling the mystery surrounding dreams and using it as a gateway for chills and thrills. Midway through the movie, a doctor played by Richard Fleischer tells Nancy's mother that the process of dreams -- where do they come from? -- has yet to be explained, and the fact that all humans tend to have dreams on a regular basis is essentially why this film remains so scary, even by today's standards. Some of the special effects are quite outdated but, unlike the ""Nightmare"" imitators, gore plays second to the plot and characters -- something rare in a horror film.<br/><br/>The sequels became sillier and gorier. Fred's name changed to the less menacing ""Freddy"" (which we all now know him by), he was given more screen time, the makeup on his face was not quite as horrific, he began to crack jokes more often and his voice evolved into a less demonic cackle. In the original ""Nightmare"" it is interesting to note that Freddy is rarely given screen time at all -- we see his infamous hands (wearing gloves with butter knives attached on the fingers to slice his victims), we see his hat, we see his sweater, we see his outline in the darkness of the shadows, but even when we finally see Freddy up-close, Craven manages to keep the camera moving so that we never gain a distinct image of the killer. Now, twenty years later, there's no mystery anymore -- Freddy's face is featured on the front cover for most of the films and his very presence has become the cornerstone of all the movies in the franchise. But in 1984, long before Craven predicted his character would become a huge part of modern pop culture, Freddy was mysterious and not very funny at all.<br/><br/>The acting is one of the film's weaknesses -- Heather Langenkamp is never totally awe-inspiring as Nancy, truth be told (although she does a decent job); Depp -- in his big-screen debut -- shows a sign of talent to come but basically mutters clichéd dialogue most of the time. The co-stars are acceptable at best. However the greatest performance is -- not surprisingly -- by Robert Englund, as Freddy, who is in the film barely at all. Ironically, as mentioned above, this only makes the film succeed at scaring us.<br/><br/>The direction is not as superb as ""Halloween,"" and for that matter either is the film. Over the years, ""Nightmare"" has arguably been given an overrated reputation, although it is inferior to ""Halloween."" However, compared to some of the other so-called ""horror films"" released during the '80s -- including ""Friday the 13th"" and other dumb slasher flicks -- ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" does seem to stand as one of the best horror films of the decade. Despite its flaws it is quite smart with a surprise ""final"" ending and one of cinema's greatest villains lurking at the core.<br/><br/>""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is really Nancy's story. The film focuses on Nancy's troubles, Nancy's dreams and Nancy's actions. The ending of the film becomes a bit muddled -- the booby traps are unfortunately a bit goofy and Freddy helplessly (almost humorously) chasing Nancy around her home supposedly trying to murder her is something the film could have done without -- but overall it is a satisfying mixture of horror, thriller and fantasy, a movie that taps into two seldom-recognized everyday events in human life, which are sleeping, and dreaming. Craven's ability to realize this unknown fear in a movie is, needless to say, quite fascinating. ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is not a great movie but for horror buffs it is a must-see and for non-horror-buffs there is a fair amount of other elements to sustain one's interest."
"broke03","9","6","6","2 February 2019"," The movie that makes you terrified of falling asleep
","It's been over a decade since and when I saw Jason X and Freddy vs Jason. As a kid then, I was more pulled with the action and violence rather than the story. So of these two slasher villains, it's been Jason I was fond of. I grew up. Watched many movies. It was recent that I decided to get back to my roots, to know more of these villains. So I watched all the Friday the 13th movies first. And recently, the first of A Nightmare on Elm Street, and wow. ANoES is one of the best horror movies I've ever seen. Immersive. Very atmospheric. The story is focused. The imagery nightmare material. The score relentlessly terrifying. A slasher movie done right, I didn't feel annoyed by the characters at all, partly because of the screenplay itself but the acting did it for me too. I do not want to spoil things for people yet to discover the movie so I would say this vague: the scene where the blood gushed profusely, and rather in an exaggerated way from the hole in the bed to the ceiling just added to the overall darkness of the tone of the film. Usually, exaggeration is off-putting when exaggeration is not the name of the game, but not that. And it was only now that I appreciated Wes Craven and only now that I learned I've watched some of his movies already - Scream and Scream 2 which are both very good too. I just don't think that ANoES can be topped by any of its sequels. But I will still watch them. I crave for more.<br/><br/>I also noticed Heather Langenkamp who played Nancy in the movie really looked like Lily James. Lily James has played several period movie characters. Nice.<br/><br/>I am more of 21st century movie guy but this one has aged so well the movie still holds up to this day. This is one of the movies that make me want to watch movies older than me.<br/><br/>I wish I could have watched this as a kid so I would have gotten more terrified by nightmares then. I'm an adult now. I will just make sure to have it watched by the kids in the family. They like scary movies and I'm sure this will spook them up.<br/><br/>One, two Freddy's coming for you / Three, four Better lock your door / Five, six Grab your crucifix / Seven, eight Gonna stay up late / Nine, ten Never sleep again"
"lostinaction","10","12","14","23 April 2009"," A true classic Horror Movie about a modern Vampire
","Do you need a big budget to make a good Horror Movie? No, Wes Craven and many other Directors of that Genre proved that more than once. From today's point of view some special effects might look a bit poor but some others are still impressive and they still stick in my mind. What I impressed more than the blood and gore scenes are the creation of a new kind of Horror figure: Freddy Krueger. In a kind he is a modern Vampire. He isn't like Bela Lugosi's or Christopher Lee's Dracula a fashionable and handsome man who tries to seduce his victims. No he is more like Max Schreck's Count Orlok of the classic Nosferatu. An ugly person you fear when you see him. Freddy Krueger doesn't suck out the blood but the sucks out the fear of his victims. He needs their fear to live and like a Cat with a Mouse he plays with his victims before he kills them. Most of them are teenager and like a Vampire he is coming into the night when all the children sleep. If one of the youngsters let him in their dream it's pretty difficult to survive for them.<br/><br/>It's not so easy to create a horror figure. Director Wes Craven had the luck to find with Robert Englund the perfect cast for this role. Also some of the young actresses and actors are showing good performances. As Max Schreck was Count Orlok Robert Englund is Freddy Krueger. No wonder that so many sequels would follow. Next to the creation of a perfect new horror monster the whole movie follows somehow the concept of old classics. If you hear a children song in a horror movie it's always scary. The concept of the plot is like an old urban legend, myth or old classic ghost story. A young teenage girl is telling his parents that she dreamed of a monster that tried to kill her. Nobody believes her and keep on telling her it's just a nightmare. Freddy Krueger cannot come into the dreams of adults they don't have the imagination of fantasy anymore.<br/><br/>Next to the plot I was always impressed of the style of directing and photography of A Nightmare on Elm Street. It's 80's style with contemporary music. The movie it self has a Gothic nightmarish atmosphere but Wes Craven used the colors and the look of the 1980's for it. The first A Nightmare on Elm Street Movie isn't a typical Horror Mainstream product. Wes Craven not only broke with some of the common rules of the genre he also reinvented some old classic rules of the genre into a new light. I highly recommend this piece of 80's culture to every movie fan not only the horror fans. If you don't like horror series don't watch the sequels but watch Wes Craven's Version of a Nightmare."
"qqq456","10","9","10","4 June 2008"," A Very Clever Horror Movie
","This movie is much different from other horror movies because it's more about the story and mystery and less on pointless killings.<br/><br/>in some pointless horror movies I think to my self when pricks get slashed d by an obvious killer I say ""yeah sure there getting killed but gives a cares"". But in Nightmare on elm street is clever psychological suspense. By 1984, the slasher genre was wearing thin. Halloween bombed out with number 3, and Friday the 13th was falling into the dreadful mix of completely cliché horror. Without A Nightmare on Elm Street, that could have been it for the slasher film. With it, however, the genre was brought off the respirator for another 10 years when Craven did it again with Scream, but I digress. Wes Craven delivers a very original, creative, and well played out horror film that has the perfect level of plot, fright, gore, and imagination. The balance of these elements is key, as it gives you the best of all of them, without becoming too cliché, too bloody, or too silly."

I remember watching the original film back in Halloween of 2000 where I thought that Freddy Krugger had gotten me until my dad woke me up to see if I was okay. Luckily, there weren't any bruises or cuts on me before leaving to school the next day.<br/><br/>Starting on my review.<br/><br/>Wes Craven's ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is about a group of kids led by Nancy (Heather Lagenkamp) where her friends have one thing in common: They see the same guy in their dreams.

That's when two somewhat under-budgeted films,James CAmeron's ""The Terminator""(which would catapult then-cult figure Arnold Scwarzenegger to super-stardom) and this film,Wes Craven's ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"". Both central characters,the eponymous Terminator and ""Nightmare"" menace Freddy Krueger would become iconic film images for decades to come.<br/><br/>The plot line of the story's no government secret here: a handful of high schoolers in a seemingly ordinary town in Ohio are being haunted in their dreams by a grotesque figure. When this figure starts murdering each one of the group,it's up to Nancy(Heather Langenkamp),the most stable and level of the group,to ferret out and end the terror. Robert Englund,previously known from supporting character roles and his touching,gentle alien in the ""V"" mini-series and t.v.series,is able to develop a nearly permanent career as the seemingly indominable child-killer. Wes Craven would redefine his own career,as well as the slasher genre,with this film,where he had previously been known for visceral,uncomfortable shockers like ""LAst House on the Left"" and ""The Hills HAve Eyes"".<br/><br/>Definitely worth a look,especially for those who consider themselves horror film buffs."

She invites her friends Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp), who had also a nightmare with Freddy Krueger, and Glen Lantz (Johnny Depp) to spend the next night with her, but her boy-friend Rod Lane (Nick Corri) appears in the house and they spend the night together. In the middle of the night, Rod awakes and sees Tina having a nightmare and being sliced. He is accused of murder and arrested by Nancy's father Lt.

When Rod and Glen are mysteriously murdered, Nancy realizes that the only way to defeat the evil Freddy Krueger is bringing him to the real world.<br/><br/>The classic ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is one of the best horror movies of the 80's and Freddy Krueger is my favorite villain. The story is original, very well written and directed by Wes Craven and is the debut of Johnny Depp in the cinema. As far as I know, the open conclusion was forced by the producers to give a sequel to the saga of Freddy Krueger.

As the series wore on, each successive film played him more and more for laughs.

","By the late 70s and early 80s, the slasher film genre was at its peak. With then-new special effects, they were always sure to have the audience on the edge of their seats. In this genre in particular, you had the Father (Michael Myers of Halloween), the Son (Jason of Friday the 13th), and last and most importantly, the Holy Spirit; none other than Freddy Krueger of A Nightmare on Elm Street.<br/><br/>A Nightmare on Elm Street is on a slightly different level than the other gory slasher films of the 80s. It delves into a different part of the viewer's psyche that a lot of other films have ignored. Freddy, our villain, is as gruesome as our other horror movie monsters, (although he's acquit with slightly more witty banter) but he can only attack you one way--- in your dreams.<br/><br/>Having the dreamworld as Freddy's playground is one of the smartest, and scariest ideas film maker Wes Craven could have come up with. Sleep is a thing that all humans have to do, no matter how hard we try to stay awake. Caffeine and cold showers can only take you so many days before you eventually drift off into slumber, where a real-life nightmare awaits you.<br/><br/>As far as the acting goes in this film, you can't get any better for a number of reasons. Freddy's (Robert Englund) sly and sometimes perverted remarks bring a sense of comic relief into the script, a thing many other horror films don't have. Also, this was Johnny Depp's first role in a feature-length film. And let me tell you, the 17 year old Johnny made being torn in two look pretty realistic. Our heroine of the film, (Heather Langenkamp) played a very believable, strong role. She made the audience root for her the whole way through, and made viewers feel her frustration when no one would believe her about her night stalker.<br/><br/>Along with a great musical score that made The Nightmare on Elm Street theme famous, a great cast, and a very talented director, Nightmare is safety one of the slasher genre's greatest films. With six sequels to follow, a television show, and various merchandise, it is obvious that this was one of horror's biggest franchises. With its cult following, this movie will be loved for generations to come."

There are few good horror movies where people fight back and this is one of them.<br/><br/>Being a big fan of John Carpenter I felt Wes Cravens film where worth checking out, and so far I'm not disappointed. i think most of you 70's and 80's horror fans noticed the same thing like me; this kinda reminds me of John Carpenters ""Halloween"". The lead role is a few years younger and Michael Meyers is replaced with Freddy Krueger an equally creepy bogeyman-ish character.<br/><br/>Of course like all horror movies is write reviews about I note that these are not for the faint of heart.

Robert Englund is truly frightening as Freddy Krueger, a dark figure whose only purpose is to kill all the siblings of his killers.  The knife-styled finger glove has become a trademark of this amazing character who was created by writer-director Wes Craven.  The film goes for suspense, drama, and gore and delivers for the most part.  None of the characters are developed very well, but most do not live to see the end of the film so it really does not matter.  A great horror film that still delivers today.

"baumer","10","6","7","21 June 1999"," Come to Freddy...
","There really are, when you come to think of it, not that many films that are truly frightening. The kind of film that gets under your skin and eats away at you. The kind of film that stays with you days ( and nights ) after you see it. There certainly aren't any that come to mind from the 90's. But along with films like Aliens the first Halloween, The Exorcist, Angel Heart, Last House On The Left and the first Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the first Nightmare is terrifying. And that is owed all to Wes Craven. The sequels of this film are really trash and that is because Robert Shaye may be a good business man but he certainly does not know how to see to it that The Nightmare series stayed it's course and kept viewers on the edge of their seat. The sequels became more comedic than scary and even though Freddy had a personality in the first one, he was still more diabolical and evil than he was funny. More Lon Chaney than Jerry Lewis. But the first one has every element in it to keep you scared beyond belief.<br/><br/>This film is iconic in many ways. There are those that say it is dated. I beg to differ on that point. This is a film that transcends generations and expertly amalgamates gore and tension. When you think of all of the so called horror films that have come out in the last year or so, many of them try to enthrall us with buckets of blood and special effects, but they forget that with a horror film, you must have an element of fear with it. Nightmare on Elm Street captures that better than most, and is on a level with the all time greats.<br/><br/>Fred Krueger, as we all know, was a child molester who was hunted down by the local Elm Street parents after he beat a court systems on a technicality. They trapped him in his basement and lit his house on fire and then watched him burn. Somehow he comes back and haunts their children's dreams and murders them while they sleep. This sets up the premise of the film and it is stated on the SE DVD that Craven got the idea for this film while reading a story in an Asian newspaper about kids dying in their sleep and telling their parents that they knew something bad was going to happen to them in their dreams. It is an interesting concept and because it is done to perfection here, it has now become one of the cornerstones of American horror.<br/><br/>Wes Craven has been revitalized as a master of modern horror with his very commerically successful Scream series, and as much as I love Scream, it is horror lite when comparing it to his efforts like NOES, LHOTL and The Hills Have Eyes. Those films, and Nightmare in particular, revolutionized ther horror genre. Nightmare on Elm Street is his best film and if you forget how truly scary the film is after viewing all of the inferior comedic sequels (with the exception of the last) view this one. Freddy is a horror icon and he has achieved that status because he is the true definition of fear.<br/><br/>10/10 One of the 10 best horror films ever! <br/><br/>Come to Freddy!!"
"ccthemovieman-1","7","21","32","6 November 2006"," A Frightening Start
","Well, this was the beginning of ""Freddy Kreuger,"" who certainly became famous in the horror movie genre. Of those horror films that spawned numerous sequels (this one, Halloween, etc.) this was the best of the ""opening"" shows. It definitely is frightening.<br/><br/>It has the usual crude teenagers, some gratuitous sex and wild Krueger scenes and is probably best-noted for showing Johnny Depp's film debut. Boy, does he look young! He looks about 16 years old, as does Heather Langenkamp, who went on to play in several more of these Nightmare stories. This was the only movie in which she was foul-mouthed. Nice to see Rony Blackley, too.<br/><br/>Wes Craven certainly started this series off with a bang."
"Chromium_5","7","12","17","17 February 2005"," Has some cool ideas, but doesn't really amount to anything.
","The best part about this movie is the whole idea that sleep can kill you in a horrible and gory fashion. Once that is established, Craven does an excellent job of making normally comforting settings such as a soft bed or a warm bubble bath seem menacing. Never before has falling asleep seemed so scary, and it gets better and better as Nancy tries to come up with a solution before she goes crazy from lack of sleep, while surviving on coffee and caffeine pills. It has a very interesting suspense to it. There is also the nicely done part where they try to apply cold hard science to Nancy's problem (""Something's wrong, the numbers are never this high!""). Very cool.<br/><br/>Those are the good parts. The bad parts are the lame acting (excluding Johnny Depp) and the laziness of the script. It really, really hurts this movie that so little attention is paid to the parents. They are barely even IN the movie, even though the entire premise revolves around them! The backstory about these seemingly nice parents, in a quiet suburban town, viciously killing a man (child murderer or not), and keeping it a big town secret, is a neat idea that is just briefly mentioned like an afterthought (""Oh, by the way honey, all of us parents burned a man to death when you were a kid. Now go to bed, OK?""). The implication is that Freddie is getting revenge on the people who killed him by murdering their innocent children, but it's not explained or developed at all. Why is he coming back NOW, for instance? Why not earlier? And why in the world do Nancy's parents completely ignore her? If you murdered a guy years ago, and then your kid, who knows nothing about it, provides an exact description of him in her dreams, wouldn't you think there was something a bit odd going on? It would have been much cooler if they had realized Freddie was killing their kids, and there's nothing they could do about it.<br/><br/>I also hate the ending to this movie. Why do horror movies always have to have such bizarro endings? The climactic battle at the end is awesome, but then it takes such a weird turn--(and I'm not even including the nutty twist here, I'm talking about the father NOT CARING that his wife just got sucked into a bed by a demon!)--that it totally runs out of steam and turns into a horrible, nonsensical train wreck. Roll credits.<br/><br/>If the movie focused more on the parents, and had a decent ending, it would have been a true classic. Instead, it is a mediocre slasher flick with a few interesting elements, which is a real shame."
"ericostendorf","10","7","9","7 May 2017"," Best horror movie ever
","A nightmare on elm street has always been and will always be my favorite horror movie of all time. But not just because it is an amazing movie, but also because it is the movie that really got me interested in movies, especially in horror movies. If i'd have to criticize anything, it'd be some of the acting. The acting in the movie is actually good except for Heather, who plays Nancy. She was decent, but i think the could have been better. But of course Robert Englund plays Freddy in this movie, who is my personal favorite horror movie villain of all time. Just the idea of some haunting you and trying to kill you in your dreams is terrifying. And of course he looks awesome. I think the characters in general are extremely likable and you really don't want them to die. But when someone dies it is really has an impact on you because first of all we don't want them to die and second of all the death scenes are really well made. This movie has one of the most iconic deaths in horror history and some of the most iconic moments in horror history. For example Freddy's hand coming out of the bathtub. Also i love the ending to this movie. Of course i don't want to spoil anything, so i'll just say that i love the ending. I know Wes Craven actually wanted to have a different ending, and yes i would've preferred the ending that he was planning on putting into the movie, but i still love the ending that we got. So, this movie is not only one of my favorite horror moves of all time, it is one of my favorite movies of all time. I can watch this movie over and over again and it just never gets boring. The cast is overly good in my opinion and Craven introduced us to not only one of the best and most iconic villains of all time, but also to Jonny Depp. This is an absolute masterpiece and of course i'll give a 10 out of 10."
"Det_McNulty","7","7","9","10 March 2007"," Whacky, Creepy, Entertaining and Amusing; A Highlight In Definitive Horror Cinema
","Looking back at the world of film in the '80s you will notice that overall it was a fairly disastrous and disappointing time for cinema. It was a time where focus was spent on money, fame and fortune, rather than talent and a decade that introduced the rise of the sequel. It was also a very popular decade for horror films, particularly slasher films and yet there are very few exceptional horror achievements from the '80s. I've never been too fond of horror as a genre. I find it a clichéd and unproductive genre; although it is a genre that has so much going for it and when done accurately you might be lucky enough to have the pleasure a skin-crawling masterpiece. You see, horror needs imagination and originality to work; it has to blend genre elements together to craft something genuinely unique. Horror is a genre that has so much to offer. Alas, it is a sad fact when you acknowledge just how little is accomplished due to focus on spawning money-laundering, gore-filled sequels. Yet, there is something so appealing about Wes Craven's triumphant '80s classic<br/><br/>A Nightmare on Elm Street is crafted around the now infamous ""bogeyman"" story, which has become somewhat globalising by marketing sequels and Halloween costumes. The film follows the story of a group of suburban American teens who are being stalked in their dreams by a murdered, superficial serial-killer named Freddy Krueger. So the teens decide to fight against the creature inside their dreams. The film is centred on a heroine (a popular Wes Craven trend, e.g. Scream) and oddly reminisces specific elements of John Carpenter's masterpiece Halloween. <br/><br/>A Nightmare on Elm Street undoubtedly has its flaws, although these are flaws that are disguised by some of the truly brilliant factors that the film holds. Yes, it has become somewhat dated, yes, the young actors/actresses hold nothing special performance wise, yes, the film is at times cheesy and yes the script is extremely bland. But when you have the brilliance of a film where the editing manages to create a parallel universe, thereby the dimension of reality and dream-state are fused together (the viewer notes the film's dimension through subtleties in the direction) creating a horribly surreal and literal nightmare. A Nightmare on Elm Street is extremely intelligent in the way it wants to attack your sub-conscious. This is another method at creating a lasting fear for viewers unnerved by the actual viewing of the film and rather will be thinking about it when they are ready to fall asleep. Fact is, everyone can relate to A Nightmare on Elm Street due to the fact that everybody has had nightmares and this is the reason for it being considered (for some) a terrifying film.<br/><br/>Filmed on a low-budget and using a mixture of dizzying camera techniques A Nightmare on Elm Street does not stop at being unique. The use of a few set-pieces and masterful props are perfect at creating the atmosphere for a horror film. There is a strong use of poignant lighting and shadow techniques scattered throughout the film. These take wonderful focus on the grotesque make-up for the iconic villain Freddy Krueger. Wes Craven uses sly editing processes and music to delve inside the film's story. The narrative has been paced at a steady speed, never feeling rushed and unnecessary meaning that you are inside the tension throughout the entire running-time. There is an amusing touch of dark comedy littered throughout the film, primarily gained from Krueger's insane antics. It really is a shame that Hollywood is obsessed with making unnecessary sequels to solid films which get away with unexpected climaxes and open endings. The American film industry seems to be obsessed by the idea of having everything wrapped up in a tight package for today's audiences. <br/><br/>If you want a highly entertaining, influential, iconic and productive horror film then look no further than A Nightmare on Elm Street. It remains fantasy horror at the top of its game and a respectful ode to '80s cinema."
"bob the moo","Null","52","94","19 July 2004"," Dated and very genre but still an effective low budget horror
","When a group of friends all have similar dreams with a weird man in a dirty red and black jumper they just think it's a bit weird. However when one of them is brutally murdered by an unseen force while she sleeps, her boyfriend Rod is arrested for the murder. Meanwhile, Nancy falls asleep in class, only to find herself chased through her dream by the same disfigured man. When it becomes apparent that this is more than a dream, more of Tina's friends start to die<br/><br/>With seven or eight (who can keep track?) sequels under its belt, Freddy merchandising and the fact that the 'monster' has become almost a hero, it is hard to look back at this film with fresh eyes. This film is not the gory spectacle that teenagers with video recorders in their bedroom will have come familiar with over several flashy sequels; rather this is a low budget horror movie that is quite gory, quite scary and pretty effective. The plot is interesting enough and is better than the 'gore for gore's sake' that the sequels fell into  it's still not the most intelligent thing you'll ever see but it is still interesting enough. Of course it is about 20 years old now and it looks dated, an effect not helped by the way recent horrors have made fun of the things in here that have become genre cliché over the years. The downside of watching it now is that you expect it to be as 'big', 'gory' etc as the 7 or 8 sequels have progressively become  but it isn't, it's a lot more straightforward a horror than that.<br/><br/>Despite this though it is still a good horror movie  low budget but yet with effective effects and a monster that has grown larger than the series itself. The cast all fit into the requirements of low budget horror, that is to say they can't really act and just scream lots. Langenkamp is a good example and, accordingly, she has done little since this film of any high caliber. Wyss, Garcia and even Depp are all pretty wooden and just fit in with the genre. Saxon puts in a better performance but even then it is only comparable. Englund is actually in the film a lot less than you would expect and, as a result, makes more of an impact. He would later take his Freddy to the level of cartoon character or celebrity (as shown in the New Nightmare) but here he gets his horror character just right  a monster.<br/><br/>Overall this is a good low budget horror but it is one that is difficult to view now without looking back and seeing it as the start of a long horror series that producing a character that has even moved beyond the constraints of his own film. The best way to enjoy this is on its own terms  it is not a massive horror series, it is a single low budget horror movie from the mid-eighties; as such it suffers from the usual genre flaws from the period but it also delivers the goods in terms of scares and gore. It may not be as gory or as knowing as some of the later sequels but it does what it originally intended to do  scare and thrill."

","While I'm sure modern audiences wont find this 80s slasher flick to be as terrifying as films like ""Hereditary"" or ""The Witch"", ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is a classic horror flick that I believe is essential horror viewing for any cinephile worth their salt. Freddy is the most inventive slasher of the 80s, and he's one of the most entreating as well. Though I wouldn't say all of the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" movies are worth watching, many of the sequels do have their merits."

By today's standard no this isn't super horrifying but put yourselves in the shoes of people watching this in the 80's and you will be able to see the horror this film afflicted to those who watched it. Robert Englund plays Freddie Perfectly, the special effects for that time were terrific and horrifying , as well as the development of the story/characters for an 80's slasher is above all others.

The mixture of humour and cruelty blend well in a film which makes the 90 mins seem like half an hour. The character of Freddy Krueger is so unique and so original, he has become an icon of the 80's. Enough gushing, but this film is amazing.<br/><br/>When killings start in a small town in teenagers sleep, they try and figure out who this mysterious killer is.

When the dream becomes a reality for one of the kids, and the worst happens, Nancy Thompson risks all to bring the bogeyman into the open.<br/><br/>Stupendous horror movie, one that not even the ream of sequels, spin- offs and cartoons could ever diminish. Wes Craven creates a film of utter terror, unleashing one of the genres most famous monsters on the unsuspecting film loving public, with Robert Englund as the hideous Fred Krueger having the time of his life slashing away and delivering oral venom. <br/><br/>A number of scenes and sequences are staggeringly memorable, in the process shifting into horror movie folklore. The youthful cast are sensibly written (Craven's screenplay that took inspiration from a true story he read about Cambodian refugees literally dying of nightmares!), they are not dumb these kids, just vulnerable, but led by Nancy (Heather Langenkamp) there may be hope of some survivors?<br/><br/>The blurry line between dreams and reality gets a bloody make-over here, creating biblical snoots in the process. In short, essential horror movie for those inclined. 9/10"

","A Nightmare on Elm Street is where Craven's career really kicked off, creating one of the most iconic horror villains of all time, Freddy Krueger, a killer that still scares its fans to this day. In this slasher film Freddy Kruger, the killer, has a personal vendetta with several teenagers whose parents took it upon themselves to hunt down and burn alive, hence the sever scaring on his face, but why? There is a slight twist to the usual slasher killer within A Nightmare on Elm Street; Freddy Kruger becomes your absolute worst nightmare, literally. We are completely exposed and vulnerable when we are asleep so this just amplifies that fear by violating you through an invasion of your dreams where Freddy takes control and if you die in the dream, you die for real. Freddy is the worst possible, inherently evil enemy you could have and these teenagers are at the mercy of his malicious ways as he takes his revenge."

","About two years ago, I watched this movie, so I was about 14. I wasn't exactly afraid, my previous comment had me saying that the movie was too short, running at 92 minutes. Despite the movie seeming short, this didn't mean I did not like the movie, actually, it is one of my few favorites in cinema.<br/><br/>Just recently, New Line Cinema released the Infinifilm version of the movie, it being a two disk set, one with the movie, the other is special features that help me understand the movie much more.<br/><br/>The story starts off with the infamous slasher, Fred Krueger, chasing after a young woman, named Tina. After her awakening, and talking with her friends at school, her friends slowly realize that the man in her dream has been in each others dream as well. After an frightening sequence, Tina is killed. So far, Glen and Tina are the only ones who can fight the slasher, but how? If there is anything to be said about this movie, it has to be Wes Craven's original screenplay and his direction that makes the movie something amazing to be seen. On top of that, this movie is the best movie out of all of the Nightmare series. If you read my comments on the other Nightmares, I never say which is the best, this is the best, no doubt about it.<br/><br/>If you ever see this movie, be it on VHS or DVD, rent it immediately.

The idea of a man that attacks us when we are most vulnerable (dreams) is terrifying to say the least and oozes with originality. One of the things I love about this movie is that it has many thought provoking ideas which are not usual in horror/slasher movies.

"v_haritha_in","8","5","6","24 August 2014"," Slasher Films can be Done Well Too
","The most terrifying situations that most people experience are nightmares. They can happen even if you are in the safety of your home and since the rules of reality do not apply to them, they can take any turn. And since they are in your own head, there is no escape. What can be worse than such a nightmare coming true? This movie adopts this premise literally. A group of parents murder a serial child killer, Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund). He exerts revenge on them by haunting their children in their dreams. What these kids experience in their dreams is parallely happening to them in reality...<br/><br/>Freddy Krueger is an iconic villain today and he has spawned numerous sequels and cross-overs, all for good reason. He has a plausible back- story which is frightening even in real life. His mode of operation in unique. His weapon is a clawed glove, simple yet so scary. He steals the show and possibly even the audience's night-time visions with a mere seven minutes of screen time. <br/><br/>The film does not rely much on jump scares though there are a few. It creates a tension-heavy atmosphere and plays more on psychological fear. The narrative is simple and coherent. For those who want to see gore, there is some of that too. <br/><br/>The film suffers from two major drawbacks. First, most of the acting is hammy especially by Langenkamp. But, this could be due to the fact that it is a slasher film, a genre not well-respected and it is of low budget. They could probably not afford the right kind of actors, though they roped in the then unknown Johnny Depp. Second, the ending looks like a cheap trick to exact one last scare from us and/or pave way for a sequel. I read that the director, Wes Craven wanted to have a different ending and was persuaded to alter it by the producer, Shaye. Craven's idea sounds much better and he should have stuck to that. A memorable film none-the-less."
"MitchellCombden","10","5","6","3 October 2013"," one of my personal favourites. definitely recommended!
","a nightmare on elm street 1984 is a horror classic. one of the most original horror films ever made. released at a time where slasher films were growing tiresome a nightmare on elm street revitalized the sub genre. Friday the 13th was up to it's third sequel and Halloween had already released it's second sequel. many other slasher films had been released and they all followed the template set in stone by Friday the 13th and Halloween. the sub genre was on life support and desperately needed a shot of adrenaline. so along came a little low budget film called A nightmare on elm street directed by Wes Craven. while a nightmare on elm street does stay true to the tropes that make a slasher film, it does so in a refreshing way (at the time of release) in terms of it's premise and the plot structure. the concept of a killer that haunts your dreams relentlessly and doesn't stop until he's killed you is a terrifying experience. if you die in your dreams you die in the real world. this allows Craven to utilize near unlimited creativity. the most frightening part though is that sleep is a must. there truly is no escape from this menacing evil so the level of impending doom is huge. just the way the director toys with your mind and plays around with whether the characters in the film have fallen asleep or not is brilliant. the amount of creativity that is put into the dream sequences and special FX is astounding. it truly delivers some of the most memorable and intense scares ever. the atmosphere is very dark and.. well.. dream-like. its a very unique and spooky atmosphere to say the least. along with a very sinister and mysterious dream demon named Freddy Krueger this movie is a real treat. although done on a small budget the film's FX are top notch and are very creative. as for the acting, most of it is not that bad. the final girl and Robert Englund are of coarse the head of the show and they carry the film with some memorable and standout performances. the script is also very good for the budget they had and it has many classic scenes of terror that will never leave my mind. but considering Wes craven is the director id assume we all knew the plot and script would be great. the only other thing I can say is definitely check out this one. whether you like slasher films, psychological horror, cool FX and some bloody mayhem, or just horror in general.. this is one that you must see at all costs! the only downside for me was the very end. I guess by that point in time most of the budget was gone and they had to fix up an ending with whatever they had left but it was still alright. i excuse the very tiny issues and consider this film a perfect horror film. the verdict: 10/10"

His costume design and make-up is unmatched by any of the other slasher icons, and he is matched perhaps only by Nosferatu's Count Orlock in terms of character design.<br/><br/>This film really gets under your skin and gives you some serious nightmares.

"ferreira_alberto","10","5","6","10 July 2008"," The Best Villain of all time!
","The Movie: I can still remember the first time I saw this one! And from that day became my favorite movie for life! The movie refreshes the genre, witch was exploring at the time the slasher sub-genre. It launched a new kind of slasher, who talks, teases and could kill his victims in their sleep! We always wonder what would happen if we die in our dreams, well, a nightmare on elm street answer that question in the most macabre way. The cast is fabulous, starting with the villain Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund from Eaten Alive and V), the heroin Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp)and the beginning of a amazing actor witch plays Glen (Johnny Depp), the heroin's boyfriend. Wes Craven's work is one in a lifetime, the effects are amazing, making this movie looked like it was big budget production. The short amount of money, makes a Nightmare on Elm Street the ultimate Classic of the modern age, and Makes Freddy Krueger the most loved villain since Darth Vader. All the energy spent with the will of wanting to make this movie is felt during the hole time.<br/><br/>The sequels: Well, as usually, if the formula works it will comeback for more! In this case, the numbers of sequels is a little bit too much for the character Freddy Krueger, because sequel after sequel the character became too much of a joker, instead the sarcastic killer from the first movie. One of the biggest mistakes of New Line Cinema was as the Budget grew, we started to see more detailed Krueger's face, witch made the character more exposed and less scary. Freddy's Revenge is probably where the ambient is similar to the original, Krueger is still in the dark, half hidden by the shadows of darkness and although after the sequel it's not my favorite part, is one of my favorites. As the character started to loose the audience, new line cinema started to loose control over Freddy's character, until the creator Wes Craven came with Wes Craven's New Nightmare, refreshing the franchise. In my opinion, Freddy is dead and he should stay that way in sign of respect for what he has given to New Line Cinema! The remake news that Robert Englund is not going to play Freddy Krueger only makes us (fans) wonder that New Line Cinema couldn't care less for the importance that the character had for the studio, and if it wasn't for Freddy, Lord of The Rings would probably be made by another studio. Freddy Made New Line big and New Line is making Freddy shrink!<br/><br/>Long Live Freddy!"

","Of the time, there where three slashers that where popular with pop culture and still are today: Micheal Myers, Jason Voorhees, and Fred Kruger. A Nightmare On Elm Street is about the clever, scary Freddy. Not only is Freddy more clever than Jason Voorhees as a killer, but A Nightmare On Elm Street is done a whole lot smarter that any Friday the 13th film. However, A Nightmare On Elm Street was lacking the true suspense that Halloween gave. Nightmare DOES have quite a few good jump scenes. It is also very atmospheric, and never really stops being scary due to atmosphere. There are a few gore scenes, but none are gross. The gore content is high, though. Higher than Friday the 13th and MUCH higher than Halloween.<br/><br/>A Nightmare On Elm Street is about a group of kids who are starting to have nightmares. These are however, not normal nightmares. All these dreams are about is this strange, burnt man who chases after this group of teens. These nightmares seem to be too real to be mere dreams, but that's all they could be... right?<br/><br/>A Nightmare On Elm Street stars Robert England, Heather Langenkamp, Amanda Wyss, Jsu Garcia, and for the first time ever, we see Johny Depp on screen. Each actor did a good job with their performance, but I felt that there was something missing with the character chemistry. This may be due to acting problems or due to a poor script/storyline. However, the viewer wouldn't be worried about the actors performances. The viewer would more likely be terrified, so the chemistry doesn't take away from the movie for first time viewing. However, re-watching can be a bummer.<br/><br/>Now here we come with the other cons: Wes Craven's directing. I'm going to be honest with you guys. I have never been a fan of any of Wes Craven's films (especially Scream.) He did an above average job on A Nightmare On Elm Street, but it's still nothing phenomenal. But then again, first time viewers wouldn't care about the directing. All they would care about is the constant scares.<br/><br/>Another thing that disappoints me about this movie is the inability it has to impress people the 3rd or 4th time they view it. I have viewed A Nightmare On Elm Street 4 times now, and each time it louses some of its mystique. I have not watched it for several months now, and I do not intend on watching again for at least one more month. I want to forget about pieces of the movie, so I can be scared by it again. A Nightmare On Elm Street is a truly frightening movie, but once the viewer has all of the scares figured out... what's left? <br/><br/>One more thing I would like to mention is about how terrible the sequels are. The sequels are all either silly or poorly done. Those are however, different reviews. <br/><br/>So overall, I recommend giving a Nightmare On Elm Street a rent. It's a good movie, especially for a first time viewing. However, re-watching can be a true bummer."

Remember the ""I'm your boyfriend now, Nancy"". <br/><br/>Conclusion: It's a fact, right now we make fun of it, that my cousin doesn't want to sleep after watching this film when he was about 7 years old. Nowadays this film is not so impressive for young audiences because it doesn't have any gore but this is a perfect horror film that creates a terrific atmosphere full of suspense because of a magnificent villain that becomes more interesting and at the same time more terrifying when his past is reveal. Definitely ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is a film that you should watch at midnight to see if you can sleep after. I could so I think you will too.<br/><br/>PS: I also recommend the parody/tribute of the Simpsons with Willie as Krueger; appears in the ""Treehouse of Horror VI""."

","A Nightmare on Elm Street is one of the original horror movies. It contains some genuinely creepy moments, but looking at it now, it does show its age. It is a landmark film that helped usher in the ""slasher age"", but that doesn't make it a good movie.<br/><br/>The whole concept of a monster that kills people in their dreams is a wonderfully original idea, it's only too bad that the execution is less than stellar. Wes Craven was still in his directorial infancy here, and it shows. The terrible acting doesn't help matters, but the characters really don't have anything interesting to say, either. The ending drags the film down further by not giving the film a conclusion of any kind.<br/><br/>What's good about the picture is Freddy. Here he is a monster, plain and simple. No one-liners, just a cold-blooded killer out for revenge.<br/><br/>In short, this is a good movie from a historical perspective. Obviously, the concept of the series is sound in order to carry through six sequels, but the direction and poor acting drag down this particular effort."

","As for myself I was not scared of this movie, it is movies like The Hills Have Eyes and Wrong Turn Sequels that scare me. But A Nightmare ON Elm Street was fabulous and very creepy, Freddy Krueger did a fantastic job but was much included but had good step in's. The death scenes were great and really creeped me out, the story was good and they built up the suspension to whatever was gonna happen. The ending I have to say was really inventive, in fact this movie is one of the best horror flicks I have watched. But- A Nightmare ON Elm Street should improve on their settings and scenes and for the up coming NOES Remake I suggest they improve the terror, violence, scenes and add some more action into it. Other than that it really was worth watching and have already watched the second one. 7/10"
"80sHorror","10","4","5","21 February 2015"," A masterpiece of americanized fear
","A classic that will have a long line of descendants. All the necessary elements are there to make a blockbusting horror film, a phenomenal scary movie. It concerns teenagers that are definitely in between desire and sex, both creating and nourishing in them fear and insecurity. The main characters are girls who are even more insecure and more fragile in their sexual fantasms and fears. Then the film systematically blurs the limits between reality and dream, reality and nightmare. It is one fundamental human fear that has been with humanity since the first homo sapiens ever appeared on this earth : the fear that what you imagine or just plain see in your mind may be just as real, even if virtual, as reality. Virtual reality is the other side of the living coin and it is so simple to toss it over. Then you get into smaller elements like underground airless and lightless corridors. Nerverending furnaces that leak and steam around. Snakes, bugs and other creepy crawly monsters. Then the film can center its focusing eye onto the essential element that is going to shine bright on the background of fearful and frightening people and objects. It is the four long razor sharp metallic claws or nails that this Fred Krueger wears on his right hand. This handful of claws, this handful of expanded and deadly nails is the ultimate fear in itself : the hand that can crush you, choke you, strangle you, seize you, grab you, etc. The claws that can tear, cut, scratch, perforate, and do so many other actions. Then you just have to add some blood, some metallic shine, some rust, and some sharp sound and the trap is ready and your soul can fall in the hole and it does at the bottom of a bathtub or in the middle of a bed. Then the film is a neverending story"

","I watched ""A nightmare on Elm Street"" last night and...Oh my God,how good it is! I thought ""Where were I earlier?!"". It is good in spite of its age. As we all know, old films - good films. Believe me, I have seen a lot of horror films and I think that ""A nightmare on Elm Street"" is worth attention. You know,I can confess that there were some times which made my heart to beat intensively than theretofore. I was surprised how professionally actors were acting in spite of the fact that it was the first time for Johnny Depp! The plot was intense and I love it. There is one feature of good horror film - restlessness about characters. And You know, when I was watching this film, You don't know how much I was worrying about them, especially about Nancy. ""What's now? No,Freddy, don't!"" and so on... Second feature of good film is unexpected ending. I really didn't expect an ending like this. Actually sound effects and soundtracks were better than I expected! Wes Craven made a masterwork. I watched ""A nightmare on Elm Street"" (2010) few years ago and I didn't like it at all because it's plagiarism, cheap copy of old, but fantastic film! Anyway let's talk about ""A nightmare on Elm Street"" (1984). I didn't waste my time, I'll tell about this film for all my friends. So, let's hurray for this masterwork, for all actors and for director, because this film is a classic!"

","To tell you guys the truth, I didn't see this movie until last week (1/24/2014) And I just fell in love with it. The creepy atmosphere, the story, the characters and even everybody's favorite killer, Freddy Kruger. Played by Robert Englund 8 times throughout the course of the series. There was even a TV show, called Freddy's Nightmares. Freddy was always the character that steels the show. In the first movie, he was scary, but as the series went on, it become more like a comedy then a horror series. The Story in the movie, is (I think) told really well. The movie kinda reminds me of Halloween (1978) almost. How to movie takes place in a suburban atmosphere, with a bunch of teenagers. In this movie though, the teens are not throw away characters. These characters, I actually like. well anyway, the story is pretty good, the characters are awesome, the acting is pretty good, Freddy's my favorite villain in film. everything about this movie is pretty good. It's not the best movie ever made, but it's one of my favorites to watch around Halloween."

Upon awakening she then proceeds to school and tells three of her friends about it. To her horror she finds that they too are having similar nightmares. Not knowing what else to do they gather at Tina's house that night while her mother is in Las Vegas and suddenly Tina's dream comes alive as she is sliced to death in bed while her horrified boyfriend ""Rod Lane"" (Jsu Garcia) looks on.

However, while in his cell he too becomes a victim of the same disfigured man with razor blades for fingers-and the killer is just getting started. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this movie pretty much earned its place among other established slasher films of the time like ""Halloween"" and ""Friday the 13th"" garnering $57 million dollars worldwide and competing quite successfully with those aforementioned franchises as well. In short, those who are looking for a good 80's slasher film should certainly be pleased with this particular picture and I have rated it accordingly. Above average."

"talasam12345","9","2","2","23 March 2020"," Absolute classic in the horror movie genre !
","What can I say about this gem that hasn't been said. Nothing .. Almost everybody loves this film and for a good reason. Made with a small budget A Nightmare on Elm Street is amazing accomplishment from the late Wes Craven. The practical effects are just jaw-dropping. They don't seem dated at all for me and they are waaaay better than the cgi crap we are witnessing today in the horror movies with the super unrealistic blood and the films as a whole. Johnny Depp's death is still one of the best and most brutal deaths i have ever seen in a horror movie, it is just amazing how many blood was used in this thing! First death of the franchise (i don't remember the girls name) was astonishing and creepy as well.<br/><br/>On to Freddy Krueger, who is at his best here. Not many words spoken, no jokes, just a frickin psycho.. The characters here are very neatly chosen, they are interesting and you root for them which is a rarity in horror movies. Nancy is one of the best female characters in an old school horror movie which i can remember. The acting is good, not great, but the story is captivating and cool so there is a balance.<br/><br/>I saw this film late in my years - i think 2014 and i knew almost every line and scary scene in the film, but it was still great and memorable , scary as well.<br/><br/>With so much great and quotable scenes A Nightmare on Elm Street is and will always be a true classic, and the go-to for every horror movie fan that can call himself that way. They never make movies like this anymore :)"
"baileycrawly","8","2","2","25 October 2019"," Wes Craven was a genius!
","Wes Craven really knew the horror genre like nobody else. A quick look at the body of work he created in his lifetime showcases some of the greatest stories in horror history. And the Elm Street series is no exception.
Perhaps his crowning achievement, this film still feels fresh and original to this day. It's the introduction we have to Freddy Krueger, the menacing bogeyman. And this isn't the Freddy Krueger that gets the most media attention, either: this isn't the wisecracking antihero. This is the man who works in the shadows, appearing only when it's absolutely necessary. His humour is pitch black and on point, and there's a serious vengeance in this film. This Freddy doesn't like to play with his kill.
The actors in this film, from Heather Langencamp to a young Johnny Depp to Robert Englund himself, give stellar performances, even when pitted against stunts that, at the time, would've been much more complex and complicated than today.
It's not the strongest entry in the series, but it's a remarkably solid introduction to one of horror's most iconic characters. It's a horror story the likes of which nobody had encountered prior."

","If you're a slasher or horror fan and haven't seen this film, where have you been for the past 35 years? This is one of the greatest slashers ever released and it's not one of the earlier one but it still brought new concepts. I will avoid the synopsis since over 700 other reviewers have gone over it, so instead I'll go over what this film succeeds and fails at. First the acting is some of the best in the genre with Robert Englund who was fantastic and it also has the debut of Johnny Depp. Next on Freddy Krueger this is the best he's ever been and is before he went really goofy. Next the kills and gore are amazing and the practical effects, right from the get go you can tell this film is something else. The music is also really good and also is the origin of one of the best horror theme songs of all time. The atmosphere and tone are also amazing and can't get much better. This film also has more suspense than any other films in the series. The only problem i have with this film is the ending, no spoilers of course. Overall check this film out it's widely available on DVD, blu ray and streaming services."

","As a kid, Freddy had me shook. I already had bad dreams as it was, the last thing I needed to see was a movie about a killer that kills you in your dreams! And Freddy was no normal killer, even his backstory was something of night terrors. Then that frightening kid's song:<br/><br/>One, two Freddy's coming for you. Three, four better lock your door. Five, six grab your crucifix. Seven, eight better stay up late.<br/><br/>I haven't seen this movie in decades and I still remember the song!!!<br/><br/>For me, A Nightmare on Elm Street has to be compared to two slasher predecessors: Halloween and Friday the 13th. It is different than those two in that Freddy Krueger was paranormal whereas the other two were not (although they were supernormal). Like Michael and Jason, Freddy preyed upon teenagers and he was exceptionally good at it.<br/><br/>Freddy belongs in the slasher hall of fame. What he was able to do with his glove of knives was epic. In fact, I'd put him on the slasher Mount Rushmore along with Jason, Michael, and maybe Chucky. I can't decide between him and Norman Bates.<br/><br/>And Nancy belongs in the killer escapee hall of fame. Laurie escaped Michael twice, Jason had his escapees, but none concocted a plan as bold and as brilliant as Nancy."

Freddy is enjoyable in every scene and gives off that scary yet somewhat of a funny vibe, and I really like that. If I have to criticize this movie for one thing is the main character is done HORRIBLE. I didn't believe her performance half the time and when Freddy stole the scene, I legitimately forgot she existed. The other characters are a little weak as well, but some are decently enjoyable like Johnny Depp. Altogether, its just a fun 80's slasher with some creative ideas at the end of the day. 8/10."

","A seminal slasher classic, Wes Craven's trend-setting blockbuster has aged extraordinarily well. The practical special effects are dated but effective, the score is memorably eerie, and Craven's imaginative approach to the death scenes manages to stand out even for seasoned horror fans. Additionally, Craven's screenplay is compelling and intelligent, in particular its treatment of main character Nancy, who defies genre tropes in subtle but effective ways and benefits from a sincere performance by Heather Langenkamp. However, none of this would matter were it not for Robert Englund's iconic performance as Freddy Krueger, imbibing the character with an unsettling menace that bleeds out of the screen."
"Vartiainen","Null","2","2","3 September 2015"," One of the classics of horror genre
","The original A Nightmare on Elm Street is seen as game changer in the horror genre. It pretty much codified the meaning of slasher film, where a group of teenagers is chased by a supernatural horror, with heavy overtones suggesting that it's because of their budding sexuality. Yeah, not exactly subtle, especially because it's almost always the young virgin female that survives, but the subgenre has other things to offer and it's the excellence of this movie that has spawned so many sequels and imitators.<br/><br/>So what's the story? A group of teenagers are all dreaming about a boiler room and about a man with burnt skin and terrifying claws chasing them within. One of them, Tina (Amanda Wyss), is especially worried and asks her friends to have a sleepover with her in order to help her sleep in peace. And naturally things don't go like they're supposed to. For Freddy's coming for you.<br/><br/>It's a fantastic setup and what makes this film so strong is how unsettling they make that blurring line between dreams and reality. For if you're not safe within your dreams, where can you run? How can you hide? The film slowly builds upon this idea, raising the stages constantly. Helping this atmosphere are some really, really nice practical effects, some of the best I've ever seen in a horror film. It's bloody and gory beyond belief, choreographed beautifully and simply a joy to watch for all fans of slasher genre. Colour me impressed.<br/><br/>The thing I was a bit disappointed by is actually the villain. Freddy certainly has a striking look, very good actor backing him up and his powers are certainly worthy of his status, but the movie gets rid of him rather easily, making me feel disappointed. Sure it's a proper horror film in that it doesn't have a true happy ending, nothing like that, but I still expected a bigger climax. Plus the actual kid protagonists are more than a bit bland. Perhaps I should check out the sequels.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it's a must-see horror film for all fans of the genre and certainly a good film to check out in any case. As long as you're not squeamish about blood."

It definitely had an impact on me to love scary films even more. They storyline was good and very entertaining. Also good performances by the actors particular one well known John Saxon best remembered starring with the Late Bruce Lee in ENTER THE DRAGON.

But this is the one movie that blows all other horror icons out of the water, there is no way anyone can say the first Freddie film isn't scary. Wish I could say the same for the other Freddie knock- offs but I won't because they all were TERRIFYINGLY AWFUL. What in God's name is more terrifying than a man who invades your dreams and can kill you if he gets to you in them? The answer is there isn't anything more terrifying, that's why this is one the best horror films ever to have hit the big screen. I saw this movie when I was 13... even now I'm still terrified of the whole concept of a dream invader.

"jcbutthead86","10","2","2","13 December 2012"," An Excellent,Scary,Imaginative,Original and Haunting Horror Classic. Wes Craven's Greatest film.
","A Nightmare On Elm Street is simply one of the greatest Horror films ever made,an excellent,scary,frightening and original Horror Classic that is filled with great direction,a wonderful cast,a creepy and memorable score and amazing Special Effects. It's one of my all-time favorite Horror films and is Wes Craven greatest film.<br/><br/>Set in Springwood,Ohio,A Nightmare On Elm Street tells the story about a group of teenagers who live in the same neighborhood of Elm Street who have been having the same nightmares about a burnt and scarred man with finger knifes named Fred Krueger(Robert England). When one of the teens is killed in their sleep,Nancy Thompson(Heather Langenkamp)has to figure out why Fred Krueger is stalking her and her friends in their nightmares and stop him before it's too late or Nancy won't wake up at all.<br/><br/>There are many reasons A Nightmare On Elm Street is a classic and my opinion a landmark Horror film. By 1984 everyone and their Mama was making a Slasher film and the Slasher genre during the period from 1978 to 1984 had hit it's peak,the Friday the 13th series by that time was in it's forth installment,the Halloween series was in limbo and semi-retirement(then brought back four years later)and the genre needed something fresh and exciting and ANOES was the answer. ANOES brilliantly combines the bloody,gory kills of the Slasher genre and mixes it with Fantasy and dreams. One of the reasons ANOES is so frightening and scary is because it blurs the lines of dreams and reality. Wes Craven pulls the viewer into a world where you're not sure if the events in the film are really happening or is it a dream or a nightmare or are the characters in the film going crazy and imagining things. The film is a dark and scary experience where you feel like none of the characters are safe when they're awake or asleep and film's atmosphere adds to the characters since of dread and fear whether it's the darkness and shadows at or even in the beautiful daylight,with images and scenes that are disturbing and creative and will give viewers nightmares themselves. The kills,gore and special effects are scary and brilliant and is impressive for a film made on a low budget of 1 million dollars. The gore and special effects enhance the film and matches the film's nightmarish tone. Unlike most of the Slasher films during the 80s where the characters are not developed and unlikable and waiting to get killed,the characters in ANOES are likable and well-developed and you feel sympathy for them whether it's the teenagers or their parents. The teenagers in the film aren't like the unsuspecting teens in the Friday The 13th films,but sympathetic to the point where you feel sorry for them and what the characters have to deal with whether it's dealing with Fred Krueger or dealing with their parents. Before he was Freddy Krueger,popping off one-liners and becoming a Horror/Cult icon,Freddy Krueger was Fred Krueger in this film,a sick,twisted killer that killed you in your dreams and did it with a dark glee and joy. Unlike the other slasher icons like Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers,Freddy had a personality and style and was unique. Instead of just using a machete or knife,Freddy uses his finger knifes and fear in this film,I also love the fact that Freddy doesn't get much screen time in the film always hiding in the darkness and shadows and not saying much dialog. What also makes Freddy a great character is that in the nightmares Freddy can control anything and have all the power to do what he wants to his prey and the victims are powerless and can't stop Freddy. While I love the Freddy character in the sequels,the version and character in this one is the scariest and most frightening. This film and the Freddy character in this film do for sleeping what Jaws did for swimming in the water and what Psycho did for taking showers and one of the reasons ANOES is such a timeless classic. The ending of the film like the rest of the movie is scary and ambiguous because you are not going to be sure if the ending is real or a dream. The ending is one of the things that adds to the film's greatness and will stay with you after you watch the movie. <br/><br/>The whole cast is great in their roles. Heather Langenkamp does a great job as Nancy,the hero of the film,bringing depth,sympathy and a likable presence to the role. Robert England is simply amazing as Fred Krueger,bringing a menacing,scary and frightening believability to the role. England's performance in this film and the sequels made Freddy one of greatest movie villains of all time. John Saxon is wonderful as LT.Donald Thompson,a cop who is Nancy's father,Saxon is calm and collective in his performance. Ronee Blakley is effective and sad as Marge Thompson,Nancy's alcoholic mother. Johnny Depp does a great job as Glen,Nancy's boyfriend. Who would've known Depp would become one of the biggest stars on the planet. Amanda Wyss is wonderful in her small role as Tina,Nancy's best friend. Nick Corri does an outstanding job as Rod,Tina's bad boy boyfriend.<br/><br/>Wes Craven's direction in the film is fantastic,giving the film and sense of fear and dread,moving the camera and giving the film a great pace and the scares are well done. Great job,Craven.<br/><br/>Charles Bernstein's score and NOES theme is dark,frightening and effective and matches the film's scary feel. Creepy score by Bernstein.<br/><br/>The Special Make-up effects by David B. Miller are amazing,gory and realistic and add to the film. Great effects,Miller<br/><br/>In final word,if you love Horror films,Slasher films or Wes Craven,I highly suggest you check out A Nightmare On Elm Street,a landmark and timeless Horror classic that will make you afraid to go to sleep and will stay with you after you watch it. Highly Recommended. 10/10."
"RomanJamesHoffman","8","2","2","6 October 2012"," The iniquities of the father (and mother) are to be visited upon the children
","Horror movies have always derived their power from monsters: those figures which inhabit realms we dare not go for fear of the unspeakable things that may be done to us. In early horror movies, by way of extension of folklore, these monsters lived under the bed, in the shadows, in the woods, or among desolate ruinsall those places that parents warn their children not to go and where we (if possessed of sense) actively choose to avoid. However, with Freddy Krueger, writer/director Wes Craven presented us with a monster that lives, and kills, in a place all of us have no choice but which to visit every night: our dreams.<br/><br/>In addition to this unique twist on folklore, 'Elm St.' supplies Freddy with a richly developed back story which distinguishes him from the other slasher genre anti-heroes Michael Myers, Jason Voorhees, and Leatherface in delivering an archetypal punch as well as the classic movie monsters like Dracula and Frankenstein in its wholly contemporary nature. In the original writing, Freddy was penned as a child molester before being changed to ""merely"" a child murderer for the film, who is assaulted and killed by a vigilante mob of parents who cover up their dastardly deed and set about raising their children to be well-adjusted and wholesome members of society. However, Freddy returns to enact his revenge by stalking their children in their dreams. <br/><br/>As such, the film could be said to contain a criticism of the hypocrisy of society's moral rectitude which, looked at in a larger context, is the same hypocrisy which is offended by bad language but which supports unjustified wars like the then-recent memory of Vietnam. However, Freddy's genesis is not only found in the mal-formed reflection of society at large but also the very personal fears of Craven himself: Craven had been bullied at school by a child named Fred Krueger (and indeed, an alternative title for Craven's debut 'Last House on the Left' was 'Krug and Company', after the lead villain's name), while Freddy's dirty clothes and hat was inspired by a homeless man he saw as a child who scared the bejesus out of him. All of this enables Freddy to effectively straddle the role of a personal and societal monster.<br/><br/>However, let not this abstract chin-stroking fool you – 'Elm St.' is possessed of a crushingly claustrophobic atmosphere unmatched in any slasher film (save perhaps 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre') due to the convincing nightmare-you-can't-wake-up-from vibe many people will recognise from personal experience. In addition, it's a darn sight more gory than notable slasher entries like 'Halloween' or 'Black Christmas' and the explicitly supernatural element adds an imaginative dimension to the ""kills"" unmatched in the genre (as the Johnny Depp bed scene (calm down ladies, it's not like that) will testify) and all pulled off without CGI. Things are rounded off nicely with a decent set of performances from ""final girl"" Heather Langenkamp, Johnny Depp (in his film debut), 70s/80s horror stalwart John Saxon and a host of lesser known talent who, albeit as Freddy-fodder, nonetheless deliver solid performances which flesh out the 'Elm St.' universeall to the accompaniment of an effective and eerie score and the infamous ""one, two Freddy's coming for you"" children's rhyme. <br/><br/>Like 'Friday the 13th' and 'Halloween', 'Elm St.' became a franchise: spawning a host of sequels (of varying degrees of quality from barely passable to painfully awful), a TV series (which continued the trend of Freddy as hip king of the one-liner), and all manner of merchandise which effectively de-clawed the grim visage of Freddy and offered him up to our consumerist society as merely another innocuous product. However, even with the bad taste of the franchise in the mouth, the fact that 'Elm St.' holds up well to repeat viewing even today and still retains the power to chill newcomers, is truly a testament to the quality of this mould-breaking supernatural slasher which stands as an exemplary example of what horror can, neigh, should be."

","A Nightmare on Elm Street is an unbelievably original, terrifyingly realistic, and overall terrifying that, despite a weak ending, is one of the best horror flicks of the quarter of a century. The film deals with a deceased child molester who now lives only through the dreams of the children of those who burned him alive. Robert Englund is truly frightening as Freddy Krueger. Wes Craven delivers a surprising amount of tension that still holds up today.<br/><br/>Nancy is having nightmares about a frightening, badly-scarred figure who wears a glove with razor-sharp ""finger knives"". She soon discovers that her friends are having similar dreams. When the kids begin to die, Nancy realizes that she must stay awake to survive. Uncovering the secret identity of the dream killer and his connection with the children of Elm Street, the girl plots to draw him out into the real world.<br/><br/>The film goes for suspense, drama, and gore and delivers for the most part. Heather Langenkamp gives a very solid performance as Nancy Thompson, the young woman is the ""leader"" among her friends and the only one who may get out alive. Forget about Jamie Lee Curtis' whimpering performance in ""Halloween"". Here Langenkamp is the real deal and she kicks ass. A great horror film that still delivers today. Look for a young Johnny Depp who, arguably, has the best death scene in the flick."

","Released in November of 1984, A Nightmare On Elm Street was a very personal project from Wes Craven. He was already a cult icon after directing two of the most notorious low budget films of the 70s, The Last House On The Left (1972) and The Hills Have Eyes (1977). By this point, Craven was moving up in the industry but still struggling in Hollywood and after directing two films back to back, Deadly Blessing (1981) and Swamp Thing (1982), he went off and wrote a screenplay that he has stated was inspired by true events.<br/><br/>A Nightmare On Elm Street came from a series of articles that Craven had read where many children were afraid to fall asleep, even trying the best that they could to avoid sleep. There was one article in particular though in the L.A. Times I believe that was so haunting to Craven that it inspired him to come up with the concept of a dream stalker or figure. While the script proved to be an inspired story with brilliant characters through out, many studios in Hollywood rejected it, claiming that it was too gory or dark. Some turned it down because they thought that the concept couldn't be pulled off. The future looked very bleak but then Craven found someone who saw great potential in the script and that was Robert Shaye. Shaye was the founder of a small distribution company called New Line Cinema, which had been around since the late 60s and released a lot of low budget films during the 70s and early 80s, all of which they were able to make their money back on but still were not huge successes. You have to give a lot of credit to Shaye who saw a lot of great things in Craven's script and believed in it probably as much as Craven himself. He felt that not only did this have commercial appeal but also, it was a great story that could work.<br/><br/>Production began in early 1984, Craven casted some of the freshest up and coming actors at the time, one of them being the very beautiful and intelligent Heather Langenkamp who proved to be a very strong choice to play the film's hero, Nancy Thompson. What Craven wanted was someone who was strong, smart and wouldn't fall down unlike most female leads in slasher films but also, someone with a lot of courage and determination and Heather pulled it off perfectly in the film. To me, Nancy is the main reason why the film works so well and while Freddy deserves credit too, Nancy is the true lead in the first film. Other actors casted were John Saxon, who had been in the business many years before and was even known as a great character actor. Also, Amanda Wyss as Tina, who you think is going to be the film's lead heroin at first and even though she is killed off in the first 30 minutes, you still care about her a great deal and I don't think Amanda ever received enough credit. First time screen actor Johnny Depp was cast as Nancy's boyfriend, Glenn. We all know Johnny as the huge movie star today but at the time, he was very much afraid of working in front of the camera and Craven stated himself that Johnny's hands were shaking a few times but because of his willingness to put himself into that character and play something that wasn't him shows what a gifted actor he was and still is.<br/><br/>Of course, Craven was looking for someone to play Freddy. He was actually looking for someone much older but it proved to not be effective. While Robert England may have not looked right for the part on first look, Craven saw something in him and Robert was cast, we can now all agree that he made the right choice because Robert brings something to the character that goes beyond what Craven had envisioned.<br/><br/>After a hard shoot that caused a lot of tension between the crew because of the low budget and restrictions, the film had an uncertain future. If the film had failed, it could have been the end for New Line, which caused a lot of stress for Robert Shaye and everyone working for the company. The film opened that November and surpassed everyone's expectations by becoming not only a film that was profitable but also one that found a huge cult following before a franchise had even been born. It launched a series of sequels, most of which are very effective and well done and while Freddy became less mysterious as he was in the first film, it was clear that because Robert Englund believed in the role so much and that the filmmakers worked so hard to make them unique visual experiences, they deserve a lot of credit and should not be ignored as far as I'm concerned. All of the actors are remembered for their roles today, especially Robert and Heather. They both are extraordinary talent and care so much about the characters while most people would try to forget about it as much as possible. I want to say again that Nancy is a great character, one that pulled me into the movie and made me believe in the story. I hope that someday, a Nancy doll will be made.<br/><br/>This is a modern day horror classic, one that came at the right time and so much hard work from people who were determined to do their best and make a great film. A company's future relied on this film and it is now one of the biggest studios in Hollywood. So check this film out if you're into the genre. While I can't speak for everyone, I think that this is a great film and one of the best of the 80s. Find yourself a copy and watch it now!!"

","...Wes ""The Hills Have Eyes"" Craven's ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" packs a solid punch despite its low budget (cheaper than Romero's soon-to-be-released ""Day of the Dead""), mostly unremarkable acting (not bad, just unremarkable), and the desperately-seeking-sequels ending. All in all, it's one of the best of the 80s fright films, and a welcome respite from Craven's previous failures (the fairly horrendous ""Swamp Thing"" and ""Deadly Blessing,"" as well as that excruciating TV stinker ""Invitation to Hell""). If nothing else, it'll always be the answer to trivia games asking about Johnny Depp's first film.<br/><br/>What's most notable on re-viewing ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is that Craven and his crew achieved everything without benefit of elaborate gimmickry or computer-driven effects, and next to nothing in the way of showoff camera shots. It's a film about affects, not effects, and that makes all the difference. It's idea- and character-based, and that lets the audience slide right into its world with little trouble.<br/><br/>The boogeyman, everyone's favorite Freddy, makes his appearance right up front in the pre-title intro, but he really isn't dwelt upon; his province is in the shadows and in the mind. We get peeks at him, and those peeks are creepy enough to suit; he'd be just another grotesque if he were hauled out into the light of day (which is why all the sequels were such disappointing failures; they gave us too much Freddy, and thereby turned him into an unfrightening, though homicidal, clown). Craven learned his lesson well from John Carpenter's ""Halloween."" I'm sure I'll catch the remake when it pops up at my local library, but I've otherwise no interest in tracking it down. I already know it can't possibly match the impact of this seminal work.<br/><br/>Oct10 edit: found said remake at the library. I was right; it was utterly unnecessary, boring, and brought nothing new to the table. I gave it a 4/10 for production values only. Totally skippable."

","After watching the 2010 re-make of this film I dug the old one out of moth balls so I could compare the two films. It had been about 15 years since I last saw the original and I have to say my opinion has not changed on how I felt about the old one, whether it was 1984, 1995 or 2010. I was glad that the sands of time did not change how I felt. It was painful to hear the ridiculous 80s canned-music, but I was able to get passed it. When I look back I remember that this film really hit the mark back in 1984. I remember that it was popular, did not anger the critics and made some good cash, plus it spawned seven sequels that racked-up $340,000,000 worldwide at the box office. After the success of Michael Myers and Jason Vorhees it was time for Freddy Kreuger, but the difference here was a supernatural sub-plot that was on a much higher level, in the fact that Freddy can kill his victims through their dreams, when Jason and Michael just kill. So, that was the part that the writers had to sell to the audience. Another plot device that helped this film move along was the schlocky dark-comedy aspect of it. Freddy drops all kinds of jokes and one-liners for comic relief and Robert Englund definitely sells it and sold it well. He would be Freddy in every one of the sequels and some people are mad that he wasn't in the 2010 remake. Not me though. I think after eight films spanning 19 years that was good enough. Great jog Rob, but let's reboot this thing. Anyway, back to the original film. The structure of this film is quite good, in the fact that, with the introduction of each character, each one feels like they could be the main character until Freddy knocks them off and you think, ""Wow, now what""? Each character had a pretty-good back story, not like the characters that Michael and Jason had to deal with. There are a few things that seem to be missing in the plot and I can't say anymore here, but the film somehow sells it. It must have if it spawned seven sequels and a remake 26 years later. The cast was tough, and I mean the acting, but this film also has a place in film history as being the first film for Johnny Depp. Oh, and John Saxon is John Saxon. What I thought back in 1984 and what I thought in 2010 was that I saw a new kind of horror franchise in the making that entertains with a little silliness thrown in."

","With the inevitable remake of ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" arriving faster than many would like, I felt that it would be the perfect time to revisit the classic movie (and its sequels) that sparked a cinematic phenomenon and influenced the genre we all know and love to an enormous extent. But, what can possibly be said about Wes Craven's masterpiece that hasn't been said countless times before? Ugh, Freddy's sweater is sooooo 1980's? To be honest, you have probably all seen this movie before and many of you have seen it more times than you could count on both hands and feet together. I'm not really talking to you; to see ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is to understand its brilliance and, therefore, you don't need me telling you how great it is. You know already.

I'm talking to you because it is high time that you experience the movie that made Wes Craven a household name, that sparked numerous sequels, and that put Freddy Krueger's charred face on lunchboxes everywhere.

","Let me say i am a HUGE fan of slashers. I don't know why i do, they are just so entertaining to me. Fredy Krueger is one of my favorite slasher villains ever, but is the movie actually worth to watch? First off, i will be writing 2 reviews. one from my point of view as a fan of slasher films, and one from a open minded view.<br/><br/>1. OK as a fan of Krueger and slasher films, i must say i love the hell out of this movie. Just the atmosphere and the creepyness of Krueger just really hit the spot. It wasn't much of a scary fim..but it still had its moments. The killing scenes were nice and gory and violent. the way Krueger scares people is also interesting. He freaks them out in there dreams until they just think nothing can happen to me...but when he kills them in there sleep they die for real. just such a brilliant idea to me. 8 stars out of 10.(remember this is coming from my fan side.) 2. OK to look at it openmindedlly. It was above average..I thought the plot of the movie was decent..nothing amazing but nothing bad. suitable for a horror movie. The cast of the movie was great. Robert did a excellent job as Krueger and it looked like he really got into the character. Everyone else in the movie did a fine job also. the lighting and effects in the movie are pretty good as far as a 1980's flick. The music was kinda weird don't really have a comment on it. The climax of the movie was eh..pretty good but not that great. I thought it was kinda rushed out. As soon as she figures out she has to bring him to the real world. the climax just hits you across the face. not in a good way. i feel as soon as the climax began, it ended at the same time. because it went by so fast. Not the best horror movie or movie of all time, but definitely worth seeing for any movie-goer."

","I just saw this movie yesterday. I was impressed. It was better than I thought it would be. This movie is a true horror movie. It doesn't qualify for any other genre. It really is a movie that defines the horror genre, which is a good thing. Much of this is based on the appearance of the villain Freddy Krueger. He has one of the most frightening appearances of any villain I've ever seen. Freddy was truly crafted with genius, which is even more impressive considering this is a low-budget movie. The red and blue sweater, the fedora hat, the blue pants, the horribly scarred face, the knives. I think he is the most frightening horror villain ever. He's really great for the movie.<br/><br/>This movie has a few bloody sequences as most horror/slasher movies do, but there is a lot more to the movie than that. It has an interesting story, a very original script, and good characters. All of the teen characters were good. The parents were a little weak as characters but it wasn't a big problem. It is really important for a horror movie to have good, memorable characters. A little bit of humor is also good. Horror movies are not just about jump scares and watching people be slashed to death. There should always be suspense, tension, plot, and atmosphere. The Shining and The Ring have the darkest atmospheres of any movies I've ever seen. A Nightmare on Elm Street still had a great one.<br/><br/>Without these it's likely the horror movie is going to lose a lot of its substance. It should be somewhat believable. It shouldn't feel like you're watching a movie for every single second of it. Nightmare on Elm street did a pretty good with these though. My main problem with the movie was that while these characters were all very good, it seemed too many of them were killed off too early in the movie. Towards the end all that was left was Nancy, Freddy, and those passive parents so typical to horror movies. It seems passive authorities are more of a characteristic of horror movies than a problem though. They can still be bothersome. I thought that some of the plot went with those friends that died.<br/><br/>It also had a really confusing ending. In the ending, you didn't know what was a dream and what was real or if it was all a dream. Not only that but you didn't know who was even having the dream, if it was a dream. I would recommend this movie to horror fans, as it's a horror classic. I wouldn't really tell you to watch it if you don't like horror movies much, as it's very much a horror movie. Some scary movies can kind of double as a thriller, (in which thriller fans might like because it would be similar to a thriller) but this was just an all-out horror. (Which is great for horror fans, like me, but not always great for everybody else."

","OK I don't usually like slasher films. I feel like there all the same. Its always 4 teenagers, two girls, two boys. Two of them have sex, 3 of them die. That kinda was the case in this film but A Nightmare On Elm Street has something else to it that makes it better than most slasher films. The main thing is that it has a brilliant storyline and thats what makes films scary and thats whats made The Omen such a good film. Although it doesn't seem realistic it is slightly believable.<br/><br/>I must say the acting was pretty terrible in this film. And the last scene when the woman gets pulled into the house by Freddy is probably the worst effects I have seen in a while.<br/><br/>Its a shame that they had to ruin this film with a stupid amount of sequels and the abysmal Freddy Vs. Jason. But the original is a great movie and I recommend anyone to watch this film. 8/10"
"robsea32","10","2","2","27 August 2009"," A superior film in the genre
","I think that the massive exposure the public has had to Freddy, along with the numerous (and mostly terrible) sequels have destroyed the credibility of the first film.<br/><br/>It's easy to say ""it's a slasher film"" because teenagers die, and teenagers always die in Freddy and Jason movies, but I don't think this movie was ever intended to be viewed in the same way as those other films and other Freddy sequels have since been viewed -- by a bloodthirsty audience that ""rated"" the kills for their ""awesomeness"". This is of course, is the exact vein upon which the remake is being built in this, our era of horror-porn. The problem I have with this is that you're not really supposed to be in ""awe of the coolness"" when Tina is dragged across the ceiling -- you're supposed to be terrified of the enormous power wielded by an unknown figure through dreams and you are supposed to relate with the utter hopelessness that these characters face. Wes Craven went to great lengths to personify this in the first film obviously, through his writing and character development.<br/><br/>Unlike the other films, this movie is completely somber and practically joyless. In the sequels, the writers are constantly hinting at the possibility of beating Freddy while gearing them up for the next ""spectacular!"" kill scene, and always comforting the audience that there will be a happy resolution (until they screw you over with the last second reveal that will guarantee another sequel).<br/><br/>There is all this long and supportive dialog between the characters in the sequels ""We can fight him! We can beat him!"", where in the first film, all of these characters (and especially Nancy) are pretty much on their own. Glenn will help comfort Tina, but only up to the point that it interferes with his lustful feelings for Nancy or his patience. Glenn supports Nancy, but abandons her by falling asleep on her the first time (dismissing her sincerity, not with his words but with his actions) and then falling asleep and dying before he was to come to her rescue as they'd planned. Nancy distrusts Rod and abandons him mid-conversation in the jail and is unsure of his motivations until just before the moment he dies. Rod and Tina are connected mostly by physical attraction and show little else (though they briefly show a somewhat deeper connection in there post-coital moments). Lt. Thompson just wants his ""baby girl to get some sleep"" and get out of his hair while he does his police work. Marge maintains appearances, but is more dedicated to a bottle of Vodka then her family, in addition to hiding ugly details about her past. Even Tina's mother is short with her in the first scene, annoyed that she was awakened or interrupted and then summoned by something as silly as a nightmare.<br/><br/>There is such a feeling of distrust and disconnectedness between these characters even before the killing starts -- they are already doomed by their vague sadness and broken connections. They are all adrift and without a friend in a cruel world of which there is no hope of escaping or possibility of someone reaching out to them.<br/><br/>In my mind, this is what makes it far superior to any of the other films. New Nightmare is a good film, but in a completely different way then the first film, and it certainly does not compare as a piece of surrealist horror. The third sequel possess some of the qualities of the first film (making attempts at emulating the tone of the first film) but it unravels due to them breaking rules set by the first film in order to cheat the audience and also by imbibing Freddy with this jokester-smarminess that would get out of control in the subsequent sequels.<br/><br/>I always preferred the term ""fantasy terror"" to slasher film for this picture. It certainly has elements of a slasher, but it has SO much more and putting it on level with Friday the 13th or even Halloween (which IS a slasher movie, but it's one of the first and the most well-done one) is doing it a disservice in my opinion."
"Sirus_the_Virus","8","2","2","27 August 2009"," Not my favorite horror film but a good film.
","A nightmare on Elm street is a good horror film. I don't like it as much as Halloween, but I still think it's a great film. Hey, it's Johnny Depp's first film. So it can't be a bad movie... no i'm only kidding. At a time, I used to think it was horrifying. Now I don't have a problem with the Scream trilogy. But I don't think that being chased by the Ghostfaced guy is that big of a deal. Freddy Krueger is just gross. At times annoying. If he were chasing you and saying something to you then you just want to say""Shut the hell up you crazy bastard""! and walk away. Freddy really is gross. In the first film, he cuts open his stomach and all of this green stuff comes out and he cuts off his finger. He laughs about both. Okay, we know that a group of people joined together to set you on fire because you were a child molester, but it doesn't me you have to kill the teens. Kill the adults. They did it. Freddy Krueger is a scary character, but he's done some nasty things. Like rape a chick with tongues. But that was another movie. The original Nightmare on Elm street is a classic. They had to make a sequel though. Wes Craven directed both A Nightmare on Elm Street and New Nightmare. Those were the only two good Freddy movies. The rest sucked. That's the case with most horror sequels.<br/><br/>The Plot: Many teenagers are being brutally murdered but people don't know how. It turns out that a guy named Freddy Krueger is murdering these teenagers in their sleep."
"MistAh_Justus","10","2","2","12 August 2009"," Classic!
","Classic. If I had to describe this movie in one word, that's what it would be. Robert Englund is sensational in this role as the bastard son of a thousand maniacs Freddy Krueger. He's scary, sinister and downright psychopathic. Yet, somehow he makes this Dream demon become an icon of the horror genre. Heather Langenkamp plays the heroine Nancy Thompson not only in this movie but two other entries in the series as well. And yes, one can't go without bringing up that this is Johnny Depp's first movie, and he does exceptional well in his acting debut, leaving his mark on the series and the genre in general with a certain scene involving a bed, but more on that in a bit.<br/><br/>Most will know the story already, but I'll go through it anyway. The parents of Elm Street caught and burned alive a local child rapist and murderer after failing to be charged in the courts. So now he comes back for the children of Elm Street through their dreams. Now we must follow four teens in their fight for survival and fear of falling asleep. Such a great concept, which was actually inspired by real events. The real events being reports of people dying in their sleep after warning others it would happen.<br/><br/>This movie has an eerie vibe throughout, as you never really know what is a dream and what is reality, it does a great job of messing with your head. They keep Freddy in the shadows for a lot of the movie, and that definitely adds to the scare factor. His appearance is unforgettable, the red/green sweater, the dirty brown hat and the burned makeup all look phenomenal. Everything about Freddy is scary in this, from his razor sharp blades to his bone chilling laugh, he is the ultimate Boogeyman.<br/><br/>The nightmares themselves, are just fantastic. My favorite scene, and many others, is when Tina (Amanda Wyss) must face off against Freddy. We are treated to a great chase scene, with Freddy just playing mind games throughout. He cuts off his own fingers while giving one of the most sinister looks I've ever seen. And who can forget about the stretched out arms in the alleyway right before running after Tina like a madman with his trademark glove high in the air. After finally catching her, he just butchers her while her boyfriend Rod (Jsu Garcia) can do nothing but look on. She is just tortured as he drags her across the ceiling and walls, while slicing her up with his glove.<br/><br/>There are so many memorable scenes in this, Wes Craven really created a masterpiece with this one. With the movie now being 25 years old, it still holds up reasonably well. The effects are top notch and well placed throughout. Johnny Depp's death scene looks absolutely fantastic. After falling asleep and being pulled into his bed, gallons of blood comes shooting out and completely soaks the entire room. Even little things like the unplugged phone ringing and once Nancy answers it turns in to Freddys mouth, so unexpected and so effective.<br/><br/>The setup for the final showdown between Nancy and Freddy is so intense, and the finale itself is as well. This in my opinion is where Heather Langenkamp really shines. We see her prepare for war in setting up booby-traps and overall becoming a stronger character. She single handily takes on Freddy and stops the dream demon, by showing great courage/no fear, and taking back every bit of energy she ever gave him.<br/><br/>My only complaint would be the final scene of the movie. Where everyone seems to be okay, the sun is shining, and the group of kids are on their way to school when the top comes flying down on the car with the colours being red and green, hmmm, what could that mean. Then the part comes that I don't like, where Nancy's mother is pulled through a small window at the top of their front door by Freddy, the effects here, are pretty poor. Luckily, I can look past this as its about 3 seconds out of the movie that I don't like, and the ending was never properly finished as it's a mixture of a couple possible endings.<br/><br/>This movie is the definition of a classic. My Favorite slasher, my favorite horror, my favorite film period. Everybody involved did a spectacular job and their effort really shows in the finished product.<br/><br/>10/10"

","I've been on a bit of a Wes Craven trip recently. Not a good one I must say. I watched ""The Last House on the Left"" and ""The Hills Have Eyes"", two shocking terrible movies and thought I'd better give this one a viewing after having never really seen it properly. I grew up in the wake of it and it's sequels, it was the talk of the school yard, I was very familiar with the story line, the general principles and even how Freddy got to be the way he was, I even went dressed up as Freddy to a fancy dress competition at the school summer fête one year, to my dismay not winning but I did get my picture on the front page of the local newspaper. Why didn't I win? I don't know, probably because the idea of a ten year old dressing as a homicidal mass murderer was a bit sick. But still I don't think I'd ever watched the film all the way through in one viewing.<br/><br/>I was presently surprised. I thought the power for this film to shock or scare me was lost long ago but I was wrong. There were some pleasant twists and turns in the plot that I did not expect. Like Johnny Depp's death for one. I didn't see that happening, and the way in which it happened did make me jump a bit I must say. Also the ending was very surreal and unexpected classic bit of cinema. <br/><br/>The idea is genius. You can't go to sleep or he'll get you and no human being can stay awake for ever. Unlike the acting in Craven's earlier films he actually manages to get the actors in this one to do some decent work. It's still not brilliant, but it is an improvement. I myself have had times in my life when I've stayed awake without any sleep for 3-5 days. At the end of these spells I was sweating profusely, paranoid, delusional, and hallucinating, so when lead girl tells us she has been awake for seven days it is just not believable. I can forgive Wes this because of the beauty of the film as a whole, but it really is a shame. He could have gone so much further with the idea. It is far from perfect but probably as close as Craven has ever gotten to a ""masterwork"" <br/><br/>This is one good, classic, horror film. Do not miss. I am eagerly looking forward to the 2010 sequel and if the other recent remakes of Craven's films are anything to go by it will surely be a lot better and hopefully fix some of the holes in the original. Thanks."

","A horror classic, Wes Craven reinvigorated the supernatural horror theme hinted at in the greatest horror film of all time Halloween and in the Friday the 13th sequels. Here he introduces the world to Freddy Krueger, an icon of post-modern slasher culture, which got so over the top in the sequels that he took the mickey with his self-referential return to the franchise, Wes Craven's New Nightmare (1994). Aside from the freaking looking Freddy and his Fraudian scissor fingers, the key to this film being scary is the terror caused through sleep, a place where we seek solace and comfort...not any more! He expertly depicts a nightmare world inhabited by the dream demon Kruguer and conjures up numerous frightening revelations resulting in a pretty silly ending but the overall horror effect is pretty startling.<br/><br/>8/10"
"ZeoRangerFive","10","2","2","18 March 2008"," A Very Enjoyable Movie
","During the mid 1980s the slasher film genre was in dire need of help. The once great genre had consumed itself with sub par sequels and extremely low budget cheesy movies that had no real plot at all. The movies that were coming out during this time were basically this: a big breasted girl and her friends (who love to get naked) decide to hang out somewhere away from civilization. While there they are stalked by some random killer, killing for some non-developed reason (if a reason at all). So, needless to say, the slasher film was dying and dying hard by 1984. <br/><br/>But, a man by the name of Wes Craven changed that. And with his little film that no one had any faith in, he breathed life into the slasher film and kept it alive for a couple more years. Wes Craven had all ready established himself in the horror genre by 1984. He had made the classics: The Last House on the Left in 1972 and The Hills Have Eyes in 1977. As well as some other films that weren't as successful. He had written a film about a killer who is killing people in their dreams. But, the twist was, if he killed you in your dream, you died for real. This idea hadn't really been done before, at least not in a slasher film. As creative as it may have been, no one wanted to make the film. He finally found New Line Cinema, a small film company on the verge of bankruptcy, that was willing to produce the film. Robert Shaye, the co-CEO of New Line had enough faith in the script and in Craven to make the film, hoping it would save his dying company.<br/><br/>The story was about a group of teenagers, all having the same nightmare about the same unknown man. The only things they know are that he is horribly burned, wears a red and green sweater and has a brown hat, oh and that he has knives for fingers! As each one of them is killed off Nancy (Langenkamp) is the only one willing to stand up to him. Oh, and did I mention the adults in the film don't pay any attention to what she is saying. That's classic slasher film rules right there! <br/><br/>Although Craven and Shaye butted heads over the ending of the film, that didn't do anything to ruin this film. With a great cast including John Saxon playing a police officer again and Robert Englund, a virtual no one at the time, he gained major success and a huge fan following after this film hit it big at the box office. Also along for the ride was Johnny Depp in his very first film. The film was extremely ingenious at the time, not only for the storyline of the film but also for some of the camera techniques used. Including a very interesting special effects shot of Freddy Krueger jumping through a mirror. And a very nice shot of Nancy waking up from her nightmare having parts of the roses from her nightmare with her, but when the camera pulls back they are gone. A very cool shot, that you should probably check out!<br/><br/>Wes Craven did not want nor did he intend this film to be the beginning of a franchise. Robert Shaye had different ideas. A Nightmare on Elm Street hit it big at the box office grossing over $25 million domestically, just enough to save New Line Cinema. A sequel was immediately planned. The film spawned six sequels, a TV series and an eventual face off with the other 1980s slasher Jason Voorhees. Though none of the other films ever lived up to this one, as a whole the series was phenomenal. Heather Langenkamp said it best in Wes Craven's New Nightmare, ""Everyone knows who Freddy Krueger is. He's like Santa Claus or King Kong!""."
"Son_of_Mansfield","7","2","2","17 June 2007"," Welcome To Wes' Nightmare.
","The story goes that Wes Craven had a nightmare and created the character of Freddy Krueger, a man who kills kids in their dreams, after it. The movie holds up well, especially every scene with Robert Englund as The Crispy Gloved One. He drips with sinister intent. Craven directs some shocking scenes that hold up well after twenty some years: Traci's death, where she is dragged up a wall and onto the ceiling as Freddy slices her, Nancy's school dream with Traci crawling around in a bloody body bag, an another of Nancy's dream where Freddy pulls her into a bottomless bathtub. One of the few slashers that actually manages to be scary and exciting. Only some slow spots and a confusing ending keep it from being all the better."
"Dr_Coulardeau","10","2","2","17 January 2007"," The most beautiful horror nightmare available
","A classic that will have a long line of descendants. All the necessary elements are there to make a blockbusting horror film, a phenomenal scary movie. It concerns teenagers that are definitely in between desire and sex, both creating and nourishing in them fear and insecurity. The main characters are girls who are even more insecure and more fragile in their sexual phantasms and fears. Then the film systematically blurs the limits between reality and dream, reality and nightmare. It is one fundamental human fear that has been with humanity since the first homo sapiens ever appeared on this earth : the fear that what you imagine or just plain see in your mind may be just as real, even if virtual, as reality. Virtual reality is the other side of the living coin and it is so simple to toss it over. Then you get into smaller elements like underground airless and light-less corridors. Nerverending furnaces that leak and steam around. Snakes, bugs and other creepy crawly monsters. Then the film can center its focusing eye onto the essential element that is going to shine bright on the background of fearful and frightening people and objects. It is the four long razor sharp metallic claws or nails that this Fred Krueger wears on his right hand. This handful of claws, this handful of expanded and deadly nails is the ultimate fear in itself : the hand that can crush you, choke you, strangle you, seize you, grab you, etc. The claws that can tear, cut, scratch, perforate, and do so many other actions. Then you just have to add some blood, some metallic shine, some rust, and some sharp sound and the trap is ready and your soul can fall in the hole and it does at the bottom of a bathtub or in the middle of a bed. Then the film is a never-ending story. It is when you think you have vanquished and gotten rid of your worst fear that it reappears and promises you a new episode round the corner of the very first street you will cross. And you may find out that your own mother, with a little help of her friend, the hard liquor bottle, is the very accomplice of this frightening monster, bogeyman, tommy-knocker that will come back, that's a promise. This first film in this long series of seven is the very archetype of what a nightmare fantasy can be. It is a masterpiece and you will be shaking with anticipation till you can watch the next one.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne"
"freaky_dave","8","2","2","7 March 2006"," Unique Story to go with everybody's favorite bad guy Freddy
","Nightmare on Elm Street was a clever story idea involving dreams and death. I believe the movie got some of its ideas from Phantasm, a movie released in 1979 that many probably don't remember. Nightmare also has Freddy Krueger(Robert Englund), a wisecracking killer who invades teenagers dreams and does very bad things. This movie and the Scream films are Wes Craven's most popular films.<br/><br/>A group of teenagers who live on the same street begin to have dreams about a scarred killer who wears a blue and red sweater and a hat. He also has a razor glove on his hand. The dreams prove to be more than just dreams when some of the teenagers begin dying in their sleep with razor cuts caused by the razor glove the killer wears.<br/><br/>But Freddy Krueger is not just any ordinary killer. He also has the ability to play with any dream reality, which makes it easier for him to get his victims while they dream and murder them. Of course one teen-aged girl named Nancy (Heather Langenkamp) is determined to fight back and get rid of the grisly fiend once in for all. Of course there is a reason Freddy is killing these particular teenagers, but for those who haven't seen any of the Nightmare films and know very little about them (which I doubt) I will not give that little secret away.<br/><br/>This movie also starred Johnny Depp in his first movie role, as well as John Saxon and Ronee Blakely. It boasts very good special effects and gave us one of the most infamous undead villains in Freddy Krueger, putting him up their with Jason Vorhees from the Friday the 13th films and Michael Myers from the Halloween films.<br/><br/>Like the Alien movies, one and two in particular, many people compare Friday the 13th, Halloween, and Nightmare on Elm Street. I found that though the first Halloween is better than all of these films put together, Nightmare on Elm Street contains the better sequels, and some of them weren't all that great either. Goes to show you what happens when you make sequels that end up just being gore films without any real suspense."
"mentalcritic","8","2","2","27 July 2004"," A little originality goes a long way
","In 1984, there were several serial-killer flicks in which some unknown loser with a grudge murdered a long list of people who had other things in their lives to focus on. The Halloween franchise was up to a couple of episodes, and Friday The 13th was about to film what was purportedly its final chapter. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was in the midst of adding sequels, even. So what separates A Nightmare On Elm Street from an overcrowded market?<br/><br/>In a nutshell, Wes Craven takes a clichéd story and adds a fantasy element that makes the whole thing more plausible than any of its sequels have ever achieved. How he achieves this is simple. Instead of making the story about his villain, he focuses on one of the potential victims and their struggle to deal with some extremely unusual events. Everyone over the age of eighteen probably has a high school friend who died in unusual, tragic, or even violent circumstances, and that is the hook Craven uses to put the viewer into the film. Human drama will always win out over special effects and simulated violence.<br/><br/>Where it begins to undo itself is that Nancy is the only character with more than one dimension. The cop hates teenagers because they're teenagers, the mother is a drunk for reasons we're still guessing at, and the teens who struggle against the villain are distinguishable only by how much the cop hates them. The villain is the one character who gets anything resembling a back-story, and his total screen time is little more than a third of the total feature.<br/><br/>The special effects budget on the film was minimal, so the makers had to be a little more creative with how they shocked the viewer. Trick shots or cheated shots feature very heavily in this episode. This is a very good thing, as they are far more convincing than the myriad of expensive special effects that have followed, particularly in later sequels. The latest crossover episode in particular is bad in this regard. All the gloss and shine of Hollywood virtually leaps out in latter episodes, but none of the dramatic tension that exists here is even suggested later in the series.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a five out of ten effort, but don't let that fool you. This is a textbook example of how much of an improvement a different idea can bring. In a film school, this would make a great example of how an active mind is far more important than financing."

"junglepants","3","15","30","21 June 2002"," Kind of cool I guess, but very poorly done
","I was aware that this movie, along with the Freddy Krueger character, became a massive horror movie franchise.  I grew up in the 80s during the era of ubiquitous Freddy dolls and posters, conscious of the fact that he was in this movie and a lot of people seemed to like it, but I had never seen any of the Nightmare movies until recently.<br/><br/>I simply don't understand why this is supposed to be a good movie; I found it barely watchable, and largely laughable.  The special effects, even given that the production team did not have the ability to use CG effects at the time, are terrible.  It is completely obvious how every single effect was done when they pop up in the movie.  Furthermore, many of the scenes contain nonsense character actions that seem to exist only to show off more crappy effects (e.g., when Freddy says, ""Watch this,"" and chops off his prosthetic fingers).<br/><br/>The movie starts off very suddenly, with absolutely no character development.  I found it difficult to care about or sympathize with people I don't know anything about, who can't act, with ketchup squirting out of them.  I just didn't get it.<br/><br/>The Freddy Krueger character is far too clownish and rubbery to be scary (I've read that it gets even worse in the sequels).  The annoying cheesy synthesizer music is far too present in the film, drowning out most of what could have been genuine scares.<br/><br/>The performances in the movie are some of the worst I've ever seen.  Johnny Depp, unsurprisingly, turns in one of the less ridiculous ones, but given that this movie has almost no redeeming qualities, he has almost no lines. Heather Langenkamp is a boring, vapid heroine who clearly just can't act. She displays an extremely narrow range of emotions, from tired, to asleep, to sort of tired and angry, to somewhat scared.  Speaking of which, she seems alarmingly unconcerned when Freddy Krueger materializes out of nowhere and tries to stab her.  Maybe she's just tired.<br/><br/>I will acknowledge that this movie seems to be more creative with the story line and visuals than those that were coming out around that time, and it's more gritty and original than a lot of the slick, boring crap that Hollywood churns out today. Other than that, this movie really isn't anything all that special.  It's not scary, it's extremely fake, and the script and performances are terrible."
"Jacques98","1","23","50","8 September 2008"," What could be more overrated than this?
","The other day some friends told me they didn't watch horror movie because every one of them was cheesy and predictable. At the time I wasn't exactly sure what they were watching to make them think that, but now I know: A Nightmare on Elm Street. I don't care if it's a classic, it's still one of the single worst movies I've ever seen in my life. I don't understand how this is by the same man who wrote The Last House on the Left, which was superior in every way imaginable.<br/><br/>To call this movie cheesy is an understatement. From opening to closing the acting is some of the unintentionally funny I've seen in a horror movie eversome of the melodramatic lines I'm sure Wes Craven had to have laughed at when he wrote them, I'm sure.<br/><br/>The entire movie plays out like something made-for-TV on Cartoon Network, and they actually show this movie on that station around Halloween. There is nothing even remotely dark or serious about this movie because it's written with the simplicity and corniness of a children's film. The actors themselves don't even look old enough to be teenagers. Minus the cliché, comical bedroom scene near the end, the movie has no more blood than a kid's movie. I really cannot think of ANYTHING in this movie that would be aimed at adults or older teensA Nightmare on Elm Street is a children's movie through and through.<br/><br/>The story itself is throw-away and lacks any creativity whatsoever. A guy kills in your dreams. Other than that, every single factor of A Nightmare on Elm Street uses clichés that were around long before it. A secondary character dies off, the main character goes on a quest to kill the killer, the main character goes to school and almost is killed, the main character does research and finds an urban legend (or the equivalent) on how to kill the supernatural killer, her plan succeeds, and the last few minutes show a reversal of expectations. Anyone remember how many times they've seen that exact plot before? If I were to list the movies on the top of my head with that same plot it would take at least two pages. Those of you who claim this is a superior slasher because it's ""original"" do not know what original means.<br/><br/>Freddy is the single thing that even kept me watching this movie. His character is a tired clichéexactly like Pennywise and Billy and the Joker and every other villainbut his actual design is at least a little different. He's essentially Mr. Rodgers with a burnt face and knives for fingers, but that is more original than you're going to get in most slashers. It's sad to see him in such a lame movie.<br/><br/>The only reason I didn't turn A Nightmare on Elm Street off and go to bed is because every ""hardcore horror fan must watch it"" and I did. But I saw nothing different than every other cheese-horror movie ever made. I hope the remake is better. And has less clothing with primary colors.<br/><br/>1/10"

"Gresh854","8","3","4","3 August 2018"," One, Two, Here's My Nightmare On Elm Street Review...
","A Nightmare on Elm Street is one of those movies that gets progressively better and better as it runs along. At first it all appears like your typical cliché horror but eventually, by the near end of it, you've been hit over the head with an insanely explosive, unforgettable, and frantically aggressive finale. Wes Craven's original horror classic challenged the concept of a ""slasher killer"" and introduced us to one of the most notorious icons ever: Freddy Kruger. The idea of a serial killer only having the ability to kill victims within their dreams is devilishly dexterous and might I add, effective. Additionally, some of the more dramatic moments-especially in argumental sequences involving Nancy and her mother-are actually quite efficient and add to the trauma of the film's present situation. The score is as overdone as it is vibrantly energetic and the horror kills have never been so ingenious! This movie however, certainly isn't without its flaws-whether it be the at times, mediocre acting or the cheap jump scares or the glaring plot-holes. It's still none of the less, a horror flick that never, ever gets tiresome. (Verdict: A-)"
"pkollmeier","8","3","4","8 December 2017"," It deserves its rightful place in horror movie history
","Aside from its clunky ending, A Nightmare on Elm Street is my favorite horror movie of all-time. For starters, Freddy Krueger does not discriminate, and he will haunt your dreams no matter your age. Aside from Alien's ""In Space, No One Can Hear You Scream,"" ""Don't Fall Asleep"" is the second-best horror movie catchphrase of all- time.<br/><br/>After Friday the 13th and the 80s slashers took the scene, Wes Craven came through with a whole different evil villain in Freddy Krueger, a former child murderer that kills kids in their dreams. I'm sorry, what?<br/><br/>He got the idea from a string of stories ran in the LA Times about a young child that had survived the field killings in Cambodia. After a slew of nightmares, the young boy was found dead in his house after dying in his sleep. The police found a coffee pot in his closet with an extension cord running up under his bed and plugged into the wall. He obviously didn't want to fall asleep either. <br/><br/>Craven ran with the story and created the most heinous, vile monster in horror movie history. With some Hitchcock elements spun throughout, A Nightmare on Elm Street is a fantastic ride from start to (almost) finish. The mood, music, atmosphere, shots, effects, blood, kills, and nightmares are all perfect. There are a few scenes that you watch and say ""Wow, that's a classic cinema shot,"" or ""Holy hell that's terrifying"". Some scenes make you feel like Freddy Krueger is actually out there waiting for you to fall asleep tonight.<br/><br/>Heather Langenkamp, aka Nancy Thompson in the film, works perfectly here. All of the characters do really. There are some missed opportunities, sure, but it all works out and there are times throughout the film where you feel trapped inside a boiler room, a terrible nightmare or a dangerous place and think, ""Is this really happening to me?"" The ending is a bit clunky and takes the fear away a bit, but I also think that is part of the point. As Nancy fights back and becomes the ultimate bad-a#$, Krueger becomes less and less of a threat. <br/><br/>Facing your fears is difficult, but Nancy shows us the courage and tenacity it takes to destroy an evil entity like Freddy Krueger. Or, does she?"
"StevePulaski","8","3","4","13 October 2015"," One of the undisputed godfathers of the slasher film genre
","Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street has become a quintessential genre classic; when people reference the ""good ol' days"" of horror or the slasher film, they generally have both Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street in mind. Not much can be said about the classic film that hasn't already been said before, aside from the fact that this remains one of the most fundamental genre films of its time and its impact as a film is still widely felt today like the waves of an aftershock. It's one of those horror films that you don't need to put in context of the times because it's so legitimately good and scary that it scares you anyway.<br/><br/>We open in the midst of Nancy Thompson's (Heather Langenkamp) nightmare, where she is haunted by a figure wearing a red and green striped sweater, a fedora hat, and a hand made up of razors. She wakes up shell-shocked and informs her friends Tina (Amanda Wyss), Rod (Nick Corri), and Glen (Johnny Depp) about the nightmare, to which nobody but Tina seems immediately convinced, for she had a similar nightmare that same night. After a while, the gang brushes it off in favor of a sleepover at Tina's house, which ends in tragedy as Tina is brutally murdered in her sleep upon elevating from her bed and being viciously attacked by an unseen force. Because Rod, her boyfriend, slept with her that night, he is taken into custody and Nancy and Glen are left to confront what exactly is haunting them and how to stop it.<br/><br/>The actual haunting comes from a demon named Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund), a savage character that seems to be extracted from the bowels of your most sinister nightmare. His methods are dastardly original, for he haunts victims in their dreams and daydreams, before murdering them in their sleep, where they'll subsequently die in real life, as well. Wes Craven, who also wrote the film, makes Freddy so quietly ingenuous you might miss the reason why he's such an unexpected villain. Sleeping is when we, as humans, are at our most vulnerable, taken out of our environment temporarily in favor of a night's refreshment to ""recharge our batteries,"" so to speak colloquially, for the next day. With that, we cannot consciously control what and who we dream of, so Freddy shows up in our dreams in order to snatch us at our most vulnerable and make us not see another day. We can't defend ourselves, nor can we adequately predict what will happen.<br/><br/>While Jason Voorhees, who predated Freddy a good four years to the point where he was already finding a new batch of impressionable youth to kill for the fourth time before his genre-counterpart decided to show up, could attack youth when their hormones and sexual energy were at its peak, Freddy attacked his victims during a time when they should've felt safety. With that, Craven emphasizes this realm of the dream-world by merging the likes of reality and dreams together, successfully blurring the line not only to confuse the characters in the film, but us, as well.<br/><br/>None of this would be possible if the cast weren't as strong as they were, and save for some cheesiness in line delivery, most of the cast is strong here, particularly Langenkamp, who I would've loved to see take on varying roles aside from just horror films. The film also features the first on-screen performance by Johnny Depp, who gives one of his only human, everyman roles here in the face of grave danger.<br/><br/>A Nightmare on Elm Street is often buoyed by a wonderful sense of suspense on part of Craven and cinematographer Jacques Haitkin, who do a fine job at not only blurring lines of reality, but creating a film that essentially bleeds creepiness, figuratively and literally. This is a downright spooky film, giving off the vibes of a demented haunted house, where at any moment a character will slip into an unforeseeable abyss and be scarfed up by demons like a piece of meat fed to hungry, feral savages. It's a film that manages to be occasionally gruesome without every being artistically empty or even an ugly piece of film; it's constantly enjoyable and a strong film in terms of its narrative structure.<br/><br/>The only trouble, seeing past the cloud of nostalgia that often cloaks this film, is that the slowburn technique that Craven clearly tries to employ here sort of interrupts itself early in the second act, where we see a bit too much of Freddy, to the point where Nancy decides to engage in a fight with him. This feels like a case of ""climax come lately,"" where what could pragmatically be the conclusion to the film comes far earlier than expected and is instead used as a vehicle for the plot halfway through. Craven would've done better to keep Freddy a more abstract figure up until the end, focusing on his trademarks before revealing the final, hair-raising product. The scene where Freddy and Nancy face off in a dream feels like it happens far too soon and throws off Craven's methodical buildup.<br/><br/>A Nightmare on Elm Street, through whatever flaw I try to accuse it of having, is still an indisputable masterpiece of the genre, destined to live on no matter how many sequels, remakes, reboots, or licensed products leach off of it. Much like The Hills Have Eyes, Craven's earlier work, this is a film that does a wonderful job at personifying fear, although while the former film gave us a taste of personified fear in an unfamiliar location, this particular film gives us a taste of unbridled fear at our most vulnerable. Sleep tight.<br/><br/>Starring: Heather Langenkamp, Robert Englund, Johnny Depp, Nick Corri, and Amanda Wyss. Directed by: Wes Craven."
"andrewbarry6336","6","3","4","25 November 2013"," An Original Slasher Movie With All The Right Elements But..
","I know a lot of people probably read my title then saw my rating of 6 out of 10 and asked themselves why would he do that? Its true this movie is a fresh take on the slasher genre and Freddy is a wonderfully designed character. The kills are great which is usually all I need to enjoy this type of movie. However a few things bother me when it comes to not only this one but the whole series.(Relax I am only reviewing what I think of this one and not the series).<br/><br/>First off the comparisons between this and Friday the 13th is ridiculous. FT13 simplifies the slasher genre and makes it fun and gory and is one of the FEW slashers where you actually root for the bad guy. Here we have a child killer(admit he was a pervert to) who comes to you in your dreams. While most people say he is scarier than other slashers because you can not get away from your dreams, you can't get away from Jason either since he can not die. Also when Freddy does come to the real world he always gets his @$$ kicked. Onto the film.<br/><br/>I won't talk of the story because in slashers its always basic. Instead I will talk of the concept. I love Wes Craven's works and think Scream was a great slasher series. The ideas presented in this movie are great concepts. I mean a serial killer all burnt up with a glove on his right hand with knives on each finger is a great design. He invades your dreams and kills you off in sick ways. While it is interesting I just do not find this movie to be all that great. While the later ones get more humor put in, I feel this one has just as much black humor and I think it works against it. Freddy has great one liners but a character needs more than that in slashers. The kills are good like I said earlier but they still don't entertain me as much as FT13's or Halloween's. <br/><br/>I will admit the remake that came out in 2010 had a lot of problems with it. The pacing was pretty bad and while I enjoyed the kills, I wish they wouldn't have copied some of the kills from the original. However the one shining character in the remake is Jackie Earl's portrayal of Freddy. Robert England did a good job but Jackie actually makes Freddy menacing. I believe with a more original story put behind it he could become a great Freddy. Also for all you fans saying FT13 turned slashers into cliché's. I agree to a point but NOES does the same. This has original ideas but the series would go on to do what all successful slasher series do and get made for the cash. Maybe I will do a report on these two franchises and show what each did do and didn't compared to the other. IN till then this movie stays at a 6 outta 10. It is a good movie with original ideas but I don't find Freddy all that creepy or interesting. If you haven't seen it don't let my review stop you from seeing it. With this movie you will either love it or just like it which is something you can't say for a lot of slashers."
"moviesleuth2","7","3","4","5 February 2010"," Inventive entry into the horror genre
","Sleep is an essential part of life; it allows our bodies and our minds to relax and recharge for the next day. It is also the time when we are the most vulnerable. When we are asleep, we are blissfully unaware of what is going on around us. Wes Craven's landmark horror film, ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" takes advantage of this often overlooked part of life and uses it in unusual and effective ways.<br/><br/>Nancy (Heather Langenkamp) is your average sixteen year old girl. She's got good friends and a great boyfriend. But when her friend Tina (Amanda Wyss) is brutally murdered, and her boyfriend Rod (Jsu Garcia) is arrested for it, Nancy's world is turned upside down. However, Tina had a nightmare the night before she died, the same one that Nancy and Rod had. As her friends keep turning up dead, Nancy begins to realize that there is someone who is killing her friends in their dreams, and what happens in their dreams, happens in real life.<br/><br/>This all sounds highly convoluted, which it is, but Craven explains it pretty thoroughly. The premise is golden, and Craven, never one to shy away from taking risks, exploits it for all it's worth. The crossing of this boundary opens up a lot of possibilities, not only for the staple events in a horror movie (gruesome and inventive murders), but some philosophical questions about this given boundary.<br/><br/>Unfortunately while the film can boast a highly original premise and story, it's not that scary. Maybe it's because it's not particularly well-acted. Amanda Wyss and Jsu Garcia aren't particularly good thespians, even within the broad constraints of the genre. Heather Langenkamp is solid as the spunky heroine. For once, the heroine of the horror film isn't as dumb as a brick or supremely wimpy. She's brave, and more importantly, pretty smart. Johnny Depp shows us a glimmer of his talent as her boyfriend, Glen. Ronee Blakely is okay as Nancy's mom, who knows more about what's going on than she's telling. However, the real star of the show is not Robert Englund (who is very creepy as the film's sadistic villain, Fred Krueger), but John Saxon. Saxon is great as Nancy's sympathetic, but incredulous father. He acts just the way a normal father would act in the given situation.<br/><br/>Wes Craven is known as the Master of Horror. While he's made a number of solid horror movies, I don't agree with that statement. His films are engaging and competently made, but they aren't all that frightening. The one thing that Craven has that no one else does is a penchant for taking risks. ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" doesn't follow the slasher film formula (in fact, this is just a horror film, and not a member of the slasher genre).<br/><br/>It's recommendable because it's a spooky story with a few shocks and tense moments."
"thesar-2","8","3","4","2 January 2010"," Tina! Mother! Krueger! Scream!
","I knew someone who didn't much care for horror movies, but he kept screeching ""TINA!"" around me and his partner attempting to either A: scare us, B: simply make fun of the dialogue or both, in A Nightmare on Elm Street. I can say that, nor the movie itself, scared me. In fact, none of the series (so far) 8 installments, including Freddy Vs. Jason, scared me. And that's okay; it wasn't the scare factor that impressed me or kept me wanting more. It was the humor and inventiveness.<br/><br/>Growing up, I was a huge fan of the Halloween, Friday the 13th, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Hellraiser and A Nightmare on Elm Street series, or in other words, cheesy 1980s horror/psycho killer films. (Yeah, I know some of them started in the 1970s, but it was the 1980s that made them famous.) The one series that topped all others, even to today, was the Freddy Krueger films.<br/><br/>Generally speaking, the first in any series is usually the best one. I.E. Halloween, Hellraiser and Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Though I thoroughly enjoyed the original A Nightmare on Elm Street, it wasn't the best and by no means is it a perfect film. But, it set the stage. It took it's predecessors to a new level. Namely in creativity. Which is one of the reasons why I liked this series the best. Well, that and Freddy is the best of all the serial killers in the aforementioned horror franchises.<br/><br/>Nancy (Langenkamp) and her high school pals are having bad dreams, and slowly they discover that they're all experiencing the same horrific nightmares about a man in a ""weird hat, red and green sweater and knifes for fingers."" What they don't realize is that even though the dreams are really, really bad, they soon become deadly when Tina (Wyss) is murdered supposedly by her boyfriend during the night.<br/><br/>Boyfriend Rod (Corri) is framed and in jail, but the killing continues! The kids, namely future series heroine, Nancy, attempt to put the mystery together while trying to stay awake and find out who this man of their nightmares is.<br/><br/>No spoiler here, but it's Willie from the original V series! Okay, it's just Freddy Krueger, known here as Fred. (At least they didn't call him Frederick.) Nancy must rely solely on herself and her instincts to solve the mystery surrounding Fred, why he's in her dreams and stop him. And seeing the people around her, her blatantly drunk mother, her ""dumb jock"" disbelieving boyfriend and her angry and overprotective cop dad are all of no use. (Heck, all of the cops should be fired – I loved the hesitant one in the closing when Nancy's going berserk. Hilarious.)<br/><br/>I guess why I rated A Nightmare on Elm Street only 8 stars is because of the laughable dialogue, the inconsistencies and irregularities. For example, some things can come out of the dream when captured, such as the hat and (spoiler – someone else) but then the trellis she doesn't even hold onto comes back with her. A feather from her pillow is seen floating but the mirror Fred crashes through survives. Nancy requests 20 minutes to capture the killer and still has time to set half a dozen traps, have a nice mother-daughter talk and fall into deep sleep. And Fred is only supposed to appear when one's asleep; yet, Nancy receives a call from him and the ending blows any of the story's mythos out the window. Literally.<br/><br/>I'm not just talking about goofs, as all movies have them, but they set up a premise, a good and original one in a series of horror movies that relied on a masked killer stalking in the shadows. At least they tried here to change the trend. But, unfortunately, they kept breaking their own rules. It actually would've made more sense to have him as a ghost and then all bets are off. (Granted, he's sort of a ghost, but with rules.) As for the dialogue, though some of its iconic by now, it really doesn't hold up. A few years back, I saw A Nightmare on Elm Street in the theater for a one-night presentation. Being a huge fan, I arrived way early to get good seats, but still thought hardly anyone would show up. Well, it completely sold out. And to my surprise, everyone practically laughed all the way though it and it appeared both at and with the movie. I had to, myself. Even though I grew up on the series and loved them, the movie really was silly, namely for some of the lines, acting and characters – Oh, that drunk mother! Alcohol should be part of any nutritious breakfast! I don't think the audience was really criticizing the movie, they were just having fun.<br/><br/>Aside from negatives, I am still awarding the movie 8/10 due to the movie being enormously inventive, original, fun and despite Fred(dy) not being in it too much, he was extremely iconic, an instant super-villain. Also, I'm glad it started a cult following since a lot of the sequels explored a lot more and were, in a lot of ways, far superior to this original one. So, it did set the stage, introduced a whole new world and just as Jaws did for swimmers, this one did for sleepers. Only, with Jaws, you could choose to stay out of the water. Here, and in real life, you eventually have to sleep. Maybe for the last time."

","Before I start reviewing this wonderful series I must say that for the longest time I had wanted to and now have had the chance to watch it. Now to the review, what can I say, hmmmmz, maybe that this film was an awesome movie with a lot of blood, gore and killing that I love.<br/><br/>Nancy Thompson(Heather Langenkamp)has been having dreams. So have her friends Tina(Amanda Wyss), Glen(Johnny Depp)and Rod(Jsu Garcia). And all of the dreams that they have been having seemed to center about a man that wears a brown fedora hat, red and green striped sweater and a clawed hand of deathly precautions. One by one Nancy sees her friends die to the hands of the killer. That is until she makes him come into the real world and learning that she holds the power of his strength and weaknesses.<br/><br/>The ending was a great success as it shouted out that Freddy Krueger(Robert Englund)is not done with his revenge upon the civilians of Elm Street. I gave this an 8 as I felt it needed to be a lot longer."
"jmcgee321","10","3","4","29 March 2005"," A Dream Come True for My Nightmares!!!!!!!!!!
","In all my years of living, I have never come across a horror movie that made me have nightmares. Even the Excorist didn't give me nightmares, but when I first saw this as a younging, I didn't sleep in my bed for two years. Wes Craven has made a landmark of a film. Not only defining reason and doubt, but also reality.<br/><br/>Nancy(Heather Langenkamp), Glen(Johnny Depp), Alice(Amanda Wyss), and Rod(Nick Corri) are all having nightmares about a badly burned man with a right handed glove of claws named FREDDY KRUEGER(Robert Englund). Not only does the nightmares scare them more than anything ever, but the violence he lays down on them are shown in real life. So when Alice dies in her sleep, it's a huge wake-up call for them, especially Nancy. When more friends start dying and her parents(John Saxon & Ronee Blakley) won't believe her. She decides to fight FREDDY on both turfs.<br/><br/>This to me was the first horror movie I ever watched that actually scared me. The acting is great, but a brilliant performance by Robert Englund; who gives birth to the most haunting name in horror history. The death scenes are shockingly scary and original in sense. One gave me the willies to not sleep in my bed. A movie like this comes once in a while thanks to the great Wes Craven. Who's new movie RED EYE is gonna blow us away. Not every horror film can be original as this was and still is. Movies today seem to copy this or any other great scary movie at this time. And to think without this we would not have an MAGNOLIA, RUSH HOUR, Friday, FINAL DESTINATION, or any other great NEW LINE company feature film."
"The Bronson Fan","10","3","4","2 March 2005"," The Nightmare that started it all!
","Wes Craven writes and directs one of the greatest horror films ever made that went on to spawn a million dollar franchise. The story begins with 4 local teenagers who are having some bad dreams to say the least. Tina (Amanda Wyss) tells Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp) about the nightmares and realize that the same creep has been terrorizing her in her dreams. Soon enough Tina is killed and her boyfriend blamed. Nancy's nightmares increase as the man know as Fred Krueger (Robert Englund) attempts to kill her in her nightmares. She finds out that he was a child killer in town that the locals including her parents, hunted down and burned to death. No one believes her including her boy friend (Depp) and father (Saxon), so she decides its up to her. Nancy manages to pull him out of her dreams and kill him. The Ending is a bit confusing weather or not she was dreaming when she killed Krueger or when the movie ends. But that's one of the effects that Wes Craven put into the film not knowing what is dream and what is reality. Of all the Nightmare films this is by far the best directed, written and acted of the series. Craven manages to put together a movie that can be genuinely creepy at times. Being a big horror movie fan, this was great and rather then the slasher flicks that it became this sticks to a better story line. The acting was in most part better than the other films. Langenkamp and Saxon are great in their roles along with Depp, though I hate him, he is a good actor. Englund though one of the main stars does very little in terms of acting. His charter does not have nearly the funny one liners he would be know for in the future. The special effects are average for the time, nothing special here. The story is probably where this movie shines the most along with the main charter of Freddy. This one may not be as entertaining as 3 and 4 but overall is a better film. I must have seen this film as kid in the mid eighties and it was very refreshing to see it again, because this is what a real horror movie should look like. I'm sure the DVD will have great extras and plan on getting it. Big ten for a classic film of pure horror and terror."
"medic249a2","9","3","4","21 February 2005"," Still frightening 18 years later!
","I first saw this one when I was about 16, after my younger brother had told me about it. The concept of a monster that hunts you in your dreams - and follows you when you wake - was original for horror flicks.<br/><br/>Mass murderer Fred Krueger (Englund) had killed 20+ children with the now-infamous claw-glove - an ordinary working glove outfitted with 4 straight razor blades. When he was caught by Lt. Don Thompson (Saxon) and a group of officers from the Springwood Police, several bodies of the town's murdered children were found in the boiler room where he worked. (This boiler room became the setting for the nightmares of the Elm St. teenagers in the film.) Unfortunately, as young Nancy Thompson (Langenkamp) finds out later in the film, a legal technicality sprung this monster loose from police custody. Krueger was followed to the boiler room, which an angry mob of parents torched with gasoline. Krueger burned to death inside. (Adapted from The Nightmares on Elm Street novel).<br/><br/>Years after his death, the ghost of Fred Krueger returns - this time in the nightmares of the children whose parents had torched the boiler room and killed him. Nancy and her friends Tina (Wyss), Rod (Corri), and Glen (Depp), are experiencing nerve-wracking nightmares involving a deformed madman in a dirty red & green sweater, who is horribly burned, and wearing a glove outfitted with 4 razor-sharp blades on the fingers! Tina is the first to encounter him, first in his boiler room - from which she escapes - and again in an alley behind her home. This time, she is killed by Krueger in the dream and dies in reality - a violent, frightening death while her boyfriend Rod watches helplessly. Next morning, Rod is arrested by Nancy's dad as an obvious suspect. But Nancy has a horrifying nightmare at school in which she also encounters the horrible man with the finger-knives, and narrowly escapes. Realizing that before her death Tina had described the EXACT SAME man to her, Nancy visits Rod in police custody where he describes having a similar nightmare - in which he ALSO faced the monster with knives for fingers. When Nancy has another dream encounter with Krueger - in which she sees Krueger threatening Rod - she & Glen go to her dad's precinct and urge him to check on Rod. But by the time they reach the cell, Rod is dead - the victim of a hanging by Krueger. At Rod's funeral, Nancy describes the man in the dirty sweater and deadly finger-knives who killed Tina & Rod to her father - and a disturbing look crosses her dad's face. Nancy's mom takes her to a sleep-disorder research clinic, where Nancy has another frightening nightmare involving Krueger. This time, she emerges with a bloody gash from Krueger's blades, and something more disturbing - the old fedora hat that Krueger always wore. It is only after learning Krueger's identity that Nancy's mother reveals the true story of Fred Krueger to her daughter. Armed with this knowledge, Nancy goes about preparing herself for the final confrontation with Krueger, to bring him into her world in the same way she did with his hat - and hopefully to erase Krueger for good.<br/><br/>In the DVD commentary, director Wes Craven described the story that inspired his concept of Fred Krueger as the demonic presence that haunts people's nightmares. Apparently it was based on a series of true events involving children of immigrants from Thailand who were living in the Los Angeles area. The children had been describing horrific nightmares to their parents and were terrified of going to sleep. In 1 case a child stayed awake for 7 days. Their parents brushed off their children's concerns, and several died in their sleep. I had never heard of this until watching the DVD version 18 years after I first saw the film! <br/><br/>Despite its low budget, the film still does an awesome job of creating the illogicality of nightmares, such as the appearance of the sheep in the boiler room and the 20-foot-long arms that Krueger extends across the alley to block Tina's escape, not to mention Tina's terrible death which was made in a revolving room set.<br/><br/>Still the most frightening of them all!"
"joshuadrake-91275","10","4","6","14 September 2015"," Great first chapter in the Elm Street series!,
","The original 1984 A Nightmare on Elm Street is more than just your average ordinary scary movie. It's a scary movie that influenced other scary movies such as The Ring, The Grudge, Saw, Hostel and Paranormal Activity and it is the reason why we have Freddy Krueger, one of the most iconic horror villains on the screen.<br/><br/>The original 1984 classic is written and directed by Wes Craven and was released on November 9, 1984 and it's distributor, New Line Cinema from going bankrupt and spawn a multi-media franchise, including eight sequels, a 2010 reboot of the same name, produced by Michael Bay and starring Jackie Earle Haley as Freddy Krueger, video games, comic books, a TV show and a crossover between the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise and Friday the 13th franchise, which was titled Freddy vs. Jason, and released in 2003.<br/><br/>The plot deals with a killer named Freddy Kreuger attacking Nancy Thompson and her friends in their dreams, successfully killing all but Nancy, in fictional Springwood, Ohio. Krueger's back-story is revealed by Nancy's mother, Marge, who explains that he was a child murderer.<br/><br/>The parents of Springwood killed Kreuger after he was acquitted on a technically. Nancy defeats Freddy by pulling him out of the dream world and stripping him of his powers when she stops being afraid of him.<br/><br/>The original Nightmare on Elm Street is a classic for me because at the time I was growing up, I really did not know what a scary movie was until I got my first taste in 2003 when I saw ""Freddy vs. Jason"" and that's when I started to like scary movies.<br/><br/>Robert Englund plays the role of Freddy Krueger and he would remain in that part for all eight original Nightmare on Elm Steet films, but would soon be played by Jackie Earle Haley in the 2010 version. Now, I can't say which actor is better as Freddy Krueger because I like both of them. I know my sister LeeAnn is going to curse me out for saying this, but I'm gonna say it anyway. I actually prefer both actors playing Freddy Krueger. Sure, Jackie Earle Haley may not have the comedic stuff like Robert Englund, but he does do one thing right: play the part of Krueger in a scary way, much like Englund does in the original 1984 film and it's sequels. Heather Langenkamp plays Nancy Thompson and she would play the part of Nancy again in ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors"" and she would also play herself and Nancy in ""Wes Craven's New Nightmare"". Johnny Depp plays Glen in the first film of his career and a lot of people said that this is his worst performance, but I actually like him in the first Freddy Krueger film. Jsu Garcia and Amanda Wyss plays Tina and Rod and they are good in the time they have on screen. John Saxon plays Lt. Don Thompson and he is just amazing.<br/><br/>The music composed by Charles Bernstein is amazing and really amazing and I really liked the musical score. The movie's tension and suspense builds up to each nightmare in the film. My favorite nightmare is when Nancy is in the bathtub and Freddy's claw comes out of the water and tries to kill her, but she drowns and she eventually gets out.<br/><br/>The visuals were impressive for 1984 and they are just as incredible now as they were back then. The editing and dialogue is memorable as heck and this movie is really cool and impressive.<br/><br/>The style and tone of this movie is really dark and serious and it is very good for this kind of scary movie. The sequels were also cool and amazing, but the only one I had mixed feelings about is the fifth film, ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child"". But, I will get to that in a later review.<br/><br/>Overall, the original 1984 version of A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET is really well directed, well-written, darn good acted and has a great musical theme that tells you that Freddy Kreuger is coming for you. The movie is gory in some scenes, but it has a purpose for being in the movie, which I like and I have no problem re-watching the Nightmare on Elm Street film franchise over and over again, especially the 1984 film, the 2010 remake and the 2003 crossover with Friday the 13th. The music by Charles Bernstein is really amazing and it is very dark and sinister and it is really cool to hear the Freddy Krueger theme. The film is definitely getting the best possible rating I can give it and that is a 10 out of 10."

","A Nightmare on elm street was okay but nothing spectacular. The movie is creepy with a little suspense but once you've seen one person get killed in a gruesome way you've seen them all. Writer/Director Wes Craven is admirable in making this horror movie about a dead child murderer who comes back for revenge by stalking people mostly teenagers in their dreams. Craven has shown his talent in all of his films and this is no different. Robert Englund is admirable as Freddy Kruger as the dead burned child murderer giving audiences a villain who is creepy and scary but the inevitable sequels that followed after just got old because it was the same plot all over again with his character stalking teenagers in their dreams. Englund is still effective as Freddy none the less. The rest of the cast are good including John Saxon, Ronee Blakley, Heather Langenkamp, and a young Johnny Depp in a small part but his role unfortunately gets cut short. The bloody deaths committed by Freddy are well executed but after a while they get kind of old. The lack of real scares, suspense build up which there was some but not a lot, and the dialogue at times is what weighed the movie down the much at least to me. Overall though A Nightmare On Elm Street is an okay horror thriller with some suspense and decent performances that make for a creepy but flawed film to watch."
"primelegend","5","7","15","11 July 2002"," Wes Craven is a good director, but NOT a good writer
","Let me tell you in one word why this movie is very poorly made.  Simply put, it's the writing.  Wes Craven has written other things in his time but when he set out to write this screenplay, he wrote some horrible dialogue! This whole movie is runed because of it's poor dialogue and idiotic situations.  Only the character of Nancy played by Heather Lagenkamp is credible onscreen.  Even Johnny Depp, the most underrated actor of the past two decades and a great character actor, stumbles over the lines as if he where in an elementary school production.  The character of Freddy, although somewhat scary in this first movie, loses alot of the presence he has by joking and snickering.  There's no suspense, only shock value.  Everything looks like it was filmed on a sitcom stage.  It almost feels like an eighties hairmetal music video.  Maybe another factor is that this movie didn't age well at all. To prove that Wes Craven started out with an interesting idea and turned it into grade B junk, one need only look towards Scream.  While Scream was a partial parody, it was also a far superior horror movie.  Scream was written by Kevin Williamson and only directed by Wes Craven.  It is Craven's most popular movie.  Watch the first A Nightmare on Elm Street ( the sequels are even worse) for curiosity's sake or for the great, creepy special effects. But don't expect, natural dialogue, suspense, logical situations, or for ""Nightmare"" to even hold a candle to Scream or Halloween."

","Essential, well deserved ""class in the genre"" status.<br/><br/>""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" is a unique Horror movie that successfully explores a common fear in humans : dreams. In this movie, a killer known as Fred Krueger uses dreams as his method for entering in the real world. Krueger turns dreams into deadly nightmares.<br/><br/>This is truly Craven's Horror classic. ""A Nightmare..."" has set rules than only a few brave have managed to copy. Even though that Craven's killer in this movie is severely influenced by the Slasher craziness from the 80's, he is a scary concept in all the sense of the word. He can control nightmares and then kill his victims while they sleep. The concept is very scary but it's better executed. Craven's direction is classy and at some points looks like a real nightmare. The atmosphere is dark, unsettling through all the running time. There ain't no room for black humor or cheesiness. This movie goes directly to the point and manages to play with the audience's emotions.<br/><br/>Also, the acting is really great. Specially by John Saxon and Robert Englund who carry the movie on their back. The rest of the young cast (including Johnny Depp) is fair good. The score is brilliantly scary. So when you have the correct elements to make a good Horror movie, think about ""A Nightmare..."" as a perfect example.<br/><br/>I don't want to spoil this for those unfortunate who haven't seen it. Please, do yourself a favor and get this modern classic in the genre. It's not a defining movie but it surely is one of the best Horror movies from the 80's. Meet Freddy Krueger, the character that will mostly appear in your real life nightmares."

The story is far better than most of the modern horror films and never fails to keep you interested throughout. Saying that, the rules of the actual dream world connecting to the real world seemed far too loose, it could have been a much better film with a more concentrated idea of what is possible (this is what brought it down from 4/5 to 3/5).

","It's poorly-acted, sloppily-made, and far too bloody, however the very first ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" spooked me at the time and has an ingenious premise. Teenage girl finds that her friends are being killed in their dreams by a deceased child-killer seeking revenge; she plots to trip him up and save the neighborhood! It's a modest thriller with fake blood splashed around, but it isn't an ugly, mean-spirited movie (as some of the sequels were). In fact, it's rather playful and fun-scary, the way a good chiller ought to be. Director Wes Craven allows himself to get a little dopey (check out that finale!), but he takes some chances here that his more recent work rebuffs. Craven is working on pure adrenaline as well as a loopy, lopsided sense of logic, and this ""BOO!"" sensibility suits him. A nifty little screamer. **1/2 from ****"

","When I first watched this masterpiece of the genre, I was not at all a fan of horror. What's more, I did not watch horror at all, and I decided to see this film solely because of Johnny Depp. I saw all of his films and Johnny's film debut was the only one left. I was avoiding it for a long time because it was a horror, but in the end I could not resist. When I finally saw it, I had to see the second one, then the third... and I was hooked. Love was born to the horrors of the eighties, and then to the genre in general.<br/><br/>Many mistakenly believe that the greatest human fear is the fear of death. The fear of death is just one aspect of the really greatest human fear - fear of the unknown. Dreams are still a mystery to us. We do not understand them and we have no control over them, so the horror based on dreams is a very effective idea. Horrors based on impossible premises, no matter how well designed, have no effect on me. But when there is even a trace of suspicion that the premise could be possible (of course, not exactly in this form), combined with masterful skills of Wes Craven and the credible cast, led by Robert Englund, as one of the most awesome film villains of all time, we get a movie that maintains tension from the beginning to the end, and you will be at least a bit uncomfortable the next couple of nights while you are about to fall asleep. And if you are still a child, get ready for a few months of nightmares.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Before the 80s, horror movies were very dark and original and they each had their own concepts and sub genres in horror. But when this movie came out, that changed EVERYTHING! Wes Craven has created one of the most iconic slashers in all movie history, ''Freddy Krueger'' played by the legendary Robert Englund and he is STILL known as one of the greatest to this day! This is a horror movie that knew what it was! It had likable characters, a VERY clever plot, great acting, and a very scary villain! I would actually consider A Nightmare on Elm Street the greatest slasher movie since Halloween! Nancy played by Heather Langenkamp was very good in this movie! I thought her character was very strong and was actually one of the few people in this movie who was ACTUALLY concerned about all these nightmares her and her friends are experiencing. Johnny Depp was also very good in this movie, considering that this was his FIRST movie he ever made, which lead him to a big career in the future and all of the other actors were good in this movie as well. A Nightmare on Elm Street REALLY surprised me when I watched it for the 1st time and as a horror fan, this is DEFINITELY one of my all time favorites! And as a low budget horror movie, this movie STILL works to this day! Some of the certain effects they used to make Freddy come to life in this film were very intense and scary and are still scary today! Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street is definitely a must watch for any horror fan and it is definitely a living masterpiece and of the best of the slashers and horror alone and of course I'm gonna give A Nightmare on Elm Street a 10/10!"

"alexanderdavies-99382","10","2","3","7 September 2017"," The first and best of the the Freddy Kruegar films!
","""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" is a highly original horror film. A new icon of horror cinema was born and appeared in several sequels and a T.V series. The film made a star of Robert Englund, who made the character of Freddy Kruegar his own for all time. It is nothing short of remarkable and incredulous in what was achieved with ""A Nightmare On Elm Street,"" both from a technical and a storytelling standpoint. Audiences had never seen anything like this before. Wes Craven (R.I.P to a great director) was enjoying success with his films ""The Hills Have Eyes"" and ""The Swamp Thing"" at this juncture in the early 1980s. He drew inspiration for his next movie, from a real life incident somewhere in Asia. The said incident was about a young boy who claimed he was troubled by the nightmares he was experiencing whilst asleep. For the character of Kruegar and his appearance, Craven remembered as a boy, Walking along a pathway near his home. He came across this man who was a hobo. Craven said that he couldn't see the man clearly as it was growing dark but observed this shabby fedora hat the man was wearing. Then suddenly, the man cast a look at young Craven and stared straight at him. Craven fled in terror and soon reached home. The director took his ideas for the film to several producers but they all said no. They claimed that they didn't fully comprehend the story and that it would never be made into a film. Then an unknown producer named Robert Shaye was shown the project and he immediately agreed to be the producer for ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" via his own company of ""New Line Cinema."" The said company at this time, hadn't yet been established and Robert Shaye's office was slightly struggling. However, filming was scheduled to commence. John Saxon and Ronee Blakley were cast as the nominal leads but it was Heather Langenkamp who is the central character to the story. In the town of Springfield, a group of teenagers are experiencing some rather alarming nightmares. They all claim to being stalked by a man who wears a dirty sweater, a fedora hat, who wears a glove of knives and is disfigured. Soon, the teenagers begin dying and one of them, Nancy, begins to investigate who this man is and what it is he wants. The killer in the dreams, is one Freddy Kruegar and he has a score he wishes to settle. Nothing is what it seems in the world of Freddy Kruegar. In his particular world of dreams, everything around the victim is recreated to the smallest detail. That makes the film even more disturbing as the victim is lulled into a false sense of security. Only Freddy knows the rules of the game and he changes those rules to suit his own devilish ends. He turns reality completely upside down in his pursuit of his victims. The teenagers in question realise that it is fatal to fall asleep as they struggle to remain in control of their destiny. The dark photography highlights the eerie and thought-provoking scenario very well. Wes Craven's direction is amongst his very best as he makes this rather outlandish premise both plausible and very convincing. We are drawn into the world of Freddy Kruegar along with the teenagers. You have the impression of sharing their danger. What makes the film work most effectively, is that Freddy isn't seen all that much. Indeed, during the opening credit sequence, he is only seen in shadow and briefly in a close up. Robert Englund doesn't have a lot of dialogue but what he does have, is unforgettable. His actual screen time isn't much but his is the character to remember. However, the actors who play his victims are very good as they successfully display the vulnerability. Johnny Depp as Glen, was in his first proper film and he was one of these actors who developed his trade as he went along. Amanda Wyss makes for a convincing victim and gives her character of Tina some shading. Nick Corri makes it known in his character of Rod, that he is more frightened and vulnerable than he initially lets on. From the time the film was commissioned to be made, right up to post production, everyone involved in the making of ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" was aware of the tight budget and demanding filming schedule. Robert Shaye had to gain some financial support from elsewhere in order to have the film completed. His business partners kept appearing on the set and were always checking their watches and making some notes about the filming. Both Craven and Shaye felt the pressure of this and this caused a tense atmosphere throughout the rest of the shooting. The whole thing was made for $1,800,000 and that is not much money at all for a Hollywood movie. The filming schedule was for about 45 days or less. Considering all the technical scenes that were needed for ""A Nightmare On Elm Street,"" 45 days wasn't much time. The technical scenes represented the alternate real world as conjured up Freddy Kruegar. The effects department had to produce miracles and they did just that. The work they did is absolutely brilliant. The script could have been just another routine one, seeing as this film is another Slasher horror film. To the film's credit and to Craven's, the script is one of the best I have come across. It helps that the narrative is kept fairly tight and with no irrelevant subplots. The running time of 87 minutes is just right. ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" proceeded to make a fortune at the box office upon its release in 1984. The public immediately took to Freddy Kruegar and it wasn't long before a sequel was made."

"thelastblogontheleft","10","2","3","31 December 2016"," Don't Fall Asleep...
","Are y'all ready for an awesome breakdown of why A Nightmare on Elm Street is head and shoulders above the other two in the horror trifecta (Halloween and Friday the 13th)? Because you're about to get it.<br/><br/>First, the entire concept is way more terrifying than your everyday slasher. He still has the severely damaged past — he was a child murderer who was killed by the neighborhood parents' vigilante justice in the form of being burned alive — but the fact that he's attacking teenagers in their dreams, in their subconscious, makes him impossible to run away from. You can only resist the pull for so long before you're forced to close your eyes, and then there he is.<br/><br/>""One, two, Freddy's coming for you. / Three, four, better lock your door. / Five, six, grab your crucifix. / Seven, eight, gonna stay up late. / Nine, ten, never sleep again.""<br/><br/>Second, Wes Craven specifically wanted Freddy to rock the no-mask look. He still has a ""mask"" of sorts with his burnt face, but the fact that his face isn't actually covered means he can show way more emotion and intent with his expressions. The dude is straight up COCKY. He taunts and laughs and flaunts himself and really enjoys torturing kids, which is horrifying. Robert Englund is just perfect.<br/><br/>Third, there are some of the most legitimately scary scenes I've seen in ANY movie. The scene with Nancy sleeping and the hands and face sort of pressing their way through the wall? The first time you see Freddy and he's got these freakishly long arms so his ""fingers"" scrape against the walls as he passes by? When Rod wakes up to see Tina being attacked in her dream, as she is cut up and tossed along the walls and the ceiling as he stands back and watches in horror? Nancy's daydream while she's at school with Tina in a bloodied bodybag leading her through the hallways? Just thinking about the moment when her legs lift up and she's dragged around a corner gives me chills. The classic scene where Glen gets sucked into his bed and the reverse waterfall of blood comes shooting out?<br/><br/>Fourth, it does an amazing job at making you unsure of what's reality and what's a dream. It blurs the lines in many of the scenes and it really gives this surreal quality to it. You think you have yourself convinced and then you're surprised. But the fact that Freddy is existing in a dream world means he is less limited than your standard killer. He can do things that not just any human can. And the dream state means that bizarre things can happen and add even more confusion to an already chaotic scenario, like when Nancy is running from Freddy and the stairs are suddenly the consistency of marshmallow fluff. BRILLIANT.<br/><br/>Fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth: it has a young Johnny Depp in a cropped shirt. I REPEAT: A YOUNG JOHNNY DEPP IN A CROPPED SHIRT. This was actually his film debut and, while he's frustrating as hell in it, it's also fun to see him as a lil' baby (he was only 21 at the time).<br/><br/>Tenth: the ending. It may not have been the ending that Wes Craven intended, but it really adds to that blurred reality that I mentioned.<br/><br/>Ultimately, if you haven't seen this movie yet, GO NOW. Like, RUN to the television and watch it. Whatever you do don't fall asleep."

","Greetings Fanboys and Fangirls everywhere, Halloween is coming close, A time where monsters come out to scary the innocent, a time where Legendary Monsters like Dracula, Wolfman, and Frankinstain return to our media, A time... of Nightmares for he has returned, to murder us in our dreams, a being who refers himself as the Dream Master, A being who would make Jack the Ripper look like on old man... His Name... is Freddy Krueger, He first appeared in a Movie called A Nightmare on Elm Street Released in 1984 and Directed by the Guy who made SCREEM, Wes Craven From the history in this This was one of New Lines first ever successful movie they ever had involvement with, And this is the same movie company that did The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, The Hobbit Trilogy, The Mask, And the Blade Trilogy (Before Marvel got the rights of the Character back) and lets not forget that The 80's in some perspective the Year where Horror movies where taking over the cinema's along side Friday the 13th, Hellraiser, even some Horror movie that where... Frighteningly bad, I'm not sure what was going on there but I'm sure the people where into horror despite of the Ratings.<br/><br/>The Stars of this is Heather Langenkamp as Nancy Thompson (Much to my surprise and I never noticed She was Moto in Star Trek: Into Darkness) Glen Lantz was played by Pirates of the Carabian star himself Johnny Depp (And get this This was his First ever Movie he stared in, That's right Nightmare on Elm Street was the Beginning of Johnny Depp's Movie Star life) John Saxon as Lt. Don Thompson which in my opinion has done a very good job at his role, although trying to hide that fact that Freddy is killing people in there Dreams But I'll get to that later on, Ronee Blakley as Marge Thompson, Who in my opinion is more of a complete wreck, Hell Throughout the film she struggles with Nancy's growing instability from lack of sleep and adds locks to the doors and bars to the windows to try to keep Nancy in and the supposedly at-large killer out, turning to alcohol to deal with the stress, (Which doesn't help) and who is playing Freddy Krueger in this, Why it's non other then Robert Englund himself, Looking at his Wiki file he's done a lot after, He was the Riddler in 2005's The Batman show, He played Vulture in The Spectacular Spider-Man show and Felix Faust in Justice League.<br/><br/>Funny enough I never watched any of the Nightmare movies until I got the Blu-Rays in 2014, And I was like this after watching the first movie Wes Craven & Robert Englund, You Mad son's of Bitch's, Not only did you create a Timeless Horror Movie Classic, But this movie Revalutionazed the Horror marketing, This idea originated from a real event of someone Having a nightmare that he was being chased by some maniac, and when he went to sleep, He died the morning after. And Let me tell you about the origin of Freddy, Frederick Charles ""Freddy"" Krueger (a.k.a. The Springwood Slasher) is a child killer responsible for the kidnapping and murder of several children before he is eventually captured. Due to a legal technicality he is released without charge and the parents of the murdered children take the law into their own hands, burning him alive. After his death, Freddy gains the ability to infiltrate and control dreams and uses it to stalk and murder the remaining children of Elm Street. Despite being defeated several times, Freddy repeatedly resurrects himself and continues trying to kill children. Now the fact of some lunatic Murdering people in dreams is pretty terrifying when you put it that way, You can say that this movie is perfect for Halloween, Later on Freddy's movies would go into of Horror comedy, Freddy having his own T.V. Show that resembles The Twilight Zone Freddy vs Jason which put's Freddy against Jason and then there's the Remake in 2010, I will cover them later on but in the mean time, I better have Khadgar put anti-Dream Hacker wards around the place so not Dream-Psycho-Path kills me in my sleep.<br/><br/>I give this move 10 out of 10"
"leplatypus","10","2","3","18 July 2016"," 1428, Elm Street : i thought it was rather 1963 ??? (Cinematheque)
","Just kidding but Elm Street is the iconic place for JFK assassination and maybe its name stayed in the memory of Wes Craven To tell more certain things, i wanted to do this new retrospective about Freddy's movies because they were great moments in my teens and the opportunity to see them on a big screen can't be missed! I don't remind exactly how i discovered them (maybe on VHS tapes or as multiple viewings on the french pay per view channel Canal +) and it's even more blurry to recall exactly the ones i saw then on TV. One thing is for sure is that i got interested in them with the extraordinary Scifi, horror fantasy french magazine « Mad movies » : i bought it from n° 69 (july 1989) to 83 (may 1993) so i have read detailed reports with lavished pictures about Freddy & Star Trek V, VI, Indy III, Batman I, II, Abyss, T2, Total Recall, Robocop II, III, TMNT, Twin peaks, Stephen King, Dracula With all this, it's funny i can't say if i have ever watched this 1st one : i remember some scenes (in the bath, the long arms, the flames) but on the other hand, a lot of characters are black holes, even young Johnny Deep ! This franchise as put by Craven is interesting as it's a sort of crossover between « Halloween », scary teens slasher and « Poltergeist » scary homes twisted by evil forces ! I expected to see also a sort of horrific « BTTF » for living in a small town in the 80s but unlike it, « NOEM » action focused heavily on the houses, bedrooms, cellars and high school so it's difficult to tell about the town of Springwood itself but it's easy to see the nostalgia of those 80s in fashion, objects, cars I can't tell if the story is sometimes lacking but this battle between reality and dreams is really confusing. It's hard to tell what really happens (especially the last scene ??) but in the same time, Craven is really talented to set a stressful pace So this screening was really great for me and i'm thirsty to follow the sequels !!!<br/><br/>NB: and i'm happy to be the 66-7th review and not the dreadful 666th!!!"
"samwellcross","10","2","3","31 August 2015"," My favourite horror film of all time.
","This film is not only the late Wes Craven's best film he has made but it's also my favourite horror film ever. Supposedly based slightly on the story of some tribesman who suffered from the same horrific nightmares but also on an old man that Wes Craven himself found truly terrifying. The concept of this idea is definitely the most original in horror history. The sets are some of the creepiest I have seen and the music adds to the tense atmosphere created by Craven. For me Robert Englund is the only Freddy Krueger and this is also the film that brought Johnny Depp to the worlds attention. I first watched this as a 14 year old teenager and i'm not ashamed to admit that I was petrified from the very first moment. It's a shame that Wes Craven wasn't involved with many of the sequels as his influence was greatly missed in my opinion. Definitely a benchmark for future slasher films and for me the best horror film ever made. BRILLIANT!!!"
"gweez-37769","10","2","3","28 August 2015"," A cool, creative, psychological,slasher film that's part of the big three in modern horror movies especially the slasher films
","This completed the slasher genre with the making of this psychological slasher classic. Wes Craven is a brilliant filmmaker that gave a whole new creativity to the slasher genre. Robert Englund created one of pop culture icons of horror of all time with his brilliant performance as Freddy Kreuger who got his revenge on the parents that burned him alive by going after their prize possessions being that's their children. Charles Bernstein created a classic horror score with that dreamy, sad and creepy theme that fit the film beautifully. I remember seeing this film when I was younger and I felt it had two of the coolest, creative and scariest scenes that you ever seen in a horror film. One is at the beginning when Tina's character rises up from the bed and gets shredded in mid air while also being dragged up the walls and ceiling that was unbelievable and scary as hell then the second scene where Johnny Depp gets sucked in a bed and gets mauled while in the bed with blood everywhere that was pretty wild and creative. Heather Langenkamp I thought played a great heroine and was perfect for this franchise. I loved that scene when she and Johnny Depp was in her bedroom getting ready to pull out Freddy Kreuger and he was to wake her up when the alarm went off but he falls asleep and she is upset with him as she slaps him and says you fell asleep you little sh** was funny as hell. John Saxon was great in this film playing Lt. Thompson the complexity of playing a loving dad trying to help his daughter through a very hard and scary time and trying to find a real perpetrator to arrest for these horrible crimes that were committed. This and Dream Warriors were the best in this franchise along with Freddy vs Jason. I love this film a must see."
"lorainadowd","10","2","3","16 August 2015"," a classic
","A classic in the genre. I've been watching all of Wes Craven's films and this is clearly his best. After seeing stuff like People under the Stairs, and Shocker, this film is clearly in a league of its own. The fact that it's starting to show it's age, only adds to the mystic and charm of the film. The effects are getting old. but that's also charming. It's practical, it's real and it exists rather then someone making it up on their computer. They treated the Freddy character with respect, and keep him as a scary character and not some sort of comic relief with one liners. The reboot didn't work, and the new reboot again will probably fail since it's unlikely to capture the charm of the original i.e. the old vintage film look and the aging special effects :)"

","Sure, this may not be a great topic to bring up, but I just love the character of Fred Krueger. He comes off as one of the best sympathetic villains in film history for me (or well, the best undead one). Michael Myers is too much a mystery for me to understand (I hate the sister theory the series introduced. Personally, I prefer to think he was confused on who Laurie was and figures it was his sister back from the dead), Jason is just Michael on steroids, his mother was a failed villain and Cropsey, though sad, is too mean to be truly appreciated. Freddy though, he has so much going for him! In the TV series Freddy's Nightmares, the first episode shows him as a living human being. He always comes off as being a bit crazy/depressed to me, being a total creep yet still likable. In every movie, he had an amazing body language that just screams that he's cocky, confident and ready to tear up everything in his path.<br/><br/>Maybe it's Robert Englund that I really like here..."
"toll-8","6","2","3","25 April 2012"," A horror fans dream
","Towards the end of the seventies and beginning of the eighties, we were blessed with some great horror films that have become cult classics today. First off there was Halloween, that introduced us to Michael Myers. Secondly was Friday the 13th which gave birth to Jason Voorhees. Next came A Nightmare On Elm Street which unleashed a demon into our dreams in Freddy Kruger. Looking back on this film now, after having Freddy Kruger being a huge horror villain as I grew up, I see that in the very first film he is nothing like he is interpreted today. The sequels seem to have ruined the character slightly as in the first film he is frightening, unpredictable and kept in the dark for most of the film, leaving you anticipating his next move. There are none of the wise cracks that he is resembled with today, and he is nothing like the version we saw in the 2010 remake.<br/><br/>For those who don't know, the film follows a girl called Nancy (Langenkamp) and her group of friends. One by one they begin to have nightmares, each involving the same man, Fred Kruger. This man is heavily scared, wears a hooped red and green jumper, a tatty hat, and has knives for fingers. As the group begin to realise they are dreaming of the same guy one of the girls is killed in her dream by Fred Kruger, which kills her in real life. Shown in a fantastic scene where this poor girl is dragged across the ceiling, blood spilling from her but no other person in sight. Once this girl is killed her boyfriend becomes the main suspect and he has no way to prove his innocence. The only one that believes him is Nancy, who has now started to have these nightmares more frequently, and finds herself attempting to stay awake for days on end in order to avoid her nightmare. Once the truth about Freddy is revealed she devises a way to finally bring a stop to her nightmare and sets up a trap involving her boyfriend (Depp) to finish Kruger once and for all.<br/><br/>What makes this stand out from other horror films of its time is that it explores the notion of dream against reality. At times during the film you are unaware of which reality we are in and this really adds to the visuals of the film, especially when we see Freddy's destruction in reality and he isn't even there. We are also introduced to another horror icon who doesn't remain silent throughout, and walk like a machine hell bent on death. We have a killer insistent on laughing at the poor children he is tormenting, and one that also looks feeble in comparison to other icons. He may not be as scary as Michael Myers but something about Freddy Kruger really sends a shiver down your spine.<br/><br/>Considering the film was made nearly thirty years ago, it is still pretty scary. Scenes that show a blood soaked girl calling out from inside a body bag is chilling, and when she is dragged around the room is incredibly disturbing and one you won't be able to shift from you minds.Other scenes however aren't as scary and can look a little comedic, but I think that is due to the low budget and standard of film making back then. <br/><br/>Robert Englund, who plays Freddy, is brilliant in this film. He brings the character to life and I'm sure would scare children if they watch this film. The make up for him is brilliant and his costume is now very iconic. Langenkamp unfortunately is not great in her role as Nancy, and it is her kind of performance that stereotypes today's horror female leads as poor actors. Her delivery of lines at times is amateurish which makes you struggle to route for her. Really all you want to see when you get into the film is Kruger. Depp is average in his performance, and it is hard to see the Depp of today in his performance here.<br/><br/>The film is full of clichés but you can over look these as horror in the eighties was designed like this. To watch it now you would cringe or roll your eyes at the character decisions to venture into the dark due to a noise, but when this was made that was brand new and wasn't as frowned upon. There are some scenes which are bad though and can't use the excuse of when it was made. One scene Nancy manages to set up a house full of booby traps in ten minutes, which includes setting a sledge hammer up above a door. There would not be enough time to set this up and certainly not if she had to find the items to use as well. Also she lives alone with her mother, what use would they have for a sledge hammer. It is parts like that in movies which is really frustrating. Also the ending disappointed me. I know it was supposed to be a twist but it didn't really make sense with the rest of the film. This ending also shows the worst piece of special effects on show.<br/><br/>All in all I can see why this is a classic. We are introduced to a new villain, and asked to believe in the notion of dreams being real. To look at it now it isn't as good as it would have been thirty years ago, but it is still better than the poor remake. The poor effects of this film really do add to the suspense of it all. Halloween this is not, but an influential horror film it certainly is. <br/><br/>3 / 5<br/><br/>For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com"

Desperately, she tries to stay awake by every means possible, but even pills and massive amounts of coffee wear off sometime and when they do, she'll have to battle Freddy for her very life. It's her worst nightmare...and it's coming true.<br/><br/>I would like to apologize firsthand that I'm around 25 years late in seeing this film because I should have seen it a whole lot sooner, but what can I say? Anyway, ANOES is one of those films that could have been a classic with some other horror films if it were not some producers messing around with the director's true vision. Yes, in fact, producer Robert Shaye made director Wes Craven change the ending for this film (which I will certainly not spoil to you in this review). However, I shouldn't be all that scathing to Mr. Shaye because, after all, he was the one who helped Craven bring this project about and without him, we'd probably not have a franchise nor an iconic villain named Freddy Krueger to this day.<br/><br/>The film has a very low budget and it could be seen throughout the film through the shoddy visual effects. However, I must admit, Craven knows how to use money because some effects in here seemed like a lot of money to be pulled off. What may seem like $20 million to make is, in reality, only $2 million. With that low of a budget, the film surprisingly pulls a lot of things off. The look of Freddy is quite frightening, I must admit, as opposed of his ""cleaned up"" look in the later sequels, with an exception of part 7. The theme is also haunting and very notable to this day.<br/><br/>As for the story itself, it's very genius and original. Who would have ever thought of a guy who can kill people in their dreams? It's fantastic! The film does a great job at confusing the audience with dream and reality, one of the key things that makes the series successful and unique to other slasher films. Heather Langenkamp is the heroine in this film. She pulls off a sympathetic role for the audience to root for. Robert Englund plays the iconic villain, Freddy, and plays it perfectly, giving plenty of witty one-liners and scares, sometimes at the same time!<br/><br/>But where ANOES starts to fall down the hill is when it gets closer to the third act, where everything goes almost berserk and where many inconsistencies start springing up, where dream and reality cross one another. It's quite confusing. However, I got it after another viewing. But the worst part of the film is the ending. It really is that bad, and bumps the film one or two points. The ending ruins the whole point of the film and I can tell why Craven is angry. Oh, well. At least Craven got success out of it. If you're a horror fan, you must see this film because it has a franchise for a reason."

","I came into existence in 1993, exactly 9 years after this movie got released and spooked the dim lights out of many people, including my dad. But now, in the year 2008, when green or brown color blood is no longer seen in films, I didn't find the film so scary as I would have if I was born at that time.<br/><br/>The film did have some spooky and jumpy moments, especially in the climax. But there are number of flaws in the movie that cannot be ignored. <br/><br/>Firstly, as its a low budget film, it looks very outdated and some of the scenes look downright silly. The acting too was a major problem. The main character just couldn't act properly. She was good in a couple of scenes but just couldn't grab my attention. <br/><br/>The other cast members, including Johnny Depp, were just about okay. Freddy was spooky though. I also found Nancy's behavior with her mother rude and irrational as her mother didn't seem so bad to her. The end sequence looked like a Home Alone film. <br/><br/>On the bright side, it still manages to get you hooked due to the clever plot. Some of the scenes were well crafted. The best part was it was just a 1 1/2 hour movie, an ideal time for a horror flick. <br/><br/>I'm going to go with a 6 out of 10 for Nightmare on the Elm Street."

","The best thing about A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET is its originality. When it came out there was nothing else like it. Director, Wes Craven had fashioned a whole new type of slasher movie, w/ a supernatural twist. Like Don Coscarelli before him, Craven overlaps dream and reality to mind-bending effect! The nightmare sequences are actually terrifying, especially one involving Nancy (Heather Langenkamp) and her friend, Tina (Amanda Wyss) at school. Unlike the mindless murderers in other such films, Fred Krueger (Robert Englund) is a sly, haunting specter who stalks his prey in their sleep. He is terrifying, and nothing like the one-liner-spewing comedian he would become in the sequels. Nancy is not the usual female fodder either. She is smart and able to come up w/ ways to fight her nemesis. Co-stars a young Johnny Depp as Nancy's boyfriend, Glen. Easily one of Craven's best efforts..."
"priyankabanerjee-45240","8","1","1","13 April 2020"," A Nightmare on Elm Street
","""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" was written and directed by Wes Craven. The story revolves around several teenagers who are stalked and killed in their dreams by Freddy Krueger. In the early 1980's a psycho named Freddy Krueger murdered several children with a glove outfitted with razor sharp knives. When a witless decision passed by a judge sets him free Freddy Krueger was burned alive in the boiler room where he used to work, by an angry mob of parents whose children he terrorized and murdered. Few years after his death he took revenge with the children whose parents were involved in his murder by stalking them in their dreams and killing them cruelly. The children started experiencing terrifying nightmares of a burned man. Nancy the female lead character realizes she must find ways to stop Freddy Krueger when his spirit kills her best friend Tina viciously in her sleep. She managed to find a way to bring Freddy Krueger from her dreams into reality and sets him up to be killed and defeated the evil spirit. The movie adds to the ""Horror genre"" and sub genre ""Slasher films"" by bringing into light the psychological aspect of horror. The Slasher films center around a killer mercilessly picking and killing victims in brutal manner as Freddy Krueger was killing Nancy Thompson's friends. This genre traditionally include a male antagonist which we have in this film as Freddy Krueger. Slasher Films generally have the last standing character being a female who usually goes on to defeat the killer and in the case of the movie ""The Nightmare on Elm Street"" the lead character is a female who goes by the name ""Nancy Thompson"". The above mentioned points make ""A Nightmare on Elm"" Street as one of the best example of Slasher movie."
"jcslawyer","10","1","1","9 February 2020"," One of my all time faves
","This movie still creeps me out as much as it did when I was a kid. This is just plain and simple a classic horror movie. The story was original, the characters were relatively likable enough that you feel bad for them, and the atmosphere is just creepy. I don't know how, but watching it still makes you feel like you're in a dream. The town was so generic and I think that not having the familiarity of a big name town makes one feel lost or uncomfortable. There's this quiet discomfort that you feel from the moment the movie starts. Sure, the ending-ending is schlocky as all get out, but I can forgive based on the rest that preceded it.<br/><br/>Freddy Kreuger is a legendary villain, slasher, and character. Pure evil and terrifying. Although his ""character"" cheesed out in later entries, you can still watch this and remember just how nee and fresh that kind of character was. He's not the guy under the bed, outside the window, or in the closet. He's in your dreams. Something you can't avoid since your body will eventually give way to slumber. Then you're on his turf and he can manipulate it however he sees fit. You don't get any scarier than not being in control of something that's happening in your mind.<br/><br/>I could go on for days about this. It's one of my fave horror movies. I'm not jumping on a bandwagon of nostalgia either. I've been watching these since I was a kid. I just recently got around to signing up for imdb so I can rate and review.<br/><br/>If you need an introduction to the horror genre, this should be high on your list....though not necessarily your first as you may not want to keep going!! Jk, but seriously."
"dormesher-21565","9","1","1","19 January 2020"," ""Come To Freddy""....... Classic
","A Nightmare on Elm Street. A classic horror and the first installment in my favourite horror franchise and definitely one of the greatest characters ever put on screen Freddy Kreuger.<br/><br/>This film is just a classic and still holds up today yeah there are some dated effects but it still holds up with the story and spooky tention it creates.
The kills are incredible and very creative especially the one with Tina such a first great kill.
The characters are also amazing Nancy is still my favourite final girl and the cast do a great job.<br/><br/>Freddy Kreuger is one awesome character and Robert Englund plays him perfectly and his performance still holds up and remains iconic. The look of Freddy is still iconic and still gives me shivers.<br/><br/>The music in this film is also iconic and sets the sage for the movie and really adds to the creep factor of the movie the one two Freddy's coming for you is really creepy and is used brilliantly in the film.<br/><br/>The only thing that I don't like about this I one is the ending its such an odd ending for a near perfect movie and doesn't really make sense and the effects in that scene are not good at all it doesn't ruin the movie just an odd ending. The scenes with Nancy turning her back on the evil and removing his power thats awesome its the bit after that I don't like with the mother being dragged through the door it doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>But I love this film its an absolute classic despite the odd ending my favourite moment in the movie is definitely the Tina kill its so creepy and weird her being killed but not seeing what's killing her is a genius move and leaves to the viewers imagination and i like that.<br/><br/>The character of Freddy has always been one of my favourites in movies and in this he doesn't dissapoint he's really dark and spooky and his back story is awesome just one awesome character.<br/><br/>Verdict 9.4/10 classic horror movie that still holds up and has some fantastic kills and a great introduction to Freddy Kreuger the ending is a little odd with the mother but it dosent ruin movie. Great characters and fantastic story make this a Horror classic for all fans."

","Wes Craven's A Nightmare On Elm Street has become one of the most famous and scariest franchises in all of horror, mainly thanks to the pop culture icon, Freddy Krueger. Freddy Krueger has become one of the most recognisable figures in all of pop culture and he's the burned, sadistic, slasher in this movie, wielding his iconic razor fingers and haunting teenagers in their dreams. A Nightmare On Elm Street was the first film in the long running franchise and follows a young group of teens, who are being troubled in their dreams by a scarred man, with razor fingers, the teens include Heather Langenkamp as the main survivor, Nancy Thompson and a young Johnny Depp playing Glen, Nancy's boyfriend. Nobody believes the teenagers so it's up to them to find a way to stop Freddy Krueger before he kills them all. For an 80s movie, it still holds up to this day the effects look more real than any horror movie today, the cinematography is well executed and the movie overall gives off an eerie feeling, just waiting for the main attraction to pop up on screen again. The acting is good although there are at times parts where you can see the young actors smirking but that's nitpicking and isn't that much of importance. The main star of the movie is Freddy Krueger played to perfection by Robert Englund who defined the character, his movements, sounds etc. And the movie's soundtrack is great at setting that eerie feeling and sound cues let you know when Freddy is near. A Nightmare On Elm Street is one of the greatest horror movies of all time and will leave you unsettled after watching, it is a genre-defining classic and anyone who has not seen it I would encourage you to. Although the series went downhill as time went on, this is the one movie that you can watch and be guaranteed to be creeped out over and over again. 8/10"

"hellraiser7","10","1","1","19 December 2018"," Dream Demon
","This is one of my favorite films of all time and it's my favorite film from one of my favorite horror directors the late great Wes Craven. This film wasn't just another horror movie, but it was a phenomenon and another one of the longest running franchises in horror, and most importantly established another iconic character in the genre.<br/><br/>There is so much to love about the film, the effects are great, not just from the gore effects, ok the film's not that gory which is probably a good think but there are some good blood effects all the same, and has some creative kills and not just mere slashing. My favorite and scary one to me was of course the infamous bed death, I'll admit seeing that the first time I really didn't want to go to sleep on my bed for a long while. But I really love how the dream sequences are handled, I really love how it messes with your senses, at first your able to tell from the reality realm and the dream realm but soon when we get further in the film the line begins to blur and you question if the protagonists are still dreaming or in reality.<br/><br/>I really like the story line which is great as it's of course inspired and based on a medical phenomenon on people dying in their dreams. This I think was a very creative idea for the Slasher genre in using the realm of dreams as an arena of terror. In the normal slasher film, you usually can run and hide from the monster/killer. In this film the slasher is attacking us in the most vulnerable place of our human psyche; this is scary because here we can't see the monster in the realm of reality let alone the know scientific fact that sooner or later, we all must go to sleep. In the realm of dreams, you have limited control because when we dream, we sometimes are unable to tell from reality and fantasy as both seem to blur, let alone command our bodies at will to awaken when we want to, as when we sleep our bodies run on their own biological alarm clock.<br/><br/>Fready Kruger is one of my favorite fictional villains of all time, played brilliantly by one of my favorite horror actor's Robert England. Really like the look of him which is sort of a burnt facial look, the strange red and black striped sweater, that hat that sort of make him look like an evil supernatural bandit which he is. This guy was just scary on all different facets, heck scared me even when I wasn't old enough to watch the films from the posters and the numerous ads on him. This film is more the dark Fready as he is menacing from that voice and some of those memorable lines, he's kind of funny but since he's dark Fready he has very little humor. He of course has his trademark weapon that razored glove, which is such a deadly and nasty weapon, just one look at it hurt me thinking about the amount of bodily damage it can do.<br/><br/>However, to me it wasn't so much that razor fingered glove I feared but the fact he has the power to manipulate and bend the world of dreams with his mind. That can be scary because it shakes your perception on reality and fantasy, which makes you have zero control of the circumstances your in. So, if you ever get trapped in the dream realm with him your as good as fraked.<br/><br/>Other than Fready what also really makes the film is the lead protagonist herself whom to me is one of my favorite horror protagonists of all time. Heather Langencamp whom is an actress I like that is underrated. Personally, I mainly knew about her from watching the 80's sitcom ""Just the Ten of Us"" really liked her character in that show and seeing her in this film was a bit surreal at the time because I saw that sitcom as a kid, this film I never saw until I was an adolescent. But anyway, I really like her, had a bit of a crush on her as she is just sexy and kind of hot with persona to boot.<br/><br/>Nancy is likeable and sympathetic as she like any other typical teenager that likes to be sociable with her friends and boyfriend whom are also likeable characters in their own way which makes what happens to them heart sinking, but also a prime motivator for Nancy to win. Of course, you know Nancy's boyfriend is played by Johnny Depp and this was his debut, which I'll say is one hell of a start but a lot of actors have had their start in horror films. However, he's solid as Nancy's significant other, I like that he does what any good boyfriend should do which is to support their girlfriend no matter what; let alone actually believe her because from certain things happening he know certain things the rational world dictates don't add up.<br/><br/>One of the things I like about her is how highly intelligent she is, she's kind of a tactician really love that sequence near the end where she is reading this book on Booby Traps (I'd love to buy that book) and is setting up traps for a very clever plan that could make Doctor Who jealous. Seeing this sequence makes me wonder if this film might have been a partial inspiration for the final conformation sequence in ""Home Alone"".<br/><br/>But other than your cat and mouse thriller, this film does have deep substance, as it's somewhat of a coming of age tale. Which makes sense as teenagers are people that are on the verge of adulthood and all are taking steps toward it, despite not knowing the dangers that world can contain. Nancy very much is the adult in the film as we see her not just learning to defend and fight against Fready but also taking charge of her own life in the process.<br/><br/>We see that most of the adults that she placed her trust in can't be trusted as most seem to have the pathetic mentality of knowing what's best for the other, we see them do some stupid things to put Nancy and company in more danger. From Nancy mom baring the house or even Glen's dad putting the phone off the hook despite the fact Nancy's calling to save his son's life, yeah real smart guys you ought to move to ""South Park"" you'll fit right in. But things like that give the film a bit of an isolated feeling, but also shows what part of being an adult is about which is you can count on no one but yourself, as Han Solo once put it ""I take orders from one person, me!"" that exactly the person Nancy is taking orders from and who we all should take orders from ourselves.<br/><br/>But also, another message about facing your fears, Fready may seem powerful but the power he is displaying toward each of his intended victims are illusions, he feeds of their fear and is really using that to kill them, because they believe in it so much it becomes real. It's only when we take control and start to realize the truth, that the fear we're being subjected to doesn't really exist, once we do that it has no power over us.<br/><br/>Even if you escape death, it's never far from your dreams.<br/><br/>Rating: 4 stars"
"paulclaassen","9","1","1","2 July 2018"," The perfect horror! What a classic!
","Thanks to Wes Craven's vision of the ultimate villain, he created one of the greatest horror films ever. Robert England portrayed antagonist Freddy Krueger so convincingly that this menacing character was bound to give us nightmares for years to come. In a time before CGI was so commonly used, the visual and special effects were incredible, perfectly conveying the nightmare world of the victims.

"joshuadrake-39480","9","1","1","27 April 2015"," Great first chapter in the Elm Street series!
","The original 1984 A Nightmare on Elm Street is more than just your average ordinary scary movie. It's a scary movie that influenced other scary movies such as The Ring, The Grudge, Saw, Hostel and Paranormal Activity and it is the reason why we have Freddy Krueger, one of the most iconic horror villains on the screen.<br/><br/>The original 1984 classic is written and directed by Wes Craven and was released on November 9, 1984 and it's distributor, New Line Cinema from going bankrupt and spawn a multi-media franchise, including eight sequels, a 2010 reboot of the same name, produced by Michael Bay and starring Jackie Earle Haley as Freddy Krueger, video games, comic books, a TV show and a crossover between the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise and Friday the 13th franchise, which was titled Freddy vs. Jason, and released in 2003. <br/><br/>The plot deals with a killer named Freddy Kreuger attacking Nancy Thompson and her friends in their dreams, successfully killing all but Nancy, in fictional Springwood, Ohio. Krueger's back-story is revealed by Nancy's mother, Marge, who explains that he was a child murderer. <br/><br/>The parents of Springwood killed Kreuger after he was acquitted on a technically. Nancy defeats Freddy by pulling him out of the dream world and stripping him of his powers when she stops being afraid of him.<br/><br/>The original Nightmare on Elm Street is a classic for me because at the time I was growing up, I really did not know what a scary movie was until I got my first taste in 2003 when I saw ""Freddy vs. Jason"" and that's when I started to like scary movies.<br/><br/>Robert Englund plays the role of Freddy Krueger and he would remain in that part for all eight original Nightmare on Elm Steet films, but would soon be played by Jackie Earle Haley in the 2010 version. Now, I can't say which actor is better as Freddy Krueger because I like both of them. I know my sister LeeAnn is going to curse me out for saying this, but I'm gonna say it anyway. I actually prefer both actors playing Freddy Krueger. Sure, Jackie Earle Haley may not have the comedic stuff like Robert Englund, but he does do one thing right: play the part of Krueger in a scary way, much like Englund does in the original 1984 film and it's sequels. Heather Langenkamp plays Nancy Thompson and she would play the part of Nancy again in ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors"" and she would also play herself and Nancy in ""Wes Craven's New Nightmare"". Johnny Depp plays Glen in the first film of his career and a lot of people said that this is his worst performance, but I actually like him in the first Freddy Krueger film. Jsu Garcia and Amanda Wyss plays Tina and Rod and they are good in the time they have on screen. John Saxon plays Lt. Don Thompson and he is just amazing. <br/><br/>The music composed by Charles Bernstein is amazing and really amazing and I really liked the musical score. The movie's tension and suspense builds up to each nightmare in the film. My favorite nightmare is when Nancy is in the bathtub and Freddy's claw comes out of the water and tries to kill her, but she drowns and she eventually gets out.<br/><br/>The visuals were impressive for 1984 and they are just as incredible now as they were back then. The editing and dialogue is memorable as heck and this movie is really cool and impressive.<br/><br/>The style and tone of this movie is really dark and serious and it is very good for this kind of scary movie. The sequels were also cool and amazing, but the only one I had mixed feelings about is the fifth film, ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child"". But, I will get to that in a later review. <br/><br/>Overall, the original 1984 version of A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET is really well directed, well-written, darn good acted and has a great musical theme that tells you that Freddy Kreuger is coming for you. The movie is gory in some scenes, but it has a purpose for being in the movie, which I like and I have no problem re-watching the Nightmare on Elm Street film franchise over and over again, especially the 1984 film, the 2010 remake and the 2003 crossover with Friday the 13th. The music by Charles Bernstein is really amazing and it is very dark and sinister and it is really cool to hear the Freddy Krueger theme. The film is definitely getting the best possible rating I can give it and that is a 9 out of 10."

"maxastree","7","1","1","11 January 2015"," Classic horror title, more of an 80s teen fantasy movie.
","A Nightmare on Elm Street was created by Wes Craven, an English lit professor, who probably got the project green-lit because its so teen orientated, and plays on the idea of dream-reality invading our waking life in such an original way.<br/><br/>The movie starts with an excellent plot conceit, local bad-boy (played by Johnny Depp) is accused of a crime he didn't commit. The real culprit? A scarred, cackling ghost, formerly a school caretaker that was burnt alive by vengeful Elm Street parents for abusing children.<br/><br/>A Nightmare on Elm Street has a sense of purpose, context, and layered story elements the other films in this series lack, and that said, the movie is also the only ""Nightmare"" film created by Wes Craven for the whole decade of numerically staggering hack-n-slash sequels. (Seven? Eight? Nine???) The decision to build this movies character into a ""franchise"" is actually a symptom of how 80s cinema was overly commercial and a tad mindless compared to the 70s classics that film geeks and reviewers still laud today as quality cinema.<br/><br/>That aside, the movie does have a sense of dread and insularity as the teens of Elm Street realize that they're trapped in a supernatural pact against the evil spirit of Freddy Krueger, and the special effects are pretty cool. The prosthetics, Jacques Haitkins cinematography and the pulsing 80s synthesizer score all became standard tropes for 80s big-league horror and its various low budget imitators where you gets stabbed in the eyeball by a guy in a hockey mask coming out of a closet in the dark etc. Bam!!! You got stabbed!! Ouch!!! EwwwwÂ….fake blood.<br/><br/>Personally, I'd rate the film as a '6', but upped it a notch because of the excellent title!! Also, creature design effects for Freddy Krueger are some of the most iconic in horror history, that said most of the other releases in the series are just VFX vehicles with anonymous teens getting sliced and ""nightmare-ified"". Worth seeing, but would have been better off as a single movie."
"OllieSuave-007","6","1","1","17 June 2014"," Dreamy horror flick.
","This is the horror flick that will give you nightmares, about a group of friends living on Elm Street trying to stop the evil spirit of Freddy Krueger, a clawed killer who stalks young victims in their dreams.<br/><br/>Like the horror flicks of the late 1970s to the 1980s, this film is one of the first original slasher movies of its kind and holds well on its own, spawning a set of sequels and remakes. It has some very creepy and scary moments that will jump out at you and will make you cover your eyes.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty basic, though, with lots of people hiding, slashing and screaming - not much substance to the story. The acting was mostly campy with cheesy dialog, but it was cool seeing Johnny Depp in his movie debut. The overall atmosphere and cinematography of the film have this lazy, dreamy and emotionless feeling, probably wanting to give the audience the impression of a dream; however, and I think it gives the film a lackluster and somewhat boring feel.<br/><br/>You will get some good scares out of the film, but the plot somewhat goes all over the place, living you a bit confused in the story at first. <br/><br/>Grade C"

","The film starts out on the footsteps of a man gathering tools and building some kind of glove. <br/><br/>Tina Grey has a nightmare and awakens with slashes similar to the glove of someone in the dream, but she dismisses this and her conversations with her friends the next day (who had similar dreams). That night, Tina's parents are out of town and she and her friends have a small party where they once again share their dreams and how similar they were. That night Tina is killed in her dream and for real, but her boyfriend Rod is accused because he was the only one present. Rod is eventually arrested and strangled in prison, again in his dreams and reality. Eventually Glen dies too, but Nancy is able to defeat Freddy by pulling him into reality and using booby traps around the house and saying she isn't afraid of him.<br/><br/>In a lot of ways this movie is very cheap, but it's effect on my youth and mass culture is hard to deny. Between Freud and this movie, I don't think conversations of dreams on the bus would have been so popular without it. <br/><br/>There are a lot of good, frightening scenes in the nightmares. I think they do a good job with the industrial imagery. It's a little bland for my modern special FX taste, but I enjoyed the 80s touch. <br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend this unless your a horror fan, in which case it's quite good."

","Every now and then, Cineworld bring an old classic back to the big screen. Sometimes randomly and sometimes in relevance to the season. Last year's Halloween one day special was ""The Shining"" (which, to my dissatisfaction i missed :'( ) and this year round it was A Nightmare on Elm Street. <br/><br/>I had already seen the film years ago, but was eagerly awaiting seeing it on the big screen and hearing the iconic Nightmare theme on the big speakers. I mean what can be said about good old Fred Kreuger; along with Micheal Myers and Jason Vorhees, those three where the absolute benchmark of deranged killers in the 80's and although their psychotic stature has been unfortunately tampered with -....Freddy vs Jason.....- and rehashed, the term they don't make them like they used to couldn't be more accurate. <br/><br/>What separates this from other horrors is that in some ways it doesn't take itself too seriously; there are several parts -whether it be a one liner or an over exaggeration- which are funny. It's part of it's charm as a horror. And instead of a typical dark and ominous soundtrack when killer meets victim; you are met with an unfamiliar techno beat. But what is spectacular is the plot, the story, the idea behind it is ...well genius. You either suffer trying to stay awake forever or come face to face with a knife wielding lunatic. It's dilemma at it's most desperate. <br/><br/>Although i have a lot of praise for the film, the acting can get on your nerves; mainly from Nancy (the main character), but despite that it is without a doubt one of the most iconic horrors of past and will continue to be. <br/><br/>7/10"

","""One, two Freddy's coming for you"" he surely is in this terrifying tale directed by famed horror director Wes Craven. Teenagers having nightmares isn't too uncommon due to trauma or just a rough night's sleep, but when a group of teens dream about a serial killer...then you have a problem. Heading the group of frightened teens is the courageous Nancy Thompson (played powerfully by Heather Langenkamp). Starring in a supporting role as Nancy's boyfriend, Glen Lantz which propelled him to stardom, was a young Johnny Depp. In the terrifying role as the murderous Freddy Krueger was Robert Englund who later starred in several other horror films such as ""Urban Legend."" The scariest moments in the film are the deaths of Tina Grey (Amanda Wyss), Nancy's best friend, and Glen (Depp himself in his most notable scene of the film). The rest of the film is more composed of cheap scares as Englund's Krueger stalks the teens one by one and kills them in gruesome fashions. But the film is still the last of the great horror classics before the horror genre went down (until ""Scream"" in 1996)."

This is very unfair for me to criticize it for this, but the effects are horrid and the blood is red paint. It was the 80's though. OK film if you want a classic horror film, but not scary and really pretty boring. Watch it if you want but know that it is slightly slow. Although scarier than old Frankenstein films, doesn't compare to the fear factor of some modern-day movies (The Strangers, etc.).

"Red-Barracuda","7","1","1","24 March 2012"," A new and original approach to the slasher film
","It's quite hard separating A Nightmare on Elm Street from the franchise it spawned. Freddie Krueger became one of the icons of the 80's. Because of this he became completely unscary. You can't really blame the first film for this development however. What director Wes Craven did here I guess was to reimagine the possibilities of the slasher film. On the back of first Halloween and subsequently Friday the 13th, there was a bucket load of these types of movies released in the early 80's. It wasn't the most diverse genre either, and by 1984 it had more or less run its course; Craven's film took the basic idea of this sub-genre but expanded with a much more original approach. Out was the faceless killer who stalked a group of dumb half-naked teenagers and instead we had a weird supernatural villain who attacked his victims via their dreams. This was a much more original idea for a slasher film. It still had murder set-pieces but these ones involved people being dragged over ceilings and fountains of blood erupting out of beds. The surreal and dream-like moments are ultimately what make A Nightmare on Elm Street an interesting movie. Another unusual aspect is the teens themselves. They're actually sympathetic and not merely there to be killed in a state of undress. I'm not saying there is anything wrong with the more typical sleazy approach but it is notable and commendable that Craven chose to do things a different way for a change. It's not a perfect film by any means though and there are some cheesy moments. For example the scenes near the end where the heroine constructs home-made traps to snare Freddie in were dangerously close to MacGyver territory. But overall, it's an interesting movie in places."

"MovieCritic33-6","9","1","1","3 May 2010"," A great movie overall, with only one complaint...
","Wes Craven's ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" is undoubtedly a classic for the horror genre that will haunt the minds of its audience members for a long time.<br/><br/>Although it may not haunt the minds of many viewers today, back in 1984 this movie scared a lot of its viewing audience. Today many of us look at horror movies from that decade as ""cheesy"", over analyzing technical elements, the acting, and the plot. Most of us still over analyze films to this day, but keep in mind that this is only a movie, whose main purpose is to entertain its audience. Which I believe Wes Craven's film achieves its purpose.<br/><br/>The film overall was great with a clever concept and a simple, but eerie storyline. I had no problem with the acting in this film, or the dialogue which to me came across as passable to very believable.<br/><br/>I felt that John Saxon (Lt. Thompson), Heather Langenkamp (Nancy Thompson), Amanda Wyss (Tina Gray), and Johnny Depp (Glen Lantz)all delivered solid and convincing performances. Jsu Garcia (Rod Lane) delivered a mediocre to a little above mediocre performance in my opinion, lacking emotional depth and intensity in some scenes. Although with all due respect to Jsu Garcia, he didn't have a lot of scene time to develop his character and make him more three dimensional. Ronee Blakley (Marge Thompson) was convincing in her role as the over protective and overbearing, alcoholic, smoke inducing mother who made me chuckle a couple of times. The rest of the supporting cast does a good job with what they are given.<br/><br/>As far as special effects and stunts go, sure there are a few goof ups where you can clearly notice what isn't meant to be noticed by viewers, but to me the effect is still there.<br/><br/>I thought the climax was great and escalated nicely from the beginning of the film right up until the end. My only complaint with this film is the final scene of this film, which is entirely left ambiguous, only for sequels to try and explain what happened after.<br/><br/>Unfortunately Wes Craven's original ending was scrapped because it wasn't deemed fit for the film. The original ending would also have made it hard for a sequel to come into play...even though Wes Craven had a concept for a sequel which was rejected and was later used for the storyline of Wes Craven's ""New Nightmare"". Although the ending might have been a huge let down for some audience members, as the director would have chosen the ""it was all just a dream"" technique, to me it would have been far more superior and would have been looked at as more than just a horror movie. Mainly because the concept of someone creating a ""monster"" in their own dream is clever, and the idea that she has to conquer the ""monster"" that she created in order for her to wake up from her dream is also an interesting concept. Also, having the car simply driving away with the children skipping to the jump rope song would have been highly effective, because it would have been more of a statement stating that although you may have overcome this bad dream, it is only a matter of time before you have your next nightmare, and that you will never be able to actually get rid of bad dreams. To me this is a lot creepier then the ending they decided to go with.<br/><br/>On another note Nancy's final dialogue with ""Freddy"" makes no sense to the scene that follows, which is why it is entirely left up to the audience to decide whether it is just another one of Nancy's dreams, or her mother's dream. Either way the film finished on a weaker note because of it.<br/><br/>Even though the ending is entirely ambiguous, and somewhat confusing, I feel that if they had gone with the original ending people would still have been scratching their heads as Nancy would have had so many ""dream within a dream"" sequences. Therefore in the end result it doesn't really matter because someone will still be scratching their head by the end credits.<br/><br/>Overall Wes Craven's ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" is a great horror movie that should be regarded as mindless entertainment, sure to haunt your memories and give you nightmares for years to come. But if not the film itself, the music score will be sure get under your skin.<br/><br/>****1/2 Stars Out Of *****"

The story line in this film is very original though, because the idea of your nightmares affecting you in the real world was unexplored before this film. The effects in this film also show that people were far easier to please in the twentieth century than now. The horror scenes in the movie are mostly impossible, especially the part where Johnny Depp dies and like a fountain of blood comes out of him.

","Because of my mentality, I was the one who stood in line for hours, waiting for the movie doors to open and when the movie was done, my friends and I actually pulled an all-nighter, and since then I was always fond of this movie. The reason being it's a ghost story but it has a little twist. Essentially its about a kiddy killer/pedophile who was burned alive by a lynch mob and returns as a ghost and kills young girls in there dreams, however he chooses Nancy Thompson as his next victim, which proves to be a mistake. Here is a movie that revived and twisted the slasher genre, and gave it an infamous face and name.<br/><br/>Rather than, haunting in real life, why not haunt in somebody's dream. Some scenes were pretty frightening (i.e. the backyard scene, bedroom scene and the boiler room scenes.) and some were disturbing, but just the concept of a killer pedophile stalking a teenage girl in her dreams is disturbing enough. Way to go Craven.<br/><br/>The emotions played by Heather Langenkamp, and a first timer for Johnny Depp, not to mention Robert Englund were outstanding. The great thing about this movie is that unlike other killers, where you can shoot or decapitate, Freddy doesn't die, and how do avoid someone who kills when you are asleep. Nobody cannon not sleep forever. That's what gave me the chills, and it still does. I wish I could tell you how much I love this movie but I would like to keep this review as short and to the point as possible.<br/><br/>Freddy has become such an iconic character, as well as any street named Elm Street and in summation, this movie is a must for any horror movie watcher beginner, even though it is still light horror compared to movies nowadays, it still gets you no matter how many times you watch it. I LOVED IT!"

","1996's Scream may be a slightly more improved film than this but there is no doubt the cultural impact Wes Craven's original slasher film had on the public in 1984. Not only did he create one of the most memorable horror characters of all time but he introduced the world to a certain young actor named Johnny Depp. The murder scenes are fantastically well put together, showing the director's vision of how a horror film should be, tongue in cheek.<br/><br/>A Nightmare on Elm Street is no comedy though, some scenes are genuinely scary such as Robert Englund's arms stretching to inhuman lengths and the blending of Johnny Depp. The only drawback is the ending which tries to be something of a Carrie but doesn't pay off, unfortunately none of the sequels were even close to the brilliance of the original.<br/><br/>Verdict: One of the best b-movies of the 80's and an iconic horror film that showed the workings of a true genius."

","Wes Craven has made four films which have redefined the genre -- they are ""Last House on The Left"", ""The Hills Have Eyes"", ""Scream"" and ""A Nightmae On Elm Street"".<br/><br/>The grimy prologue of this influential shocker establishes Freddy as he constructs the glove he will use to murder and maim. Charles Bernstein's minimalist score provides a chilling, almost nauseating backdrop to proceedings.<br/><br/>As in the first ""Friday The 13th"", this film's villain may be the product of a deranged mind. A lurker in the subconscious, he exacts a gruesome revenge on those he holds responsible for his mutilated state.<br/><br/>The film, like Craven's best works (up to the excellent ""Red Eye"") is tightly constructed and filled with thought-provoking concepts. The use of signature sound effects such as Freddy's metal fingernails is a key to its success and subsequent injection into popular culture.<br/><br/>Actor Robert Englund, who had appeared in films for Tobe Hooper (""Eaten Alive"") and Gary Sherman (""Dead and Buried"") before this, is perfectly cast as Freddy and brings a twisted, sardonic humour to the role.<br/><br/>Certainly a watershed for horror, the film's sequels, unfortunately, manifested no understanding of what made this so effective and served up surreal special effects showcases instead."

","I was still young when I watched this movie for the first time, probably too young in my opinion. This is without a doubt the scariest idea any movie director as ever come up with, and all due to a great crew and cast, such as the great Wes, or the ever supporting Robert Shaye. It is such a great idea, mostly because of the psychological effect it tends to have on people. It is when we are unguarded and helpless (like in a dream) that we feel most desperate and we can feel the true nature of fear. A note to the cast of course, with such great actors like Robert Englund (they couldn't have chosen a better Freddy), the debut of Johnny Depp or even the under rated Heather Langenkamp.

","Now that I just bought the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" DVD collection, I watched the original ""Nightmare"" again just to refresh my memory about the film.  A couple years ago I rented the movie on video and submitted my comments.  I felt it was a good movie, but I wasn't raving about it.  Maybe I wasn't in such a good mood that day.  <br/><br/>First of all, the transfer from video to DVD looks wonderful.  If you watch it on video, the reception is grainy and you can determine how old it is by its picture quality alone.  <br/><br/>As I've mentioned in previous reviews, I don't get scared easily, so I'm not going to give this a negative review just because I wasn't leaping out of my seat.  However I was creeped out a few times.  Hell, even after seeing Freddy Krueger's face a million times, I'm still creeped out by the dude. And nobody--I mean--nobody could've played the role better than Robert Englund.  For some reason I regarded the acting as cheesy the first time around.  OK, so the acting isn't extraordinary, but it's good, especially for a horror film.  And I've learned to appreciate Heather Langenkamp more and more as a scream queen.  It is amusing to see Johnny Depp, who didn't possess the same star power or talent he does today.  <br/><br/>Perhaps I was too hard on the film, and I'd regard ""Nightmare"" as at least a minor classic.  After all, Freddy is a supreme horror villain!  And I forgot to mention the film's nifty premise.  I'm fascinated by psychology, especially the subject of the unconscious mind.  It's a very perplexing element, because nobody really has control over their unconscious minds, so nobody has any control over what happens in their dreams.  So what happens if those dreams, or nightmares I should say, become a reality?  Kudos to Wes Craven for an inspired and original effort.  <br/><br/>My score:  8 (out of 10)"

","I grew up with ""A Nightmare on Elm Street."" It was one of the defining themes of my childhood; Freddy Kreuger's iconic face and finger knives were part of the cultural fabric of the eighties. Freddy was like a demon in the media, haunting our collective consciousness just like he is supposed to have done in the film. I was terrified of him; I probably would not have been if I had ever actually seen the movie. <br/><br/>You see, my mother had seen it; and, while she considered it a good film she declared it simply too scary for me to watch and so, for many years, I sat on the sidelines as all of my friends came back with their survival stories (This was Britain, where an 18 rating MEANS 18, so unless you had permissive parents who didn't care what you watched on video, you didn't see horror films under age)and I concocted Francis-Baconesque visions of the film in my mind; gothic dreams that came from the darkest depths of my soul.<br/><br/>
Well, illusion can trump reality at the best of times, but never was it more so than with this film. It was not scary in the slightest; it had a completely ludicrous plot (If Freddy is supposed to be killing children in their dreams, than how is he moving ropes or turning beds into blenders in the real world?), and a suprisingly incompetent villain (a supposedly omnipotent nightmare-master who does little more with his power than jump out behind trees and yell ""Boo!""). I know that later sequels did more with better special effects, and created more realistic death scenarios, but this film remains a severe dissapointment. Perhaps the only Freddy-inspired creation I saw that dealt with the concept sucessfully was, oddly, the ""Simpsons"" parody"

I'm going to own up and confess that I only watched half the film; but that was enough for me to render it completely awful. I didn't have a speckle if interest in what the ending was, let alone what would happen in the second half of the film. This is furthermore worsened by excruciatingly bad acting. Action so disgraceful I remember putting up a better performance in my Primary School JungleBook Play.<br/><br/>Then arrives the main purpose and genre of the film. Horror? Horror my ass. I would flag this film as comical more than scary. The only I can remember that induced the genuine feeling of suspense and horror was the bath tub scene, with the finger nails slowly floating upwards. Apart from that, there are merely scenes of screams and the terribly UN-horrific laughter of this strongly wrinkled cowboy mad guy with knives attached to his fingers.<br/><br/>This film is pathetic at best. I would suggest strongly against wasting what could be such valuable time. Decide wisely and watch real ""horror"" like The Exorcist, The Omen and The Mist instead."

","Nightmare was my favorite horror movie growing up.  It used to give me my own nightmares after late night viewings.  I recently watched Nightmare again and was completely disappointed.  I was never scared in the least, the F/X were prehistoric, and the acting was atrocious.  Heather Langenkamp, though young at the time, is horrible.  Her mother in the flick is even worse.  Johnny Depp is also quite poor in this movie, though I liked him in Gilbert Grape and Ed Wood.  There is definitely no hint in Nightmare of his potential.<br/><br/>I give this flick a 3/10.  It is watchable and is not laughable as some horror films can be.  That being said, it is not very good.  It is clearly not in the same league as Halloween.  It isn't even as good as Craven's more recent offerings.  It's on a par with the Friday the 13th movies and that is not a complement.  Watch Nightmare only if you are desperate."

","What can I say really about Nightmare on Elm Street. It has been said that it is a horror classic, Freddy Kreuger is iconic and it is an all round great film. I have to say, I agree. Is it a perfect movie? Not quite, the characters are not that well developed, but actually with everything else done so well that is a small gremlin. The film is shot in a non-cheap and atmospheric way with good editing and lighting that is never too dark or dim. The music also helps to enhance the mood without being too obvious, the script is smart, the story is compelling but what Nightmare on Elm Street really succeeds in doing is how it incorporates its scares. There is gore, but it is not used in a cheap and excessive way, and there are some genuinely suspenseful touches. The ending is surprising and very shocking. The acting is good, this is all about Nancy and she is very believably played. Johnny Depp went on to do better things but he's also fine. I'll remember Nightmare on Elm Street though for the terrifying performance of Robert Englund, Kreuger is now an iconic villain and after you see how Englund interprets him you would say justifiably so. And Wes Craven directs efficiently. Overall, the first of the series and the best and most iconic of the series. The sequels were mixed with a lot of gore and silliness and not much heart and suspense and the remake is not worth bothering with. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"lynnblake1108","1","5","15","20 June 2011"," Terribly Boring and Simply Atrocious
","This movie was one of my least favorites thus far. Not only was acting poor, and special effects laughable, but overall, film was pretty atrocious. The universal concept that our dreams can haunt (and in Nancy's case, harm) us itself is fantastic. However, the delivery is less than acceptable.<br/><br/>The first fifteen minutes were the scariest, simply due to chaos, confusion, and the setting. After that, it becomes more comedic than anything else. I will admit that while the movie itself was less than frightening, its after-taste is simply creepy. I mean, the fact is that this girl was being hunted out of revenge, and her every move is stalked by this shadow of a man.<br/><br/>I have plenty of qualms with the movie, but the following is definitely number one. I've yet to see the remake, the prequel, or the sequel, so I'm just wondering who Freddy is. I don't think that it's enough to say; ""Oh, Fred Krueger was a child murderer so we 'offed' him."" No. There are plenty of scumbags in every neighborhood who deserve death time and time again, but we, ordinary citizens almost never intervene. Did Freddy commit an atrocity that hit close to home? It also wasn't very clear when Freddy was actually murdered. Yes, Nancy's mother was involved in the killing along with some other renegades, but how much time has passed? Were they themselves children, or was this some sort of PTA rally? Either way, it's these crucial details that make the story actually come to life. Without them, I honestly have a difficult time focusing, so this movie distracted me in that sense.<br/><br/>Now, onto the special effects; honestly, they weren't nearly as terrible as I had planned. While none of them were realistic by any means, they were this surreal kind of creepy that I thought was done very well. I'm actually curious about the geyser of blood. How did they create such an optical illusion? I mean, maybe they had a blender-esque machine forcibly shooting the gunk into the air, but I just don't know. I thought that special effect was really well done. Then again, I've been known to watch television shows from the sixties, so my perspective is a little different than the average teenage kid.<br/><br/>All in all, I will not waste money or time on the sequels."

","alright, I'm not going to speak about ""gore"" or ""thrill"" i'm just going to talk about the fact that this film is not actually a horror film, but it could have been the best horror film ever done. First of all, being directed by Wes Craven was not the best thing that could have happened to this movie, in fact, it's one of the week points it has. He had the main idea, which was awesome, but the rest sucks. The performances were hideous, and the low budget effects too, i think the only good thing that this movie has is the Robert Englund appearance. But is still a classic, and if I had seen this movie in the time it was released, I'm sure I'd have been scared, and it did gave me the creeps, but not when I was seeing the movie, it was after everything had finished, when I had to go to sleep... If some other person got this movie script and really made an effort to make a non-Hollywood horror film with this, I would pay whatever it costs to see it, because i know it would be great. I mean, come on!!!! a guy that killed little kids, that after being burned alive by your parents follows you in your nightmares!!!! it's great!!! Great but not well done, that's how i describe this movie, I recommend it though, for the reasons I have already explained... Try Again Wes!!!!"
"Dar_Sargent","6","0","0","3 July 2020"," A good urban legend flick, but best as a meta film
","This review will go into the film's merits as well as its most gaping flaw.<br/><br/>By now, you've surely seen many movies and shows that imitate or reference this classic horror. So you might wonder: can it still surprise you and thrill you, or is all the surprise ruined like Rosebud in Citizen Kane? Simply put, it's a thrill alright. This film is full of utterly unique and creatively creepy ideas that have never been successfully imitated. You can tell the cast and crew put a ton of energy into this production; the dream scenes are both extremely spooky and just plain fun.<br/><br/>The film doesn't beat around the bush or give you infodumps about how the nightmares work. It just jumps into its Twilight Zone concept, truly embracing its genre of horror-fantasy. It piques your imagination and puts you on the edge of your seat during the tense parts, especially in the claustrophobic cat-and-mouse finale. Almost 40 years later, the film's style still feels like an innovative breath of fresh air.<br/><br/>By now, you surely know the premise: a killer stalks teens in their nightmares, and when they die in their dreams, they die in real life--often in very bloody and messy ways, at that! So the plot is a thrill, but what about themes? The story's themes are pretty familiar territory for slashers. But when you step back and look at the film's meta-themes, there is some darker, deeper stuff at work here.<br/><br/>For instance, if you're watching as an adult, you'll probably notice how exploitative the film is towards its teen actors. The movie is glad to give glamorous shots of half-naked teens, showing off the boys' muscles and as much as they could of the girls--after all, we all know sex sells. But this is a movie where the villain is a child molester who sexually assaults teens onscreen; the villain's actions are presented as evil, yet director Wes Craven (a middle-aged 45 year old man when he made this film) is utterly shameless in objectifying his teens for profit.<br/><br/>This hypocrisy is utterly disgusting. If you're actually thinking while you watch the film, you will probably find that its exploitation (and lack of integrity) is a huge drawback that makes it harder to enjoy the movie.<br/><br/>And so, if you really want to enjoy this film, it works best to view it as a meta-horror. It is a psychological tale of a director, Wes Craven, a middle-aged man who makes a movie about his idealized, sexy teens. He creates a scene where two teens have cartoonishly loud, screaming sex while a virgin boy listens obsessively--a scene that clearly reflects Wes' own intense preoccupations. We see a dirty old man living out both his sexual fantasies and his sexual insecurities through teens, like a stunted Peter Pan wannabe who never accepted his own adulthood.<br/><br/>That statement might sound like a stretch, but it simply isn't--Wes' rejection of adulthood is on full display here. He portrays every single adult in the film as a useless loser or an adversary. In appearance, the adults all range from frumpy and homely to downright monstrous, making the teens even MORE idealized in comparison. The heroine is Craven's flawless dream girl: smart and brave but also vulnerable and fine with getting half-naked for his camera. We never even learn about the characters' interests; she is just Craven's tool. He presents her as sexy, but it's important that she's virginal because that childlike innocence makes her more exciting to Craven. Craven's next step is making a villain who embodies all of his dirty-old-man qualities, allowing him to self-flagellate but also revel in his sleaziness, entertaining people with it, making it charming and fun. His idealized girl degrades and dominates Craven's shame-avatar Freddy... and yet Freddy gets what he wants in the end.<br/><br/>If you just take the film as a story, it has some great spooky scenes and a tense, satisfying ending. If you take the film as a whole, then its exploitation will detract from its appeal. But if you take it as a meta-story about a twisted director who exploits teens, self-flagellates for it, but ultimately embraces his sleaziness because it's profitable, you will find some a thought-provoking psychological tale here (as well as a shining example of Hollywood's usual hypocrisy).<br/><br/>Whether you enjoy this film for the surreal, gory spectacle or for its meta-narrative value, I can confidently recommend it for sheer horror value."

","While age has wearied the scares found within, there's no doubt that A Nightmare on Elm Street is an indisputable horror classic, a creative and unnerving world created by legendary genre filmmaker Wes Craven.<br/><br/>Causing much fan-fare and becoming a box office sensation off a meager budget upon release in 1984, Street holds up incredibly well thanks to Craven's imaginative direction and world building, that takes us on a bizarre journey into the universe of deranged child-killer turned deformed dream stalking murderer Freddy Kruger.<br/><br/>Played by cult figure Robert Englund, Kruger almost instantaneously becomes an icon of horror figures as we are introduced to him as the film opens, Charles Bernstein's moody score accompanying him on his way as he haunts the dreams of Amanda Wyss's unfortunate teenager Tina.<br/><br/>It's an unforgettable entrance, Kruger's now often imitated razor claws burning their way into the viewers memory and Craven never lets up the tension and suspense as Tina and her friends, including Heather Langenkamp's Nancy (who becomes the film central focus) and Johnny Depp's dimwitted and very sleepy Glen Lantz, find out that sleep is not the answer as they become more aware of the fact Mr. Kruger is targeting them when they are at their most vulnerable.<br/><br/>It's a fantastic set-up, everyone can relate to the feeling of being at their most open to terrors when they lay peacefully in their bed (I'm sure many viewers at the time thought twice about their cosy beds) and Craven perfectly plays this out as the victims of Kruger's campaign of terrors face off against rotting flesh, terrifying chases through abandoned factories or quiet side alleys or even in now mainstream imagery, pulled into their beds to a world far below or hunted in the confines of their own bubble bath.<br/><br/>There's much kudos that needs to be paid to Craven and his team, particularly those responsible for the ghastly burnt visage of Kruger's raw and tortured appearance, its incredible how off-putting and vile a single look from the creature can be, as they managed to against all the odds develop what could've been nothing more than a college like production into something that spawned countless rip-offs and follow-ups that never quite managed to make the most of the creation handed to them.<br/><br/>Throughout the fast-moving reign of terror and battle against evil at its most uncompromising is a collection of committed and well-tuned performances that became a staple of Craven ensembles throughout his career.<br/><br/>All giving it their all, the cast of up-starts all dive headfirst into the material provided to them and sell the horror's of their plights as a group of school students in well over their heads try their best to find a way to stop Kruger from enacting out any more bloody acts of revenge, rounding out a solid package that is deserving of its reputation.<br/><br/>Final Say -<br/><br/>There are elements to A Nightmare on Elm Street that haven't aged as kindly as others but Craven's crowning achievement remains a deserving horror icon, anchored by its masterful and detestable evil incarnate.<br/><br/>4 tongue phones out of 5"

","A Nightmare on Elm Street is a classic for a reason! At the time of the hype of the non stop 80's slasher craze, the genre needed some new flavour added into it... and who better to do this than the master of suspense himself Wes Craven.<br/><br/>Wes took that slasher phenomenon and turned it into a psychological nightmare that to this day makes it hard to fall asleep watching.<br/><br/>All the characters are all likeable and more so believable, especially Nancy and her family.<br/><br/>Nancy really goes through it all in this film and was probably the first notable final girl to go up against the villain in the way that she does.<br/><br/>The only real downfall for me is the ending of this movie, I understand that director Wes Craven and producer Robert Shaye had conflict with this it self but it just felt like we had two alternate endings back to back.
I personally like to think of the ending as after Freddy kills Nancy's mother, Nancy then does vanquish him by getting rid of her fear. It then immediately cuts to a dream Nancy is having where all of her friends are still alive and so is her mother until it's not a dream... it's a nightmare. Freddy is controlling the car the friends are driving in and he pulls Nancy's mother (aka the blow up doll) threw the door and this is just Nancy's subconscious unable to get past the ordeal she went through.<br/><br/>Overall an amazing movie 36 years later and will always remain a horror classic... but that ending still hurts my brain to this day."

And then everybody who died comes back, completely inexplicably, but then Freddy grabs Marge through her front door while she's completely awake??).<br/><br/>There was also way too much blood, like when Rod sank into his bed. I'd say enough blood to account for roughly 5 people came spurting out of his bed onto the ceiling, and it was never explained why it was gushing like that, since he was just sucked into the bed.<br/><br/>You think I'm kidding? I used to think people who laughed at horror movies were insane but I cackled uncontrollably when all that blood came out of the hole in Rod's bed.<br/><br/>I would've given it 1 star if it weren't for the actors.

","The film A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) is a shock film where a group of high school students, including Heather Langenkamp as Nancy Thompson, are being stalked and killed in their dreams by a decease child murderer Fred Krueger (Robert Englund). Nancy's father Lt. Donald Thompson (John Saxon) is desperately trying to find who is committing these murders but when Nancy explains who is doing this and how, no one believes her. Nancy knows that if she is to survive this, she must learn to out-think her adversary.
The film begins with a focus on fear as the central theme when Nancy and her classmates didn't understand why they were suddenly having nightmares. When Tina Gray (Amanda Wyess) began to describe the man from her dreams Nancy couldn't believe that she had dreamt about the same person. After Tina's death the fear grew to why someone would murder her, but once Lt. Thompson caught who they thought had committed the murder, the suspect ends dead shortly after. Both victims gave the same portrayal of the man in their dreams to Nancy before their deaths and the same man in own dreams had to connected but why the kids from this town or how someone could die in their dreams. It wasn't until Nancy's mother, Marge Thompson (Ronee Blakley), explained that her and many other parents in town took the law in their own hands and murdered Fred Krueger by burning him alive after he was released from jail because a search warrant was signing improperly. The central theme switched from that of fear to that of survival, once Nancy understood Fred's motivation for revenge for the towns action on him. She was no longer the victim but was bring the fight to Fred on equal playing ground. She began reading up on making booby-traps and antipersonnel devices and planned on bringing Fred out of her dream by having a hold of him as she woke up.
Once in the real-world Fred could be hurt like any normal person but like a classic villain once their powers are gone, they are cowards and he fled back to the dream world. He returned one last time to bring the fear back to Nancy, but she understood him now and without fear his was powerless and she turned her back to him and he vanished.
The lighting in this film is outstanding as they you a lot of high lights at different angles to give the settings in the night sequences a lot of long shadows and dark spots to give that eerie feeling. The setting of the boiler room gives that glow and reddish tint as if there is a fire always burning somewhere close, but plenty of dark secluded areas that are perfect for someone to jump scare from. Though some of these scenes are dark they make it a point that the actors faces are always lite enough so you can make out their expressions as in fear, the facial expressions are just as good as a scream. The little lighting in the dark broiler room when Nancy calls out Fred to face her and doesn't the in frustration is so vivid and without that lighting, we may not have seen it as well.
The sound effects in this movie were excellent through the use of subjective point of view as the boiler room you can hear the chains rattle back and forth and the release of steam from the pipes as it gives that unnerving hissing sound. The continuous sound of water dripping from somewhere was always present and of course the frightening screeching sound of the knifed glove on the pipes and other metal objects. These sounds radiate thought the scene and give you the sense that you are in the boiler room with them and the fear of the unknown where it's coming from.
In 2010 a remake of A Nightmare on Elm Street was released on the same focus of fear and played homage to the original. However as many say it's hard to beat the original and for this film it is true. As you couldn't get the feeling of fear in the remake as you could with the original. I think most of this credit must be given to the actors in the original as there was a connection that emitted on the screen.
The film shows that we don't have to live in fear of the unknown if we understand it. We can rise above the fear and defeat it by taking the fear that gives it power."

As a young effeminate boy my father thought it would butch me up. But it just made me have awful nightmares and idolized Nancy and wanted to be her. I mean after all she was the one who survived and she had a hot boyfriend played by a young Johnny Depo wearing a crop top. As I got older I really began to appreciate the perfection that is this film. Robert Englunds iconic performance as Freddy is nightmarish and the film's dark, gritty tone is disturbing.

","The Nightmare on Elm Street is a classic horror film making the audience always feel on edge thanks to one of the most unique and iconic villains of all time: Freddy Krueger. This film sparked the start of a 9 movie long series and is still talked about 30 years later. The movies starts by following the story of Tina, a teenage girl who seems to be getting nightmares that all involve a terrifying man named Freddy Kreuger who's wearing distinctive gloves with knives attached to it. She tells her friends but they simply pass it off as a harmless nightmare. However, things take a turn for the worst when she ends up being murdered in her sleep and her friend Nancy starts getting nightmares with Freddy in them as well. She tries every way to stay up in order to prevent the same outcome from happening to her and tries to devise a plan to stop him before it's too late.
The theme of this movie seems to be the idea of power. This is present towards the end of the film when Nancy refuses to give Freddy any power and because of this he vanishes into thin air signifying without Nancy giving Freddy any power, Freddy wasn't able to have power over Nancy. This was an important scene because throughout the movie Nancy look very helpless and weak. She was forcing herself to stay up and was running away from Freddy any time she saw him, but towards the end this all changed and she was able to regain power while also stripping Freddy of his power which simply made him insignificant. However, in the last shot it appears to have Freddy pull Nancy's mother through the house door, but it isn't clear how or why he does it and the scene feels like a nightmare, not reality.
This theme reminds me in some ways of the Hunger Games. Katniss being from District 12, a district with little to no power, must fight in the hunger games and survive. Towards the end she ends up going against what is expected of her and she forces the Capital to become powerless and allow both her and Peeta to become victors. The similarities in the theme are interesting especially since they have two entirely different plots, but they both follow the story of two helpless characters who must think differently and strip power from the powerful even though it seems as if they don't have any control or power of their own.
In the Nightmare on Elm Street, there are many great techniques used that help carry this theme. For example, lighting techniques are used when Nancy confronts Freddy at the end of the movie in a dark eerie room. She lets Freddy know she's going to take back any energy she gave Freddy and reaches for the shiny door knob and as she does this Freddy attempts to attack her only to vanish and once Nancy opens the door it becomes noticeably bright. This signifies a turning point in the film and shows the shift in power from Freddy to Nancy through the lighting. Another technique used in the scene would be the camera angles. This is the only encounter with Freddy where Nancy is able to have a full dialogue with him and you can see her become mentally stronger. As Freddy speaks to her, there is a close up of Nancy's face and you can see she has no fear when it comes to Freddy's threats which shows her taking back her power from Freddy before he even disappears. These are great techniques used to show her transition from scared and helpless to powerful and fearful by literally confronting her nightmares."

","The first Nightmare on Elm Street movie introduced us to horror icon Freddy Krueger, a man with razor sharp knives on his glove that attacks you in your dreams. It was dark. It was scary. And it cemented Robert Englund as a horror movie staple.<br/><br/>As a stand alone film it stands up really well. There is genuine menace from the character and a reliance on atmosphere and wanting to tell a scary story over jump scares and gags.<br/><br/>But as a part of a series it's a lot different than the subsequent movies that turned him from a scary figure to one that made bad puns and used things like the ""power glove"" to do somebody in. As such until ""A New Nightmare"" came out this was the scariest incarnation of Freddy which means if you started watching the series after the first one you'll see a remarkable difference.<br/><br/>The story is of a former gardener of an elementary school that is accused of child molestation and gets off on a technicality. The parents decide to take justice into their own hands and burn him alive. Years later he shows up as a horribly scarred man haunting the dreams of the children of the parents who killed him and kills them in a rather gruesome way.<br/><br/>The special effects are great for the era considering that computer animation was very primitive at the time. There's lots of blood to appease the gore hounds and there's a good story to appease those that want to see a scary movie.<br/><br/>While not my favorite of the series, that would be the third one a.k.a.

Heather Langenkamp as Nancy shines on screen as the movie takes it's twists and turns for both the better and worse.

","Despite some mediocre acting on occasion, this film stands head and shoulders above the many, including my personal favorite, Halloween, based on sheer inventiveness and psychological intrigue.<br/><br/>One of the greatest heroines in horror history is the character of Nancy. Her melodrama and innocence belies a steely strength of will and maturity that the other kids lack. She has endured the pains and drama of a fractured home, but from parents who do clearly love her, and this is part of the resonance we find in Nancy. Her strength has basis in the subtext of her reality. She's tough, but not broken. We believe her. We believe she is the prepared one. I do not think of her as a ""scream queen"", for she is 100% heroine.<br/><br/>The other kids are all real, too. For each character, we see exactly why they are who they are. We get to see the products of suburbia in decline. I remember these kids.<br/><br/>Cleverly written and directed by Wes Craven, on a budget of $1,800,000, the film was downright scary when I was a young teen. I remember having to watch this with the lights on. Watching it today, it is still an entertaining watch. You can not understate how great makeup and special effects look in this film.

"oratiosanctus","8","0","0","11 May 2018"," A film that rightfully defined a generation, but also hasn't aged as well in other areas
","*Review originally posted via Instagram (""@oratiosanctus"") on April 27, 2018*<br/><br/>~<br/><br/>Considered by many (myself, included) as Wes Craven's masterpiece, A Nightmare on Elm Street is one that utilises what it is, and still remains to this day, one of the more ingenious and original ideas for a horror movie villain to date. A supernatural killer who stalks teenagers in their dreams, the one place none of us can escape. The concept alone is cinematic gold. Robert Englund - who plays the villainous Freddy Krueger - turns out a marvelous performance, offering just the right amount of restraint and menace to be both disturbing and compelling to watch. His constant presence (even when not on screen or only heard by distinct sounds, such as the unnerving screech of his iconic bladed glove) holds the film. His hostile, predatory nature is always felt, and his capabilities as a modern-day bogeyman brings out that primal and scared inner child within who was afraid of the thing lurking under his bed.<br/><br/>It is, however, a movie not without its flaws. In fact, a few are quite glaring. Aside from Heather Langenkamp, who delivers a strong performance as the heroine Nancy, the other actors are very hit-and-miss; with the parents characters (Nancy's excluded) being largely forgettable. The special effects also have not aged well in most areas. That aside, the imagination and visual style of this picture is one that stays with you long after the credits roll and features a death scene early in the film that remains one of the most chilling and well executed you will find in any horror film. This movie is one that is made by its atmosphere.<br/><br/>For a film made in 1984 on a very modest budget, A Nightmare on Elm Street remains a diamond in the rough for a slasher movement that, at that time, was only starting to gain real traction. The movie's legacy as it stands today speaks for itself."

","Realistic view on sexual abuse survivors, not much graphic imagery (of the actual child abuse), subtle memories.
Abuser presented as an actual ""harmless"" person who the parents trusted. So much as to make us believe the kids lied about the abuse for a part of the movie. Which is very realistic, for real life abusers are often close to the kids, someone trusted.
""He's not after us because we lied. He's after us because we told the truth."" That line really settles the fear to me, more than anything else to be honest.
The adults in the movie are pretty disapointing though, their silence is understandable at first but becomes a bit frustrating and annoying after a while.
All in all, great movie, iconic, all that stuff. But the creepiness of child sexual abuse, the idea of helplessness is what hits home for me."

","The scariest thing about 'A Nightmare On Elm Street (1984)' is its fantastic concept, one of the most inherently frightening and interesting cinematic ideas ever conceived, which paves the way for some superb surrealist imagery (created using wonderfully inventive practical effects that still hold up) and a general off-kilter feel that perfectly provoke a pervasive and persistent nightmarish vibe that makes the film really stick in your mind long after the credits roll. The mysterious villain, a sadistic scarred serial-killer who's become incredibly iconic despite only having seven minutes of screen-time (though his presence is always keenly felt), relishes in the terror he causes his teenage victims and his design expertly plays upon several primal fears to feel like something straight out of a bad dream; we're also never spoon-fed his motivations (though some back-story is given which allows us to infer his incentives) or given a clue to exactly why he occupies the so-called 'dream world'. It's the ending that causes the most concern as the darker take, pushed for by a producer who essentially vetoed Craven's well thought-out 'happier' finale, basically ruins a killer reveal seen just moments prior and doesn't even really make sense in the context it itself presents. Still, the film isn't ruined by this and remains one of the best 'slashers' of its time. 8/10"

I must say I'm really surprised with such good project; everything in here works well. There is a great and creepy story, in which the neighborhood kids start dreaming with a dead psycho, who tries killing them during their sleep. Along with such original and creepy story, we have a professional directing that warily does its job; there are tense songs in the very scenes they are required. Also, this film never manages to get boring, considering that spectator easily gets involved in the thread. The acting is, on the other hand, sometimes a little shallow; in some scenes it was evident that the cast was overacting, especially in the scenes related to Tina and her mother. However, out of the horror classics I've seen, ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is the one that surprised me the most, beating films like ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Halloween"", reason why I strongly congratulate Wes Craven and everyone involved in this, for such achievement.

","A hugely enjoyable, clever and imaginative slasher film which very effectively explores the nature of reality and imagination. Robert Englund is excellent as Freddy Krueger, who works brilliantly in no small part because his screen time is so limited. However, the entire cast is very good, particularly Heather Langenkamp, Johnny Depp (whatever happened to him?), John Saxon and Ronee Blakley. The film is often extremely frightening, never more so than Tina's death scene, and Freddy Krueger makes for a terrifying and highly memorable villain, not least because big knives scare the bejesus out of me!<br/><br/>One that I particularly loved about the film is that Nancy is such a strong, intelligent and resourceful character and a fighter. Rather than accepting her fate, she tackles the situation head-on and develops a plan to trap and defeat Freddy. Speaking of the dead child murderer, I have an adorable one-year-old Golden Cocker Spaniel named Freddie. I naturally knew who Freddy Krueger was but, had I seen the film prior to a year and a half ago, I would have given my dog a different name!<br/><br/>On the negative side, the film's music is occasionally rather irritating. It also loses some of its momentum in its last half an hour and it doesn't seem to have same level of imagination as the rest of the film, though the ambiguous ending is excellent. On the strength of its first hour, I'd have given it full marks."

"Foreverisacastironmess123","10","0","0","30 October 2014"," ""Hey! Nancy! No running in the hallway..."" One of the greatest horror movies ever made and the birth of a legend!
","Inspired by villains Michael Myers and Jason Voorhees, A Nightmare on Elm Street was released on November 9th 1984, and the world of macabre motion pictures was granted one of its greatest treasures, one that would take the idea of supernatural horror villains to the next level, for unlike any others here was a fiend with a face that leered right at you, a voice, and a definite personality, one that devised many twisted and cruel ways in which to psychologically torture victims with a gleeful passion, and whip them into a state of panic before delivering the final blow and destroying them within the realm of their own dreams, and his name was Freddy Krueger... This is simply a fantastic film, it's an utter classic, and a veritable masterpiece among horror movies and to me it was totally Wes Craven's best work. I love everything about it, it's so fiercely unique and special and has its own dark magical lore about it that makes it stand out from the rest to this day. The music score and distinctive sound design is my favourite horror score ever, as it elevates everything so beautifully and gives the film such a strong and memorable identity. The iconic jump-rope song alone probably forms a huge part of why this movie came to be so ingrained into the collective consciousness of horror movie buffs the world over for decades.. It moves at just the right pace and never seems to rush into anything, they make the most out of and flesh-out each moment so tremendously well, I never find myself waiting for it to end. What I most enjoy about it is how it so effortlessly and eerily blurs the line between dreams and reality... Just the idea is scary, I mean it's a concept that is literally the stuff of nightmares and while I don't find the scenes dead terrifying, it definitely takes you out of your comfort zone. It's been said, but it is something that we can all relate to, we're all at our most vulnerable in that state and no one can stay awake forever. And who hasn't ever experienced that kind of dread where you're having a really bad night terror where you're not sure you're gonna escape alive? The concept Craven came up with and how he expressed and inter-weaved it so perfectly into the overall environment and atmosphere of the story was just genius. It does get a little confusing when some of the dream stuff begins to mingle with the real world, like the hysterical tongue-phone, or when Glen's poor mother goes into his room and is somehow able to see the spectacular tornado of gore that she shouldn't be able to.. I take that as a clue to what I take as the meaning behind the chilling final scene as the questionable reality and structure of the film comes tumbling down as the suspiciously happy ending turns grim and everyone is whisked away by the Freddy-Mobile and mom is hilariously sucked through the door, and even that's kinda spooky! Anyway what I think is that at some point the movie became or perhaps always was, a dream-within-a-dream, and it ended that way and never came out of it. And if you watch with that idea in mind it's even scarier as it plays into the ambiguous and occasionally even ethereal tone. My favourite part is the sequence between Nancy falling asleep in class and when she burns herself to wake up. I think it most captures what they were trying to sell, the surreal, almost hypnotic haziness of the dream-state. That's exactly what it can be like sometimes when you're dreaming, you do accept the bizarre and incomprehensible as reality because you're not aware that you're sleeping, hence why Nancy doesn't run screaming when she sees the bloody animate corpse of Tina beckoning to her or when she bumps into the chainsaw-crazy bitch from hell!!! The scariest image for me is the sight of Tina's body being dragged away by invisible hands, and the way she looks like a piece of meat as her hand flops to the ground - it's so good! The characters are all vital to the story, Heather Langencamp's Nancy most of all. She was an outstanding heroine, despite only being in one and a sorta sequels she remains the most memorable survivor girl of the series. She had a great realness to her and a level-headed resourcefulness, like she was just a regular person who wasn't so scared of dying that she wasn't willing to fight to try and solve the deadly mystery before it was too late. Her personality was strong enough to hold the center of the movie together, and although it's her and Englund both that are the stars, I find her more interesting because in this one at least, he's subtle and more of a shadowy bogeyman, a dark force to be conquered, and you root for her and want to see her kick his charred ass! Anyway that said Freddy's still awesome and very different in his original appearance, he hides in shadows and all you mostly see of his face are his amused mad eyes and he's just more threatening and ominous, and it was more than just a great-looking getup, Englund brought a lot of his own sinister body language to his most famous role. They may have made a complete clown of him eventually but as far as this film goes, he was a legitimate scary bastard! What's really amazing is that they did it all and achieved such macabre magnificence on a low budget, you feel how much effort was put into it - the movie works and always will. It more than deserves every last bit of the considerable love and admiration that it's ever got. God bless, ""Screw sleep!!!!"""
"xkazx89","8","0","0","13 October 2014"," May contain spoilers. My favourite film from the whole Nightmare franchise
","The first and probably the best film in the Nightmare franchise thanks to Wes Cravens brilliant script and directing. But also due to Robert Englund who in my opinion is the one and only Freddy Krueger. At the beginning of the film Freddy is named Fred Krueger as that was his name before he became a dream demon. He was a child molester that was burnt to death by the neighbourhood parents and has come back to take revenge on their children. This is the first film that Johnny Depp appeared in and kick started his carer into the film industry and becoming a very famous actor. He plays Glen the boyfriend of the lead character Nancy played by Heather Langenkamp. These actors are far beyond the age that they are portraying in the film. Heather plays a 16 year old and is a 20 year old actress, Depp plays a 17 year old but is 21 at the time but the strangest and biggest age gap is that of Tina (Amanda Wyss) who in the film is 15 but was 24 at the time. When I first saw this film I was young and wouldn't have known any difference but watching it now I can tell that these actors and actresses were too old to play the age portrayed in the film. Although we know that Tina and Rod are about to/having sex this is not something that is shown, unlike horrors made now where there are large parts of the film that have sex scenes in it. Tina is also a 15yr old that is having sex, now in the UK this would be illegal and I'm sure back in the 80s this would be very frowned upon unlike now where it is the norm. When Nancy's hair changes colour she says ""God I look 20 years old"" this is probably a reference to Heathers real age. The 1st time we ever see Freddy is when he has his long arms and scrapes the metal around him and then cuts his fingers off. This Freddy however is never used again in any other of the Nightmare movies when I think he should have been. Also in this film he has no stripes down the arms of his jumper yet in later films there are stripes on the arms, so how and why did this get changed? In another scene Nancy asks Glen to watch her sleep then within her dream asks him if his still watching. If he was still watching how could he have been in her dream? When Nancy is having her dreams monitored and comes out of her dream with cuts and brings a hat out of her dream she is still not believed. Even though there was no possible way she could have brought it into the room as her mother was constantly watching her. The best part of this film in my opinion is Johnny Depps death scene. As I have yet to see another death like it in any other film and is such a strange, unexplainable death. Overall the acting of all characters is much better than those in poorly and cheaply made modern films. This was like I said earlier Depps 1st film and clearly made an impression on other directors such as Tim Burton as he now acts and voices in many of his films. Although not Robert Englund's 1st film he was kept on as Freddy for the whole of the original Nightmare series where as other 80's characters such as Leatherface and Jason were never continuously played by the same actor through all of those franchises. Since these films he has had multiple acting roles and has even directed his own film. Overall I give this film an 8/10 mainly thanks to the brilliant acting, directing and of course the bed scene. As a horror collector I also collect figures and other merchandise and from this film although some figures have been made I feel there are more bits that should be made. I would love for the phone to be made into a life-size prop that's available to all and not limited. Although they have now done a phone with the 2014 30th anniversary figure. I would love for there to be a diorama made of the bed scene as it is my favourite part of the whole franchise and is probably many more people's favourite scene. Other good dioramas that would be good if made would include Freddy ripping out of the bed at the end and then when he turns into the car. Before becoming Freddy he was burnt alive and in this film there is a scene where Heather sets him alight. Surely this should be a figure that's made as it's what makes him look like he does. I shall review my figures in a separate review and will eventually be reviewing all of the nightmare series possibly including the awful remake if I can survive watching it again."

","Freddy was the first true ""boogeyman"" in my life, I remember watching this film about 15 years ago, he was the monster that made me fall in love with this beautiful genre. Since that day I have been watching Horror films religiously I would not like to even speculate on the number I have seen. Since that first time I have watched it every Halloween since and countless times throughout the year, this year is no exception seen it twice already and will be viewing again on the 31st.<br/><br/>The film opens up with a very ominous scene of what we can presume is a man creating what can only be described as disturbing, the scene really sets the tone for what is to come dark, evil, monstrous and death. Cut to the next scene we see Tina Gray (Wyss) finds herself walking down a dark, creepy hallway hearing eerie laughter then out of nowhere a goat, yes a goat. Tina now finds herself in a boiler room the constant dripping of water, the laughter the sense that she is not alone. Then it begins you hear the claws scratching the metal, a glimpse of a hat, face and a man in the distance, the sound of goats, she's backed into a corner then boom he strikes we get our first glimpse of the scariest slasher I have ever known. I can pretty much play this scene in my brain from memory now.<br/><br/>I don't want to talk to much about the story, it just has to be seen to be appreciated, Wes Cravens directing in the two opening scenes in which I mentioned are so on point you will watch them and know what the film is going to be like.<br/><br/>People will argue that majority of the success for ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" comes for the performance given by Robert Englund as Fred, which is not entirely wrong a lot does come from that but also from Cravens writing and directing. Englund plays a very subtle but still menacing presence as the demonic antagonist. Englund is not the only one to shine in their role though, Langenkamp as Nancy Thompson she adds a vulnerable yet intelligence that really shows when her character develops throughout the film. The main shame comes from the displays from the majority of the supporting cast who do nothing but read their lines they are not stand out in any way.<br/><br/>Cravens baby shall we say will forever live on as the absolute pinnacle of the Slasher genre at a time when people and even studios were giving up on the sub-genre. Craven has even spoken recently on his Instagram about how there was nearly no Elm Street. The film is celebrating its 30th anniversary this year, and it is still loved across the many generations who have seen it, and me personally I will continue to tell people how perfect a film it truly is so I will help keep it alive for whatever time I am on this planet hoping you guys and girls will also.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is a masterpiece in its genre and for me personally a triumph in what a man can do when he puts his whole heart into a project. There is some problems with the acting but that happens in EVERY Horror film, the effects, the story, the acting of Englund and Langenkamp, the directing, the music, just everything makes up for that. The greatest slasher in history, I'll say it the best monster/villain performance since Boris Karloff as Frankenstein's Monster in ""Frankenstein"" 1931, there I said it."
"bowmanblue","8","0","0","26 August 2014"," The original (and best)
","Say what you like about the (numerous) sequels that followed 'A Night on Elm Street' (and many people did), but most will agree that this one was a classic horror movie that still stands the test of time. And, if you don't know, it's recently been remade, so you want to make sure you check out the original if you're new to the franchise. The remake was universally despised and critically panned.<br/><br/>If you don't know, 'Nightmare' tells the – not particularly nice – story of Freddy Kruger, a child murdered who was burned alive by the parents of his victims. However, you can't keep a good child killer down and he gets supernatural powers which he uses to return to children's dreams, only to despatch them again.<br/><br/>The 'Nightmare' films were a little different to your average 'slasher' flick, as you don't just have a masked killer wandering around hacking people to bits one by one (normally after they've just had sex). The 'dream-angle' provides the film-makers with a broader pallet to work with, one where they can be more creative and have fun with the locations. As Freddy only attacks when his victim falls asleep, the landscape is normally individual to the victim and he can manipulate it suitable to 'mess with their heads' before he kills them.<br/><br/>Of course, Nightmare wouldn't be Nightmare if it wasn't for Freddy and therefore finding the right actor to play him was paramount to the film's success. Step up Robert Englund. He really makes the film what it is. He's suitably nasty, but strangely fun to watch at the same time.<br/><br/>So, if you're into eighties horror, slasher films in general, or just like a film that's genuinely creepy, give this one a go (and for heaven's sake please steer clear of the 2010 remake – despite having an equally great actor to portray Freddy, it's just plain awful).<br/><br/>http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/"

","CONTAINS SPOILER! READ ONLY IF YOU'VE SEEN THE MOVIE!<br/><br/>If you want to watch a good movie, go back to the classics. Apart from the 80s cheesiness that might at first make nowadays teenagers uncomfortable, A Nightmare on Elm Street hasn't aged much.<br/><br/>Wes Craven ingeniously pulls off a seminal horror movie amidst the endless flood of early 80s slasher madness that still stands out thirty years later. Faithful to it's slasher genre with surprising, gruesome deaths it however has something more: a script that goes the distance. The primary strength of the film is the intellectual involvement of the audience, we are not just trying to guess who's next, we are trying to solve the mystery along with the heroine Nancy Thompson (Heather Lagenkamp) and are constantly on the edge of our seats. The blurred lines between reality and fantasy are precisely crafted to deeply emerge the audience in the story and warp expectations. At times we think it's a nightmare when it turns out to be reality, and vice versa, and sometimes nightmares become reality, those are very conscious directorial choices putting the audience in the same state of fear as the main protagonist, with no where to escape.<br/><br/>Even though the nightmare scenes become slightly redundant and less imaginative after the spectacular bathtub one, the visual and practical effects, unlike many CGI nowadays, are still very disturbing. I've always thought that human created creatures and practical effects were somehow more repulsive than CGI ones even if they're low budget and look fake, they are more organic, more palpable, more terrifying. I don't know about you, but when I imagine the boogie man he looks much more like Seth Brundle as the fly (The Fly, David Cronenberg, 1986) than the spider in Big Ass Spider! (Mike Mendez, 2013). But the true strength that makes Freddy Krueger much more terrifying than his robotic psycho villain counterparts Jason and Michael Myers, is his personality exhibited throughout the movie as a sadistic but yet playful child murderer, unashamed of his one liners: ""I'm your boyfriend now, Nancy.""<br/><br/>As for the cast, Tina Grey (Amanda Wyss) is perfect as the Janet Leigh of the film, she even brings some sort of unexpected class to the genre, her death, shown from the reality part of her nightmare, is the most horrifying scene of the movie. Nancy, the typical teenager, is not just another scream queen, she's also resourceful and courageous and makes it easy for the audience to suspend their disbelief. The boys, Nick Corri and Glen Lantz (Jsu Garcia and Johnny Depp) of course have minor parts but are nonetheless convincing, and Glen's death, which comes in the last act of the movie, competes with Tina's as one of the most unforgettably gruesome scenes, coming as a shock after the much more ordinary death-by- hanging of Corri. The adults are much weaker characters than the teenagers and their acting is so caricatured it makes us chuckle, although Ronee Blakely (Nancy's mom) is very efficient in the exposition scene explaining Kruger's origins and I also loved the sleep clinic sequence, alas all of her other scenes are over the top and unconvincing; John Saxon (Nancy's dad), in spite of being too dramatic, still manages to portray a strong but frustrated parental figure.<br/><br/>And of course, Freddy Kruger (Robert Englund), fully scared in his striped sweater, harboring his iconic razor glove, manages a visceral performance which reminds each of us of the monster that haunts our nightmares, whatever form it may take, the one we think we finally got rid of but yet might still be lingering somewhere waiting for his comeback. With the marvelous creation of this character, Wes Craven reinforces the fear of sleep, proving that a horror movie doesn't have to lobotomize it's audience to be truly frightening.<br/><br/>Like my review?

"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","8","0","0","14 May 2014"," The only horror film where no person wants to be attacked
","If you look at the history of cinema, almost every horror villain has something in common; they physically exist. They are present in the material world no matter how many times they're resurrected from the dead. That is, except for Freddy Krueger, who is the exact opposite of every other character. He literally doesn't exist, unless you're asleep. If you're asleep, then you should worry. Who knew that while even sleeping you couldn't be safe? Well, this is what happens to a group of teenagers who discover they are being haunted by the same creeper every night when they fall asleep. Sounds fun.<br/><br/>The girl who realizes this ongoing trend is Nancy Thompson played by Heather Langenkamp. Langenkamp is another one of those special actresses where credit must be given for giving her character amiability. Just like Kirsty Cotton from Hellraiser (1987) and Laurie Strode from Halloween (1978), Nancy is a character that shows strong courage in the face of severe danger - even if they do scream. But then again, who wouldn't if you truly had to face these menacing demons? Freddy Krueger is played by Robert Englund and although he barely has any dialog, the fact that his cackle is all that he really needs, makes him all the more intimidating. Aside from these two main actors, audiences will also get to see John Saxon from Enter the Dragon (1973) play Nancy's father, Charles Fleischer who later plays as Roger Rabbit in Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) and playing Nancy's boyfriend is the now ever famous Johnny Depp.<br/><br/>The writer behind this movie is Wes Craven (who's also directing). What helps this movie elevate itself among other horror franchises is the fact that it relies on a whole different way of surviving. Forget running away. You can't escape your dreams if you're tired enough. At some point, you will fall asleep. Most people can not avoid sleep so either way, Freddy will find you. Adding to this different angle of suspense are Wes Craven's heavy-handed gore scenes and uncomfortable imagery. Many of these scenes involve realistic looking practical effects, which will keep the audience guessing whether the character is dreaming, or not. Also, there are some scenes that are just downright creepy. Being haunted by ghosts are not the best memories people would like to relive.<br/><br/>But perhaps one the weaker parts of Craven's writing is the explanation to Krueger's special abilities. His backstory is elaborated on which is great, but the actual information about his demonic powers are never talked about. It would be nice to know. Plus, there is a point in the film where it's kind of explained on how he continues to exist but even then there isn't much explanation given. Not sure if it was supposed to be left unexplained but it could've have been, to clear things up. Finally, the last element that really helped this film was Charles Bernstein's score. His main theme which consists of a tune not only fits the story well but is rather unsettling. Although the music is enjoyable, at points it did sound like Bernstein couldn't come up with not very many other new tunes. It could've been worse though. Overall very entertaining.<br/><br/>Wes Craven changed the game of horror when he added Freddy Krueger to the mix. Only the insomniacs are safe. The special effects are great, along with a unique story, likable characters and creepy music. Some explanations are needed from time to time though."

","Freddy Krueger is my favorite Horror icon. He is just a lot more interesting than the Michael Myers or the Jason Voorhees of the world. He doesn't plod along and kill you right away, he savers the kill, allows you to run and run until you can't anymore, like a boxer waiting for the opposing fighter to tire himself out. Freddy waits until you are at your most unstable, your most vulnerable, and then, he becomes your worst nightmare, and then you die. <br/><br/>Maybe its my sick, twisted mind, but I love that about Freddy. He knows when and how he's going to kill you, he just takes pleasure knowing that you don't know. The Freddy here is far different Freddy from the sequels. Yeah he's got a small bit of that black comedic humor about him, but for the most part, he's just flat out disturbing. The knives against the pipes, the face only slightly revealed by light, he cuts of two of his fingers and then smiles about it... thats down right mental. Always with the smiling as well, always smiling, planning, he's a cunning b@st@rd and he knows it.<br/><br/>Of course, I couldn't make this all about Freddy. The cast of characters are the best iv seen in a slasher. They all have great personalities, there isn't any obvious person who's going to die, it seems crazy characters like this are in a film even considered a slasher. Nancy is a strong, independent character that isn't the wimpy, constantly crying character or the weirdly over-tomboyish character, she actually feels like a, get this, real person. I loved Johnny Depp here as well, his character has a name but I just call him Johnny because, well its hard not to considering how big he's become. On a side not do you think thats why a lot of young people star in horror films?, because they saw how big Depp got and thought 'I can do that', I know nobody has ever thought of that, but it would be interesting.<br/><br/>The special effect are very good for the budget this film had. The anti gravity death scene, the blood gushing from the bed, Freddy coming out of the wall, its all really wonderful practical special effects and shows you that you don't need a big budget to produce quality effects. <br/><br/>Overall, I cant rate this highly enough, fantastic film that works without trying to shock or scare you, it just disturbs you, it gets right under your skin and invades your safe place, your dreams. Its a film that has remained timeless even after more than 30 years and heres to 30 more years of Freddy terrorising the kids of Elm Street."
"taylorkingston","8","0","0","16 April 2014"," Freddy Krueger, is a great character...
","I love this movie, it was one of the first horror movies I ever saw. Actually, I think it was my first horror movie. And frankly, it was a great first choice. I was so freaking scared. I was only ten or eleven, I'm sure if I was older, it wouldn't have been so scary. I love the character of Freddy Krueger, I think he is a great aspect of fear. Basically, in this movie, kids that live on Elm Street, go to sleep and see Freddy Krueger in their dreams. He tries to kill them and if he succeeds, they die in real life. I love the different death scenes. Some are so scary and some are still my favorite death scenes from all of the horror movies I've seen. Some are even better than Saw, Scream, Final Destination and Friday The 13th. My favorite death scene is where a boy is sucked into his water bed and a tornado of blood flows around his room. I was sad when I found out it was Johnny Depp's character, but you might as well have actors and actresses you really like die in the movies, instead of some random that you don't even care about. Overall, I give this an 8 out of 10."

","As the slasher boom came to an end, with most major studios bowing out of the genre and leaving just the independent filmmakers to milk the concept dry, a struggling director by the name of Wes Craven had penned a script full of original ideas and inventive deaths, far from the standard butcher knife kills which had become commonplace with the countless Halloween clones. Funded by pledging production company New Line (whose only previous credit had been the classy thriller Alone in the Dark), A Nightmare on Elm Street would not only introduce the world to the grotesque bogeyman that is Freddy Krueger but would also move the horror genre into the world of merchandise and shameless marketing, something which only the likes of Star Wars had previously dabbled in. Shot on a relatively small budget with an inexperienced crew, the movie would eventually cement the careers of both the director and studio.<br/><br/>Fifteen-year-old Tina Gray (Amanda Wyss) once again finds herself in a creepy old boiler room. There is a constant drip of water from the pipes and the sound of metal being scratched again metal rings through her ears. The place is playing tricks on her, a goat suddenly appearing from nowhere and a constant feel that someone is watching her. Eventually, that presence appears in the form of a burnt man (Robert Englund) in a striped old jumper, a dusty Fedora and a menacing glove on one hand, with long claw-like blades attached to each finger. Suddenly, Tina wakes up screaming, which summons her sleeping mother from the other room. She looks down at her clothes to discover four identical tears, which match perfectly with the blades that he had attacked her with. Grabbing the crucifix off the wall, she curls up in bed and prays that she will survive the night.<br/><br/>The following day at school, Tina is discussing her scary nightmare with her friends, the sweet-yet-naive Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp) and Nancy's boyfriend Glen Lantz (Johnny Depp), when Tina's criminal lover Rod Lane (Nick Corri) appears behind them, making crude references to the kind of dreams that she has been giving him. That night, with the mother away, Tina has invited over her friends to keep her company, when an uninvited Rod arrives to spend some quality time with her. Later, as everyone is sleeping, Tina begins to violently toss around in her sleep, before her shirt is ripped open and four deep cuts simultaneously appear across her stomach. As Rod watches, her body is lifted into the air by an unseen force and is dragged up the wall and onto the ceiling, suddenly falling back down onto the bed, a shower of blood praying over him. As Glen and Nancy break the door open, Rod is seen escaping out through the window.<br/><br/>Struggling to cope with the death of her best friend, Nancy begins to have bizarre visions, including seeing Tina's corpse in a body bag being dragged through the halls of the school whilst she whispers her name. With Rod arrested for the murder, Nancy witnesses the burnt man appearing in the cell and willing the bed-sheets to wrap around his neck, pulling his body up to the ceiling to the guards who find him believe that it was suicide. But, as the mysterious figure begins to terrorize them, Nancy learns the truth about him and his death at the hands of her mother and the parents of the neighborhood. The man is Fred Krueger, a child murderer who had been released on a legal technicality and so the parents of the victims, determined to keep him from hurting any more children, had tracked him down to his boiler room and had burnt him alive. Somehow, he had found a way to come back and was now haunting the children of the guilty in their dreams.<br/><br/>Much of the success of A Nightmare on Elm Street relies on the performance of Englund, who provides a subtle-yet-sinister turn as the demonic antagonist. Somehow made all the more creepy by his co-stars towering over him (perhaps giving the indication how he is a dirty old man), Englund's most famous role prior to Krueger was as a friendly alien in the hit sci-fi show V, so Craven's decision to cast against type was an inspired move. Langenkamp also shines in her role, adding a vulnerability and intelligence that makes the character's development from victim to violator an interesting transition. Sadly, much of the supporting cast provide weak performances, most notably Depp, making his screen debut. Lacking the charisma and depth he would apply to his later roles, Glen is a one-dimensional character who, whilst adding a little humor to the story, does little to provide genuine sympathy.<br/><br/>elmstreet3Craven's achievements with both the creation of Krueger and the endless delivery of surreal set pieces are remarkable. Having previously been responsible for a slew of movies that ranged from average to awful, A Nightmare on Elm Street saw the filmmaker developing as both a storyteller and a director. Occasionally adding a touch of brilliance when exploring the illogical nature of dreams (the stairs that inexplicably turn into goo being a perfect example), Craven's script was more of a deranged fairytale than a straightforward slasher. One theme that the film explored that had become a common aspect of his work was the protagonist being forced to become as savage and calculating as the antagonist, something that had also been explored in The Last House on the Left and The Hills Have Eyes. Despite a laughable epilogue that had been included at the insistence of the producer, A Nightmare on Elm Street was a highly original and inventive horror that successfully lived up the promise of its unique concept."

"sunshinebeachcinema","6","0","0","30 December 2013"," The last of the big three slasher franchises, a unique villain and a unique protagonist.
","The third of the big three slasher franchises came latest, well into the '80s, and has ended up being my favourite. Like Halloween it's suburban, taking place in and around a few houses on the titular Elm Street as teenagers are picked off by a sadistic killer (with a relatively low, early instalment body count).<br/><br/>What sets A Nightmare on Elm Street apart from its rivals is Freddy Krueger, who again became a horror icon. With his trademark hat and clawed glove (long razor blades attached to each finger), he has a striking silhouette, which is played with during the first act of the film until his face is later revealed – and a grotesque, burned visage it is.<br/><br/>Writer and director Wes Craven creates an altogether different villain. He does not stalk the woods with a machete, but is wholly supernatural, and inhabits the world of nightmares, playing off a typical childhood fear – that things in your nightmares could become real.<br/><br/>This film is largely rooted in these childhood concerns; Freddy's arrival is heralded by skipping children who sing an ethereal, unsettling rhyme, and another major theme is that of disconnection between children and parents.<br/><br/>Typically, the adults are worse than useless, dismissing the concerns of heroine Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp) as mere dreams, even when her friends start dying in their sleep, and she pulls Freddy's hat back into the real world with her.<br/><br/>But there's more to this than meets the eye; hints are dropped throughout that Nancy's mother knows more than she's letting on, and it is later revealed that the erstwhile Freddy, a child murderer, was burned alive by the parents of Elm Street. Freddy's plan is one of pure revenge.<br/><br/>As a character, Freddy is certainly unhinged and despicable, but is prone to more gags and wisecracking. In the dream world, he's the boss, ands he likes to play around. He is not merely a lumbering stunt man in a mask, but is played by an actual actor, Robert England, who is now an established horror veteran as a result of his work on the series (he has played Freddy in nine Elm Street films between 1984 and 2003).<br/><br/>Unbound by the limitations of physical reality, he scares his victims with acts of self mutilation, which are not just body horror but also sight gags, another element of the series' more tongue in cheek take on the horror genre.<br/><br/>He toys with his victims, slicing his gut to reveal maggots and green goo – at one point, a victim grabs his face, and the flesh simply comes away. Freddy lets this happen, to display his control and the hopelessness of the situation.<br/><br/>All of this provides the opportunity for some great practical special effects to showcase Freddy's dream manipulation, which may well be lost in a modern production (I've yet to see the 2010 remake, so the validity of this remains to be seen).<br/><br/>Freddy stretches his face through the wall above Nancy's bed, and makes the staircase melt into quicksand. A scene where Freddy's glove attacks Nancy in the bath (part of a limited scattering of sexual imagery) was achieved by building the bathroom set above a larger tank of water. Other gravity defying effects were shot on upside-down sets.<br/><br/>One of Freddy's victims is a young Johnny Depp in his very first cinematic role, and his death scene reputedly holds some kind of record for the sheer volume of fake blood used in a single movie (500 gallons, according to IMDb).<br/><br/>If Freddy is a unique villain, Nancy Thompson is a refreshingly different final girl. She does not spend the entire film fleeing in terror, or cowering in cupboards like some of her predecessors, but is altogether more pragmatic and determined. She sets out to defeat Freddy, and constructs a gauntlet of Home Alone-style traps throughout her house before pulling Freddy into reality for the final showdown.<br/><br/>The nightmares themselves are a high point. If Halloween was set in suburbia, and Friday the 13th in the woods, A Nightmare on Elm Street really takes place in the mind. Wes Craven blurs the line between dreams and reality; although the nightmares have a darker atmosphere in terms of lighting and colour palette, the transition is almost unnoticeable until Freddy appears. Dreamlike location switches are also used – Nancy leaves a boiler room, and appears on her front lawn.<br/><br/>The ending is strangely ambiguous, although slasher films frequently end with a final confusing shock or sequel hook. With this final scene, it is not clear how much of what we have witnessed was real, and what was just a dream, so while it's a head scratcher, that's really the point."

","Plot:<br/><br/>You all know the drill, I'm sure. Freddy Krueger was murdered in an incident where the parents of Elm Street turned on him. Now, he's back or resurrected in the dreams of the children of the parents. The children are now teenagers and are being haunted by the knived-crusader. If you are killed in the dream, you die in real life. Now since this is the first movie, it's safe to say this original idea is brilliant. I've never heard of something some random, yet so awesome in my life. The concept is great, but the only thing that holds this movie up is the characters. The deaths are a little cheesy today, but they're still fun to watch. The point of the film is to see the characters survive. It's much more thrilling to see Nancy or Glenn running away from Freddy, rather than being killed by him.<br/><br/>Characters:<br/><br/>Freddy is a pure joker. He kills kids and he loves it. He knows he can get away with it and can do anything he wants in the dream, so why not have fun with it? He makes jokes and uses situations to make puns and grim humor. That's what makes this movie so awesome: seeing Robert Englund as Freddy. He's the perfect fit for the killer and does a great job being the murdering jokester. Heck, in the sixth film, he kill off one of the teenagers by using a video game console and a Power Glove from the NES. It's all about having fun at the kids' expense... meaning death. Well, I went off on a large tangent, so let's talk about the other kids. Nancy is a strong-headed and independent lady who is currently enrolled in High School on Elm Street. She's experiencing the dreams too and her life is affected by them. By the climax of the film, she does something awesome and unbelievable to stop it, but I won't spoil it. She knows what to do to not get killed, unlike some of the other kids, but still looks out for them, especially her boyfriend, Glenn. Glenn is played by newcomer Johnny Depp, from Pirates of the Caribbean and so many other damn movies now. The man is a funny, strong, caring, but a little careless all at the same time. He's a nice character that doesn't have too much depth, but works for the story.<br/><br/>Visuals:<br/><br/>They're obviously outdated, but they're still fun to look at. The stretched arms of Freddy nowadays look so damn fake it isn't funny, but don't focus on that. Think about the other things they had to do. Have you seen the film before? Remember when Freddy starts running towards Tina at night on the street? Well, there's a wide shot of him running and the camera pans as Tina runs past the camera and then the camera stops to show Freddy teleported to right in front of her. Well, the man running in the wide shot was a double and Robert Englund was standing there the whole time. It's movie-making like this that makes me appreciate how the movie was made, rather than if they look one hundred percent realistic.<br/><br/>Sound:<br/><br/>The main theme song and soundtrack have become a staple in pop culture. Almost everyone on this planet, I guarantee you, can start singing along to: ""1, 2, Freddy's Coming for you... 3, 4, Better lock your doors... 5, 6, Grab your crucifix... 7, 8, Gonna stay up late... 9, 10, Never sleep again."" They even did a new rendition of this song for the 2010 remake.<br/><br/>Rewatchability:<br/><br/>It's a fun horror movie, especially if you've never seen it before. At LEAST see it once. It's worth your time. And, if you DO have time, go see the third movie. (The second movie has nothing to do with the first movie)"

","Freddy Krueger has become a household name, which all began from the psychologically straining original: A Nightmare On Elm Street. Everyone has either thought or actively thinks that nightmares may have some way of manipulating the real world, which in turn can cause a supernatural being to be granted the powers to physically and mentally damage a person. This film is exactly what that is about, which is what makes it so effective. The story itself is unsettling. A group of teens are being savagely murdered one by one and the only explanation from authorities are claims of foul play amongst themselves. What they are unaware of is that the long deceased Freddy Krueger, a former janitor at the local kindergarten, has come back for revenge. And the only way his revenge can be exacted is through nightmares. Why is he seeking revenge you ask? Watch the film and find out. I guarantee it will leave you feeling paranoid and if you are able to think clearly throughout your dreams, I can also guarantee that the supernatural serial killer Freddy Krueger will haunt your thoughts. Personally, I found the story-line fast-paced, intriguing, unsettling and in your face, which is what makes this film so special. The topics it enforces were far from acceptable in the year it was made, which makes this thrilling and controversial film one of my all-time favorites. If you are a horror fan but have not had the time to watch A Nightmare On Elm Street, put every other film on your watch-list aside and watch this film right now! Literally, as you read this, run to your nearest video store and get yourself a copy! You will not be disappointed. I give this film an 8 out of 10. Perfection in the horror genre is hard to accomplish, but this film comes pretty close to myself giving it a perfect score."

","This movie is a rare masterpiece that was way ahead of its time, everything from the special effects to the music composition. I can't think of a better original horror film to date.<br/><br/>Lets start with the special effects, the effects used on Freddy's face are incredible. The realistic look of it and the acting from Robert Englund has made this a truly terrifying character for all audiences through the generations.<br/><br/>The film follows the story of Nancy Thompson, a high school student who gets stalked in her dreams by a murderer, Freddy Krueger. Freddy is out to kill her and her neighborhood friends while they sleep. It has a great twist ending that leaves you hanging for more. This movie spawned many sequels and a remake as well.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie portrays the real terror that the characters would be feeling. We are introduced to Johnny Depp for the first time in this movie, he plays the friend and neighbor of the main character, Nancy (Heather Langenkamp). It also features Ronee Blakley as Nancy's mum and Amanda Wyss as Nancy's friend.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves horror/thriller or even scarier classics. 9/10"

","I must say with all the time that has passed and sequels (most of which suck)that have been made this holds up really well. The story of a child murder that got burned alive by angry parents that comes back to kill their children in their dreams is brilliant. Wes Craven did a great job here I must say,as well as Robert Englund. The younger cast did alright acting wise and is rounded out by screen veteran John Saxon.The death scenes are good and my favorite is when Johnny Depp gets killed. He is'nt bad here actually,but I can't stand most of his work. In my opinion Nightmare 3 Dream Warriors is as good as this and ties a lot of stuff from the 1st film together. Nightmare 2 is horrible and is nowhere near close to the quality of the 1st and 3rd films."

","After Halloween and Friday the 13th became successful franchises, another horror movie came out in the early 80s and the premise of that horror film is about dreaming about a demon who wears a glove with five knives. This, A Nightmare on Elm Street, is such a movie and when it was released in theaters in 1984, it became a worldwide hit and spawned a bunch of sequels.<br/><br/>The reason why I'm reviewing it is that even though I was born in the 90s, I will admit that seeing this for the very first time, I was really blown away and consider this to be a classic. To others, it may feel a little dated, but to others, there is a lot to like about it.<br/><br/>The story is not only a terrifying one, but it's also a character study and it works really well. It also has a lot of frightening moments that would spook the wits out of those who have seen it. The characters are solid and it's well-acted, especially Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger, who is by far one of the best movie villains in history. Even the death scenes are so over-the-top and creative.<br/><br/>Overall, A Nightmare on Elm Street is a classic and I'd recommend this to those who haven't seen it to start off Halloween.

"Nothinggrandproductions","9","0","0","23 October 2013"," A slasher masterpiece among the pile of generic ones
","A Nightmare on Elm Street is a special film for me. It's one of the first movies that really got me interested in movies and everything about them. Actually, when I first got into movies, it was mostly horror movies and this one always stuck out. From the frightening character of Freddy Kreuger (and Robert Englund's great performance), questioning what scenes were dreams and which were reality, the camera work, and the performances being great for the most part, this movie is a standout slasher flick from the piles of generic ones. <br/><br/>The movie opens up with us not having a clue as to what is going on. An unknown person is creating a glove with knives on it. Then, it cuts to Tina Gray (Amanda Wyss) having a nightmare about this man with his glove. It's a simple but effective opening. The next day, we find that Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp), Glen Lantz (Johnny Depp in his film debut), and Rod Lane (Nick Corri) all had the same nightmare, and this man wants to kill them all, but why? One of the best aspects of this film is how things don't get explained to us. Who is this man with the burnt face and knife hands attacking these children? It is towards the end of the film where we finally get answers and it works so well because we don't know. <br/><br/>Regardless, this film is filled with plenty of terrifying sequences. From the first death on screen which is mixture of reality and dreams and scenes in the school hallway to the boiler room, each scene is crafted to perfection. The camera work stands out in this film especially when compared to horror movies today which are filled with shaky cam and not being able to tell what is even going on. In this movie, they don't hesitate. The camera will follow characters as they run from Freddy chasing them down and it won't shake the camera around like crazy. It keeps everything clear. This is the defining slasher movie in my opinion. It's tasteful, well-done, and actually has interesting themes with dreams. And it unfortunately led to (mostly) crappy sequels just like most slasher flicks did (although, the 3rd sequel and Wes Craven's New Nightmare are actually really great). Overall, this movie will always be special as one of the first films I ever really got into and besides that, it's just a fantastic horror film that knew what it wanted to do."

","I have a confession. I'm a sucker for slasher movies. So maybe this isn't a totally objective opinion. But if this film isn't a classic horror movie I don't know what is! The premise is famous: the dreaded killer Freddy Krueger stalks teenagers in their dreams. There are a lot of iconic scenes, such as the bed that swallows a person whole, or Freddy's stretching arms, or the girl who's dragged violently across the ceiling. That last one is actually really haunting and looks good even on today's standards. Practical effects just have that magic to them.<br/><br/>The acting is a bit over-the-top, the hairdos scream 80's fashion, as do the clothes, and the dialog is a bit cheesy, but I feel all these elements serve to create an enjoyably familiar and entertaining setting of comic horror."

","Without a doubt this is one of my favorites. Also this is the scariest one in the entire series. Although New Nightmare was scary but not as scary as this one. Also the acting is fantastic and features a great cast of actors who later became big stars after this film. Including a young Johnny Depp which this is his very first film. Also i ain't gonna lie i think Heather Langenkamp is hot in this and she's even hot in A Nightmare On Elm Street 3 Dream Warriors and even New Nightmare she is a total hot girl and one of my favorite hot girls of horror films. Also Robert Englund is without a doubt the best Freddy Krueger. Although Jackie Earle Haley did good as Freddy Krueger for the remake but not as good as Robert Englund he is the Freddy Krueger and always will be. This film used to scare me in the past around the time i first watched it. But after awhile i got used to it after watching it over and over again. And it never gets old i can watch it over and over again and never get tired of it. Because it is such a classic horror film. And definitely is a must own for horror fans out there."

","This is what I call ""extreme supernatural slashers"". Great movie with a great story.<br/><br/>The only thing what makes the whole movie (for me) a little worse, instead of 10/10, 9/10 is that sometimes it's kind of ""to easy"" to beat Freddy, the movie killer. I mean, not like really easy, he's just ""not so strong"" and he's completely powerless in reality.<br/><br/>But the good thing is also, that Freddy can kill you in your dreams, that means you are extremely powerless when escaping away from him. It's his world and you're trapped inside. But when you pull him out of his world, it's way to easy to beat him as i already mentioned. Also, the way of killing in this movie is pretty great. Like, totally bloody and really original. (I won't reveal parts, cause then it will be a spoiler). So when i was watching that movie, it was really great but still not as good as Halloween or Friday the 13. But i must say, that 2010 remake of that movie (no offense) sucked.."

","When her friends start dying in their sleep of apparent suicides, a teen finds the source of the strange incidents to be the returning spirit of a killer murdered by her parents and seeking revenge against the children and must find a way to stop him.<br/><br/>This here is one of the more controversial of the classic-era horror films because a lot of what makes it so appealing is due to historical significance and reputation rather than any actual merits of the film itself. The main source of the film's reputation is the rather clever and unique manner of the killer's back-story, which here is made to showcase one of the more common archetypes of horror, the sins of the mothers and fathers repeating to their sons and daughters, but is done with such a unique and original take that there's a sense of originality in the work and that makes for some of the best sequences in the film like the bed-attack where she levitates in mid-air while being ambushed, the first encounter in the alley and the final showdown in the house with all sorts of nightmarish situations being utilized in the battle by both sides. These are high-quality scenes that work not only because they're incredibly creepy but also due to the big action-spectacle they endow the film with, and when it's coupled with the fun special effects present and several ingenious kills, this one does have some positives. The main flaw to this one, though, is the fact that there's a hidden clue to the film's sense of reality-bending that really makes it easy to write off a lot of what happens and takes a lot of the sting out of this one with how it handles its' main villain. That really makes this one feel a lot less creepy than it really is, as well as the ending which undoes everything that's happened and doesn't seem to really offer much beyond a lame jump, but otherwise this one still has some going for it.<br/><br/>Rated R: Graphic Violence, Brief Nudity, Adult Language, and an off-camera sex scene."
"tomgillespie2002","8","0","0","5 February 2013"," A powerful, deeply disturbing idea
","By 1983 the horror sub-genre of slasher films were dwindling, offering largely imitations of the hugely successful Friday the 13th series (in 1984 Friday had it's 'Final Chapter' that proved to be eventually false), with films such as Curtains, The Forest or Sleepaway Camp. Whilst the majority of these films expressed the vapid nature of teenagers as throwaway avatars for murder, they continued with the conventions set out by John Carpenter's Halloween (1978), but added very little in originality or invention. Of course, Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street was not the first slasher to involve a supernatural villain - Uli Lommel's ridiculous The Boogeyman (1980) - along with Halloween's Michael Myers - had utilised these elements before, but Craven's nightmare hook turned what could have been a standard early- '80's horror film into something quite original and filled with socio- political ideas.<br/><br/>Wes Craven at this point in his career had made the notorious (and still quite shocking) debut, The Last House on the Left (1972), the mediocre, yet well known The Hills Have Eyes (1977) and the failed mystery, Deadly Blessing (1981) - amongst other inferior projects. He had yet to display his intelligent subversion of horror conventions that are now well known though the Scream franchise (1996 - 2011), but within the foundation of his slasher screenplay, was a concept inspired by a real-life mystery that he embellished, creating what is now an icon of the genre. Craven read in the newspapers about a young Asian boy who was fearful of sleep, telling his parents that someone was after him in his dreams. One night his physician father gave him sleeping pills, and the boy violently died in his sleep. So, what if there was someone attempting to kill a group of teenagers in their sleep? Well, it would surely make for an interesting narrative, and one that would equally be frightening, smart and original.<br/><br/>In this context, Krueger represents America's violent past, from the decimation of native Indians, through the depravity of civil war, to the embarrassment of the failed war in Vietnam. Reagan wanted to present the nation as a clean-cut, progressive society, and with the religious right now on his side (before 1980, state and religion were separated by the constitution, until Republicans realised the number of voters that could be gained by ""preaching"" god and country into their policies). In the first real introduction of Krueger proper in the film, the young Tina (Amanda Wyss) stands in an alleyway, and he enters at the other side, his Fedora hat in silhouette, he stands like a figure from the old western frontier, the music suggests the genre conventions of a John Ford film. But this is an outlaw figure twisted to reveal to the youth of the '80's that they are no longer able to believe the lies and deceits of parent and government. But Krueger is also a spectre of the past, who will correct the wrongs by eliminating the future, tearing apart the fabric of the fallacy created to whitewash any infractions of history.<br/><br/>Aside from subtextual concepts that run through the film, there is ample room for inventive, bloody deaths. The supernatural infuses the script and lets fantasy become overindulged. From the horrific death of Tina, whose body, slashed with the finger knives, is dragged onto the ceiling where she screams for life, to Johnny Depp's screen debut, where his body is pulled into his bed, gushing out blood at an impossible rate, the bloodletting is both horrifying and informatively original. In Nancy we have the standard final girl of the sub-genre, but she is far more intelligent than previous girls. Langenkamp portrays the strong-willed female with confidence. But fundamentally, unlike films such as Friday the 13th or Halloween, the ""monster"" seems to have purpose, his vengeance almost justified by the legality of his murder; legitimised by a troubled past. In a way, Krueger looks over the teenagers, like the incredibly effective scene where his claws and face push through the wall above the sleeping Nancy, he peeks into the wrong bedroom, but he wants to expose the fabrication of history.<br/><br/>I first saw A Nightmare on Elm Street on video in 1985 (a friends brother rented it for us - I was 9), and it was one of the first modern horror films I was introduced to. To be honest it was a bit of a revelation, and I can easily state that it probably changed my life, in the sense that I saw a film that played with film form, and presented the concept and atmosphere of a dream/nightmare in such a primal and effective way. It is certainly a film that has stayed in my sub- conscious ever since. The impact of the film, and its central, monstrous conceit (Krueger), has been watered down with seven inferior sequels (which I will be reviewing over the next few months), and has therefore lost the thing that made it work on so many levels. But, watching this film as a stand alone narrative, it still has a powerful, deeply disturbing idea - we all sleep, we all dream. What if that activity that we all need to survive could kill you? The only real failure of this first movie is the multiple, farcical endings that time has been unkind to. It seems that director and producer, Robert Shaye, were unable to agree on a suitable end, but resolved to use them all. But it is still a film of interesting beauty and mood, and a film that I will no doubt return to in the future.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

But the original movie was still the best one and it will always be my favourite one and i don't think that will ever change.it just seemed to me that none of the sequels had what this film had,they didn't have the same creepy atmosphere that this film had and they didn't have the same intensity that this film had either so i just couldn't get into the sequels as much as i got into this one.this film was so terrifying i felt like i was actually in it! and none of the others did that for me but this film had everything!. I thought The lead girl played by Heather Langenkamp was very likable and i wanted her to win against Freddy and i found myself cheering for her throughout the whole movie.With the sequels i couldn't seem to do that with the main Characters and that's why i think this one is the best out of the lot. The only sequel that came close to being as scary as the first film is Wes Cravens New Nightmare and I'd Say it's My Second favourite elm street film.<br/><br/>the Original Elm street film has a lot of fun and creepy moments in it like there's a nightmare scene at one point in the movie when Heather sees a dead person in a body bag standing in her school Hallway calling her name and later there is another scene where the dead person in the body-bag gets dragged away leaving a huge trail of blood behind. that was one of the creepiest scenes in the whole movie! and there was another creepy scene in the film when she sees the dead person in the body bag again only this time she sees cockroaches coming out of its mouth! and she sees them under the body bag!. that's what's so good about this film you have tons of creepy moments instead of lame jump scares like you have in the sequels and this film was also very suspenseful and entertaining and i thought the ending was pretty good too when Heather fights with Freddy and she sets a bunch of bobby traps for him and he falls victim to all of them and then she overpowers Freddy and takes him down!.The film had a great pace and a great build up to the ending and the fight between Freddy and Heather at the end of the movie was cool and well edited and Heather was a BadAss! in this movie! she kicked Freddy's Ass! and i quite liked the twist at the end of the movie too it was a twist that surprised me so i thought it was a good twist. All in all this was a great film with great acting and great Characters and it was by far the creepiest and best film in the series!. This is one of the best horror films iv'e ever seen!."

","In the slasher sub genre, one that's particularly crowded with all sorts of efforts, studio and independent productions alike, of high and low budgets, Wes Craven's ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" still reigns supreme as one of the more imaginative of the entire bunch. Nightmares have been fodder for many horror films over the years, but here they're particularly insidious and memorable. The film basically turned its producing studio, New Line Cinema, into a major player, gave a fresh breath of life into a sub genre that had grown stale, boosted the career of Craven, turned its dream haunting, scarred bogeyman Freddy Krueger into a pop culture icon (hat, red & green striped sweater, designer glove and all), and made co-star Robert Englund (as Krueger) a bona fide genre star. The impact it's made in 31 years is simply undeniable.<br/><br/>The story deals with Krueger, a depraved murderer of children, who was executed by a vengeful vigilante mob, and who now lives on in the nightmares of the mob members' children. Resourceful, feisty young Nancy (appealing Heather Langenkamp) realizes it's up to her to combat Freddy - on his own terms - before he can continue to claim victims, while her peers and the adults around her think she's simply going insane.<br/><br/>Many ingenious ideas here when it comes to the world of nightmares, and as this thing plays out it's not always clear where the nightmare ends and reality begins. The boiler room is one hell of a wonderful, atmospheric, and sinister location, and that glove, with knives attached to the fingers, really is a thing of macabre beauty. The movie is fantastically gory, yet other special effects are often just as impressive; there is an undeniable appeal in seeing effects done when the digital revolution was still years away and things were accomplished practically. Jacques Haitkins' cinematography is often wonderfully moody, and Charles Bernstein contributes what has to be one of the most catchy and haunting scores of the genre, up to and including that jump rope ditty.<br/><br/>The cast runs a little hot and cold as some of the performances aren't all that great, but it's still a decent assemblage of talent, from veterans John Saxon and Ronee Blakley, to Langenkamp, Amanda Wyss, Jsu Garcia, and Johnny Depp (in his feature debut) as the imperiled kids to character players like Charles Fleischer, Lin Shaye, and Joe Unger. Langenkamps' Nancy is a heroine for whom you do want to root, and Englund, although it hardly needs to be said, delivers a deliciously evil performance; given how silly a character Freddy eventually became, it's nice to see him in the days when he was still plenty scary.<br/><br/>All in all, ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is one of the quintessential films of its genre that's pretty much required viewing for newcomers.<br/><br/>Nine out of 10."

","In 1984, Wes Creven was consecrated as reference works to launch terror scary A Nightmare on Elm Street that even with characteristics of B- movie called - as grotesque passages - and ended up revolutionizing the genre has become a benchmark for future works of the type . It is impossible to understand the importance of the saga Freddy Krueger without taking into account the year's production work and also the consequences for the market of its kind.<br/><br/>What A Nightmare on Elm Street loop to the status of classic terror is, above all, its creative story that, until the outcome surreal, can make a credible plot implausible. The script's own Wes Craven's original and well tied to the point of building in the first film in the saga a fascinating villain. The mysteries about Freddy Krueger and his motives for attacking the youth group of Elm Street are developed effectively. The sadistic killer strikes Nancy (Heather Langenkamp) and her group of friends during their dreams, but nightmares that could be seen simply as the greatest torments wounds occurred during sleep in young people leave marks in real life too.<br/><br/>The taste for torture that moves Krueger takes the viewer to witness real bloodshed. The special effects, if viewed from the perspective current is weak, and therefore, scenes that should increase in voltage as unfold eventually becomes comedy. However, for the time, the effects were effective and consistent with reality - especially budget - films B.<br/><br/>You can, for example, see the mattress placed on a ladder so that the interpreter Krueger actor Robert Englund, do not get hurt during the fall. However, the strength of A Nightmare on Elm Street is just in its history, and not on details of production, as the effects, which are primary. Still, Craven managed to insert chilling passages and mark all the long series, such as the unforgettable scenes in which girls dressed in white sing the song ""Freddy's coming to get you.""<br/><br/>The classic final scene, with the hood of the car in the colors of the blanket Krueger and Nancy's mother waving at her daughter with a smile on his face, show that the Nightmare on Elm Street brought remarkable sequences for the film. Fits this regard, the passages in which Nancy's phone rings even after the girl Tues pulled the wires of the device and when she, in a dream, follow your body's friend killed in the corridors of the college.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is outstanding and extremely efficient in function to create anxiety and tension and this aspect is undoubtedly one of the highlights of the entire series to contribute to the tone of this abnormality in the plots.<br/><br/>The final uncertain, and controversial, initially confuses the viewer. Was it all a nightmare widespread? If so, how to explain the final scene? Is, then, everything was the same as we imagined, a mix of nightmares and reality, and the final scene is more of a nightmare that still haunts the young Nancy? And so we await the sequel, knowing that reality and delusion mingle all the time and with enough subtlety. And that is why, also, that the screenplay is praiseworthy and the movie, after all, is more interesting than it seemed.<br/><br/>There is no doubt that Freddy Krueger is one of the most - if not the most - interesting characters in film history, and his saga, as bad as are the subsequent films, it is interesting to explore and keep alive the one who helped consecrate the terror as an important genre."

","Wes Craven's A nightmare on elm street is a seminal film. It ranks right up their with his other best films, Last house on the left and Scream. The film is about a group of teens that are stalked and killed in their dreams. Ten years before the story begins we find out that a child killer was freed on a botched search warrant, and the parents took the law into their own hands by burning him to death. The killer's name is Freddy Krueger. After his death he is granted the ability to exact revenge by entering the dreams of the children that killed him. A nightmare on elm street is a great film. One of it's strengths of the film is that it's open to interpretation. I believe that towards the end of the film the lead character Nancy is tricked into thinking that she pulled Freddy into reality. But the whole time she is still dreaming,i actually believe that the entire third act is a dream. The good about the film is it has an intriuging premise, and has mostly good music. Robert England is excellent as Freddy, John Saxon does a superb job as Nancy's cop/father, also look for a young Johnny Depp in his first movie role. A nightmare on elm street also does a good job blending dreams with reality. So you're probably wandering why i called this a flawed classic, so here's the bad. Some of the music and definitely the sound effects are terribly dated. Also the acting is left to be desired in some spots, not to mention the film features a pretty weak ending. But overall you are looking at a definitive horror classic."

","A Nightmare on Elm Street is probably Craven's most gritty film that went all out on some frightening bizarre scenes and borderline outrageous storyline. However, the movie works well, so much that Freddy Krueger has become a widely known killer villain. The introduction of Freddy was nearly perfect showcasing a great character. The supporting cast around Krueger was subpar but its easy to overlook. The pacing is great being fast in the beginning, releasing tension in the middle leading up to a great ending. The music is solid, atmosphere could have been a little better but overall a terrific movie in A Nightmare on Elm Street. A must see for horror fans."

","Most of the time, dead teen flicks are pretty standard-issue. A deranged, masked killer slowly stalks a group of teens and picks them off in a variety of inventive ways. It could take place at summer camp, or in a mine, or any number of isolated locations. But along came this, Wes Craven's best and most demented. And with it, dear Ole Wes set out to do something a little different with the genre. A group of high school friends are having weird dreams about the same badly-scarred man in a dirty fedora, striped sweater, and a glove with razor claws. But what of it, they're only nightmares... right?! WRONG!!! See, it turns out that man is none other than Freddy Krueger. Years ago, back when he was alive, some parents burned him for being a child murderer. Now, he's back to attack their offspring in their dreams. As their numbers dwindle, a teen named Nancy chooses to try and fight Freddy. The script is pitch-perfect. So are the remarkable performances by Heather Langenkamp as Nancy and a young Johnny Depp as Glen, Nancy's boyfriend. And of course, Robert Englund as Freddy. He gives the role a true sense of menace. Unlike the sequels, this one at least treats Freddy dead seriously, with a wicked streak of humor. The elaborate death and dream sequences are some of the most imaginative. Half the time, you'll be wondering ""Is this a dream or real?"" Unfortunately, the ending is kind of a letdown. But apart from that, this is a solid entry in the dead teen flicks and should be required viewing for all horror fans. Just watch out, Freddy may be coming for you!!!"

"Robert_duder","8","0","0","22 August 2011"," Legendary Horror comes to life with a deep story and blood and guts
","Slasher flicks are my favourite. The legendary ones like Friday the 13th, Halloween, and Nightmare On Elm Street are legendary for a reason. They spawn multiple sequels, they have a memorable killer, and in this case they have an amazing story. I think where A Nightmare On Elm Street stands out on its own is because Wes Craven is a truly outstanding writer and creator and he didn't just rest on blood and guts and slashing teenagers but actually put a story behind this killer, a very real story, that could be explored in future instalments and actually makes the killer seem that much more disturbing. Also you have this really brilliant idea of a killer that kills in your dreams. Anything goes in dreams...Wes Craven single handedly got rid of any concern about whether something is believable or not because this killer is in their dreams. The only reality in dreams is what's happening. A hot young cast, a great director and the birth of one of the most chilling killers in history...Freddy Kreuger makes this truly memorable, fun, chilling, disturbing and just plain fun all at once.<br/><br/>I always joke that star and scream queen Heather Langenkamp always lives up to her name...the 'kamp' part of it because every performance she does is campy. But at the same time she's cute and down to earth and somehow you relate to her but some of her emotions and expressions are bordering on hilarious but it works because her Nancy is the legendary scream queen of Nightmare. Johnny Depp in his premier role is recognizable and certainly has a handsome quality to him. He doesn't particularly stand out but he does a decent job and the chemistry between him and Langenkamp (his love interest) is sort of minimal. Other teenie fodder for death includes Amanda Wyss and Jsu Garcia, both of which do a good job but again nothing that will stand out. Depp, Wyss and Garcia are better than your average Friday the 13th victims because I think Craven gives characters more depth. John Saxon is actually one of my favourite Nightmare characters as Nancy's Dad and the no-nonsense Sheriff who buried Freddy's remains after killing him. Saxon gives a great performance in the small screen time he has but he really does stand out as a seasoned actor. Oh yes and of course Freddy Kreuger...the legend is brought to life by a legend in his own right Robert Englund. Certainly no one knows Freddy better than Englund and he makes him come to life in all his sarcastic, twisted, gory glory.<br/><br/>I mean what can I say about writer and director Wes Craven. The man is a horror master and was even when this was created. The Hills Have Eyes and The Last House On The Left already set a bar for gore and disgust so this was tame compared to those. He simply created an iconic character, gave life to the other characters and made us believe this could happen. His story is timeless and creepy and the special effects, especially given the budget, are terrifying eerie. A Nightmare On Elm Street set the bar for horror flicks after it. It is more than a slasher, and while I feel like as I'm watching them all (I am making my way through the entire Nightmare On Elm Street and Friday the 13th series) the sequels to this fell off far faster than Friday the 13th, there is still a lot of greatness to be found in the original classic horror flick A Nightmare On Elm Street. 8.5/10"

","!!!!SPOILERS!!!! Wes craven can go to his grave knowing that he made two of the best horror movies (nightmare on elm street & Scream)in this classic a teenage girl and her friends are having nightmares about a burned man with knives attached to a glove. that right there is got to be the most creative plot ever the idea of someone killing you in your dreams which causes you to die in real life is terrifying that and the fact you cant run away from it you have to sleep and sooner or later you will fall asleep and then Freddy will get you and unlike Michael myers or Jason vorhess who you can just simply run away from if the characters would stop being dumb-asses and learn to run Freddy can do anything in the dream so running away isn't going to help speaking of the dreams at times in the movie it would blur the line between dreams and reality which would confuse the people watching the film which was a genius idea. this movie also has some of the most gruesome but creative deaths for example the scene where johnny depps character glen falls asleep and get pulled into the bed he was sleeping on or Tina Grey who got drug up the wall and the ceiling its amazing that they were able to these special effects considering the extremely low budget the character devolpment is great they devolpe Freddy just enough well this review cant do this movie justice just go watch the movie and see for your self"
"that_jed_guy","8","0","0","28 June 2011"," ""Don't Fall Asleep""- A look back at the first Nightmare on Elm Street
","The first Nightmare on Elm Street was released in 1984, was written and directed by Wes Craven. Craven already had 2 successful horror movies under his belt, The Last House on the Left and The Hill's Have Eyes. The idea for ""nightmare"" came from a newspaper article that Craven had read where a young boy was actually found dead from suffering a terrifying nightmare. He then wrote the script to nightmare and showed it to New Line Cinema which back then was only a small film company that wasn't doing much business.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie involves 4 teenagers who are stalked and killed one by one in their dreams by a man named Fred Krueger or better known as Freddy Krueger played by Robert Englund. What's scary about Freddy is that he is horribly burnt from head to toe and he wears a menacing glove with razors or knives for fingers. He also wears a brown and beaten fedora hat and a dirty red and green sweater. <br/><br/>The basic story behind Freddy's character is that when he was alive, he was a child murderer in the town of Springwood. When the parents of Springwood found out, they decided to band together and hunt him down out of justice and revenge. They found him in his boiler room and so they set fire to it and burned it down killing Freddy in the process. That's the reason why he comes back and kills their kids in their dreams: out of revenge. What sets Freddy apart from other horror villains like Jason Voorhees, Michael Myers and Leatherface is that he has a personality and a very sick sense of humour. The fun in watching the Nightmare on Elm Street movies comes from the special effects and Freddy's sick sense of humour. Freddy can do pretty much anything in the dream world and that's part of what makes him and the movie scary, the fact that you're more vulnerable when you're asleep. <br/><br/>The main character is a teenage girl named Nancy. Throughout the movie she's afraid to go to sleep after her best friend was killed by Freddy and because every time she falls asleep Freddy attempts to kill her. In the end, she decides face Freddy and defeat him by literally bringing him into the real world. What I like about her is that she actually uses her brain and defends herself against Freddy. In one scene she sets an alarm clock to wake herself up and near the end of the movie she rigs her house with traps. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp plays Nancy's boyfriend, Glen. Like some of the other characters in the film such as, the parents, he is sceptical towards the existence of the paranormal which in my opinion is a big mistake because the characters who say that a particular thing or person doesn't exist usually die horribly and believe me; his death scene is pretty memorable. It's interesting to note that the first movie Johnny Depp starred in was the first Nightmare on Elm Street. <br/><br/>One of the things that I like about the movie is the colour contrast between the real world and the dream world. During the day, the suburb of Springwood looks like a friendly place. The houses are white, the grass is green, but in the dream world it has a dark, misty and spooky atmosphere. Also, in the dream world is Freddy's boiler room which is dark, red and has a hellish atmosphere. Whenever Nancy walks down into the boiler room it's almost like she's descending into Hell itself.<br/><br/>The music in a Nightmare on Elm Street is another key element that I like. The theme music is slow and sounds really spooky. Speaking of theme music, Freddy actually has his own nursery rhyme sung by these creepy kids playing jump rope. Freddy's nursery rhyme is another one of Freddy's trademarks which appears throughout the series and is usually heard before he appears.<br/><br/>At times the movie can be a bit confusing for example; there are some moments where you're not sure whether a character is asleep or awake and the very end is the most confusing part because you're not sure whose dream it is. This isn't necessarily a bad thing because it suggests that the nightmare isn't over at all. Wes Craven had actually decided against having a teaser ending, but they ended up making three. <br/><br/>One of my favourite scenes in the entire movie is the opening scene before the film's title appears. It's shown on a small screen and it just shows Freddy's hands actually constructing his infamous glove. Freddy's breathing can be heard in the scene and just before the title appears his hand is shown wearing the glove. It's a scene that gives me goosebumps and lets you know that you're in for a good fun scare. If you're a fan of horror be sure to check it out, because it's a lot of fun."
"jflores28","6","0","0","20 June 2011"," My First Slasher Flick (Spoiler)
","A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) starring Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger, Heather Langenkamp as Nancy Thompson, Johnny Depp as Glen Lantz and Ronee Blakely as Marge Thompson, is, admittedly, the first slasher flick I have ever seen, and although I have extremely limited experience on the topic (I avoid horror movies at all cost) I understand why it is a definite classic.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Krueger, a known child murderer, who gets off on a technicality and as a result is murdered by a mob of angry parents. To exact his revenge, Krueger stalks the parents' children when they are most vulnerable, when they are asleep, and kills them in their dreams.<br/><br/>The main problem I have with horror flicks is that they cause me to have nightmares (I am acutely aware of the irony). I was hoping since this one is so old, I would be able to effectively review it and point out the flaws and unrealistic scenes therefore not have any lingering effects personally. Not the case, at least not for the first half of the film. Writer/director Wes Craven's use of imagery was amazing. I was never quite sure if what I was watching was reality or a nightmare. The nightmare sequences are precise and fluid. Frightening but did not come across as cheap.<br/><br/>The opening scenes show Krueger chasing a victim and eventually killing her in front of her boyfriend. To top it off, he drags her bloody corpse across the ceiling. Nancy has a nightmare set during her English class. It begins with a normal classroom but quickly changes when one of the victims appears in a body bag. These were just a few of the images that will not soon leave my mind, unfortunately. Krueger definitely lives up to the terrifying icon he has been since the movie came out.<br/><br/>In the second part of the film however (after Nancy goes to the dream research center) is when I was able to see some of the downfalls of the movie.<br/><br/>There was one obvious unrealistic part I did find when Nancy tells her father to come and get her in twenty minutes, she then sets up traps throughout the house, has a bonding moment with her mother and ends up getting to bed all in a matter of ten minutes.<br/><br/>I was feeling pretty good when I knew the end was near, impressed with the take away lesson that things only have power over you if you let them, and then the final twist ruins it all. The ending was pretty much a letdown in my opinion. A dream within a dream within a dream!?? It contradicts everything that has happened in the entire film. I understand the reasoning behind it; to lure viewers into the sequel, but I feel they could have done it in a better way instead of creating the feeling of being cheated out of the last two hours."

","I am going to be reviewing the entire collection of A Nightmare on Elm Street, which has a total of eight films (counting Freddy vs. Jason) so let's start at the very beginning where it all kicked off. A Nightmare on Elm Street is famous for being one of the most scariest and original horror movies ever to have been made. Many are scared to watch it, many love it but is it really scary? The answer in a nutshell: yes. The story is brilliant and really captures the mind and imagination of Wes Craven and his filmmaking. The characters were brilliantly written and you cared for the teenagers and you hoped that they would get away from the clutches of the villain or defeat him. The character development involved in the movie was great as we see the main character Nancy turn from a defenceless, scared girl into a fighting, brave woman and we see her literally battle her demons. The acting was brilliant, especially Heather Langenkamp who played our heroine Nancy and Robert Englund who left his mark as the terrifying Freddy Krueger. The cinematography was fantastic, the direction was brilliant and the script was great. The nightmare scenes and the effects were executed magnificently as the cast and crew really pulled it off to make the movie scary and believable.<br/><br/>I love this movie and this is probably my favourite horror movie. The scares are original and don't rely very heavily on blood, guts and gore but jumpy and suspenseful scenes, which I love. The scariest thing about the movie is the fact that Freddy isn't real in the real world but is real in your dreams, which I think, was a very inspired and original thought from Wes Craven. I'm sitting here, typing this movie review trying to think of the pros and cons but I really can't find a fault with this movie. It has everything a horror movie should have, let's hope the sequels keep this quality.<br/><br/>To read more reviews, please visit: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com"

","A Nightmare on Elm Street is certainly one of the better slasher films out there. It's demonic, gripping, gory, horrifying, gruesome, intelligent, and a really good time.<br/><br/>The villain, Freddy Krueger, is one of the greatest villains of all time. He's scary in and of himself. His look is very distinct and his voice alone inspires quite a gripping bit of fear out of the audience. Robert Englund's performance is spotless.<br/><br/>The movie is shaped around a great premise already, and Wes Craven builds the movie very firmly on it, putting it up there with Texas Chain Saw Massacre as being one of the best slasher films. The characters were all very well written and well portrayed. We actually get an emotional bond with some of these characters, and I commend Craven for that.<br/><br/>And the music! The music is just behind the themes from Halloween and Jaws as one of my favorite horror film soundtracks. I loved the music entirely.<br/><br/>The only major complaint I have with this film was the ending. While Craven took the direction with the Final Girl in a refreshingly original way, the ending itself was neither poignant nor satisfying. <br/><br/>That's really the films only major weakness. Other than that, this is sincerely one of the greatest horror films ever made.<br/><br/>8/10"

","This is a very good film. The kills are few, but are very memorable. Sets are also really nice. The lighting in the boiler room is just perfect. The acting is great for a slasher movie. Most of the time slasher movies have either OK or bad actors, but this movie has some good performances. The premise was genius. In all other horror movies the killer will have to either chase someone down or surprise them to kill them. That is not the case with this movie. Here the killer attacks in your dreams where you are most vulnerable. You'll run away, but he can just appearer right in front of you, and kill you. This makes the odds stacked way against the protagonist, and strikes fear into the people watching that they will be slaughtered in their sleep. The score is chilling. It is one of the best horror movie scores ever. The atmosphere created by the music, the sets, and the effects is really good. Then there is the best thing about it. Freddy Krueger is the best horror villain ever. The way he moves, that evil voice, the great kills, the funny lines just make him such a great villain. He is such a likable villain. You care about the characters, but you can't help loving this guy. Robert Englund you are the man. Overall A Nightmare on Elm Street is a classic in horror history.<br/><br/>4 stars out of 4"
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","0","0","4 August 2010"," Fantastical element makes Freddy a memorable slasher in this suspenseful classic
","Nightmares are about the closest any of us get to confronting something truly terrifying. In them everything feels so real, but we wake up and all is fine. Wes Craven sees the powerful possibility for horror by blurring that line and such is the premise of ""A Nightmare on Elm Street,"" a story of teenagers being hunted in their dreams by a burned man with knives attached to his fingers.<br/><br/>""Elm Street"" is not as scary so much as fraught with creepiness and suspense. When Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) does strike, because it is within a dream world independent of reality, the attacks are exciting and original. Essentially, Freddy is nothing but a slasher, but his existence in a ""supernatural"" plane keeps ""Elm Street"" fresh.<br/><br/>One of the under-appreciated story techniques that Craven uses is that he focuses on Tina (Amanda Wyss) for the first 15 minutes and it is with her gruesome death that our attention turns to Nancy (Heather Langenkamp), our true (and infinitely more likable) protagonist. This simple technique of violating expectation sets the tone for the film on a positive note.<br/><br/>As an antagonist, Freddy is simply demented. The one scene where Englund really gets to do any acting is during his assault on Tina in the beginning. He's a goofball -- anything but terrifying. But with the knife fingers and Craven's suspense techniques he becomes as formidable as any slasher.<br/><br/>Outside of the horror elements, Craven excels at creating rules for the dream world that Freddy occupies. It starts with only being able to attack you in his dreams and then expands to including any wounds that you suffer at his expense show through in the real world. Then we later learn you can take things back with you from the dream world into reality. This kind of contextual crafting usually gets reserved for science-fiction movies, so it's refreshing to see another genre trying it out.<br/><br/>The credit for retaining the film's sense of self-seriousness belongs to Langenkamp. She believes in the material as any one of us would in her situation. She's cautious brave about taking on Freddy but not stupid brave. She's not afraid to tell the other characters what's going on but she doesn't act all crazy explaining herself like most protagonists do when the people around them think they're insane. Thanks to her, ""Elm Street"" doesn't necessitate being laughed at for being preposterous; it's genuinely suspenseful and dramatic.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site http://moviemusereviews.com"

If Freddy Krueger kills you, there is no coming back. You die for real, it's reality.<br/><br/>I really love how Wes Craven was able to keep the action so packed into one with this film.

I just loved the entire concept of the film.<br/><br/>I think the dreams idea was very good. There are many things that I found well done with this film - The acting was beautiful as most of the characters where putting out there emotion whether they didn't believe in Krueger or not.

","I hadn't seen this movie until..would you believe it?..LAST YEAR. Yes, I really was that late in seeing this movie. Freddy Krueger always seemed creepy to me and so I avoided the Elm street movies for years. I thought they'd scare me too much((I get scared really easily sometimes)). I found the VHS version of ANOES at a local bookstore and decided to buy it, along with ""New Nightmare"".<br/><br/>I was surprised to find that, not only did ANOES not scare me half to death, I actually enjoyed it! A Nightmare on Elm Street, while it may be a little dated in parts, is a work of art. It shows how so much can be done with so little. It's encouraging, since I've been thinking about getting into making movies myself.<br/><br/>Here's my breakdown of the film: <br/><br/>Plot: 9/10 <br/><br/>Music: 8/10 <br/><br/>Scare factor:2/10 ((For me at least, but that's okay. I didn't want to be scared poopless while watching this movie)).<br/><br/>Characters: 10/10 Wow. I know, right? But the actors and actresses are excellent in this movie. Heather Langenkamp is lovely and talented. She seems to be just your average teenager and isn't over the top. Did I mention she kicks butt? <br/><br/>Effects: 9/10. Surprisingly good effects considering the time in which the movie was made. As cool as cgi is now, I'm glad there isn't much of it in this movie. The movie seems more realistic and believable since only a little cgi is used.<br/><br/>That's about all I can think to comment on. Bye! And remember, every town has an Elm street..just a little something to think about >.> <br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie yet and are worried it might frighten you,then let me give you a rundown of the ONLY things that would probably scare you.<br/><br/>************Spoilers ahoy!************* <br/><br/>1) There is a bloody scene towards the beginning of the movie where a girl is being attacked by Freddy in her sleep. Gashes are appearing on her skin and she is getting kind of thrown around the room. Much blood ensues. This is pretty much the only part that freaked me out when I saw the movie for the first time.<br/><br/>2) General Freddy sneaking moments. When Freddy is stalking people, you might get kind of nervous, but trust me, there aren't that many jump scares in this movie.<br/><br/>3) The blood fountain. This might gross you out, but probably not ""scare"" you exactly. It's towards the end of the movie, and if you want could always just fast forward it if it's too yucky to handle.<br/><br/>Aaand, I think that's about it for the scariest stuff. Hope whoever is reading this enjoyed my review :) Happy watching!"

","This movie is without a doubt one of the best slashers ever made. Unlike most slashers, this is un-clichéd,well written, and has some kick- butt characters.<br/><br/>I love the creativeness of A Nightmare on Elm Street, it will be unlike any slasher you've ever watched. Nancy Thompsen (Heather Lagenkamp), is one heroine you'll absolutely love and be scared for. Although it has a ton of special effects, it works here! Another mystery: After 25 years, it still seems very modern to this day (unlike 90% of slashers out there). Fred Krueger is one of the scariest villains of all time, because he isn't out there in real life, he comes to you in your sleep. (The Jump rope girls are very scary as well!)."
"kaos_katt9","10","0","0","14 January 2010"," To me, the very perfect horror film ever made.
","This film is the overall perfect horror film to me. The villain is unique and insane, with the very creepy look of the burned up body, the knives for fingers making it many people an easy close combat kill (which I find scarier than a ranged kill), and the almost bland look that will always stand out in you mind. The ability to control the world in which you dream is also terrifying, as we all dream, making us all possible victims. The directing I find amazing, many scenes being quite beautiful in my opinion, especially my favorite death scene which I will talk about later. The writing was good, with the unique story, and good dialogue and character development, to hate the characters we are meant to hate and love the characters we are meant to love, along with Freddy, being the character that we love to hate. I thought that Heather Langenkamp's performance was stunning, and I also find her quite attractive in that film as well. Robert Englund's acting was, as always, phenomenal. He is the perfect Freddy and always will be the perfect Freddy. He looks, acts, and sounds the part, and is the epitome of a nightmare in this film. Onto the last, but definitely not least, the deaths. Creative and very well done death scenes in this film. A Nightmare on Elm Street carries on the torch of having my very favorite death scene in any movie ever, the death of Johnny Depp's character Glen. Seriously, it is perfect in it's simplicity of being sucked into the bed to be killed, yet Wes Craven does one better by adding hundreds of gallons of blood to spray straight up to the ceiling. This film is absolutely, and will forever be, my favorite horror film of all time."

","I grew up watching this, and believe me it used to give me several disturbing and horrible nightmares through-out my childhood. A Nightmare on Elm Street is directed by horror legend Wes Craven, the movie is simply put and executed brilliantly. A mysterious, freakish looking semi-human being enters the dreams of the humans at night, violently attacking them, not knowing that the damage and suffering caused in the dream will affect them in real life. The make-up, music and horror is a big positive in this movie, as Freddy Krueger looks utterly disturbing, thanks to those who added the scars, and burnt effects to the character. The movie itself is fantastic, a real horror classic that has a villain that just can't be tracked down and defeated, Krueger is something that nobody else can get but those who suffer and witness his dreams. This movie created one of the most famous horror icons, a true cinematic achievement."

","A Nightmare On Elm Street (1984)<br/><br/>Top 20 - Horror Films of All Time <br/><br/>Wes Craven has given us Scream, the most enjoyable and probably the best horror film of the 1990s - but before that he came up with 'A Nightmare on Elm Street', a film inspired by a newspaper article reporting the deaths of two people after horrific nightmares. There goes the idea.<br/><br/>The story of Freddy Krueger, a maniac who killed 20-30 children on Elm Street and was not imprisoned due to a technicality, only to be burned to hell by angry parents... However Freddy doesn't go away that easily! He comes back and haunts teenagers of Elm Street in their dreams, and if he kills them in their dreams, that's it! Bam, they are dead and gone another kill from the man with the razor blades...<br/><br/>Elm Street was made on an unbearably low budget ($1,800,000) and this is evident in a lot of the make-up, set design and special effects. However one should not see this as a negative. The film is fiendishly inventive, original and at times tense and disturbing. A Nightmare on Elm Street is part of a number of horror films that are actually good, effective and disturbing. Modern horror films are vacuous films filled with sex, gore and the same dull premises.<br/><br/>One, two Freddy is coming for you... three, four better lock your door... five, six better grab your crucifix, seven, eight better stay up late, nine, ten never sleep again...<br/><br/>A modern horror classic.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Possibly the most stunning thing about this movie, looking back, is just how few people thought it would work. Fortunately for New Line Cinemas, they were willing to take the plunge and this film, and its various sequels, put them on the map.<br/><br/>Wes Craven reportedly got the idea of this movie after reading about a young man of Asian descent who had recurring nightmares and died mysteriously in his sleep one night. He read another couple of news stories of similar happenings and decided ""That sounds like a great plot for a horror movie."" He was right.<br/><br/>Anyway, for the few people out there who don't know the story of Freddy Krueger, he was a child murderer, who was released from prison on a technicality, burned alive in his boiler by angry parents, and then came back to take revenge by killing their children in their dreams.<br/><br/>Krueger is effectively bought to life by Robert Englund, in the film Freddy is a menacing creation we don't really see much of and usually in a dark setting. He truly looks, and acts, like a creature of nightmares, and terrified millions of cinema going teenagers back in 1984.<br/><br/>The main threat to Freddy is the strong willed Nancy Thompson, the daughter of the local police chief, who has her life turned upside down after Freddy murders her best friend Tina and the police blame Tina's boyfriend Nick.<br/><br/>Nancy uncovers the town's dark secret and comes up with a plan to drag Freddy out into the real world for a final confrontation.<br/><br/>The supporting cast includes John Saxon (Roper from Enter the Dragon) and Johnny Depp (yes THE Johnny Depp in his first role) as Nancy's boyfriend Glen who dies in particularly memorable fashion.<br/><br/>The effects in this are good for the time, most of its shot in the dark anyway so you wouldn't really notice the bad stuff unless you were looking for it. The acting is passable and the story is fun.<br/><br/>Has lost a bit though due to all the sequels. Remember in this one no one knew the hokey stuff about Freddy being ""the bastard son of a hundred maniacs"" or dream demons, dream warriors, dream masters, or dream children. This was just a nasty guy with a beef who could do cool, deadly stuff to his victims while they slept.<br/><br/>Well worth a look, if a bit dated."

","Once you get past many of the obvious flaws in the film, it is actually pretty good. The story focusing on a girl who is chased in her nightmares by a monster who wants to kill her. The idea itself is quite original which makes the movie even better but there are a number of things that let it down.<br/><br/>NEGATIVES: Dialogue such as ""I'm going to kill you slowly"". Freddy chopping his fingers off to reveal squirting green ooze, the near non-relationship between Nancy and her parents in an attempt to feel sympathy for her seeming too forced.<br/><br/>POSITIVES: The first death scene, the end (nice touch with the car), the scene in which Nancy has dream therapy.<br/><br/>Definitely a classic horror movie.

","Wes Craven does a perfect job in rejuvenating and refreshing the horror genre, first with this elaborate 'slasher', and secondly with 'scream' more than ten years later. Taking the successful elements from both 'Halloween' and 'Friday the 13th', Craven created what many think is one of the best horror films of all time - and I certainly have to agree it is impressive.<br/><br/>Firstly, the character of Freddy is well-written - he is a guy that is in control of the characters and therefore the audience. You have no idea what he is going to do next, and the people he kills are slaughtered with the right amount of gore to please the slasher hungry viewers without becoming considerably cliché.<br/><br/>There is imagination and suspense to make this an exciting and original approach to the genre. The characters aren't simply thrown in to get bumped off, and for once I liked them all - especially Johnny Depp's character in his screen debut. Usually the teenage victims don't know whether they're awake or asleep - to deliberately confuse the audience - and balances the boundaries between reality and dreams. The film was followed with many sequels but this is by far the best. There is a surreal quality to the film that hasn't been surpassed and Freddy is one of my favourite horror villains - he has a voice, a witty personality, and is played by Robert Englund every time.<br/><br/>Overall, this is great. I recommend any fans of the genre to watch it, but I won't say it's the best horror film ever - there are a select few that are in my opinion better - but don't think this is just an ordinary slasher film, because it's awesome."
"Mr_Censored","9","0","0","12 October 2008"," The Suburban Nightmare
","Let's take a trip back in time, 24 years ago to be precise. The horror genre had established slasher movie icons such as Michael Myers and Jason Vorhees as the new standard and the horror genre itself was rapidly evolving. Enter a seasoned, yet underrated filmmaker in Wes Craven. Craven's gift to the genre in ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" was a colorful and unique villain in Freddy Krueger, brought to life by the incomparable Robert Englund. Instead of merely dispatching horny babysitters and camp counselors with long, sharp objects, Freddy dwelled in the dream world, haunting the children of those who burned him to death in his previous life. Part cautionary tale, part suburban nightmare, ""Elm Street"" had a little something to creep out everyone. Who can deny the psychological implications of avoiding sleep at all costs? The mere idea that  despite the fantastical elements  such a seemingly safe environment could host such evil is almost a wake up call to never fall asleep or become complacent. Almost as chilling as the concept itself were the ways in which Freddy would dispatch of his victims. Donning a glove with razor sharp blades for each finger and using the unlimited possibilities of the dream world, nothing was off-limits. From bloodbaths that reached the ceiling to a rather nasty fire, Freddy created the ultimate, inescapable nightmare.<br/><br/>Watching the film today, it still holds up. Yes, the effects are as dated as the overall style of the film. But below the surface is still a quality film that stands well enough on it's own. Heather Langenkamp plays Nancy, one of the more independent and strong ""survivor girls"" of the 80's slasher boom. Langenkamp possesses a rare charm, and as the archetypal girl-next-door, she sells an out-of-this-world concept by keeping her performance grounded in reality. Many will note her co-star, her boyfriend across the street, a very young Johnny Depp. Depp also brings a sense of realism to the table, delivering some early, if somewhat choppy acting skills. Granted, it helps that Craven was and is amongst the more intelligent of horror directors, and his vision is still relevant today. The idea that a new generation can inherit the burdens of their parents is a timeless theme that remains potent. The key factor here is that the movie is just as intelligent as it is shocking for it's time. As for Freddy, he is the ultimate boogeyman. He is the evil that never truly dies and Englund plays the part to the creepiest degree, you know, before he became the class-clown of the genre. Although the overall impact of the film was watered down by sequel after sequel, this one still retains it's class. Unlike most films of it's time, it never sacrificed story for obligatory gore, or nudity for that matter. Despite looking somewhat dated by today's standard, there isn't much else that dates the film, no cheesy pop songs, catch phrases or hair styles. It's just a straight-forward, true horror movie that packs a mind-blowing punch in a briskly-paced 90 minutes. The birth of a legendary villain, a timeless concept, ""A Nightmare On Elm Street,"" nearly two and a half decades later, is a cornerstone of modern American horror, a true essential."

","Plot Synopsis: When her friend is killed while being asleep, Nancy Thompson discovers the killer is a shadowy figure who haunts his victims in their dreams. With her friends being picked off one by one, Nancy must confront the killer in his domain.<br/><br/>When ""Halloween"" came out in 1978, it spawned a very prolific genre known as the slasher film. In a slasher film, a group of characters, mostly teenagers, are stalked & killed by a shadowy bogeyman who usually has an axe to grind. By the time ""Elm Street"" came along, the well had been sucked dry by dozens of poor-quality films. Wes Craven gives us a film that is purely nightmarish (okay, bad pun) & very clever. While it is not the masterpiece that it's fans are claiming to be, it is nonetheless a classic, giving birth to a character that became a legend in the horror genre: Freddy Krueger, a child murderer who was killed by an angry mob & who gets his revenge by killing his victims in their dreams. The acting is all over the place, with the teenagers being the usual round of morons that we have seen in other films, but Robert Englund commands the screen as Krueger."

","Nightmare On Elm Street was a wonderful movie! A catchy, creative script executed great with a good director and good actors, it succeeded expectations. I tried watching it with my friends, but they hated it because of the ""magic"" used by Freddy. But I didn't mind it, it was a bit corny, but it made him more scary. Freddy is a chilling character. He's probably one of the most creative and scary characters ever, and I thought they used him perfectly. They didn't show him too much, but just enough to make you wide-eyed every time he appears. The actors aren't wonderful, but they do an exceptional job. The only acting that bothered me was Heather Langenkamp's work on Nancy. I don't know why, she just kind of bothered me. <br/><br/>The ending was kind of dumb and corny.

A horribly disfigured man with razor-claws stalks them in their dreams - dreams so real that dying dreaming means dying in reality. This man is Freddy Krueger, a former serial killer of children, who was lynched by his victims' parents years ago. Now Freddy has come back for revenge - in the dreams of the kids of Elm Street, and he will not rest until he has butchered all of his lynchers' children...<br/><br/>The world's favorite metal-clawed maniac, Freddy Krueger, celebrates his debut in this creepy film that became one of the most popular Horror films ever. The idea of a serial-killer who murders his victims in their dreams is without doubt quite original, and this first ""Nightmare"" film has several other great qualities. The film spawned a number of sequels. Only part three is worthy of the original, some of the other sequels are mildly entertaining, others almost unbearably awful. Other than most of its sequels, the original ""Nightmare"" is a scary and genuinely creepy film that focuses on suspense instead of dumb gags. Freddy Krueger is the absolute evil here, and he behaves adequately for the absolute evil. Krueger is played by Robert Englund, who became a world-famous horror icon for the role. Englund was no newcomer to the Horror genre (he had been in Tobe Hooper's demented ""Eaten Alive"" seven years earlier), but since 1984 Robert Englund IS Freddy Krueger (and Freddy Krueger IS Robert Englund). Heather Langencamp stars as Nancy Thompson, one of the teenagers stalked by Krueger. None other than the great John Saxon plays her police detective father. What makes this film even more memorable is the fact that this is the screen debut of one of todays greatest actors, Johnny Depp. I am not sure whether this film's fame is justified, as it is, in my opinion, overrated, and certainly no Horror masterpiece, but there is no doubt that Freddy's screen debut is a highly original and creepy cult flick that lovers of Horror can not allow themselves to miss!

But a while later something told me to watch it again and it immediately appealed to me all of a sudden. I was creeped out and there was a great, descriptive story, something missing from most modern slashers. Krueger is genuinely scary and the plot aids that scariness tremendously. Murdered by a mob of angry parents, Krueger was a former child serial killer. Now, the descendant children of the parents on Elm Street are being stalked by Freddy in their dreams, where he can physically kill them in a dark boiler room. Very dark stuff, but with its thick layer of black humor and comic moments, it never truly achieves serious, tense scares, for when they're coming, director Wes Craven throws some silliness into the pot.<br/><br/>You'll laugh and jump, and you'll remember Freddy forever. This is an instant classic, made back in the eighties by an ambitious and eager director Wes Craven, who went on to be particularly famous for the ""Scream"" trilogy.

","Director Wes Craven became instantly world-famous through his immensely successful ""Scream""-trilogy, but his finest and most original film was made more than 10 years beforehand. Not only the movie was groundbreaking but its main character also became one of the all-time greatest horror icons. ""A nightmare on Elm Street"" isn't your typical slasher film; it's far more impressive and intelligent. The story is about a demon that kills teenagers in their sleep. The cinematography is so brilliantly done that the lines between the dream world and reality often get blurred. Near the end of the movie, it becomes a real puzzle to figure out whether what you see is a genuine event or part of a dream sequence.<br/><br/>The bad guy in this movie is one of the most powerful demons from hell. His clothing however might suggest otherwise. He wears a stupid, brown hat and a red-and-black striped sweater. The most unique trademark of this horribly-burnt child molester is his glove with razor-sharp finger-knives. He will use them to slaughter his innocent victims who find themselves trapped in a mysterious world from which they cannot possibly seem to escape. In this world, the monster is all powerful like a god and he will set the rules in opposition whenever he feels like.<br/><br/>This movie is certainly the darkest and most terrifying of them all. The first time we see Freddy Krueger in the flesh is truly one of the most spine-chilling moments in horror history! This creepy-looking creature is beautifully played by actor Robert Englund who's an American leading actor of Swedish descent and very famous for appearing in dozens of horror films. His greatest achievement will however always be his chilling portrayal of Freddy Krueger. The main part is played by actress Heather Langenkamp who stars as Nancy Thompson; the girl who decides to fight back rather than become another victim. Her performance is quite good as is John Saxon who plays her father. This is also the debut of Johnny Depp. Needless to say: Wes Craven is the most important person for he came up with the idea and directed the movie as well.<br/><br/>In short: ""A nightmare on Elm Street"" is not only a horror classic, but also one of the finest horror movies ever made! It's an intelligent and very original yet gory thriller! If you ever wish to try out a horror movie - this is a great one to begin with! As for Freddy Krueger, he is - in my humble opinion - the single most original horror icon ever thought of!"

","Back in '75, people thought that Jaws was terrifying, the difference here is, if you're scared of sharks, you just don't go near water. If Psycho scares you, then it's OK, a quick escape from the killer and the police can handle it from there. But what can you do about somebody that wants to kill you in your DREAMS? You can have all the legions of soldiers and tanks in the world surrounding your house, but there's nothing you can do, because as soon as you close you eyes...""hey, why does that soldier look like Freddy? Oh.....oh no...""<br/><br/>And so this movie is born, spawned from the true story of a child that begged his parents to believe him somebody wanted to kill him in his dreams and eventually died in his sleep, this film takes that story ten steps further into hell. This was way before Freddy became the comic goofball he is nowadays, here his character is damn blunt - a filthy, crude old man, set out to maliciously murder the children of elm street. The dreams are only weird and exaggerated enough to still seem dreamlike yet still be scary - it might seem like an old dog's trick now, but when one sees Freddy cornering Tina in an alleyway with 8 foot arms stretched out, it's certain there's something sickeningly twisted about this man's mind.<br/><br/>As well as being both a darkly spiritual and terrifyingly psychological movie, this could also pass as a slasher film - plenty of scenes featuring total bloodbath (including one girl being dragged by an invisible entity across her ceiling before, dragging a trail of blood drained from the slicemarks in her stomache with her) without over doing it like so many crappy modern killer films.<br/><br/>This film conjures up fear like none other, and is one of the only horror movies that is perfect in every way, that could never be remade.<br/><br/>If it really needs to be said, this is the quintessential horror movie.

Except for an early performance by Johnny Depp that manages to be quite normal and human, and Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger, who manages to be evil and ruthless (instead of the clown he became in later films), the acting is rather ho-hum. This is not helped by some poor writing on the screenplay's part. Heather Langenkamp as Nancy stands out as quite bad, and the rest of them are sort of there (yes, that includes Saxon).

","Nightmare on Elm St is many things: first off it's a brilliant film that probably built the basis to which all slashers are built (besides the standards set by TTCM and Halloween.) The idea itself is such a brilliant and chilling notion that left me with many a sleepless night the first time I saw it.<br/><br/>The prospect of someone killing you in your dreams is terrifying. After all, you can't exactly not sleep or run away from him now can you? This basic principal does get overused but c'mon, the first time you saw it you can't say it didn't leave you jittery and scared. The Body Bag Screen is enough to scary the living daylights out of you. Of course this film is also unintentionally funny. (The ending Window Grab made me nearly fall to the ground laughing.) The killing is genius and creative, ranging from being set ablaze to being blended up inside your bed and spewed to the roof and being picked up in a bucket. The sequels may seem quick rehashes of the movie but that shouldn't stop you from enjoying this, and any other of the sequels. So I say you sit back, relax, enjoy the corny acting and the typical sex scenes and root for Freddy like you know you want to.<br/><br/>7/10"

","The quality of Nightmare on Elm St. has dropped in recent years, FvsJ you know what you did, so it is understandable that audiences today would have forgotten about what made Freddy well.. Freddy.<br/><br/>Let's travel back to the early eighties shall we. This was a time when many well known horror franchises were still in their infancy many of the greats started here. One day a horror film writer by the name of Wes Craven decided to pen a tale of revenge from beyond the grave. It was in this stroke of genius that Freddy Krueger was born.<br/><br/>The tale told the story of Fred ""Freddy"" Krueger who, for years, molested and murdered the local children with a glove that had blades fixed to the fingers. This went on for a number of years, that is until he was arrested. Having somehow gotten away with it, the parents of the neighborhood decided to take matters into their own hands and then one night found him where he took his victims and burned him alive. Flash forward a few years the children are now teenagers and living normal lives. The nightmare that was Freddy is only a vague memory in the town's past. That is until young Nancy starts having bad dreams and her peers start dying in their sleep. Freddy has returned to his old stomping grounds to continue his work. Now with the body count rising how will Nancy and her friends stop this maniac? One thing's for sure until they find a way they better not fall asleep.<br/><br/>A Nightmare on Elm St. was original in the fact that while most horror monsters and villains could be fought on the physical plain and were often confined to one area Freddy's range of attack was wide spread. Not only that but he was not confined to the limitations of the real world. He claimed dominion over the dream world and for the most part there was no way you could stand toe to toe with him even in your own dreams. You couldn't shoot him, you couldn't escape him, and you couldn't stop him. Another added factor to the creepiness was the fact that he could even appear in your own nightmares after the movie was over. This guy gave me nightmares for years and even now I get the occasional midnight fright. Plus the ending really got you to thinking as to whether they really got him in the first place.<br/><br/>If you want to see Freddy before his fight with Jason Voorhees check this film out it's a classic and you won't regret it. Plus there are no stupid CG effects around to screw up the experience."

","Freddy was new back then, he was fresh and dark and scary. In fact, you don't actually see a lot of him throughout this movie. The film was borne out of an idea that Wes Craven had after he heard some disturbing news article about a number of Japanese students (I believe) who had all died in their sleep. It also goes back to the old tale of the man dreaming that he was being sent to the guillotine, being tapped on the neck by someone and dying instantly. The flaw there, of course, is that if he died instantly then nobody would know what he was dreaming about.<br/><br/>Anyway, back to the plot. Burnt, and dead, child molester Freddy Krueger returns to pick off the children on Elm Street, all of them being somehow related to the vigilante group who set fire to him and killed him DEAD. How does he get the kids ? In their dreams. He attacks them while they sleep and if he gets you then you die. That's it. It's a great concept and Craven works well with it.<br/><br/>BUT the movie has two major flaws.. Craven's penchant for booby traps which provides us with a finale that veers from the suspenseful to the laughable. The other is Heather ""put me in a paper bag and I'd be trapped by my limited acting skills"" Langenkamp. Lots of genre fans love her, I am not one of them. Luckily, her acting is compensated slightly by a good turn from Johnny Depp and a great role for the ever-dependable John Saxon (now THERE'S a genre star). Even the girl that plays Tina does really well with her limited screen time. Throw in a fun, small role for Lin Shaye (known to many as that old crazy woman from There's Something About Mary but she's been a great genre star, appearing in the likes of Critters, 2001 Maniacs and Dead End) and you have a good time for horror lovers.<br/><br/>For giving birth to a new slasher icon and franchise and for having many great moments, despite it's flaws, it deserves it's rating."

It includes bad acting, weird music, cool killer, lots of blood, bright cute leading lady and action from beginning to an end. Wes Craven's script is despite somewhat over the top storyline is incredible and the film manages to keep you excited for the 90 minutes running time. Sure some people might complain about few things - some of the special effects are yes downright awful even for 1984 standards and the goofs cannot be overlooked yet for some people it makes the film even more hip and cooler.

This movie is actually really good for its time and even today its better than most of the horros being released.

","In 1984 Wes Craven redefined the horror movie forever, bringing his own rules to the game, avoiding the clichÃ©s that had gone before, making an exciting, inventive, gory, wickedly clever, and above all-scary film. A Nightmare On Elm Street, spawner of sequels, influencer of crap is the movie horror fans hoped for in the early eighties, but is also an effective satire on small town life, our fascination with serial killers, our fear of the unknown, and the sins of our forefathers.<br/><br/>The children of Elm Street are being murdered in their dreams by serial child killer Fred Kreuger. Nightmare is quite a surreal film. When I first watched it years ago it was hard to tell what was real and what wasn't. This added to the terror. Its not so frightening today but it still holds up very well especially against its dire clones and sequels. The reason why the first Nightmare is far superior to its sequels is that it plays to its string's. Freddy is a horror character not a comedian. Here he plays the classic bogeyman - a symbol of terror and not the lovable wish cracking anti hero of subsequent films. Not just in the way he acts but also in the way he looks. Freddys makeup in this film is pretty horrible - but in a good way. We can see he has been badly burnt and can see strips of flesh hanging from his face if you look hard enough. Its dirty, slimy and unpleasant. <br/><br/>This movie as a horror movie is fantastic. As a part of the slasher sub-genre, it is the cream of the crop. Nothing has come close in terms of ingenuity. This is much more than a guy in a mask killing people. Being able to attack someone in their dreams, and having the ability to manipulate aspects of the environment (coming through walls, beds, etc.) this movie is smartly made. Well thought-out; one of the most evil villains ever in a movie. For the low-budget affair that it was, it sure was impressive, and definitely stood the test of time."

But other than that it was still great. The story/screenplay was pretty good as well. The original A Nightmare On Elm Street is as classic as the original Friday The 13TH, being a slasher flick without really being a slasher flick. The funny thing with that film was that I think 99% of the film's budget was spent on fake blood. But in general it was pretty great.

","It wasn't until 1984 that ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" was released, which was twenty-four years after ""Psycho"" and six since ""Halloween"", but somehow this flick still stands on its own as a real original piece of cinema. It takes the psychological aspects of Hitchcock's classic work, the unstoppable serial killer aspects of Michael Myers, and merges it with a low-budget surreal environment.<br/><br/>Even with a young Johnny Depp given very little to do, noticeably tiny budget special effects, and an honestly preposterous premise, the frights in this movie still work. This could only be possible with the overacting teenagers who are recognizably scared, which is one aspect filmmakers sometimes overlook. Sure folks are danger, sure the editing is flashy and jumpy, but don't expect the audience to be scared without the talent peeing their pants. This one did it right.

","A Nightmare on Elm Street, that title says it all. It is exactly what this film is, a Nightmare, in a good sense. It is terrifying. My own experience with this film is somewhat of a personal one. Around the time that I was a three or four year old I had a demented babysitter who made me sit through all the Nightmare's that were around at the time. I assume either three or four had been made at that point as it was the late 80's. I remember being sat in front of a T.V for hours on end and force fed this series. I at the time hatted the women who made me watch this film. I did not have the vocal capacity at the time to tell my mom what was happening, it was not tell about five years later after I had left the women's care that i ever remembered watching this film and it's sequels. This film impacted my life in several ways through the years. First I was in a state where I could never watch this movie or any other horror film. The fear of this move scared me all through every day life until about the time I reached the age of Eleven or so. That was when my cousin who knew of my fear showed me that Freddy Krueger was only a character played by a man named Robert Englund. I remember this well as it was a turning point in my life. From that point on I became a film fan and mostly of the horror genre. I studied all that I could and watched all that I could it became an obsession and still is to this day. I love this movie and many like it. I feel bound by this movie. It is a part of me. To discuss the film though is to say that is terrific. Wes Craven's direction is distinct and tough. The movie has a fast, cheap, dirty look to it that makes you feel dirty when you watch it. You almost feel like you need to take a bath after the film ends. The Johnny Depp death scene is great I love it. Heather Langenkamp is great as the last girl and love what she goes on to do in the series, I also appreciate what Wes did with the seventh entry in the saga by making it so surreal. Robert Englund is a God, although Jason is better and my favorite killer. Watch this movie to get lost by it's magic."

","What makes this movie just as terrifying as other slasher flicks, is that it is the most realistic. If you think about it from the movie's perspective, you know that anything is possible in our dreams. Even death.<br/><br/>Wes Craven twisted reality with the dreamworld, and hence, A Nightmare On Elm Street was created. Along with Halloween and Friday the 13th, this movie set the basic horror plot of teenagers being killed off by a murderous madman. Wes clearly followed the movie rules for the horror genre such as ""Virgin's live, Sluts die."" The killer in the movie, Fred Kruger, has a very unique touch about him. Unlike Michael Myers and Jason Vorhees, Freddy had a personality. His humorous, witty one-liners had the power to make us laugh, and at the same time, send shivers down our spine. The film may have some visible errors and goofs but because of it's overall performance, those mistakes don't really seem to matter.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a movie that you should watch with your friends on a dark night. Get the popcorn, and prepare to be sucked into Freddy's Dreamworld."
"barrybent12-1","10","0","0","26 August 2006"," the best as far as what Freddy's character really was and what he did...
","The original Nightmare on Elm Street is by far the best. I know it naturally goes that way-- with the reason always being, 'well its the original...it started it all' and such, but as far as to what the story is about and the actual character of Freddy Kruger, the others don't even compare. Don't get it twisted, the Freddy we've all come to love in the sequels is cool... funny, witty, but remember-- that version of Freddy is the ""Sequal"" Freddy. In the original, the idea of Freddy's character is a much more frightening concept then smart-alec, ingeniously imaginative and creative killing machine he has evolved into. Think for a moment what Freddy is... what he was before he was burned alive by a mob of angry, vengeful parents. I think Freddy as a sick, little, psychotic pedophile is much scarier, realistic, dirty and all things bad. He is weird little man, with a weird little laugh, spending his time alone fantasizing, plotting and eventually carrying out his twisted urges to kidnap and hurt little children. Although it has never been officially established in any of the films I don't think it is absurd or out of line to believe Freddy did more than just kill children. Whether he literally molested those children sexually or not I think its safe to bet that he achieved some sort of sexual stimulation from hurting them. <br/><br/>In the original, Freddy is darker, not just in character, but also is the way they lit him. You hardly saw his disfigurement in bright sharp tones... he was always in the shadows, and although he did speak and had a few darkly humorous quips, (in contrast to a few famous killers that came before him), his words were few and far between and definitely not of the stand up comedian stock. Freddy is a phantom, a supernatural evolution of what he once was as a mortal man, and I like to imagine what he was while I'm watching what he is. He was a deviant, a perverted, sick bad man who is even sicker and badder as a spiritual entity. <br/><br/>p.s. while the make up appliances giving Freddy that stretched, burnt look is classic and much admired by this fan, I always loved the darkness of his flesh in the original. I'm saying though, ever leave a hot dog on the grill too long.. it goes well beyond the fleshy red color... blackened and charred--just like Freddy's heart."

","Since A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2; Freddy's Revenge was the first horror movie I had ever seen at the tender age of seven, I must point out first that I had nightmares myself about Freddy Krueger for years after I was first exposed to this. This also had to do with the fact that when I was young, my brothers and I suffered from a somewhat rare affliction known as Night Terrors. Since I am an identical triplet, and often all three of us would wake up screaming at the same time, my mother's hair turned Gray by the time I was five years old. When I saw the sequel to this movie, nightmares were already a prevalent theme in my life... they were almost more real than what I was experiencing when I was awake... And for years after, the antagonist in my dreams took on the form of Freddy Krueger. Unlike the characters in Dream Warriors, however, I could bend the reality of my dreams in many, many ways rather than having only one dream power. Because of this, Freddy never got the better of me in my dreams, I always would viciously slay him. And for a child who had only seen images of violence outside my dreams in this single film, it was just as scary to see myself do these things. I became obsessed later in life with the films and when I saw the sequel that had first introduced me to the series I found it tame in comparison... the one element that still stood out in my mind though, was the talented screamer who played Jesse. TRULY terrifying screams. Of all of the movies the original still stands out as the scariest for me, because No one really knows whats going on, there is never a survivor from the last film to explain what was happening, or to lend a shred of hope that one person might perhaps make it to the next film. The fact that everyone seems to believe Nancy is crazy at best lends to the fear that she will soon die. In doing research on the film to trace Wes's original inspiration, I found it documented that he said a series of articles he read in Los Angeles started the idea going. HOWEVER, I also found out that Wes went to Wheaton College for a time, which I lived near... and had friends on the somewhat close by Elm Street... as I still do... I believe that this is actually where the name of the film came from, and possibly some of the story. I guess only Wes knows the truth. *screeeeeeee*"

","Something strange is happening on Elm street, teenagers are mysteriously dying and yet nobody seems to know why, the adults of course are concerned but when the children ask about Freddy Krueger they get nothing but silence as the adults try to stonewall their story. However Nancy (Heather Langenkamp) is determined to break the silence and escape the terror once and for all. John Saxon and Ronee Blakely co-star. Nightmare On Elm Street which is of course famous for introducing us to the bogeyman who invaded dreams, is by itself a classic horror movie with lots of suspense. Back in the 80's when it first came out, it was truly frightening and disturbing but now it's lost some of it's edge due to the sequels which took away from the menacing edge Freddy once had. Although it may not be quite as scary, it is however quite suspenseful with a fascinating premise and shocks that work. It is obvious that this is a classic but I for one found the mix of reality and dream-like mentality to be intriguing. One striking sequence in particular is how Langenkamp sinks into the stair way like quicksand, it's a very effective moment which borders on both reality and surreality of a dream with effective tension. If you haven't seen this movie, well you have either been under a rock or are squeamish of violence, never the less for a horror movie this is by far one of the best from the 1980's.<br/><br/>* * * * out of 4-(Excellent)"

","""Nightmare..."" is, perhaps unavoidably, most directly derived from ""Psycho"". ""Carnival of Souls"", ""The Haunting"", ""The Entity"" and ""Altered States"" are suggested.<br/><br/>The center of this is Shakespeare: ""The sins of the father are to be laid upon the children..."" ('The Merchant of Venice'), which in turn came from classical and biblical sources. 'Hamlet' is also directly referenced. These are wedded to Grand Guignol excess.<br/><br/>The acting and dialogue are almost toe-curlingly bad. But those aspects are forgivable, because they are compensated by the rather clever idea of the movie itself being a 'nightmare' within nested 'realities' -- Craven toys with us by confusing each level of reality with the others. <br/><br/>Also quite clever is the construction: Freddy is Craven's alter-ego. The demon enjoys frightening the characters within in precisely the same manner that Craven enjoys frightening us -- a nesting of realities by self-reference.<br/><br/>It wasn't the low budget that kept this from greatness, though. What's missing is any sort of interesting camera perspective or movement. The editing is competent, geared towards maximum jolt effect, as we expect from the horror genre. Other than that, it's mostly ordinary hand-held footage, par for the course."

A Nightmare on Elm Street is a creepy horror classic by one of the greatest horror masters Wes Craven.<br/><br/>A Nightmare on Elm Street is not a typical slasher movie. In 1984 when it was released, there had already been four Friday the 13th movies, three Halloween movies, and one Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Violent slasher movies with a silent, masked serial killer was the horror movie formula of the time, but Wes Craven went a different, original route by making the killer a wise cracking burn victim. Even his weapon is something never seen before: A glove with knives attached to each of the fingers. The movie has a mood to it that is very creepy. The dream sequences are dark and foreboding, and make the killer himself look more evil. The way the killer makes cracks at his victims before he kills them gives him more of a personality, which makes him a more interesting killer than Jason.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is quite good. Fans of Johnny Depp will get a kick out of seeing him in his first film role as a sex starved teen. Robert Englund is perfect as the murderous Freddy Krueger.

But compared to other scary movies(me not being a fan of those) this is one of the better. Giving it an 8."

","This was the new movie that every-body like and that they say and I agree that this gave a new definition to the word nightmare,and this was all done by none-other than Mr. Wes Craven,he did a great job on this movie.Wes Craven did not gave us a movie that he wanted to put because he liked it.No he gave us the best film that every-one will love to see from all ages.When I went to rent Friday the Thirteen to compare this with Nightmare on Elm Street,F.T.T was nothing.It was put to shame,that director putted anything he like and that is why N.O.E.S. was better than Jason.It was not so bad but to see it on boring days when their is nothing to see but it will make it even boring.Wes Craven was the master of horror and scary films that everyone loved.Only part one and eight of Nightmare on Elm Street was great because both was directed by Wes Craven,the only film that was great from the movies.This movie should have be in the top 250 greatest movie,something new to see that brings terror only in are nightmares which is cool and spooky at the same time."

","One of the best horror films i have ever seen. With some scary scenes, average gore factor but enough blood to satisfy any horror buff out there . One never knows what Wes Carven is gonna do, many of his films are disasters but he always seems to comeback from a disaster flick and makes a brilliant film. Everything in this movie screams instant cult classic and i guess it became one a soon as it was released. I spend a small fortune on it when i bought it from a local video-shop and back then movies were only rentals and not for sale in Iceland. I have seen this movie more than ten times and the most recent was about 2 months and it still holds it own. In a genre with so many dodgy bullets i treasure a hidden gem like this and like in many cases hoped that it would not turn in some endless sequels that actually just retold the story or bent the plot in ways one could not understand why. Does not matter about the other 10 movies or who knows how many were made they can't ruin this one."
"DonFishies","7","0","0","6 April 2006"," The beginning of the franchise, and the early suggestion of problems with it.
","I'll hand it to Wes Craven.<br/><br/>He can construct a fairly original story, and throw in just the right amount of scary twists at us to keep us watching. Even with being 22 years old, Nightmare still smells and looks fresh (save for some of the items that have been updated since). The idea of having someone take your life in your dreams is just an interesting one that has yet to be done as well, if at all, since the franchise's run during the 1980's. The death sequences are imaginative, and make others pale in comparison. This movie was popular at the time for a reason (and gave Johnny Depp a name as well). They are all done very well done for 1984, especially considering they all would be benefiting from the help of CGI if the movie was remade today.<br/><br/>Another interesting thing to note, is how the characters aren't dumb like the casts in their horror film brother and sisters (read: Friday the 13th). They genuinely have no idea what's going on with their dreams, and the Freddy Kreuger cover-up only adds to this fact. They attempt to avert the inevitable, but just end up failing. Whereas most horror just have the characters being complete morons, and walking right into their fates with no chance of thinking before hand. The heroine in this picture genuinely has ideas for what to do, and fights to try and get them to work. She is the one who set the cliché up for future generations of horror films, and you can just see the beauty of the original idea playing out in the movie. And while Kreuger had yet to become the smart-ass he was in other films, his creepy presence only adds to the genuine scares of the film (and he is pretty witty in some instances).<br/><br/>The problem with the film is how the film falls apart after it all sets up completely. The entirety of the final 30 minutes of the film are just silly, and do no justice to the rest of the film. The ending is absolutely awful, and makes the clichés of today look absolutely brilliant. It looks entirely half-baked, and too well appreciated for its own good. It had the makings for something that really should continue to live on in 2006, and just dissolved faster than it was made. It just stops making sense. Yes, you need to have an open mind, and just let the movie play out without using your brain, but if you're left sitting there completely not understanding one thing that just happened, what kind of payoff is that?Craven had created a great horror film, and simply, he just didn't know how to make it play out. A number of things could have been done to make his status even greater than it was after this, and one is definitely to allow it to make sense.<br/><br/>Adding more sense to the finale of the picture would have benefited greatly, in 1984 or in 2006. It would have added so much more to this memorable film, and really made the sequels pale in comparison. I will say though, it was a hell of a way to make a name for yourself Craven.<br/><br/>7/10."

","I adore Wes Craven. I think he is the BEST horror director in horror history! I especially love A Nightmare on Elm Street. The reason why I like it is because Freddy actually talks unlike Michael or Jason. Freddy is also hilarious and is very creative with his murders. I'm sad that A Nightmare on Elm Street has stopped but I also still have great respect for Wes. I completely loathe Jason because he thinks he's all that with a pair of bunny slippers. Well, he isn't because he has no personality to him, he has nothing to make him cool. He just has big muscles and stabs people. Wheres the fun in that? Freddy has fun killing his victims and is the leader of the pack. No one messes with Freddy. Robert is the only person who has EVER played Freddy Krueger and if Robert Englund stops playing Freddy, that will be the end of A Nightmare on Elm Street.

"blanbrn","10","0","0","2 April 2006"," Real scary. Wes Craven started a slasher genre phenomenon.
","This 1984 horror-flick is without no question a film that will frighten you. ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is a fantasy of terror, as director Wes Craven shows how a badly burned bogyman can kill and destroy a group of teens thru their dreams. When first seeing this as a small kid the burned face of Freddy would frighten me as when I would lay down at night you would think of his face, and not want to fall asleep! ""Elm Street"" has the gore, blood, and evil but unlike some horror films elm street's main theme is psychological. As one should know it's the fears of the mind that are the worst the things you imagine, that hurt you the most in the end. With this group of friends it is the psychology of their nightmares that kills the mind and brings death upon them. Watching this can get into your mind at a young age to be frightened, but as I grew older this film still stayed scary to me, but I learned to look at the realism and not be frightened. In my opinion Wes Craven made this film to show a connection and maybe bring some fright-realism attention to people about the issue of serial murders, and to remind them that we don't live in a good world. Also remember during this films release in 1984, the US was dealing with unsolved cases all over the 50 states. Craven knew an ugly face, a dirty hat and razor gloves would help start the slasher genre, and yes he did put a psychological fear in the public, with this slasher classic."

Some of the scenes got some getting use to at times, I like the part where Johnny Depp's character gets electrocuted in his water-bed. I know electricity and water don't mix, but in a nightmare like this one, it gives a whole new meaning that you don't get electrocutes in baths and pools, but in a water-bed? Get real!

"boyinflares","9","0","0","7 December 2005"," Just try falling asleep in this film - you won't be able to!
","There are two reasons you won't be able to fall asleep during Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street. Firstly, because it is such a fantastic film and you won't want to miss a second of it, and secondly, because Freddy will get you. At least, you may begin to believe that.<br/><br/>What's so great about A Nightmare on Elm Street (not just the first film, but the entire series in general), is that Freddy is a unique horror antagonist. He stalks you in your dreams - somewhere that is going to be hard for people to come and rescue you. Being inside someone's mind, Freddy knows his victims weakness's and can use this to his advantage.<br/><br/>Unlike other horrors which have a large cast of teens ready for the killing, the first Nightmare on Elm Street was limited to four, played by Nick Corri, Amanda Wyss, Johnny Depp and of course the fantastic Heather Langenkamp. The former three are all very good on their limited roles, but it is Heather Langenkamp as Nancy Thompson and co-icon of the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise (alongside Robert Englund's Freddy Krueger) who really shines. Though Jamie Lee Curtis may be the Scream Queen (and rightfully so), Heather Langenkamp should be the Princess of Horror. Her character, Nancy is one tough cookie and fights back against Freddy, while the authority figures in the film, stumble about. John Saxon and Ronee Blakely play Mr. and Mrs. Thompson and both do a great job.<br/><br/>So while the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise may have made various mistakes in the later films, the first one remains a classic of the slasher genre, with a vibrant cast, awesome storyline, scary villain and great direction from the legendary Wes Craven."

","For starters, don't judge this movie by the terrible sequels that followed it. True, this movie had horrible acting, excessive gore and some shoddy editing work. In other words, it was a great 80's slasher movie.<br/><br/>The setting is Elm Street in a suburban American city called Springfield, which obviously is intended to make the audience feel like the horror could occur in their own neighborhood. The basic premise of the movie is a burned, undead villain named Freddy Krueger - who dons a red and green sweater, a fedora and a glove with blades on the fingers - stalks and kills high school children in their dreams.<br/><br/>The motives behind Freddy's violent behavior toward these children is to avenge his own death, where he was burned alive by the children's parents back when they were kids. Freddy preys on the new generation with a sickening glee, seemingly enjoying the terror he imposes on his victims before, ultimately, ending their lives.<br/><br/>There are some really outlandish death scenes in this movie that are impressive even today, which will stay in your brain long after the movie ends. If you are the type that scares easily, you might be afraid to sleep the night of your first viewing. This is Wes Craven's best film, which also provides the breakout role for Johnny Depp's now illustrious career.<br/><br/>""Whatever you do, don't...fall...asleep."""

Really. I remember a scene where Freddy is standing in a dark alley or something, and his arms stretch, and it is way too obvious that what is inside of that sweater of his aren't real arms.<br/><br/>Aside from that, there is some good dialogue, and parts of it make nice quotes...<br/><br/>And in answer to that comment I saw, I don't think Freddy sounds less frightening than Fred at all; rather the opposite, when it's the name of a murderer."

The bit with the moving bodybag scared me so much I stopped watching it and went to play a computer game to take my mind off it.<br/><br/>I watched it a few months ago and now aged 27 I don't find it very scary at all which is quite disappointing. Heather Langenkamp looks great. She looks cute when she's bathing and running around in her translucent white pyjamas. I've always thought horror and erotic are two genres that really go well together. The scene between Depp and Langenkamp where Depp displays wariness about Langenkamp making sexual requests of him is kind of cute. It's kind of a sweet teenage love story until Depp ends up us as a swirling fountain of blood.<br/><br/>The idea of a killer who gets you in your sleep is very powerful. The film is very effective in applying dreamy experiences to its horror sequences. When Nancy finds the stairs turn to glue and she can't climb up them many of us are probably reminded of dreams we have had ourselves were we feel we are trying to run but can only move in slow motion."
"jboothmillard","8","0","0","13 September 2005"," A Nightmare on Elm Street
","I watched this scary movie a couple of times in the past but I suppose I could not judge it properly, watching it again I definitely agree it to be worthy of being one of the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die in the book, from director Wes Craven (The Hills Have Eyes, Scream). Basically on Elm Street a group of high school teenager students, Christina 'Tina' Gray (Amanda Wyss), Rod Lane (Jsu Garcia, or Nick Corri), Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp) and Glen Lantz (introducing Johnny Depp) are having terrifying nightmares. Talking to each other they realise that they are having the same nightmare, of an unknown burned guy wearing a brown hat, green and red striped sweater and a glove with knives for fingers, often in a boiler room, and he is trying to kill them. During a sleepover Tina falls asleep and dreams of this boogeyman, Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund), he slices her chest with his razors and she dies, this means that she dies in reality as well, and being the only person visible in the room her boyfriend Rod is arrested suspected of her murder, even with no sigh of a murder weapon. Nancy realises if she or the others fall asleep and die in their dreams, they die for real, and she finds out more about the guy in the dreams from her mother Marge (Ronee Blakley), she tells that Krueger was a notorious child murderer, molesting and killing various children, and in revenge she and the other parents on Elm Street caught him and burned him to death. Nancy tries to keep herself awake with anti-sleep pills and coffee, Rod is killed falling asleep in his prison cell, and Glen falls asleep and dies while lying on his bed, and the only thing Nancy can think to do is ask her father, Lt. Donald Thompson (Enter the Dragon's John Saxon) for help, asking him to break down her door after twenty minutes. While sleeping and dreaming she searches for Freddy, and like before pulling his hat from her dream she hopes to pull him out of the dream with her, she manages to do this, hurts him with her booby traps and sets him on fire to burn alive. In the end Nancy is heading back out into daylight to spend time with her friends, they are Glen, Tina and Rod back from the dead, so it is obviously a dream, and they drive away in a car that is recoloured into Krueger's sweater, and Marge looking happy is dragged through the door window by Freddy smashing and grabbing her. Also starring Who Framed Roger Rabbit's Charles Fleischer as Dr. King, Joseph Whipp as Sgt. Parker, Lin Shaye as Teacher and Joe Unger as Sgt. Garcia. The rhyme made famous by the film is ""One, two, Freddy's coming for you. Three, four, better lock the door. Five, six, grab a crucifix. Seven, eight, gonna stay up late. Nine, ten, never sleep again!"" Langenkamp is good as the young female lead, Depp in his first film role is likable as the mischievous boyfriend of the heroine, and of course the film is almost stolen by Freddy, the cheeky, ugly, nasty and lovably vulgar evil psycho killer, and ""Son of 100 Maniacs"", played really well by Englund. It is good that the lead villain became an icon with following sequels, but it is questionable how a child molester and murderer can be turned into a hero for the younger generation, with toy stores selling the razor hand gloves! Kraven came up with the concept for this film reading a newspaper article about teenagers dying in their sleep, and of course that gives the film freedom to do almost anything possible within a dream and bringing it into reality, hence inventive deaths, and hence both good and bad sequels with dream inspired plots, this original film is obviously the best, a great classic horror film. It was number 10 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments, and Freddy Krueger was number 40 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains. Very good!"

The sequels changed this when he began cracking jokes, and becoming a big comic. I think nightmare one is the best one in the series when it comes a thriller, the only sequel coming close was new nightmare with the same actress from the first (Heather Langenkamp), the movie isn't the best movie or scariest, but to the series it's up top.

Having someone who can kill you in your sleep is one hell of an original idea so all credit to Wes Craven for thinking up the idea for Freddie Krueger. The story is excellent, Freddie Krueger was a child murderer who killed more than 20 kids on elm street before he was caught but he was released on a legal technicality so an angry mob of parents torched his house and burned him to death but it was just the beginning because five years later he returned to elm street and started killing the children whose parents killed him for revenge. First to die was Tina Grey who was slashed open and dragged up the the wall and across the ceiling while her boyfriend watched helplessly, second to die was Rod Lane who was hung in his cell, third to die was Glen Lantz who was sucked into his bed and spewed out in a huge torrent of blood which was rather cool and finally forth to die was Margeret Thompson who was set on fire by Freddie. The acting was excellent from all members of the cast especially Robert Englund who stole the the show as Freddie Krueger. In my opinion if you are a horror fan this is well worth watching.

I'd rather take John Carpenter ('Halloween', 'The Thing') any day, but I will agree: 'A Nightmare On Elm Street' is a good horror film.<br/><br/>The teenagers of Elm Street begin to have strange nightmares, and soon enough, the teenagers start dying in their sleep. When her best friend dies, Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp) becomes the next target of the dream wandering Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund), but Nancy decides to fight back.<br/><br/>When compared to similar teen-horror films from the time (such as 'Halloween', 'Friday the 13th', and 'the Evil Dead'), 'A Nightmare On Elm Street' is slightly more subtle. Granted, it is still a teen-slasher at heart, but it has this slight subtle edge to it, bringing it above the level of the average slasher. 'A Nightmare On Elm Street' presents a good balance between slashing and playing to the mind. There is plenty of gore, but the audience is almost drawn to question Nancy's state of mind: Her parents have split up, her mother is an alcoholic, and Nancy has been going days without sleep. She can't be in her right mind, and this is what gets to us. Nearly anyone who managed to see this as a kid will tell you that this is the kind of movie that made them want to sleep with the door open, or with a night light.<br/><br/>'Nightmare On Elm Street' is by no means perfect though. As with most slashers, there is that element of predictability. Any avid horror fan will be able to guess, with some degree of accuracy, who will die and when, and the conclusion. Like most slashers, the actors aren't the greatest and the dialog often turns into pure 80s cheese.<br/><br/>In a generation of teen slasher flicks, 'A Nightmare On Elm Street' was one of the best. Shame about the the sequels though - 8/10"

","So the song begins. And continues with some very useful facts of survival if you ever happen to encounter Freddy Krueger. But it doesn't really matter how many precautions you take. Since most people who run into Freddy very rarely live to tell about it! A Nightmare on Elm Street was the film that established (and stereotyped) Wes Craven as a master of horror. It also introduced audiences to one of the most terrifying and menacing creations (before he became a franchise) ever seen on the cinema screen, Freddy Krueger.<br/><br/>ANOES is one of the most intriguing horror films to ever come out of Hollywood, because of the way it skilfully blurs the line between reality and illusion.<br/><br/>The opening scenes are extremely eerie. For one reason because we get to see Freddy's infamous weapon being created. A glove of finger knives. And also because we are thrust into one of the film victim's dreams. It starts with a girl called Tina, lost in a seemingly endless boiler room. She is not alone. A scary man wearing a hat, a red and green striped sweater, with a badly burned face, is stalking her. Just as he catches up to her, she wakes up.<br/><br/>She's quick to tell her bad dream to her best friends Nancy Thompson and Glen Lantz (a very young Johnny Depp!). The next night, Nancy and Glen stay for a sleepover, and eventually Tina's boyfriend Rod Lane joins in the fun. Tina is about to have another nightmare about Freddy.<br/><br/>This time Tina is not so lucky, and she ends up being slashed to death in her dream. As I said before, this is where the distinction between reality and illusion converge. If Freddy kills you in your dreams, you really are dead. Rod gets the blame since he and Tina were sleeping together, and goes on the run.<br/><br/>ANOES takes on more terrifying dimensions as it goes on. Nancy than starts to have dreams about Freddy. One eerie dream in her high school, and an even scarier one in her bath. No sooner has she dozed off Freddy's glove comes out of the bath water, and pulls Nancy down into a bottomless abyss inside of her own bath.<br/><br/>Nancy eventually discovers from her mother that Freddy Krueger was once alive. He was a child murderer who killed over 20 kids in the neighbourhood. He was eventually caught, but released on a technicality. Most of the parents in the neighbourhood tracked him down, found him in an old abandoned boiler room, and set fire to the place. Now Freddy's come back to get revenge, on the children of his executioners.<br/><br/>As more of Nancy's friends get killed (Glen's death is shocking and gives new meanings to the term bloodbath) she takes it upon herself to deal with Freddy once and for all.<br/><br/>ANOES is a truly inventive horror film, and some of the dream sequences are deliriously surreal. Freddy Krueger is an awesome presence in this film, as he is a completely original bogeyman. He takes tremendous glee out of scaring his victims to death. As more sequels were made though, the character of Freddy Krueger became more ridiculous, and lost the ominous presence the brilliant original had.<br/><br/>The ending is a little unusual, because it makes us wonder if what we've been watching all along is all just a dream. The ending is disappointing and strangely intriguing at the same time.<br/><br/>Don't bother with the sequels. They're not a patch on the original Nightmare on Elm Street. The first is frightening, clever and insightful. Something the sequels never were."

","Many people will already know of Mr Krueger because he is a household name and it is this movie which made him a star and the ultimate horror icon. This movie is a true classic and many consider it to be the scariest of all time, with the fact that Freddy attacks you in your dreams which we all have and can't resist sleeping so his victims all all doomed (which makes for good watching!). Some of the special effects in this movie are know dated such as the extending arm effect but others such as the scene where Freddy looms out of the wall are still impressive and will make many people afraid to sleep. The gore is brilliant with the first death being my personal favourite in horror history for reasons you will see for yourself.

","The original Nightmare is still the best in the Freddy Krueger series. Here, Wes Craven manages to build some terrific suspense with a highly original idea and also creating a truly scary horror villain (whose impact has lessened dramatically with all the sequels, unfortunately).<br/><br/>The idea that when kids are killed in their dreams, they actually are killed for real is one kick-ass idea and Craven milks it for all it's worth. The atmosphere is tense and solid throughout with some solid scares along the way.<br/><br/>Acting performances are generally O.K. John Saxon is good as always, Heather Langenkamp is pretty solid as Nancy, Freddy's main nemesis and a young Johnny Depp is also quite good. The film does unfortunately have a very weak ending, which undermines the overall impact of the film, but up until then, this is a first class horror film all the way."

","I have often said that the 1980s was the best decade for horror films. There was AN American WEREWOLF IN London, CHILD'S PLAY, THE EVIL DEAD, POLTERGEIST, and of coarse A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. One of the many great movies of 1984, A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET is the brainchild of Wes Craven, a genius filmmaker who knows how to create suspense and fear like few directors know how to do. With 'NIGHTMARE' Craven not only proves himself as one of the world's most talented director, but he also proves he is a skillful screenwriter as well. The screenplay (which can be read on simplyscripts.com) is smart, scary, and at the time was original. It is also unlike any slasher flick one is likely to see in their lifetime. It holds up quite well today. Some parts feel a bit dated and Johnny Depp's extremely wooden performance hurts most of the scenes he's in, but the film remains in my top 5 horror movies of all time thanks to Craven's unique directing and script, the performances from Heather Langenkamp and Robert Englund, and the special effects. It's a must see for horror fans. 9/10"
"acidburn-10","10","0","0","14 June 2005"," The Scariest of them all
","Wow the 80's certainly was a great time for slasher movies, and this one came out in the nick of time and saved the slasher genre from becoming stale, because by 1984 the golden age was coming to an end and following in the footsteps of Jason, Michael Myers, Norman Bates and Leatherface, come Freddy Kruger. <br/><br/>This was actually the 2nd movie I saw in the franchise as I'd only seen part 3 at the time and plus it was rather interesting to see where Freddy came from. I knew from the opening when we first get a glimpse of Freddy's iconic glove that this would be the start of something special, while terrifying the first would be victim. This one is definitely the scariest of all the sequels and Freddy plays straight up evil and minus the wise cracks as he becomes later known for. The concept of a maniac stalking and killing you in your dreams and then dying for real is rather chilling and disturbing and this film works really well in all aspects, director Wes Craven really got it spot on with this movie with its interesting plot, execution and style. <br/><br/>This movie has really aged well and is still quite fresh and terrifying even by today's standards. This movie is more character based and focuses more on the plot than being a straight out gore flick which I do like as it never gets boring and keeps you interested all the way through, but the death scenes that this movie has are awesome and brilliantly played out like when the girl is slashed to death in the bedroom and being dragged up the walls, which never looks silly and always looks effective. The boiler room sequence when Nancy first comes across Freddy is truly terrifying.<br/><br/>The acting is overall decent in this film as well, which makes it work despite some inexperience. Heather Langenkamp definitely gives a stand out performance as Nancy strong willed and determined making her a definite all time final girl. Johnny Deep in an early appearance does okay as the dutiful boyfriend although a bit wooden at times but still decent. Amanda Wyass brings in a memorable performance and even makes you feel sad when she bows out. And of course Nancy's parent Ronee Blackely and John Saxon are both interesting and adds layers to both the characters as the movie progresses. And last but not least Robert England as Freddy of course stole the show with his wonderfully depraved, chilling and lasting performance.<br/><br/>All in all a great start to a brilliant franchise, ambitious and cleaver."

","The horror genre today has cornered the market on slasher films of all types that appeal mainly to teen-agers and young adults. But the one Wes Craven film that still stands high and above as a towering example of a great horror film is NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.<br/><br/>Its great success is partly because the blurring of dreams and reality is so cleverly done that the audience, along with the participants on screen, scarcely knows when to believe Freddy is real or not. And Freddy Krueger here is not played for laughs, as he was in later NIGHTMARE films. There is an occasional touch of humor, but for the most the horror is played straight and it really works.<br/><br/>The revenge motif is clearly explained with Freddy getting even with the parents who burned him to death by tracking down their children. Perhaps the scariest moment in the whole film is the episode involving the unfortunate victim, Johnny Depp, in one of his first roles. The gory, vindictive nature of Freddy Krueger is fully exploited in this sequence.<br/><br/>Fans of the series should make sure they see this one. It stands head and shoulders above most horror flicks that have come along since 1984.<br/><br/>Wes Craven has gotten an excellent performance from Robert Eglund as the man with the claws and the other players are not far behind. This one ranks with HALLOWEEN as one of the best fright flicks of the last few decades."
"zippydidledo","10","0","0","21 May 2005"," One of Craven's best
","Wes Craven is one of the best known names in the horror genre, and ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is one of his best! In the wake of his success with Nightmare, Craven was able to get movies made - even if nearly all of them were horror films (he was typecast as a director). During the late '80s and early '90s, he made a string of forgettable motion pictures. Following the original A Nightmare on Elm Street, he largely turned his back on the series (although he did executive produce the second sequel, A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors). However, in 1994, he used a new and radical concept to take control of the Nightmares for one final outing, Wes Craven's A New Nightmare, which brought things full circle, once again blurring the line between reality and fantasy. In the wake of A New Nightmare (which was largely praised by critics, but was given a lukewarm greeting by horror fans), Craven turned his attention to Scream, the success of which advanced his reputation further. <br/><br/>A Nightmare on Elm Street is tailor made for those who like their gore leavened with thought-provoking ideas - something that is a rarity in this genre. Sequels dumbed down the series to a regrettable degree, but the first movie still stands on its own as an intriguing and chilling example of how horror works best when the characters and the audience don't have to be lobotomized. Those who appreciate scary movies can do no better than a double feature of Halloween and A Nightmare on Elm Street. Taken in tandem, those two films epitomize all that was good about '70s and '80s horror films."

","I first saw this when I was quite young, and after that I was hooked on both Nightmare on Elm Street films and horror in general. The plot involves four teen-aged friends who find they are having nightmares about the same man, a horribly-burnt character in a red-green striped sweater and a battered old hat, wielding steel claws on a metallic glove.<br/><br/>This is one of my favourite films and, in my view, is up there with the likes of Frankenstein, Dracula and so on. What really sets it apart from a lot of horror films of its kind is the surreal atmosphere, the well-written storyline, the genuine characters and the thin line between dreams and reality. This is one of those films which never grows old on you no matter how many times you watch it."

","In 1984 Wes Craven redefined the horror movie forever, bringing his own rules to the game, avoiding the clichés that had gone before, making an exciting, inventive, gory, wickedly clever, and above all-scary film. A Nightmare On Elm Street, spawner of sequels, influencer of crap is the movie horror fans hoped for in the early eighties, but is also an effective satire on small town life, our fascination with serial killers, our fear of the unknown, and the sins of our forefathers.<br/><br/>Nancy is a 14 year old. She has a cute boyfriend who would do anything for her, and two friends who mock them by being...experienced. Nancy lives with her alcoholic mother in a large house, her father is the local Sheriff, they divorced a while ago. One night when the four friends are staying together, Tina is brutally murdered by a hideously disfigured man, seemingly in her dreams. Her boyfriend watches on, horrified, while Nancy hears the screams from outside. Rod flees, and the cops look for him believing he is the only possible killer. However, once caught Nancy becomes convinced that someone else killed Tina, a man named Fred Krueger. Later Rod dies in his cell, it is believed to be suicide but Nancy knows differently. Her mother becomes increasingly estranged, as Nancy does all she can to stay awake, knowing that if she sleeps she may die. Her mother takes her to psychiatrists as she doesn't know what to do, not knowing that everything she is doing is wrong. She goes so far as barring Nancy inside the house, and she can't see Glen her boyfriend. Nancy believes Glen is next. Upon investigation Nancy finds out Krueger's story- he was a child murderer who stalked the town a few years ago. He was caught but escaped unpunished by some loophole, so the residents took the law into their own hands, burning and killing Fred. However, now he is back for revenge by killing the children of Elm Street once again in their dreams, where they should be safe. Nancy thinks that she can bring Fred into the real world and stop him, but needs Glen to stay awake. However, Glen's parents think she is a maniac and take the phone off the hook. Glen is killed and his parents are clueless. It is up to Nancy to stop Krueger, hoping her father will be ready when she screams for him. So she lets herself sleep, and looks for Fred.<br/><br/>This is one of the most imaginative horror movies ever, blending dreams with reality so the viewer never knows whether a character is asleep or not, giving a sense of tension throughout. Craven uses all the force which caused his previous films to be censored and banned, but makes his themes more subtle, and substitutes the realistic and grim visuals of The Last House on the Left for the fantastical sights here. For the most part it is the fault of the parents that their kids are killed- they created the monster by trying to kill the monster, but more importantly they then feel like their job has been completed, not realising when their kids are in danger. There is a total lack of understanding between the two generations, and little trust in the abilities of the youth. It is not only a tale for those reaching adulthood to be afraid of the world, that in the end we have to rely on ourselves rather than those who have protected us, but it is a story about the older generation's fear of the next generation. They want to be leaders but have their own insecurities, they want to be respected but show little in return, they want to protect but cannot see when something is really wrong.<br/><br/>The young cast is good, particularly Langenkamp. Garcia and Wyss have little to do, Depp has a bigger role and shows some of what would make him a legend. It is Langenkamp who carries the film, and she is excellent in her portrayal of fear, paranoia and helplessness, all the things we face when we are teens. We forget though that these things rarely leave us. She screams, but thinks, and is not the typical stupid teen, making an assertive step towards saving herself and her friends, while trying to hold her family together. Indeed she proves to be the strongest character in the film, preceding Ripley by a few years. She knows her survival is down to herself. The older members are also very good. Blakley is brilliant as Marge who cannot cope with Nancy and with her break-up, giving in to booze like so many others. Saxon is also good as the father trying to get on with his life and work, and forget the evils of his past while trying to understand his daughter. And of course, Englund steals every scene he is in. He is terrifyingly believable, the perfect example of what lurks in our nightmares, waking and dreaming. His one-liners are comic to himself as he takes sadistic joy in following and killing kids. In later films they become silly, but here we get the sense that these are the exact words that would come from a paedophile and serial killer.<br/><br/>The effects here also standout, with the famous bloodbath bed scene and Tina being torn all over the ceiling becoming some of the most famous images in horror history. Kreuger looks scary, those blades will be heard in our dreams, and the dream world is filmed with care so that we can tell that there is something not quite right about the surroundings, unsettling us. A highly effective film, scary and at times funny, but thought-provoking and unnerving with one of the most frightening villains ever committed to film. This inspired many clones, but this is still the king and continues to influence many films, horror and beyond. And count the number of Simpsons references.<br/><br/>10 out of 10"

","The first and best of the Nightmare on Elm Street series.<br/><br/>The children of Elm Street are being murdered in their dreams by serial child killer Fred Kreuger. Nightmare is quite a surreal film. When I first watched it years ago it was hard to tell what was real and what wasn't. This added to the terror. Its not so frightening today but it still holds up very well especially against its dire clones and sequels.<br/><br/>The reason why the first Nightmare is far superior to its sequels is that it plays to its strenghts. Freddy is a horror character not a comedian. Here he plays the classic bogeyman - a symbol of terror and not the lovable wish cracking anti hero of subsequent films. Not just in the way he acts but also in the way he looks. Freddys makeup in this film is pretty horrible - but in a good way. We can see he has been badly burnt and can see strips of flesh hanging from his face if you look hard enough. Its dirty, slimy and unpleasant. In other films its obvious its a mask. And a pretty clean one at that.<br/><br/>This one also has all the classic scenes. The claw appearing above the bed, the teenager being slashed in mid air, Johnny Depp getting sucked into his bed and turned into a fountain of blood. Its nice to know a set back like that didn't stop him from furthering a successful movie career. The ending falls a bit flat with Freddy being bashed with hammers and set on fire like in a Tom and Gerry cartoon but its easy to look past it, especially to the final scene where again you don't know if its real or not.<br/><br/>Speaking of that final scene I'm almost sure I seen a different ending again where it WAS a dream. Or maybe I was dreaming myself."

","If you are not a horror fan but have to name one horror-film most people will come up with 'A Nightmare On Elm Street'. Other possible pictures they might mention are 'Halloween' or 'Scream', in my opinion more thrillers with horror-elements. The scariest of them all, 'The Exorcist', could be a real contender as well. Still, 'A Nightmare On Elm Street' is so well-known, at least the title, I could not believe the actual film could live up to the promise. I have to admit most of the time it does.<br/><br/>The idea director Wes Craven exploits here is as simple as it is brilliant. Teenagers are chased by killer Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) in their dreams. The nightmare becomes reality because Freddy is able to actually kill these kids in the dreams, causing their death in the real world as well. Instead of misleading us with a scary moment that ends with the ""only a dream""-scene, we know when the characters are dreaming and we know that it is as dangerous as facing a killer outside a dream. The first victim is Tina (Amanda Wyss). This is a little surprising since she is introduced as the hero, the way Janet Leigh seems to be the hero but is killed in Hitchcock's 'Psycho'. After Tina a couple of possible victims are introduced. Tina's best friend Nancy (Heather Langenkamp), Tina's boyfriend Rod (Nick Corri) and Nancy's boyfriend Glen, played by first-timer Johnny Depp.<br/><br/>The film follows some of the usual paths, but Wes Craven shows he is the kind of filmmaker that has little surprises for you on the way. We think we can guess who will live and who will die but even in that area there are more surprises than you might think. The scenes where it is sort of certain someone will die are directed in a way there is lots of suspense anyway. Craven showed this again with the parody on itself, 'Scream'. It is too bad the sequels, except for the last one, were without involvement of Craven. I am not saying 'Scream 2' and 'Scream 3' are terrific films, but they are entertaining, something you can not really say for the first five 'A Nightmare On Elm Street'-sequels. Fortunately Craven returned with 'New Nightmare', unfortunately you have to sit through part 2 to 6 to fully appreciate that one. A good reason to simply start with the original and best 'A Nightmare On Elm Street', after that you might think about the others."

","Tim Lucas commented in a recent edition of ""Video Watchdog"" that the movie world would've been a lot better off if there had been no sequels to ""Halloween"", ""Friday the 13th"", or ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"". While the ""Halloween"" sequels ran out of steam and ""Friday the 13th"" was such a lousy movie that the sequels really didn't damage it, the movie monster that suffered the most was Freddy Krueger. With each sequel even more witless than the last, Krueger was changed from the nightmare demon of the original to a combination of bogeyman and stand-up comedian that has just become boring and tiresome. To wash that bad taste from your movie taste buds, you need to return to the source  the original ""Nightmare"". Craven, supposedly working from his own nightmares, created a bloody and atmospheric shocker that intriguingly mixes in themes of vigilantism, its' effects on a family unit, and inherited guilt. The story is pretty basic  four teenagers are being menaced by a shadowy killer, but the kicker is that this killer only appears in their dreams, dreams that become so realistic and frightening that by the end of the movie the sole survivor can't tell the difference anymore between what's real and what's not. It's interesting to note that the kids attacked in their dreams have NEVER done anything to deserve their fates  their bloody demises are the direct result of their parents' revenge against a child murderer who was caught and released only to kill again. By that act of mob justice, they've marked themselves and their children for destruction both physical and moral. Of the four main kids, one is a juvenile delinquent, two live with their alcoholic mothers, and the fourth's parents are so busy they don't even notice that their son regularly sneaks out every night to spend time with his girlfriend. But let's not forget Freddy. In the original, he's a shadowy and menacing dream-presence who has a personality, but isn't in the least bit funny. He bursts into their dreams and viciously mutilates them before killing them in their dreams (and thus killing them in real-life). There's a lot of shocking and bloody visuals in this one  if you really want to trip yourself out, watch it alone and at nightand then see what dreams you have."

","Wes Craven's ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is an excellent horror film, mainly because it is so different from many horror movies. It's not a typical slasher movie, it's quite original and has some great moments.<br/><br/>It's about a group of teens who are plagued by scary dreams, primarily Nancy. When she has some friends over one night, Tina and Rod go into the bedroom and have sex while Nancy is left with Glen in the living room. But Tina is murdered brutally in the bedroom by an unseen force, and Rod becomes the prime suspect. But it wasn't him at all- it was a horribly burned boogeyman named Freddy Krueger who haunts people in their dreams and murders them. As the dreams the teens share become more and more disturbing, Nancy tries to stay awake as long as she can, and try to stop Freddy before he claims another victim.<br/><br/>This movie features Heather Langenkamp (scream queen of the series), Robert Englund (Urban Legend) as Freddy Krueger, and a very young Johnny Depp (""Pirates of the Carribbean"", ""Edward Scissorhands""). Wes Craven does a great job, as he always does, in creating an excellent movie that has some pretty good scare scenes. The whole dream scenario was extremely original had never been done before, so that's one thing that I really enjoyed about the movie. The sequels (while I've only seen a few) weren't nearly as good, and became more comic than scary, which ruined Freddy (for me at least). But this one was great, and Freddy is a perfect movie villain.<br/><br/>Overall, ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" is one of the classic horror films of the 80's. It's not fully perfect, but it's close.

One at a couple sleepover their friend Tina explains thats she had trouble sleeping because of horribly brutal nightmares. They all admit to having similar dreams as well. And from than on one by one their staked and murdered in their sleep. Creative death sequences and genuine suspense turned this ordinary slasher film into a horror classic. Including the general creativity of finding how a new way that a slasher/homicidal maniac can kill you. Looking back on this film now I still considerate great. But all compliments said the acting is a little off and some of the spfx and dialogue are marginably laughable. But it's a horror flick and even though I hold them to very high standards.

The reason to this, is because Freddy Krueger used to kidnap and kill children, and was not put in jail for lack of evidence.<br/><br/>Everyone is working hard in this film.

Well, they were certainly impressive for the 80s, but they cannot stand up to the competition in today's digital and hi-tech era. So it must be the direction, right? Well, yes and no: Wes Craven does a fine job, but that alone is not a sufficient condition for the title.<br/><br/>What is it then? What does ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" make it so special? The answer is simple: Its cult status. Within a short period from its release, the movie became a legend, with Freddie Krueger (Robert Englund) being a familiar figure to virtually everyone. His knife-laden hands have claimed some good scares from frightened fans, that's for sure!<br/><br/>The amazing success was totally unexpected even for New Line Cinema, the production company, whose people could never imagine that they would come up with, well, The Mother of All Horror Films! They tried to capitalize on their great fortune by producing numerous sequels, yet none had the flair and originality of this film.<br/><br/>I am not a horror movie fan in general, and yet I value this film very highly: It has something truly unique, and despite the 20 years that have passed since its release, its flame is still bright. If you are willing to get a really scary ride, then don't miss it: 8/10."

","The first part of the long-running Elm Street series is by far the scariest of them all, even if I liked parts 3 and 7 more. But here we have the introduction of the possibly most evil villain in cinema - Freddy Krueger. The story is not very complicated - a hideous spirit of a burned child murderer is torturing the dreams of inncoent teens - but the film is cleverly shot and with some very interesting ideas about mixing dreams and reality. I also like very much the personality of Freddy, I think that he is much more interesting than ordinary slashers like Jason Voorhes and more clever and sinister even than Hannibal Leckter. The special effects in the movie are old now, but still, they are well-made and impressive. The only thing I didn't like is the ending, I think that it was too nasty. But overall, a good movie."

","The problem with horror movies is that they are always followed by horrible sequels. In most cases, the original movie starts out with such a great concept and story that the movie itself can be appreciated for more than just a horror flick. But once the villain gains fame in the real world, the series becomes a money-making machine for the company who owns the movie. The original writers and directors are usually not involved with the rest of the series, and as a result, the original concept of the movie has little or nothing to do with what happens throughout the rest of the series.<br/><br/>And thus, in every movie a hero emerges and finds a way to ""kill"" the villain. This cycle continues and each movie offers a brand new explanation for why the villain has come back to life, and what they must do to end his reign of terror.<br/><br/>Finally, after countless sequels, the series comes to an end.

"TheNorthernMonkee","Null","0","0","18 September 2004"," dated and not particularly scary
","SPOILERS<br/><br/>Way back before he directed the ""Scream"" series, Wes Craven created this classic series of films. Just like his later series however, the horror and styles of this film are slightly too dated to really connect.<br/><br/>Starring your regular group of high school students, ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" introduces us to the evil and mischievous Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund). Killed by a mob years before, Krueger lives in the dreams of the children of Elm Street and is out for revenge.<br/><br/>Running a relatively tried and tested formula, this film has the disbelieving parents, the ""heroine"" who must defeat the forces of evil and the excessively gruesome deaths. Operating on a tiny budget though, Craven is forced to limit the action to moments of extremity and as a result the film suffers.<br/><br/>With a cast of four main teens, Craven's film is obviously limited in the potential headcount (the excessive deaths in gory style being preserved for the more recent, graphics driven films) and is also not helped by weak acting. Heather Langenkamp as Nancy attempts to play the role as something more than it is, and is not particularly good as Krueger's eventual nemesis. Alongside her, Johnny Depp in his big screen debut is mediocre as the ""nice"" boyfriend and it actually feels quite satisfying to see what happens to his character. On the opposing force of evil, even Robert Englund as Krueger is rather weak with his limited screen time and headcount. Whilst Krueger will eventually develop as a character over future films, in this first encounter he never really gets going and is rather pathetic.<br/><br/>The ultimate problem with this film however is not the acting but more how the film has dated badly. With typical 1980's style clothing and film quality, it's like going back to a time which nobody really cares about. It's a shame really because whilst this film used to be worthy of merit, now it's more like watching a history lesson. Often the original is better than it's sequels, but in horror like this series, the later they get, the more enjoyable they come. Worth missing."

","First there was Micheal Myers with his Kitchen Knife, then Jason Vorhees with his machete, now there's the creepy Fred Kruegar with his glove with ""knives for fingers""<br/><br/>Before all the hype of Freddy being an icon for young teens, Freddy was actually scary. Wes Craven directs this creepy slasher with a new twist. Four teens living on Elm street are having the same dream about some creepy looking weirdo with knives for fingers who stalks them in a very disgusting boiler room, they all think it's unlikely that they could be dreaming about the same guy until one by one they all began to get killed in real life (one girl gets sliced and dragged up her ceiling, another guy gets hung in a jail cell, the best is a dude getting pulled in his blood and blood GUSHES all over the room)It's up to scream queen NANCY to get the parents to listen and help her before she dies to. Too bad the parents all ready know of him, because they were the ones to burn him in real life because he was a filthy child murderer who killed at least 20 kids. The acting is excellent from the tight ensemble, sure all the teens look too old for 15 year olds, but they all seem likable and the John Saxon and Ronee Blakely are top notch as Nancy's parents (in particular Ronee). The whole film has a very dark presence that sequels 3-6 all lack, there's just something real creepy going on here. Whether it's the weird Freddy imagery (the alley scene is one for the books) or the very effective score, I really dug it. Some effects seem a little cheesy to today's standards but I easily let those slide. Some complaints are the ambiguous ending...What exactly does it mean? I just like to think the ending was a trick to Nancy and everything all ready did happen. You just can't go wrong with this flick, When TINA was in the body bag standing outside NANCY's Classroom was very morbid and is a perfect example why this is a classic in the tradition of HALLOWEEN, Friday THE 13TH, THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE, and the EXORCIST.<br/><br/>***1/3 out of ****"
"MF210","9","0","0","23 August 2004"," A Tremendously Crafted Horror Film
","My Rating: ***1/2 out of ****. <br/><br/>If Nightmare on Elm Street only proves one thing it proves that Wes Craven is one of the best horror directors. I admit I haven't seen all of Craven's films but I have obviously seen Nightmare and I have seen the Scream films. While I think the Scream films are good in their own right (well Scream 3 was a bit of a letdown), Nightmare clearly shows his talent as a horror director. <br/><br/>Good Horror films are a rarity nowadays, Great ones are almost non-existent. Today, we get stuff like the overrated, pretentious 28 Days Later and the amateurish Blair Witch Project. Oh sure there have been good entries like the previously mentioned Scream films, the recent remake of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and the Ring but horror films are usually the most ineffectively made films  today. Nightmare on Elm Street is proof that a great horror film can still be made. It belongs in the company of Alien, The Exorcist, Halloween, and The Shining. If I had to be real critical, I think it's a small step below the second, third  and a bigger step below the first and last one (since I consider Alien and The Shining to be the best horror films ever made, although Alien also belongs in Sci-Fi) but it clearly belongs in that exceptional group of films. <br/><br/>Nightmare is not a conventional horror film. This is not about a killer going around killing stupid people with an ax, knife, or machete. No, this film is about a killer that gets you in your dreams-or nightmares. Craven, who wrote the script, creates two worlds: one where your awake and a dream world. His script is intelligently constructed so that at times, we don't if one of the characters is awake or dreaming and that makes the film all the more thrilling. <br/><br/>Nightmare also has a unique style. Nightmare is a highly atmospheric film but contains some unusual sequences. When Nancy (the main character of the film) is trying to outrun Freddy (You ought to know who he is by now) her foot sinks into the steps like they are quicksand. There is also a chilling sequence where Nancy is pulled under bath water into a black pool.<br/><br/>
The acting, while not extraordinary, is effective. Heather Langenkamp is solid as Nancy. She makes her into a more intelligent person than most protagonists in horror films and she definitely gets us on her side. Johnny Depp, in his first starring role, is also solid. Ronee Blakely is very effective in her somewhat limited role as Nancy's mother.<br/><br/>
Robert Englund became famous after his first role as Freddy in Nightmare. Freddy is a pretty gross sight, he burns and bleeds green (the make-up job on englund is excellent). This really isn't much of an acting performance for Englund, but when Freddy speaks you can tell he has a vicious personality. This is no Michael or Jason, who don't say a damn thing. Freddy has more of a personality. He also has a backstory that is revealed enough to make us more afraid of him without spoiling anything.<br/><br/>
Nightmare on Elm Street is Wes Craven at the top of his game. He generates a high amount of tension and delivers the thrill required for horror film. It's tough to say whether he'll top this effort but if he doesn't he can be proud of this brilliant horror film. Nightmare may not quite be perfect but its faults are minor and do not harmfully damage the film."

","I had the pleasure of looking after Mr Craven back in 1984 for a week long UK PR campain on this movie. Amoungst the many anecdotes that he told to journalists....was how the film took a long time to get financed. As usual Hollywood failed to recognise a good idea when they saw it....and of course the rest is history. I believe the opening scene has been planned to take place in an old theatre with lots of flapping drapes. Lots of very ingenious special effects were achieved on a low budget (including the shooting of the Nancy bathtub scene, which includes a POV shot, realised in somoene's swimming pool on the last day of the shoot) When Craven was in the UK for this publicity trip he was working on the script for his next film which was to be called AI (The journalist with me, quiped that in the UK that stood for ""Artificial Insemination"" which could have prompted the title change to ""Deadly Friend"". To my mind ""Nightmare"" is still one of Craven's best films, because it is dead serious and played straight (Without the knowingness of the later ""Scream"") This was a time when American films took their horror seriously (As Japanese cinema does now)"

","If someone were to ask me who my favorite movie slasher was, I'd have to say Fred Krueger (Robert Englund) from ""A Nightmare On Elm Street.""<br/><br/>Krueger, the brainchild of horror movie veteran Wes Craven, has a distinct personality, which separates him from his contemporaries (i.e. Michael Meyers of ""Halloween"" or Jason Voorhees of ""Friday the 13th."")<br/><br/>He's given a sickly humorous and sadistic personality by Robert Englund, who first dawned the dirty, red and green sweatshirt, raggedy hat, and razor fingers in 1984 when he began his reign of terror by stalking Heather Langenkamp and numerous others in their dreams.<br/><br/>He was unique amongst them because of the fact that he even had a personality. He didn't hide his face behind a mask; if he were killing you, he wanted you to know that it was him doing it. Krueger was also unique because you couldn't be really sure that he was even a living entity, since he stalked you in your dreams.<br/><br/>Craven has stated that the character of Fred Krueger was inspired in part by an article he read about perfectly healthy people dying mysteriously in their sleep. To further add to that, the name of ""Fred Krueger"" was inspired by a bully and a disfigured hobo who scared him when he was a child.<br/><br/>With ""Nightmare,"" Craven had crafted himself an icon horror film, one that was sure to inspire many knock-offs in the coming years. The sequels turned down the terror and upped the dark comedy. The series only seemed to return to its roots when Craven became involved with the project again and created ""New Nightmare"" 10 years later in 1994.<br/><br/>Even to this day, ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" still terrorizes its viewers, prompting them to not fall asleep as that razor-fingered sleep-stalker Fred Krueger could come looking for you in your dreams.<br/><br/>10/10"

With a low budget of $1,800,000, A Nightmare on Elm Street sure did great with the effects. All that blood and Tina being dragged on the wall, excellent. The acting was well done, and the dark mood (unlike the sequels) worked great and scared me through the whole movie. I liked the way that the movie started out as a bright world, and slowly turned darker. <br/><br/>This is definitely Wes Craven's best work. He made New Line into what it is today. <br/><br/>The story is simple for those who haven't seen the magic and pure horror of Elm Street. 4 friends are having terrible dreams of a dark man (Fred Krueger, not Freddy like in the sequels) who can kill you in your dreams.<br/><br/>The sequels were good, but ended up going a little bit lighter, having Fred Krueger becoming a joke who no one is afraid of now.

It's a showcase for wooden actors, klutzy mechanical effects and silly genre cliches, and even if you dig the premise (which is definitely cool), you gotta admit that the execution is rather clumsy.<br/><br/>Still, this is a refreshing change of pace from the smarmy and self-aware horror we get these days.  Craven's own ""Scream"" thumbed its nose at the conventions of the horror genre and ""Buffy"" followed suit, but for those of us who don't necessarily want horror to be a postmodern laugh-riot, a movie like the first ""Nightmare"" has something to offer.  A proactive heroine, creepy dream segments, a menacing atmosphere (the one quality that excessive humor is sure to destroy), and a novelty appearance by Johnny Depp add up to decent entertainment.    <br/><br/>In the final analysis, this is a superior example of teenage horror.

","The horror genre is a tricky thing for those of us who consider ourselves Cinema buffs. For some reason, I can enjoy a horror movie much more than I can enjoy another film with similar production values, acting, script quality etc... There is something about horror movies that speak to my inner fifteen year old, even ones that aren't that great. When the subject comes up in conversation with my cinema snob peers I get a lot of blank looks, and rolled eyes. I mean could you imagine the look on a peer's face when I start extolling the virtues of this movie while they are discussing when exactly Fellini lost ""it""? Nevertheless, the genre has brought about a few masterpieces. Rosemary's Baby, Repulsion, Psycho, some Cronenberg and a few of the Universal and Hammer movies come to mind. This movie is not a masterpiece but it is an intelligent examination of the relationship between our dreams and reality. Some of the acting is typically hammy, but it's hard to call it cliched when this movie helped invent those cliches. The only movie where Freddy didn't mistake his role of revenge-seeking psychotic for that of a stand up comic. Craven's insistence on using cheap shocks rather than true psychological terror at times prevents this from being a masterpiece but it comes pretty close. This movie spawned several horrible sequels (that still can be entertaining as camp), and one decent one. It wouldn't be until Craven directed an entry in the series again that it would be truly worth our time. An excellent movie overall. 4/5"

","As a little kid, movies like ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"", ""Halloween"", and ""Friday the 13th"" were terrifying pieces of horror sitting in my aunt's den, the VHS cases covered with terrifyingly subtle pictures from the films. I didn't dare watch them, fearing that I would be scared out of my wits for years to come, but the concepts of the movies still somewhat intrigued me, especially that of ""A Nightmare On Elm Street.""<br/><br/>The story of a disfigured serial killer hunting teenagers in their dreams was a scary yet interesting concept in my mind. Years later, I would find the film playing on a satellite movie channel one late night in December, and I tuned in. I had only planned on catching part of the movie before going off to bed, but I found that I couldn't tear myself away from it. So, I stayed awake until 2:00 in the morning, watching the film's events unfold. I discovered that it was one of the best horror movies I've ever seen. But, enough with the required lengthy introduction to make myself sound superior, onto the review.<br/><br/>Within the past year, I've found myself to be quite a horror fan, something I never knew after avoiding such genre movies like the plague for ages. Truthfully ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" is not very scary, albeit very creepy. The film is more of a late night entertainment movie rather than a terrifying horror film. The music is the scariest aspect of the film, particularly the high-key jingle played throughout the movie. Most of the scenes involving Freddy Krueger managed to come across as quite spooky, and the murders were appropriately unsettling. The way the film is laid out -- fast-paced and down to the point -- works perfectly for the story. This kind of movie needs no long-winded buildup.<br/><br/>Acting has often been criticized in horror films, particularly this one. The actress who plays the protagonist, Nancy, doesn't have amazing range, but is effective in the role, as is the woman who plays her mother. I believe that some reviewers need to keep in mind that this is a plot-driven film, not a character-driven one, and the acting does not need to be Oscar material for it to work. And I, for one, am very tired of hearing the phrase ""cardboard cut-out characters"" used over and over and over again whenever some desperately-needing-to-sound-superior reviewer believes they need to dis acting performances in a smart, Ebert-like way. The point: the acting isn't the issue in this movie.<br/><br/>""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" is appropriately horrific and somewhat comedic in a campy yet creepy sort of way for most of the film. The only real problem I had with the movie was the ending. If you don't want to have part of the ending spoiled for you, then skip to the last paragraph now. Freddy loses all of his wits and ghostly powers when Nancy drags him into the real world. She lights him on fire, knocks him down the stairs, and basically kicks his ass. And this is a teenage girl against a psychopathic supernatural murderer hell-bent on revenge. OK, so she had to gain some slasher movie experience and take action against the killer by the ending, but it would have been nice if Freddy had been a little more menacing. This is really my only gripe with the film.<br/><br/>""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" is appropriately creepy and a little bit campy at times (although this was probably intentional), and is one horror flick not to be missed. Better than ""Friday the 13th"", and ""Halloween"" is next on my list to see."
"Raiderofthelastfries","Null","0","0","11 January 2004"," Overcomes flaws to become a classic
","Yes, it has an incredibly shlocky premise, as bad as Craven's ""Shocker"", but all of its logic problems are inevitably overcome by the sheer, all powerful battering ram of a villain that is Freddy Kruger. Aside from being drawn by its famous killer, I think A Nightmare on Elm Street really gives us a fascinating look inside Craven's psyche. A noted psychologist once stated that ""in the dream, you are everyone"" which I believe is also the case with narrative arts from novels to films, and even comic books. I think Nancy is representative of Craven in his formative years, trying to free himself from a domineering mother (his father left when he was four, and here Nancy's father is notably absent for most of the movie's events). He was denied to access to movies, growing up in a strict Baptist household; I imagine that he wanted to break free from this kind of sheltered existence, hence the bars on Nancy's house. The ""caging"" of Nancy against her will from the outside world for ""her own good"" by an overprotective mother is an interesting parallel to Craven's own life. Freddy himself may be a vehicle for him to vent his dislike (hate?) of his father, as Craven himself once stated that Freddy was the ""ultimate bad father punishing the children"", that of course, in addition to the other threatening men he may have encountered in his life (like the bully named ""Freddy"", or the disfigured hobo who giggled at him. ""I can see you!"" and chased after him) Craven, a intellectual filmmaker whether or not you'd like to believe it, arrived at the creation of Freddy's infamous glove by such a beautifully simply process (so it seems to me, who thought for years that such creative gems could truly spring from nothingness). Thinking over man's most primal fears, still imbedded in our collective psyches after many millennia of evolution, he remembered that early man was afraid of bears snatching him out of the caves where him took shelter with clawed paws. Fantastic! I wish I could think of something like that.  I highly recommend Nightmare on Elm Street, inspite of the fact that it might not be for everyone. For all of the disdain it may inspire in  certain viewers, it has a kind of subtle genius intertwined with the standard slasher elements that I know others will see."
"Leatherface33","Null","0","0","5 January 2004"," Awesome. One of the coolest horror movies ever made.
","I think Freddy Kreuger is a truly unique character. Other horror kings,<br/><br/>like Jason and Michael and Leatherface, use masks to hide their<br/><br/>identity. The fear dwell on what unforseen horrors could lie under the<br/><br/>masks eminating ""pure evil"". Freddy is much different because his burned<br/><br/>distorted face is what makes him him. And it is damn creepy too. While<br/><br/>all of the Nightmare on Elm Street movies were actually really good,<br/><br/>(alot better that ""Jason goes to Hell"" ha ha ha ha ha) I think the<br/><br/>original has to take the cake as the best of the series. I definitely<br/><br/>consider myself a horror fan, and I don't really put movies above other<br/><br/>movies in a list of my favorite. My fave is Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but<br/><br/>Friday the 13th, Halloween, and Nightmare on Elm Street are definitely<br/><br/>close. This movie also had some really cool effects that really were<br/><br/>seldom or never seen before. For example, Johnny Depp's death, where<br/><br/>he's sucked into his bed and all the blood splashes out. That was<br/><br/>awesome. I also think that the idea of being killed in your dream and<br/><br/>having it happen in real life is a very creative idea. It was always,<br/><br/>get stabbed by a knife, get chopped with an ax, get sawed with a<br/><br/>chainsaw, but Nightmare on Elm Street introduced, get slashed to death<br/><br/>in your sleep. I think that using the idea where, ""if you go to sleep<br/><br/>you're going to die because Freddy kills you in your dreams"" really was<br/><br/>a pretty cool concept that probably freaked a bunch of people out. I<br/><br/>personally was never really scared by this and just saw it as a<br/><br/>director's tool to ""scare viewers even after the movie is over.""<br/><br/>However, all in all, this is one of the coolest horror movies ever made.<br/><br/>It had unique and creative stuff in it.

"sjwest","Null","0","0","26 October 2003"," You Can Sleep  But You Cannot Hide.
","Many horrific characters have terrified audiences down the years, but only a few seem to touch the subconscious profoundly enough to return to the big screen many times over. Universal produced many monsters in the early part of the last century. Most of these were subject to severe constraints such as the ability to communicate. They were monosyllabic since their inability to communicate was indicative of the fact that they were not human and we could not reason with these beings that only existed to wreak havoc. The only one with any sense of sophistication was Dracula. This is the one of the prime reasons why this character has such strong appeal.<br/><br/> Wes Craven has now given us another character that is worthy of recall to the big screen. Although lacking the sophistication of the past vampire characters, he can interact more on screen thus creating entertainment beyond the Universal monsters. He had many wise cracks, which also was necessary for audiences of the Eighties  a prime requirement for the superficial era. To an audience which had been bombarded with slasher flicks as a consequence of the success of Friday 13th, it was a progressive step. For the audience of today, we now have Freddy Vs Jason' which is an interesting idea, albeit a sensationalist one.<br/><br/> There are many reasons why Freddy Kruger has captured the imagination of audiences. The first and most obvious is his appearance. His burnt features make him have the appearance of a monster. He is human in shape only  a disfigured monster hell bent on revenge. The trademark finger knives are also an image of terror. He does not just want to kill - he wants to maim and destroy. The stalker with the axe' now takes a fiendish pleasure in his vicious deeds. Killing is not enough. He has to torture his victims and see their pain. His demented psyche needs to be satisfied. He is above the aimless slayer and there is method in his madness. A far more deadly assailant.<br/><br/> Another is the children playing outside his house. Their presence is an ominous one as the image of pure innocence is now a messenger of foreboding evil. A sense of impending doom is created since we now see the all-consuming power of Freddie's evil in his victims. His past victims are now an element of psychological torture for his next victims. Although this has been an element of stories of the past, this image becomes a more striking and harrowing one when we learn that he was a child killer.<br/><br/> Self  mutilation is another feature of Freddie's psychological torture. In one scene he slices his fingers off. This accentuates the impression of invincibility since if he can harm himself in such a way, how can we hope to harm him. His form also changes as he contorts himself into painful images. This is indicative of the predator's adaptation to his hunting ground. He holds great power over his victims. Warriors of times gone by used this tactic in the field whereby they would endure pain in adorning their body with aggressive artwork showing their commitment to wage war. Freddie is the supernatural caricature of this ancient practise.<br/><br/> The final element is part of the high concept of the movie. Sleep is escape for us. Peaceful sleep is secure sleep. This security has now been invaded by the being that Freddie has become. Our final hiding place has now become a place of terror. We cannot call for help in this dream world. It is now the world of Freddie that is at his every whim. The monster is now seemingly invincible. Our final refuge is the predatory ground for the evil killer and the prey is not equipped to defend against attack. This element of originality is the defining one of the Elm Street' movies.<br/><br/> The performances are very strong as one comes to expect from a Wes Craven movie. The leading character could easily have been hammed up and appeared contrived. Robert Englund plays the role of Freddie with obvious enjoyment. We can tell that he calls on that side of him that wants to strike back at the system and it thus came naturally. The danger of identifying with a role of this nature has, however, been realised since seeing him in other roles he seems to be out of place. The audience is accustomed to seeing him as Freddie. Typecasting is not always necessarily a bad thing. The actor gains recognition and success, but once the story has run its length, he will struggle to achieve similar success and his typecasting will limit his ability to successfully engage the audience in a character of another story.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The young cast all perform well with a notable debut by Johnny Depp. In the past, acting performances were secondary to the necessity of the look and the scream as the mad axeman delivers his coup de grace. This is definitely not the case here as believable performances are given. Craven also sets his movie apart from the others in the same genre by using up and coming talent and maximising their potential. When creating movies that have to capture the imagination, good acting becomes a greater necessity since a hammed up performance will not draw audiences into the story.  <br/><br/> Besides a good debut performance, Depp's end is met in a cult scene where he is torn to pieces in his bedroom. Despite the gore, the scene was not an excuse for a gratuitous violence. It gave an image of the destructive evil that Freddie was. It rose above an obligatory slasher scene because the story was laying down a platform for it by building on the acts of Freddie and the terror that the teens faced increased with each incident. It therefore fitted within the fabric of the story.<br/><br/> The stalk and slay movie concept is now being adapted to mans ability to control his environment and therefore conquer his ancient fear of the unseen foe. The monsters are now not only powerful, but have other supernatural abilities. Their menace is now manifold, as these screen monsters have evolved to face audiences and our screen heroes. Our ancient fears are still there, only more suppressed and characters like Freddie have now come to being in order for moviemakers to give rise to these fears and ensure audience entertainment as well as terror. Slasher movies should never be the same again."
"daveyramone","Null","0","0","10 October 2003"," A classic Horror flick, but even classics have their problems
","*Attention* The following contains spoilers<br/><br/>I'm sure there are plenty of devoted horror fans out there who will consider what I am about to say blasphemy.  But, keep in mind that I too love horror movies and am a fan of the Nightmare on Elm Street series.  But just because you like something doesn't mean its perfect, or even close to perfect; and A Nightmare on Elm Street certainly isn't perfect.  The concept of the movie is fantastic: a boogeyman that can kill you in your dreams.  Wes Craven does an excellent job of blurring the lines between dreams and reality, as well as providing the audience with some cheap scares and genuine suspense along the way.  However, the ending to the movie is one of the worst ""cop-outs"" I have ever seen in a movie.  Just when you think that Nancy's confrontation with Freddy is going to lead to some conclusion, be it her death, Freddy's death, or whatever, Nancy simply utters the words, ""It's just a dream Freddy, I'm not going to play your game anymore,"" or something to that effect.  At this point Freddy disappears and we are shown Nancy and her mother leaving the house on a beautiful, yet eerily foggy day.  Nancy gets in her boyfriend Glenn's car with the rest of her friends as her mother waves goodbye.  Now, just as soon as the gullible audience starts to believe what they're seeing, the top of Glen's convertible comes down to reveal its red and green stripes...wait a minute that looks a lot like the colors of Freddy's sweater...and then Freddy's are breaks through the front door of the house grabs Nancy's mother and pulls her in...could it be, are they still in a dream?<br/><br/>I guess so, there's simply no other plausible explanation.  Apparently, when Nancy told Freddy that she knew that it was all just a dream and the jig was up, Freddy decided to stop toying with her and just kill everyone in one fell swoop.  So apparently, everything we've seen in the movie up until this point was just a dream; it was all one intensely elaborate plot to drive Nancy to the brink of insanity and then kill her.  It was supposed to be some huge twist to have the audience scared to the very end, to have everyone leave the theater terrified by the unexpected ending.  Instead, all it did was ruin what had been a good horror movie up until that point. Apparently everything else that happened in the movie was pointless because Freddy never intended to kill Nancy, in fact, he never actually killed anyone, he was just messing with her and the audience, making us watch a movie that didn't actually matter until the end.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if Wes Craven originally intended the movie to end this way. I would like to hope that he had some better finale in mind, or even on paper. I want to believe that it was some idiotic movie exec that decided the end should have some scary twist at the end and had to be changed.  Whatever the case, I want to know who wrote Nancy Thompson into the script of Part 3, which is simply ridiculous considering she drove off in a car apparently possessed by Krueger at the end of the first movie.  Call me crazy, but I assumed she was dead.<br/><br/>Now, I'm sure that many of you, whether you're huge fans of the genre or not, are thinking that I've been way too critical of this movie.  And perhaps you're right, maybe I should just accept the flaws of this movie like I do all the others of the countless horror movie sequels I've seen. But there's one problem with that: major flaws are intrinsic to horror sequels.  Consider the fact that the bad guy that died in the previous movie always inexplicably returns.  I expect flaws in the sequels, not in the original.  The first Halloween, Friday the Thirteenth, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and etc. are all classics not only because they scare you, but because they're not full of glaring holes in the plot or ridiculously stupid endings.  The fact of the matter is that the ending of A Nightmare on Elm Street is awful, it leaves so much to be desired, and falls far short of being classic.  If you don't believe me ask yourself, what could have made the end better, how would I have done the ending?  If you find yourself with a pretty long list, then I think I've proved my point."
"Snake-666","7","0","0","9 October 2003"," The sequels were certainly unnecessary!
","Last House on the Left' (1972) and The Hills Have Eyes' (1977) director Wes Craven brought us this eerie and unnerving horror movie which went on to create one of the most highly recognised characters in the history of horror. The teenagers of Springwood are all suffering from nightmares and in a bizarre coincidence it turns out that they are all dreaming about the same man. When her friends start being slaughtered in their sleep it occurs to Nancy Thompson (Heather Lagenkamp) that perhaps these nightmares are actually reality.<br/><br/>Long before Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) became the wise-cracking, anti-hero he is known as today he was a dark and menacing monster who took sadistic pleasure in methodically slaughtering teenagers. A Nightmare on Elm Street' features sparse amounts of the humour that the sequels were beset with, and is all the more better for it. By 1984 Wes Craven had established himself as one of the great up and coming horror directors. His controversial exploitation flick The Last House on the Left' had thrust him into the horror limelight and his subsequent offering, The Hills Have Eyes', won several awards and established Craven as one of the most exciting horror directors. It was therefore only fitting that A Nightmare on Elm Street' retained the ugliness and gloominess that had made his earlier films so enduring. Except for sporadic moments of black humour, A Nightmare on Elm Street' is a dark and unsettling horror movie which features a truly frightening premise. Ingeniously playing on an already fear-provoking experience, the movie takes the idea further and gives it a startling realism.<br/><br/>A Nightmare on Elm Street' is an imaginative, bloody and surreal movie that rises above other 80's slashers such as Friday the 13th' for its slick direction and character development. Unlike slasher villains such as Michael Myers and Jason Voorhees who were almost robotic in the way they senselessly slaughtered, Krueger is an animated sadist with a real purpose behind his killing. Craven built A Nightmare on Elm Street' on a brilliant premise and dexterously blurred the lines between fantasy and reality. That is not to say that A Nightmare on Elm Street' is a flawless movie, there are times when the film seems to drag and the acting is not always up to par. On top of this the characters, although developed, remain typical slasher movie clichés. However, considering A Nightmare on Elm Street' was made for a budget of just over $1million, the movie appears remarkably stylish and features low-grade special effects that are effective nonetheless. A Nightmare on Elm Street' blends dark, atmospheric horror with an inventive and captivating premise; a quality that is somewhat rare in modern horror.<br/><br/>It is little wonder that A Nightmare on Elm Street' has become one of the most popular post-1970 horror movies. I recommend this for all fans of the horror genre that have not already seen it. Featuring interesting and well developed characters, a strong and imaginative premise and a dark, foreboding atmosphere throughout, A Nightmare on Elm Street' is one of the staples of the horror genre and is certainly worth a look. My rating for A Nightmare on Elm Street'  7.5/10."

","Let's all face it, without director Wes Craven and Freddy Kruger(Robert Englund) this movie would have been nothing more than an average B-Movie horror film.  The sub par acting and script could make anyone laugh from beginning to end.  The mother doesn't exist in the universe of reality.  I found her to be 'the real' target of Freddy's terror and not Nancy as she is the one being terrorized and kept alive by Kruger for revenge.  Wes Craven's directing of this movie took the cliched slasher genre to a whole new level. He mixes foreshadowment and tone to make the viewer get on the edge of their seat.  Robert Englund makes Freddy creepy behind the dark by staying still so that it makes him not look scared of his prey.   You will notice this happens many times in the movie.

That's good enough for me. 2) The visual effects are outstanding; all of them but one are practical. 3) I was expecting the gore to be over the top, but it's fairly light. Of the kills in the movie, only one is graphically violent. If the gore were heavy, good acting would be needed to make it more believable. 4) The boogeyman can kill you in your nightmares? The premise of this movie is gold. 5) There were a few times that my pulse quickened; The Sixth Sense was the last movie I saw that had me reacting that way.<br/><br/>All in all, Nightmare is a decent way to spend 90 minutes. 7/10"

","Freddy Krueger will always be scarier than Jason Voorhees. And do you know why that is? Because Jason can't do anything super-cool, just cut you into swiss cheese. Freddy Krueger can take an ordinary thing, like a blanket, for example, and use it to kill somebody. Or in Part Five, where a diving board comes to life and almost kills a girl. <br/><br/>In dreams, anything can happen, and Freddy uses this to his advantage. Although there's a low body count (which I think is one of the strengths because it shows that the movie isn't about the blood and gore) it's extremely creepy. Yay for Wes Craven!<br/><br/>I guess I'm supposed to write out the plot, so here it goes: Fred Krueger was a child murderer who killed over 30 kids. He was arrested, but the court couldn't throw him in jail because of some technicality. So a bunch of parents got together and fried him. Freddy Krueger exists now as a dream demon, who kills kids in their dreams. He's after the kids whose parents killed him, and only Nancy, one of the kids, knows what's really going on.<br/><br/>
I'd recommend this film to just about everybody. And, no, the sequels don't wreck this movie: Some of them are really, really good, just not great like this one.

Even though i have seen this movie for the 90 millioneth time, it still has that power to give me shivers.<br/><br/>The main reason this movie sticks in my head is the pure horror of it,Wes Craven's fantastical direction and his tense set pieces (See Tina's Death for instance) Is pure horror movie genius and is definately one of my top 10 jaw dropping movie moments.<br/><br/>For anyone out there that has'nt seen this movie (and i doubt it very much) RENT THIS or BUY THIS, because if your looking for a horror movie that has kept its scares, shocks, and creeps.. then this is the baby for you !<br/><br/>

","A Nightmare On Elm Street is surprisingly good. I was a bit skeptical before I sat down to watch this- thinking that it was going to be as bad as Freddy's nemesis- Jason's Friday the 13th movies. But I was pleasantly proved wrong. The story is a bit predictable, however, it is interesting enough to keep your fat butt on the edge of your seat. The effects in the film were well done and the horrific portrayal of Freddy Krueger is by far one of the scariest I've seen in quite some time.

","In a time where bad movies (usually horror and/or comedies)ran rampant all over movie theaters and television sets throught the decade, there were a few shining gems that were actually not low-budget cheese at all, but well-made, influential films. One of them is ""Nightmare On Elm Street"". Although today, the cliches in the film have been seen many times before, when this came out, it was (for the most part) all brand new and exciting. Watching the film today, I realized that it is still a good film and always will be one, no matter what time period it is being watched in."

The non-specific article use tells us that this film is itself the nightmare.  Many have posited that all films are a waking dream.  Wes Craven took this idea into the realm of our worst dreams.  Those who complain about the ending being confusing or a cheat or whatever are missing the point.  They were in the one and only nightmare when the film starts and do not leave it till the lights go up.  That is the films true genius.  Abandon logic and allow yourself to be absorbed in the vision.  The joy of the film is it's originality and visual virtuosity. Stop carping over whether or not it is scary enough.

"walshie2k3","9","0","0","7 July 2003"," Classic Thriller - SCARY! Recomendation 10 - 10
","Recomendation 10 out of 10<br/><br/>This is a classic Horror film. It is mentally scary more than any thing. However, this is the best film out of The Nightmare on Elm Street. What makes it so scary if Fredys voice. Fredy has hardly no lines. This makes it scary. And when he does speak it is demonic. Well remembered Freddy lines are ""I'll kill you slow"" and ""I'll split you in two"". These are simple but genuinly scary lines<br/><br/>One of the other things I like about this film, is that some part of it is true. There is one scene were Nancy falls asleep during English class. She is still asleep but you see her screaming, shouting and in a sort of fit like episode. That is actually a sleep disorder which is not rare, as I have suffered it myself. It is know as night terrors. This is were a person is half asleep and half awake. Also there have been reports of people having Nightmares and later dieing in there sleep. These are the two factors that inspired Wes Craven to create the movie. I think that what makes this movie scary is because when you go to bed or go to sleep you feel safe and relaxed. This just proves that no matter where you go you have to sleep and if you cant sleep your better off dead.<br/><br/>This is a movie that is not to be missed by any horror fan. I would strongly advise to anyone who is planning on watching these movies to watch the first one first. As this will tell you about Fredy's past. It is one of the better Nightmare films! This film is definatly in my top ten favorite and will make you think twice when getting into bed!"

","Basically about four teenagers who all have the same dream of being murdered which is caused by something their parents did in the past.<br/><br/>When I saw the very beginning of A Nightmare on Elm Street yesterday I thought: ""Great..., yet another slasher-movie."" But I was soon to change my mind as the film ran. The very idea of the murderer existing in the teenagers dreams and that injuries/wounds which are obtained in the dreams transfer to the real world is brilliant.<br/><br/>I must say that I am impressed with Heather Langenkamp's performance as Nancy. Also Johnny Depp was good in this very early role of his. It was fun to see him here before he became an established actor. Robert Englund was superb as Freddy Kreuger and he really did look evil! The film itself was only partly scary but the excitement lasted throughout. The gore was at a reasonable level, because in my opinion even slasher-movies can be too gory. I feel that the music was good but not great which prevents me from giving this a higher grade as music is a crucial part of horror-movies. Having said this, I have to give A Nightmare on Elm Street a well-deserved 7/10."

"Mulliga","Null","0","0","18 June 2003"," Heather Langenkamp: A Tribute
","""Nightmare"" is a classic horror film, and perhaps the scariest slasher ever made (aside from Halloween, that is). Much of that terror comes from the performance of Heather Langenkamp.<br/><br/>Ms. Langenkamp imbues the role with intelligence and determination (no surprise - she earned a degree in English from Stanford University while working to pay for it herself!). Some have called her performance stilted and listless, but I disagree; Nancy reacts differently from the other characters because she IS different - like Jamie Lee Curtis in ""Halloween,"" she dares to fight back against the monster. This idea of a heroine kicking butt, while certainly commonplace now with shows like Buffy, Xena, and Alias, was still quite novel in the 80s.<br/><br/>The real Heather Langenkamp is a devoted wife and mother, as well as the head of a chewing gum business. Ironically, she married a special effects makeup artist (just like in ""New Nightmare""!). Inducted by Fangoria into the Horror Hall of Fame, Heather Langenkamp, just like the plot of ""New Nightmare"" says, brought life to Nancy, turning her into one of cinema's most memorable scream queens."

"Krug Stillo","9","0","0","31 May 2003"," Another Craven Classic
","SPOILERS AHEAD ... Once Wes Craven accepted the fact that in the horror arena was where his career belonged, he made his first true blockbuster. Less commercial than his later Scream trilogy, but more professional than his earlier Last House on the Left and The Hills Have Eyes, A Nightmare on Elm Street was his most original and imaginative work to date. More successful than the actual film was its hero', who in this case was the film's wisecracking villain: Freddy Krueger. Basically a monster crafted from other past Craven characters: the vile Krug Stillo', child-molesting sleaze-ball, Fred Podawski' and the subhuman mutant cannibals, Pluto' and Mars'. The basis of Craven's story eminated from a selection of newspaper articles detailing the deaths of certain youths who were afraid to sleep. Then, one night when they were unable to stay awake, they fell asleep and died.<br/><br/>On first viewing one must forget all about Freddy and the franchise, then you'll find that A Nightmare on Elm Street is a well-mounted mystery/fantasy/horror. I'm sure there's no need for me to delve into the plot, but for those who were sleeping and haven't seen the original, or only saw the sequels, none of which came anywhere near as eerie and dark as the original, here you go All of Nancy's friends are dying in their sleep. She discovers that they were all suffering from realistic nightmares in which they were stalked by a shadowy figure in a red and green sweatshirt and a dirty old fedora. Nancy is now threatened by the same man in her dreams and knows she must solve the mystery if she wants to survive.<br/><br/>
She discovers his identity as the notorious Fred Krueger, a child murderer that the Elm street parents hunted down and burned alive in retribution. Now, not only does he play cat and mouse with their children in their dreams, if he kills or harms in that realm, the same happens in reality. The story by Craven is ingenious, the music by Charles Berstein is memorably chilling and the photography by Jacques Haitkin is beautiful.<br/><br/>Six sequels followed & Freddy became a superstar, alongside other seemingly invincible maniacs who stalked the cinema at the period, in particular Michael Myers and Jason Vorheesetc. replacing the monsters of yesteryear; Dracula, The Mummy and Frankestein. Saxon and Langenkamp returned in parts 3 and Craven's attempt to put Freddy to bed, New Nightmare.<br/><br/>This best added features on the DVD are an interesting commentary by Wes, Langenkamp, Saxon and Jacques Haitkin and a theatrical trailer. This DVD is also the first part of the series in five-disk box set. A must for all Freddy fans."
"BillyBC","Null","0","0","20 May 2003"," Craven reinvents the '80s slasher genre
","(****1/2 out of *****)<br/><br/>Along with ""Halloween"" and ""Friday the 13th,"" this was one of the three most successful series in the 80s horror genre.  This is easily Craven's best movie to date (including the semi-horror/semi-satirical ""Scream"" series).  He puts an original spin on the (by-then) standard slasher formula by making his killer, Freddy Krueger, a deceased child killer who lives on in the nightmares of the children of the neighborhood parents who burned him to death in his boiler room when the courts were unable to convict him. Unlike its increasingly silly sequels, this movie doesn't overexpose Krueger (played by Robert Englund) and, instead of having him crack lame one-liners throughout, tries to make him an evil and frightening character.  There are a number of imaginative and memorable scenes:  a bloody Amanda Wyss being lifted and dragged across the ceiling by the invisible Freddy; Freddy's arms extending across the alley and his steel-clawed fingernails scratching and making sparks along the brick wall as he pursues Heather Langenkamp; future star (and serious actor) Johnny Depp being pulled into a hole in his bed and discharged in a geyser of blood; and there are plenty more.  Some of the ideas are borrowed from earlier movies and books, but Craven still deserves credit for doing something inventive with the typical slasher movie.  The cast also includes John Saxon, Ronee Blakley, Jsu Garcia and Charles Fleischer.<br/><br/>HIGHLIGHT:  In the creepiest scene, Langenkamp follows her dead, bloodied and bodybag-covered best friend (Wyss) through deserted school hallways and down into the shadowy boiler room."

He would tell me the history of Mr. Krueger and that if i went to sleep he would get me in my dreams.  The thought of this at that age really scared me.  A few years later, i was a little older and i was home alone.  I took my brothers copy of ANOES and watched. I was extremely scared.  Freddy was a great horror villian.  I just saw this movie recently, me being much older then i was the last time i saw it and more mature.  This was a good movie. Now, not so scary, but definitly a classic and it was very original.

","""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is done somewhat of a disservice by most of the sequels that followed it. They are cheesy horror films whose main device is special effects-layden dream sequences. They are not scary. The original film was truly terrifying to me when I first saw it. I didn't want to go to sleep for rear that that awful creature who lurked in the shadows of Nancy's dream whould get me next. I asked my parents ""you didn't murder any child killers did you?"" Freddy was a serious villain who said very little and mostly just gave out that sinister high pitch laugh which is lost in the later films. He's terrifying instead of corny. The final sequel comes closest to the original in it's plot line, bringing back the old cast with the idea that their imaginary tormenter had somehow found his way into the real world. It is much better that the other 5 sequels. No matter how cheesy or stupid you might thing the sequels to ""Nightmare"" are"" don't let it detract from the original.

First are the movies that I like very much, for example ""Harry Potter"" or, if you are true cine-fan, much of Fellini films. Second are films that I dislike or even hate, I think ""Matrix"" would be perfect for it. But third... There are films which I call ""movies of my childhood"" (there are, of course, actors too), which both you and I jaust cannot discuss, even if they were in bad quality. You see, when Russians had the time of Perestroyka and Glasnost, there was a lot of American films were shown in our theaters. So, ""Nuns on the Run"", ""Godzilla"" and others can be easily named as ""my childhood films"" ( because I was then 10 or 11). And this movie is on the first place. I remember it impressed me so much that I began collect the money for buying another part of ""Nightmare"" films, so much that Robert Englund became one of my most favourite actors and I even asked my mother to make me a Freddy red-green sweater. Sounds strange, huh? But this movie just hooked me... Well, what else can I say about this movie? Wes Craven did it - directed and wrote this cleverest and intriguing shocker of all times, and it is superb. Everything in this movie is just first rate; the cast and the acting - how can you forget fresh, zany, sexy and beautiful Heather Langenkamp as Nancy Thompson, or really funny Johnny Depp's first(!) screen appearance (probably that's the reason why I still can't take him serious), or Ronee Blakley and John Saxon's outstanding performances as Nancy's always-doubting-in-something-but-still-having-a-smile-on-their-face parents, or - say it with me - F-R-E-D-D-Y  K-R-U-E-G-E-R in Robert Englund's body. But it's all also about the music. I don't know how Charles Bernstein made it, but every time I hear the Freddy main theme, it makes me thrill and chill on one side and laugh out loud on another. So, what else could I say? The camera work is excellent, the plot couldn't be better. This movie is far from ""worth to watch"" and ""instant classic"". Wait - it will COME AFTER YOU.

Heather Langenkamp is put down for most of her acting skills throughout the series, but she also puts on a very good performance in this one. Also the nightmare series in my opinion is what made Robert Englund what he is today. <br/><br/>MINOR SPOILER: One of the coolest things in this movie is that Freddy goes through a progressive change. He starts out weak and sounds like the actor that played him instead of a gravel-voiced dream demon like in the other movies; throughout the movie he becomes more evil and stronger with the more souls he gets.

","There are three characters that make you think of truly terrifying horror, and they are Michael Myers, Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger. Michael Myers' ""Halloween"" is deffinately a classic, filled with suspnese and chilling music. Jason Voorhees' ""Friday the 13th"" didn't even star Jason until Part Two. The movie was probably the dumbest movie ever made. And neither were particularly scary. Probably because everybody knows that people don't go on murderous killing sprees because the people they're stalking are between 17 and 26. Wes Craven read a news article about a group of kids who died after having violent nightmares of a creepy killer. Of course, everybody has dreams, so what better way to scare people than to find something that occurs in everyday life and put a murderous twist on it? After this, he created Nightmare pn Elm Street, one of the scariest movies ever made. The killer, as said above, is Freddy Krueger, a child murderer who was killed by a group of parents after being declared innocent of his crimes. He now exists as a dream demon; if he kills you in a dream, you die in real life. He's hunting down the children of the ones who killed him, and they don't seem to stand a chance, until one of them, Nancy, learns Freddy's moves and takes a stand in a truly amazig showdown.

","Wes Craven wrote, directed and produced this masterpiece about a group of teens plagued by a dark figure in their dreams who wants to kill them. This is the film that would help make Robert England a horror legend and put Freddy Krueger along such baddies as Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers. Heather Langenkamp and veteran actor John Saxon co-star as Nancy and LT. Donald Thompson. The atmosphere of this film is extremely dark, Wes Craven made sure to hide Freddy's face extremely well and give the audience a sense of fear.

"Mr Parker","Null","0","0","30 August 2002"," I wanna be.... your sledgehammer!
","This film is easily on my top three scariest films of all time. Sure, Freddy kinda got overexposed, what with Halloween costumes, toys, fifteen exceedingly bad sequels with another one on the way, talk show appearances, his own t.v. show, his own lingerie line, cookbook, website, board games, video games, condoms, etc., etc. available to the public. It's too bad because what made the first Elm Street work was the fact that you barely saw the guy at all. There isn't one scene in the movie where you get a real good look at this guy and to me, that's what makes the film scary even to this day. Even though the film contains many of the things that buried the slasher genre (the person investigating the strange noises for example), the movie still contains one of the more original stories seen in the horror genre. It's been imitated who knows how many times and while a little dated by the all too familiar '80s wardrobe, it's still pretty timeless. I don't know what's up with some of the music in this, it sounds like it was done with a really bad synthesizer. Heather Lagenkamp gives a great performance as the heroine and is the precursor for most of the slasher movie heroines that take a stand. Watch as she sets up a booby trap for Freddy with a door tripped sledgehammer to the chest! Watch for Johnny Depp in an early role. Definitely worth seeing or owning. Wes Craven at his best folks. Or would he be his best with Scream? Rating: **** out of *****."

","(POSSIBLE SPOILERS)<br/><br/>Despite being an adult when I viewed this movie, it scared the hell out of me and gave me a few sleepless nights.<br/><br/>The concept of this movie was brilliant-a maniacal killer back from the dead to haunt your dreams. Freddy Krueggar was evil personified and he was the ugliest horror villain ever having a face resembling an overcooked pizza.<br/><br/>Robert Englund excels as Freddy Krueggar. It was hard to believe that Englund played the mild mannered Willie in 'V:The Mini-Series' because in this film he was pure evil. Heather Langenkamp also did a great job as Nancy who was doing her best to stay awake to save her life. John Saxon and Ronee Blakely also played good roles.<br/><br/>The beginning of this film is truly creepy where one of Nancy's friends is butchered when Freddy gets into her dreams and kills her. How do you defeat a being who exists in your dreams and can not be killed by conventional means? You simply stay awake. However, staying awake can also lead to death eventually so you're pretty much stumped.<br/><br/>The ending is very creepy too. Nancy defeats Freddy (I won't say how) but the final scene is really scary as you realise Freddy is one dude who won't be staying down.<br/><br/>I happen to think this was a very symbolic movie telling us that dreams are only dreams and can cause you no harm if you don't let them. It's when you do let them cause you harm that the danger starts.<br/><br/>But, philosophical thinking aside, A Nightmare On Elm Street is a classic horror of the 80's and praise must go to Wes Craven and also to Freddy who carved his own niche."

","Ok, so the plot is something like this...<br/><br/>A horribly burned man with a dirty hat and striped sweatshirt is terrorizing a group of friends on Elm Street. Only this isn't just any man, he has a glove with knives fastened on for fingers and he's trying to kill them in their sleep. How you ask? By entering their dreams at night and stalking them one by one. It's simple really, whatever happens to them in their dreams happens to them in real life. Scary as hell, huh?<br/><br/>You bet it is! I swear, Wes Craven is a genius. To come up with a concept so simple yet so unbelievably horrific at the same time. Not only is the burned bad guy (Freddy Krueger) gruesome enough to kill just by looking at him, but he's designed a set of knives attached to a glove on his right hand to do the dirty work. As the children of Elm Street start falling victim to Freddy Krueger, one girl must stand up and fight against the evil which claims her friends, or she will be next!<br/><br/>Leading the cast of great actors (including Johnny Depp in his  first role) is the beautiful heroine, Nancy ( played  by Heather Langenkamp). The curiously terrifying Freddy Krueger is played by the extremely talented Robert Englund (who also stars in the sequels).<br/><br/>There were many things that made this movie great. The acting and lightning were top notch. The death scenes were fantastic and there was enough blood to satisfy any horror fanatic. However, that's only the beginning. This movie isn't like the other stalk and slash films of its day (which by the way, I love and watch constantly), it attacks you in the one place you thought was safe, your bedroom! Picture this..you're falling wearily asleep, head rested on pillow, snuggled under layers of blankets. Sounds good huh? Nope, because the second you fall asleep Freddy will be ready to bring you to your nightmares!<br/><br/>So, where do you run? Where do you hide? Don't worry, you're safe. Just as long as you don't fall asleep!<br/><br/>Don't miss this movie! In fact go out and rent or buy it right now! You won't be disappointed but you might be scared!     10/10"

Well, I took some time to revisit the original ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" and found that not only is it not a classic of modern horror, it itself is one goofy movie.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I like it. Freddy is a great character, and there are some great kills- the girl on the ceiling and the bed-turned-blood fountain. But there are tons of goofy scenes in the movie: Freddy's face falling off to reveal a silly skull with bug eyes, Freddy appearing as an ugly girl with two big pony tails, and the whole absurd sequence where our protagonist rigs her house with traps to catch Freddy (I never knew  ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" was the inspiration for ""Home Alone"").  Even the final ""zinger"" scene is hilarious- with the obvious dummy of the mother being pulled through the window. <br/><br/>So, while I would recommend this movie, I don't think it's a genuinely ""good"" movie. I think parts 3-5 are where the series really hit its stride, taking full advantage of the dream settings and Freddy's powers."

","After ""Halloween"" (1978) there were many horror films trying to be successful. Many succeeded. But the people who were making the imitations also tried to be original. Nearly no one succeeded. A Nightmare on Elm Street was one of the rare exceptions. Sure, there are similarities between ""Halloween"" and this one. But A Nightmare on Elm Street was far more original than any of the other slasher horror films. The idea of a mass murderer killing people in their dreams is very exciting and very original. Freddy Krueger is one of the best and most sadistic persons in the history of horror films. Unfortunately they turned him into a comedian in most of the sequels.<br/><br/>Robert Englund is great in the role of Freddy. He was born to play this part (that's why they never replaced him). Heather Langenkamp is very believable and not one of these blond and dumb girls that can be seen in other films of this genre (Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode was an exception). The opening sequence shows us right at the beginning what the film is about. There are no flaws in the film and it never gets lame. It is unpredictable because you can never be sure if you are in a dream sequence or in real life.<br/><br/>The film is very intense and scary and the special effects are gripping. I still wonder how Wes Craven and his crew were able to shoot this film and the effects in it on such a small budget.<br/><br/>A must-see for any true fan of the horror genre and anybody else who likes being scared and entertained at the same time.<br/><br/>My rating: 10/10 (I don't recommend Part 2: Freddy's Revenge to anybody who is not a passionate fan of the series)"

","i have a theory on this movie   what if it is not really meant to be seen as a horror movie.  hahahahaha i hear you say. but what if it is just a cover for the real hidden meaning. the theory goes that it is a study on the loss of friendship and the reactions/mentality of its affect. nancy loses her friends thru death, the basis of this is to show how a teenager in the early/mid eighties would deal with such an issue. if it was to be tina who had survived and not nancy, would the differences be more noticeable? the answeris yes. from what we see of tina, we see she is a weak personality (as are all of her friends/mother who die in the film) and therefore deserves to die. nancy seems to deal with the event and move on... but she is also starting to loose her mind. is freddy real or is he just a nightmare? this is the whole idea of the tragedy, try to make the strong one breakdown by killing off the weak ones. in essence this could be a true shakespearean tragedy... if good ole willy had thought of it :) nancy is a tool to show young women how to be stronger role models for themselves. as she was loosing her mind, she also became stronger by continuing her course of action, and in doing so proved that she was right all along, thus proving that the stronger does prevail. i believe that the horror is just a front to hide the bigger issue, cause lets face the 80's were the time of the horror movie. crappy as most were... this one had to hide it's issues to become the hit it remains today. the gore factor is a cover.... thats how i see it. any counter claims please email me in responce.<br/><br/>thanks"

The first Nightmare film was original.  Others will copy this format over and over again...including Mr. Craven himself (Shocker).  Heather Langenkamp, Amanda Wyss and Johnny Depp were  great unknown actors in this film.  You can't really cast any better for this type of film.  It was also great to see horror great John Saxon reappear on the screen.<br/><br/>The chemistry flows nicely throughout the film.  At times, Langenkamp seems to be talking to herself and not the actor she is supposed to, but overall it's one great scare.  Wyss played a great sexy little friend of Langenkamp's and her scene-stealing death scene is one of the greatest of all time.  The fact that when you were hurt in your dreams, you were hurt in real life has opened the imagination for many.  While it may not be totally original (H.P. Lovecraft's dreamland's novels used this to a limited degree), it did introduce it to a wide audience.<br/><br/>On such a limited budget, Craven and his group did a wonderful job keeping the effects realistic and the story great!"

","""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" was released in 1984 and introduced Fred Krueger in his darker times. Story focuses on Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp) and her friends Tina (Amanda Wyss), Glen (Johnny Depp, in his first starring role) and Rod (Nick Corri), who are having nightmares about a burned man in a red and green sweater and dirty fedora who wears razors on his right hand. He was a child murderer freed on a technicality. The parents of the murdered kids got together, tracked him down and burned him to death. He returned in the dreams of their other kids to kill them, to make them pay for what they did to him. Each of the teens gets killed by Freddy until Nancy is left, in which she enters his world to carry him into the real world, so he can die. This film is very scary, disregard any of the other ones, focus on this one. The acting is great, especially by Langenkamp, she puts on a pretty crazy performance.

"Morphy-3","10","0","0","12 August 1999"," A true classic though the ending is less than it could have been
","Wes Craven's ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is a truly masterful work. It is uniquely scary: No other horror film makes use of  the ""dream aesthetic"" as this one does. However, it does have three flaws: 1. The acting is uneven in quality. Heather Langenkamp's (Nancy's) performance is excellent as are the performances of most of the teens in the film and Robert Englund. However, the other performances are rather poor (with the possible exception of the actor playing Nancy's father). 2. Wes indulges himself, allowing his film to be diluted with some of the cheapest and most hum-drum devices of horror film. 3. The ending, which was changed from the one originally written by Wes, hurts the theme of the work---it destroys the sense that ""it was only a dream"" and again makes the work quite stereotypical. Despite these flaws, the aware viewer will notice much that is clever about this film and much that is terrifying in a way that can only be described as primal and archetypal. I give this film a 9.5 out of 10. A true classic. (With the intended ending, I'd have given 10 out of 10.) This film and ""New Nightmare"" are the only worthwhile ones in the series, however. If you must watch a third, Watch ""A Nightmare on Elm Street: 3."" Avoid all the others like the plague."

For instance all that we were allowed to see was no more than his glove and sometimes the silhouette of his hat and spent most of his time with his face hidden in shadows. But other than that Robert Englund and Heather Langenkamp performed  both roles well making this an artistic movie also.

She makes Nancy a sympathetic character who just might be going crazy. However, my favorite was Johnny Depp, in his film debut.

","I am a horror fan. My first horror film was Phantasm III, when I was five years old. Since then, my maturity has led e into better films. I first watched the original Nightmare when I was 12. After the credits rolled, I knew life s I knew it was changed forever. With a great plot, fantastic acting for a horror movie, and a killer that just won't quit, the claustrophobic production sent shivers down my spine. A wonderful contribution to the film was heroine Heather Langenkamp. She evoked the proper sympathy for a person who has lost all of her friends. She then shows that sh can work well under pressure. Langenkamp acts as well as another woman in a dramatic film, and I believe that she, along with Freddy Krueger, are the reasons that the film series became so popular. And now, Freddy Krueger, played to menacing perfection by Robert Englund. Frightening yet interesting, the film's dark atmosphere was pertained thanks to Englund's performance as the claw wielding maniac. In the fourth through the sixth movie, Krueger would acquire a witty sense of humor, which wasted the movie. And now, Wes Craven's direction. I believe this was a true 80's gem, that he made sure was not another slash-and-dice flick. He would not achieve such greatness until Wes Craven's New Nightmare, ten years later. And lets not forget the wonderfully gory deaths in this picture. Amanda Wyss, being dragged up a all. Nick Corri, hung from a sheet in a jail cell. Johnny Depp, pulled into his bed thrown back up. And Ronee Blakely, burned alive. This is a horror movie that no fan should miss! If possible, get the DVD box set, which contains all seven movies, a bonus disc, and a booklet! It's a real treat."

","I didn't particularly care all that much for Wes Craven's ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" when I first saw it. But then came all the sequels. Parts 2-6 (unless you count 1994's ""A New Nightmare"", which was really a different kind of movie compared to the first six films in the series) made the original look better with each passing movie. Now this stands out as a cult classic. ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is the scary story which introduced the world to Freddy Krueger, the killer with knives for fingers who can enter the dreams of teenagers and kill them via their dreams. This is the movie in the series that scares me the most because it's also the most serious movie of the bunch. Freddy Krueger became more wisecracking in the sequels and therefore were less interesting. ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" has alot of thrills and scares, and some good performances (Johnny Depp made his film debut here). But the real star here is Craven, who not only directed ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" but also wrote the script. He created a monster that ranks right up there with earlier classic slasher killers such as Michael Myers (""Halloween""), Jason Voorhees (""Friday the 13th""), and Leatherface (""Texas Chainsaw Massacre""). While ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" isn't as effective as ""Halloween"" or Craven's own '90s smash ""Scream"", it's still an effective little horror thriller.<br/><br/>*** (out of four)"

I loved the charecter development between the charecters, I just wish that the actors had been a bit more seasoned for the roles they were playing.  I think the movie would have had more plot if they had focused more on the fathers distance from their family and less on the mothers alcoholism.  This was by far, in my opinion a good a tasteful movie.  It had a plot that developed at just the right places and gave you just enough gore to set you up, and then tare you back into your seat.

And it's unpredictable for its time. It's crazy to me that Wes Craven could have conjured up the concept of this movie and it's characters considering his strict, no movies allowed, Christian background.  But maybe that is why it is so good.  Freddy is really scary and the teenager as well as the adult characters feel very real.  Craven outdone himself on this film.  In fact, I don't think he has or ever will again upstage A Nightmare on Elm Street.  I love The People Under the Stairs and Shocker, and Scream was good (although it was not good for the genre.

","This is it, the one that started it all.  Hard to do a movie like this justice with a review, but I'll try.  This was like the third or fourth time I watched it and I still say it's damn good.  Not perfect, but few, if any, movies are.  It's hard to look at a movie like this without seeing the whole series, but even in relation to the rest of the series, it's one of the best.  Wes Craven really stumbled onto something good with this flick.<br/><br/>I'll start with the story, which is really quite simple when you get down to it.  It's the old-fashioned boogeyman story.  Something's under the bed and it's going to come out and get you as soon as you go to sleep.  The trick with this story is that the boogeyman isn't under the bed, but in your head. Simple, yes, but effective, because when you're dealing with dreams, or nightmares as the case may be, you have a lot of freedom.  The laws of reality don't bind you and Craven used that to make a pretty scary movie.<br/><br/>
It's really your basic slasher, teenagers, sex, and bloody death, but I think this was a far more imaginative slasher then, say, Friday the 13th, which was a killer in the woods basically.  Almost anyone could come up with that idea and throw in some nameless teenagers to get slaughtered. `Nightmare' took more thought and it shows.<br/><br/>Another thing is that there aren't any cannon fodder victims in this flick. You know, those people who are brought in just to be killed off.  In this movie all the characters are just that, characters.  The total number of bodies in `Nightmare' is a very low three, but each one of the deaths are gruesome and they all occur to developed characters, which means the effect is that much greater.<br/><br/>The acting wasn't top notch, but it was still very good.  Newcomers Heather Langenkamp and Johnny Depp (this was Depp's first movie) are great in their roles, as is good old Robert Englund playing (as if you didn't know) Freddy Krueger, the knife-gloved maniac.  John Saxon also plays a good role.<br/><br/>The special effects in this movie were really good considering what they had to do.  Krueger's burns are very gruesome and realistic, I just didn't get how he could be burned alive and still his hands were untouched (look under his glove, his skin is perfect).  There was a very good segment involving a girl being dragged up across a ceiling as well as a blood fountain that was pretty cool.<br/><br/>`A Nightmare on Elm Street' is a classic slasher and horror movie.  I think everyone should watch it at least once."

Wes Craven did a brilliant job in creating the notorious horror icon to day (i.e. Freddy Krueger) as well as another phase or realm of terrifying spectrum (killing in dream).<br/><br/>

","Ok, I was only ten at the time, but of all those classic horror films of the 80's this is the only one that kept me awake after it was over.  The fact that it deals with dreams had a hand in that as well.  I know that it would have the same affect if I saw it for the first time today.  Everyone knows the story by now, but here's my two cents:  a group of four friends are being tormented at night by a creep in their sleep.  Now, it's undetermined how long this has been going on, which would've been interesting to know, so we could contrast how long it lasted before he starts killing them!  Yep, in their sleep, he has someway of manipulating time and space, and physically slashing them with knives he has affixed to his hand (the famed ""glove""). The ability of which was something that was never determined either. Heroine Langenkamp realizes what's going on when one of the menaced kids says it looked like four razors were cutting his girlfriend at once.  She tries to mastermind a plan to bring the killer from the dreamworld, into the real one.  A truly innovative premise for it's time, which included elements from more convential horror films, made this a memorable and heavy hit. Aside from your usual dark and spooky imagery, one of the more overlooked effects is the absolutely chilling music.  Lots of slow screeching, bongy noises, then shocking keyboard stingers to help jumpstart your heart.  They contribute to the eeriness as much as anything else.  And anyone who says the film is dated must be in a dreamworld of their own, as buckets of blood spewing everywhere (though TREMENDOUSLY overused in the silly bedroom death involving Depp) never go out of style.  The film has really held up well, as nothing like it has come along since.  The performances still work, Saxon's doubting dad, Blakely's boozy mother, cute and spunky Langenkamp, and then the man of your dreams, the hardly heard, but coarse voiced, giggly Englund as Freddy.  One downspot is the ""second"" ending, a confusing moment designed to finish the film with a scare, that made no sense.  But overall a fine beginning to a series that would spawn 7(!) movies."

","""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" was in my opinion a classic original movie and stood alone in its time and genre. Sad to say, the sequels went in and out, with some of them okay in a sense, and others very lacking. All said, none compared to the brilliance of the original. The movie features a teenage girl and a group of friends menaced and stalked by a scarred dream-killer, who wears a dirty green and red sweater and a old rusty hat, with knives intentionally in the replacement of fingernails. He makes his appearance in strange and unexplained ways through his victims dreams of choice. Some are slaughtered, some are spared to linger on his presence. There are people in town who know of the ghosts past and how he perished. But we never quite find that out, which leaves the film hanging by its silk. The setting looks innocent at times, and plays on the audience by usage of eerie music...manifested by the ""DEAD"" children singing their tormenter's warning ""One-two, Freddy's coming for you...three-four, better lock your doors...five-six, grab your crucifix...seven-eight, better stay awake...nine-ten, never sleep again"" A creepy melody that dug under the surface of the viewers, and left an uneasy feeling of clamor. The special effects are mediocre, but the acting fares well for the kind of horror it dispenses. Wes Craven does a fine job with his direction, but could have satisfied us with a more tight ending...it didn't do to much for me.

","Never in another movie, horror or otherwise, has falling asleep and dreaming and being killed been such a deadly combination. Wes Craven has made many horror movies, as after ""Elm Street"" and some others he was locked into the genre, but this was a great combination of many things that led to this having eight sequels.<br/><br/>Perhaps the best part of this movie was the plot: a crazy child murderer who was unjustly killed and then became pure evil in order to kill children in their sleep. This was such an original idea that it took many sequels to totally drain Craven of the different dreams kids could have and then subsequently the different ways the kids could be killed. But the first ""Elm Street"" gripped audiences because they didn't know what to expect next; they didn't know what the rules where and how to abide by them.<br/><br/>From the second ""Elm Street"" on the child murderer, Freddy Krueger, was someone to avoid or someone who would just kill you in your dreams. But in the first one, he toyed with his victims because no one knew about him, his past, and how he died only to vow revenge by killing children in their dreams.<br/><br/>Heather Langenkamp, as Nancy Thompson, just doesn't wait around to be killed by this serial killer, as many other horror movies depict victims especially women. Nancy is the girl who learns about Freddy and his story and vows to stop him. She comes back in ""New Nightmare"" as herself and again she vows to stop ""Freddy"", but even though the idea for ""New Nightmare"" was incredibly unique the actual delivery of the idea was pretty poor. And the only other Freddy movie I'd recommend would be ""Freddy's Dead"" where another herione takes on the role of killing Freddy in a childless town that fears him; and in the process she learns about his childhood and how actually Freddy came to be.<br/><br/>No other serial killer slasher movie even compares to this, no matter who the killer is or victims are. I give this 4.5 out of 5 stars."
"cchase","Null","0","0","17 November 2000"," One of the true originals...
","For a horror film to achieve legendary status, it must offer its audience something truly original. It must have the ability to elicit its shocks and scares in a way that its target audience can identify with, without boring them to tears or insulting their intelligence. It must present protagonists we can empathize with and root for, and an antagonist that presents a threat that can represent something that we all fear, first and foremost, death in all its guises.<br/><br/>HALLOWEEN managed this somewhat, but John Carpenter's crowning achievement owes as much to Hitchcock and the 'giallo' stylings of Dario Argento, as it does to Carpenter's talent for introducing tried and true conventions in a way that audiences had never seen them presented before.<br/><br/>FRIDAY THE 13TH was actually no different and no better than most of Herschell Gordon Lewis splatterfests, or any of the infamous drive-in gross-outs that held sway all through the '60's and early '70's. What set it apart were the vast technical improvements over those earlier films, plus the unmistakable ability of master makeup artist Tom Savini to take cinematic gore to newer, more shocking and more repulsive levels. Which, bottom line, is about all that FRIDAY had going for it.<br/><br/>Leave it to the writer/co-producer/director of what truly WAS the granddaddy of the slasher genre, the almost unwatchable LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, to come up with one of the last, truly terrifying monsters of the horror canon.<br/><br/>
The moment we close our eyes and enter our own subconscious minds, traversing the lands of our private, individual dreamscapes, is the moment we become the most vulnerable. Even more exposed than our naked flesh, our open minds are subsceptible to suggestion, to outer and inner stimuli, to the light and dark sides of our psyches that otherwise we would never have a chance to explore...or dare to.<br/><br/>So what would happen if we introduced at this point, a creature who could take all the rules that bind the id, the ego and the superego, and slash the rulebook to bits? Someone who could wreak havoc at will the moment you fall asleep, free to torture, to maim, to murder you and your friends in your sleep, and not just make it SEEM real, but bring it all into the realm of waking, bleeding, screaming reality?<br/><br/>That is the brilliance and the power of the original NIGHTMARE, eons before Fred Krueger became a razor-fingered Rodney Dangerfield, tossing off goofy quips while dispatching trendy teen actors ranging from Robert Rusler, to Jennifer Rubin, and even occasionally, the likes of Zsa Zsa Gabor. This was like an ABC Afterschool Special whose script somehow found its way into the word processor of Clive Barker, took a left turn into THE TWILIGHT ZONE and never looked back.<br/><br/>Compared to the havoc that today's directors can now wreck with CGI, it may seem crude by today's ""Matrix""-style standards. Some of the dialogue is clunky, and there are a few glaring gaps in continuity, but in the casting, the acting, the direction, the special effects and the music (a truly spine-chilling score by genre specialist Charles Bernstein), very few movies of its decade could measure up. It raised the bar for overall ability to scare the squirts out of you, and I can't recall the last time a film frightened me as much as my first ELM STREET viewing did.<br/><br/>[And that definitely includes THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, which, IMHO, is a really pale imitation of LAST HOUSE. Get yourself the unrated copy of this horror-in-the-deep-woods gem, turn out the lights, sit back and let it enfold you. Afterwards, if you can still speak, you tell me if you think BLAIR WITCH is still the scariest movie you've ever seen. Anyone who has seen the complete version wouldn't have been surprised at all, that the same director came up with NIGHTMARE and the SCREAM movies. I certainly wasn't.]"

Well worth another glance, A Nightmare on Elm Street is a striking film. In a time when its creator is associated more with ""Scream"" or 94's ""Wes Craven's New Paycheque"" (where this film would be regurgitated for a sanitised cash market with only a hint of satire), this still stands up remarkably well.<br/><br/>A sort of Halloween meets Salvador Dali; Nightmare stars a Fred  not yet Freddy, note  Krueger who is genuinely disturbing. The 80's incidental music may sometimes sound like Depeche Mode on an all-night drinking session, but it's low-grade trappings and the amateurish acting only serve to make things more unnerving.<br/><br/>This is light years away from the rest of the franchise, an independent low budget horror. There's some appalling dubbing, disjointed dialogue (""What the Hell are dreams anyway?"" Nancy's mother cues an exposition-friendly Doctor), plus occasionally ropy special effects. Long-armed Freddy, anyone? Most importantly, though, it takes it's own world seriously. How odd that the sequels from the third onwards opted for send-up, while the second collapsed under the weight of it's own absurdity. You would have thought that at least one of them would learn from the original. The denouement is slightly limp, though clearly signposted by earlier dialogue. If your idea of a weak ending is the lead villain being called ""sh*t"" and having a back turned to him, then this fits the bill perfectly. But then again endings never did seem to be Craven's strong point, as New Nightmare's underdeveloped finale goes to prove.<br/><br/>Rather sensibly, Wes opted out of the studio-enforced sequel, Freddy's Revenge (4). Made and brought out within a year of the original, it contains the most homoerotic imagery you'll see this side of the gay soft porn industry. Even Freddy lovingly uses his claws to comb Jesse's (Mark Patton's) hair, while his S & M loving P.E. teacher is stripped naked and his bare bottom towel-spanked. While this is an unusual tack in the genre, it fails to be commendable, as the teacher in question is also a rapist. The unsettling surrealism of the first is perverted into pool parties and spontaneously-combusting parakeets. Freddy makes too much of an appearance, and the old horror classic of setting the villain in broad daylight and with incidental music that sounds like dolphin calls only adds to the lack of fear. It misses anything approaching the artistry of the original, and completely overlooks it's own prime remit: to scare.<br/><br/>As if in revenge for Freddy's Revenge, Craven took on a producer/co-writer function for the third film, the only time he would be involved until the tenth anniversary. Probably the best sequel if only because it has more plot than the rest of them stuck together, Dream Warriors (5) finally sees the franchise tip over into the mainstream. Nancy is back, as is, briefly, her dad. She's now a staff member at a juvenile amateur dramatics group, er, I mean, psychiatric ward, where they all develop special powers in their dreams. Violent, gory, comic book like and reliant on special effects and bad language, it also contains the first real example of nudity in the series. However, most of Freddy's appearances are shot with a psychological aspect in mind once more (particularly the head snake, a Freud-worrying concoction), and it's probably worth seeing just to see Krueger tell Zsa Zsa Gabor ""Who gives a f*** what you think?"" Generally, though, coming from the pens of Craven and Frank ""Shawshank"" Darabont you would expect a lot more. Direction, too, by Chuck Russell, lacks Craven's defter touch. From hereon it was only two films to go before the all-time low of Freddy's Dead (3).<br/><br/>The notion of vastly inferior sequels is always an odd one. Occasionally the originals can still hold their reputations intact (People still discuss Psycho without having to mention 2-4 in the same breath), but the adventures of Freddy & Co. are violently affected by what followed. The five painfully weak attempts to recreate its appeal means it's often forgotten that the first was a genuinely good film and worthy of... 7/10."

I've never been a fanatic over this series but I don't think there's any denying that this first entry is a very strong staple of the genre.

Heather Langenkamp has a certain mature nature that really comes through that makes her character very believable. The young Johnny Depp is also enjoyable to watch, although you certainly can't watch this and predict what would eventually become of him. John Saxon is the one who doesn't get enough credit for his performance as is Ronee Blakley. Then, of course, there's Englund with his terrific performance as the now legendary Freddy Krueger. In the end I think most of the film's credit has to go to Craven who really builds up an incredible atmosphere, which stalks this film from start to finish. The opening sequence in the boiler room doesn't show too much but at the same time it perfectly sets up the mood of what's to come. The dream sequences are also very well handled and a lot of them come off very disturbing. People can debate on what the studio would do to the character of Freddy over all the sequels but he had a purpose in this first film and it wasn't to make people laugh or telling funny one-liners."

","A Nightmare on Elm Street is a classic and I respect that, but I was very disappointed. This movie is plain boring and dull. The reason why this is unbearable to watch is because of the acting. Seriously the acting is HORRIBLE. Probably the poorest acting I've ever seen. There is not one decent performance. It seemed like the producers picked random bums off the street to play in the movie. The dialoge is just as poor. Also I was surprised that Johnny Depp played one of the teenagers. I feel sorry that he had to be in this crap fest. Still the plot is okay and the special effects were average. The only thing I enjoyed is Freddy Krueger terrorizing the teenager's lives. Anyway the 2010 remake is the version to see. Its scarier, well acted, great screenplay, and higher quality. The original is terrible."

","Freddy Krueger begins his murderous reign of terror as the evil boogeyman with knives for fingers who can attack people in their dreams in A Nightmare on Elm Street.<br/><br/>A young girl named Tina is having recurring nightmares of a disfigured man with knives for fingers who is trying to kill her. One night while hanging out with her friends for a sleepover, she has another terrifying nightmare and is killed in the dream by the burned man. We see that she is also killed in the real world. Her boyfriend Rob is blamed for her death, but he explains to our main heroine Nancy that she was attacked while asleep which she soon believes.<br/><br/>Nancy starts investigating and begins experiencing dreams of the disfigured man herself. She quickly learns that the boogeyman in her nightmares is named Freddy Krueger, a child murderer who was burned alive by parents (including hers) in the town after they discovered his vicious crimes. Freddy is clearly out to kill the children on Elm Street whose parents were responsible for his death. Can Nancy survive the dream world and stop Freddy? Or will she be done in by a nightmare?<br/><br/>I love this film and the entire Elm Street series. There are SO many wonderful things about this first Nightmare film that set the tone for the rest of the series. The music of the nursery rhyme ""one, two, Freddy's coming for you"" is first heard. We get the knives/fingernails scrapping across the metal int he boiler room. All things that are shown throughout each sequel but done here first. We get some gore in the death scenes, and also creative visuals from dream sequences.<br/><br/>Heather Langenkamp is a great scream queen and set the tone as the strong female lead who has the ability to take down Freddy once she figures out what is going on. Johnny Depp makes his debut as an actor and you can see the talent there even from this early on. Robert Englund is in his glory as Freddy Krueger, but it is worth noting that the comedic side of the character that we've come to know is nowhere to be found in this original film. We don't get much of that side to the character until around the 4th entry.<br/><br/>A Nightmare on Elm Street is one of those horror films that should be seen by everyone, not just fans of the genre. Wes Craven hit a homerun with this movie and it's creative villain. Freddy Krueger owned the 80's as a legendary bad guy, and it was all from Craven's twisted yet brilliant mind. Freddy isn't your typical Jason or Michael because of the dream element and his attack in those nightmares against the teenagers. One of the best horror films ever made for sure.<br/><br/>9/10"
"BandSAboutMovies","10","1","2","29 October 2018"," A surprising classic
","Upon watching this again for the first time in probably thirty years, I was struck by how European the movie feels. Perhaps it's the color tones throughout, suggesting the patina of Italian horror cinema (both Fulci and Craven cite surrealist filmmaker Luis Buñuel as an influence). It could also be John Saxon having lead billing. Or just that it doesn't feel like any horror cinema that was currently being made in the United States.<br/><br/>The real villain of this piece is not Freddy Kreuger - more on him in a bit - but the parents of Elm Street who have allowed secrets and their assumed authority over their children to do unspeakable and unspoken things. All of them are haunted by it, divorced, depressed and self-medicating with over dedication to their jobs or their addictions.<br/><br/>There are stories that David Warner was originally going to play Freddy, but that's been disproven. After plenty of actors tried out and failed to win the part, it went to Robert Englund, who darkened his eyes and acted like Klaus Kinski (!) to get the part.<br/><br/>The other feeling I have about this movie is that it owes a major debt - as all horror movies post 1978 do -to John Carpenter's Halloween. Much like that film, the true horror happens within the foliage of the suburbs, with shadow people showing up and disappearing. Much of the action on the final night happens within two houses. One of the main characters has the ultimate authority figure, a policeman, for a father. And the cinematography by Jacques Haitkin glides near the characters and around them, much like the stedicam shots that start Carpenter's film.<br/><br/>The film starts with Tina Gray (Amanda Wyss, who puts the events of Better Off Dead into motion by breaking up with Lloyd Dobler) waking up from a nightmare where a disfigured man chases her with a bladed glove. I loved the way this scene look, as you could almost consider Freddy off brand here, as his arms grow comedically long and he moves way faster than he would in the rest of the series. Yet by keeping him in the shadows, he's absolutely terrifying.<br/><br/>When Tina awakens, her nightgown has been slashed and she's afraid to go to sleep again. She learns that her friends, Nancy (Heather Langenkamp, who left Stamford University to be in this), Glen (introducing Johnny Depp) and Rod (Jsu Garcia, credited as Nicki Corri) have all been having the same dream. To console Tina, they all stay at her parent's house overnight. But when Tina falls asleep, Krueger is waiting. Rod awakes to find Tina flying all over the room and up the walls - an astounding effects sequence in the pre-CGI era - and he flees the scene after her death.<br/><br/>Soon, Rod is arrested by Lieutenant Don Thompson (Saxon), Nancy's father. Freddy now starts pursuing her, chasing her as she falls asleep in class (look for Lin Shaye as the teacher) and later in the bathtub, as his claw raises like a demented and deadly phallus between her thighs. Rod tells her how Tina dies and now she knows that the same killer is definitely after her (Garcia's watery eyes and lack of focus made Langenkamp think he was acting his heart out; the truth is he is high on heroin for real in this scene). She tries to find the killer, with Glen watching over her, but he's a lout and easily falls asleep. Only the alarm clock saves her, but no one can save Rod, who is hung in his sleep while rotting in a jail cell.<br/><br/>Nancy's mom Marge (Ronee Blakley, who was married to Wim Wenders, sang backup on Dylan's song ""Hurricane"" and she's also in Altman's Nashville) takes her to a sleep clinic, where Dr. King (Charles Fleischer, Roger Rabbit's voice) tries to figure out her nightmares. She emerges from a dream holding Freddy's hat to her mother's horror. Soon, she reveals to her daughter that the parents of Elm Street got revenge on Freddy Kreuger, a child murderer after a judge let him go on a technicality. In a deleted scene, we also learn that Nancy and her friends all lost a brother or sister that they never knew about.<br/><br/>While Nancy is barred up in her house by new security measures, Glen's parents won't allow him to see her. Soon, he's asleep and is transformed into an overwhelming fountain of blood. Nancy falls asleep after asking her father to come in twenty minutes. He doesn't listen and she pulls Freddy into our world. On the run, she screams for help until her father finally comes to her aid, just in time to watch a burning Freddy kill his ex-wife and them both disappear.<br/><br/>This is an incredibly complex stunt where Freddy is set ablaze, chases Nancy up the stairs, falls back down and runs back up - all in one take! At the time, it was the most elaborate fire stunt ever filmed and won Anthony Cecere an award for the best stunt of the year.<br/><br/>Nancy then realizes that if she doesn't believe in Freddy, he can't hurt her. She wakes up and everyone is still alive, ready to go to school. As the convertible hood opens up, she realizes that she's still trapped by Freddy, who drags her mother through a window.<br/><br/>In Craven's original script, the movie simply ended on a happy note. Producer Robert Shaye wanted the twist ending so that the door was open for a sequel, something Craven had no interest in. Four different endings were filmed: Craven's happy ending, Shaye's ending where Freddy wins and two compromises between their ideas."

"ashboomstick-50540","10","1","2","18 October 2018"," A Nightmare on Elm Street 1984 Review: Don't Fall Asleep
","In the late seventies and early eighties, there were a myriad of low budget ""slasher films,"" a group of movies where the premise usually involved a killer hunting down a bunch of stupid teens. Many of these supposed horror films came across as cheesy and dopey, failing miserably at the box office and with critics. However, some of these films were insanely successful at the box office, and are now considered cult classics. Films such as Halloween, Phantasm, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Friday the 13th are considered to be some of the more eventful and original horror films of the decade. The 1984 film, 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' is a prime example of the best of the eighties in terms of what these directors had to offer. It's no wonder that because of it's originality, dazzling special effects and fantastic characters that to this day, 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' is still one of the best.<br/><br/>What is it about this movie that makes it a horror classic? The number one reason is because of the originality of the storyline. The film's main concept is one of the more intriguing storylines and themes of horror. It also has an interesting origin story as to how Wes Craven (the director of the film) became inspired to craft this story and bring it to life The story begins when Craven found a Los Angeles newspaper article printed in the seventies which told the story of several Southeast Asian refugees who fled their hometowns as a result of war and genocide. These men later had a multitude of nightmares, resulting in some of then dying in their sleep. This horrific story, mixed with Craven's love for the seventies pop song 'Dream Weaver,' (set the tone for the music in the film) sealed the deal for Craven. In the end, I believe that nightmares, and the endless flow of information that could be revealed about dreams in the future is a fascinating subject matter. Craven's willingness to include this theme is what made the film so great.<br/><br/>One of the most salient issues with horror films is the tendency for the director to fail to craft realistic characters who you care about. While 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' certainly has this issue occasionally, most of the time, the average viewer will actually care about what happens to these characters. Why do you care about these characters, and not others? Because you actually learn certain interesting things about these characters and their home life. For example, we learn that Marge Thompson, the main characters mother is an alchoholic. We learn some interesting facts about Freddy Krueger himself, such as what kind of life he led when he was alive. This development of Krueger really makes you wonder what compels him to commit such horrid acts. You could continue asking questions about these characters for ages because Craven actually gives you questions to ask. Of course, if it weren't for the endlessly interesting main storyline, we wouldn't be able to have the chance to watch these great characters entertain us as much as they do in the film.<br/><br/>In the end, 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' solidifies itself as one of the strongest, most entertaining horror films. Hopefully the great abundance of modern horror directors will learn from some of these fantastic films such as ""Nightmare."" But no matter how hard they try, the future of the horror industry will never be as successful as it was in the eighties, partly because of the horror masterpiece, 'A Nightmare on Elm Street.<br/><br/>'A Nightmare on Elm Street=95%

","There is something really visceral and real about the first entry of the Elmstreet series. This movie was made before Freddy was an icon and the sequels almost turned it into a parody of it self. Even Johnny Depp was just an unknown kid. 
Even the make-up and special effects are way beyond the sequels; more gritty and life like. It's almost a snuff movie. Don't get me wrong I like all the movies, but this one is the best in the series, in my opinion. 
The acting is great, the story is to the point and has no fat to speak off, and the special effects look great and hold up very well today actually. Looking at the Freddy make-up; it's especially gruesome instead of rubbery. 
A great teen-angst movie and the best of the series."
"a_chinn","9","1","2","20 October 2017"," First is still the best, focusing on primal fears versus wisecracks
","Wes Craven's classic original film that spawned a highly influential franchised (and a terrible reboot) is still the best of them all. Craven cooks up an irresistible premise of child murderer Fred Kreuger killing the kids of Elm Street in their dreams as revenge for his mob justice murder by their parents may years before. What makes the set-up work so well is the blurring of the lines between dreams and reality when Kreuger stalks the kids in their dream. The characters fight sleep to avoid Kreuger, but are never quite sure when reality may have drifted into dreams after they may have dozed off in class, in a bathtub, or wherever they might be at any moment. Once reality moves into the dreamworld, Craven plays off of some of our most primal of fears; claws, drowning, burning, not knowing what's a dream and what's reality, and, of course, being killed in your dreams. In many ways, this film stands in stark contrast to the rest of the series. Most notably Freddy Krueger (in this film referred to as Fred Kreuger) has a total of 7-minutes screen time. This film is mainly about the Elm Street kids trying to figure out what's going on and how to stop Krueger. This film is also much stronger than the sequels because Freddy is not yet the wisecracking, one-liner delivering character he later became, which has the impact of making him a much more frightening of character. Since this is the first film in the franchise, it gets to tell the origin story of Freddy and Elm Street, which is more interesting than the sequels (""Dream Warriors"" and ""New Nightmare"" being the exceptions) and who all basically recycled the same material but with bigger budgets and set pieces. Heather Langenkamp is quite good in the lead as Nancy and Amanda Wyss is good as well as her best friend. I did like how Craven (SPOILER ALERT!) pulled a bit of a Marion Crane by starting the film with Wyss, who gets killed off about 20-minutes into the picture and the film then shifts it's focus to Langenkamp. It's also pretty fun to see a teenage Johnny Depp in his film debut. And, of course, Robert Englund is very scary and effective as Fred Kreuger, even if he's not on screen all that much. Englund really made this character his own throughout this series and England's absence from the remake is a major reason why that film did not work. Also worth mentioning is the iconic music from Charles Bernstein, who for some reason never scored another film in the series, and also of note is the wonderfully surreal and dreamlike photography by Jacques Haitkin, who's now a second unit director of photography on major Hollywood films like Captain America films, the Fast & Furious films, and even the new King Kong film, ""Kong: Skull Island."" My main complaint about the film is the ending. The producers wanted a twist ending that left it open for a sequel and Craven wanted a happy ending. I'm not completely opposed to twist endings, though more often than not they don't work, or even unhappy endings, but I do think this film would have worked better if it had more definitive of resolution. And regarding the producers desire for potential sequels, Jason got killed at the end most every Friday the 13th film and managed to come back over and over again. Why wouldn't that work here too? Overall, this is Craven's best film and one that really got under my skin as a kid back in the day watching it over and over on VHS, but what's so great about the film is that it still holds up today, both in concept and in suspense and scares."

The film is a brilliant classic,the acting was also brilliant especially from Heather Langenkamp who to this day,remains one of my favourite final girls along with Laurie from Halloween and Alice and Ginny from Friday The 13th:Part 1&2. Robert England was the only one in the three big horror franchises that actually appeared on screen and had actual lines,Michael and Jason just killed people and stared at people angrily. Johnny Depp also did a fantastic job in this doing an amazing performance as Nancys brother who was weird to see in this and even reappeared in the sixth Nightmare On Elm which was most likely the worst.

Even Johnny Depp didn't show enough realness in the kissing scene (his other scenes were great, though).<br/><br/>I feel glad to finally watch one of this great horror classic.

","Freddy Krueger is back...oh wait, this was actually the first movie in the series. I did in fact watch the 2010 remake and recognized it for the crapfest it was. This movie is superior in nearly every way even though I'm not a fan of slasher movies. Freddy was notable in being the first slasher villain who talked so this really was something innovative at the time. Come to think of it, has any slasher movie remained silent since his introduction? Chucky, Pinhead, the leprechaun, they all talk and came out later. I think a weakness is that Freddy isn't on screen that much.<br/><br/>He actually doesn't talk that much in this movie which is probably for the better. He appears as genuinely scary in this. We actually do get some pretty good character development for everyone else. That's probably because this movie has a fairly low body count and we're not just given the sense of developing doomed characters like the lesser ""Friday The 13th"" movies. Hey, this had ""Home Alone"" antics before ""Home Alone""! It's interesting to learn about the series mythology even though it isn't all explored here. ***"

"ratnakar-techie","8","1","2","6 August 2017"," Nightmares of Wes Craven
","Wes Craven's had played upon the subconscious nightmares of average Americans in his first two movies The Last House on The Left and The Hills Have Eyes. Both these movies were a typical motif of the 70′s exploitation grindhouse flicks, damned as B cinema, but which in years later would have a cult following of their own. They had certain elements common to 70′s Grindhouse flicks, copious amounts of gore, sex, nudity and violence. But most importantly they seemed to play upon the insecurity of the average American to the 60′s free sex, free living, flower power movement. In the Last House, two teen girls, out for a quick fix of hash, on a weekend, get into trouble, as they are kidnapped, gagged, taken to the woods, raped, tortured and finally kiled. Craven seems to set the line between the good folks and the bad folks, the bad folks, were guys who got stoned, were slutty, and horny. In an ironic indictment of the free sex mood, a particularly graphic scene, shows the two teen girls, forced to have sex with each other in front of their tormentors. Craven draws the line even more clearly in The Hills Have Eyes, where the good All American family, is stranded in the middle of nowhere, and they have to deal with the bad guys, the a family of violent thugs with a cannibalistic tendency.<br/><br/>In 1984, Craven came out Nightmare on Elm Street, a movie , that actually preys on a common fear, of nightmares. So many times we would have had nightmares, waking up in sweat, and wondering what if it really had happened. Interestingly the word nightmare originates from an Old English word referring to demons called incubi which were thought to sleep on the chests of people. This could be one reason, why the nightmare device has always been a favorite of horror fiction writers.<br/><br/>Traditionally horror movies have worked on the idea of something unseen somewhere, coming out and attacking us. Poltergeist played with the fear of ghosts coming from a TV set, and much later The Ring, toyed around with the idea of a spirit coming from an old video casette. The very reason why Nightmare is to date regarded as one of the best in the horror genre, is that its not just your routine, evil spirit comes out and goes slash, cut, slash on screaming victims. Nightmares have often been said to be the outcome of our inner fears, so Craven here by suggesting that our inner fears could actually end up coming true, puts in a psychological, Freudian sub text.<br/><br/>One of the scariest opening scenes, a young teen female of around 15, by stalked by a mysterious stranger.What i loved here is the way, Craven, shows the credits in every frame, the girl leaves behind, and we have the blades ripping through the fabric.<br/><br/>The opening murder is quite a shocker, following a standard cliché of slasher flicks-With great sex, comes sudden death. What I loved here is the way Craven, shows this from the POV of both the girl and the guy. On a side note, some kinda underlying message too here. Nancy(Heather Lagenkamp) the heroine, who refuses to have sex with her guy Glen( a certain Jonny Depp)is the one who survives. Tina her pal, who has a hot romp under the sheets gets killed. Something on ""Don't cross the line"", which Craven showed in The Last House on the Left too. <br/><br/>Not giving too much of the story away, but what works here is some absolutely creepy stuff, particularly one scene where Nancy gets pulled into a dark pool, while having her bath in a tub.<br/><br/>It has a total kick ass heroine in Nancy, who seems smart, sassy, feisty, quite a change from the dumb low IQ scream queens of horror flicks. And yeah Freddy Kruger one of the nastiest characters you can ever imagine. <br/><br/>This Nancy vs Freddy Kruger face off stands on par with Clarence Starling vs Hannibal Lecter, Ripley vs the Alien. And Heather Lagenkamp while no Jodie Foster or Sigourney Weaver, does a fairly good job. Also good to see John ""Enter the Dragon"" Saxon, in a support role as the heroine's cop father.<br/><br/>Craven also creates the necessary creepy mood here, with good light and shadow effect, especially in the surrealistic dream sequences, and also the climax. Though shot on a very low budget, the movie does not have a tacky feel to it, and the special effects are well done. The 80′s feel is there though, especially with some of the blood spilling scenes. Craven however did not take much interest in the sequels, though he wrote for the 3rd part, with the result, that like any other franchise, this also went downhill, as the subsequent versions just dumbed down the intelligence of the original to make them more audience friendly."
"Tweekums","8","1","2","24 May 2017"," A classic '80s horror
","Something strange is happening to four teenage friends; Nancy Thompson, Tina Gray, Rod Lane and Glen Lantz. Each of them have had the same nightmare about a man with a burnt face and knives on the fingers of one hand. Not wanting to be alone they spend the night at Tina's house. That night she has another nightmare she doesn't wake up. As the strange man attacks her in her dreams her boyfriend Rod witnesses her starting to bleed as though slashed by invisible knives! He is soon arrested for the murder by Nancy's father, the local police lieutenant. Nancy is sure that he wasn't to blame. She is terrified of going to sleep as she is sure she will be attacked. She does however agree to sleep under supervision at a 'dream lab'; something strange happens and as she is awakened from a nightmare she finds that she has the man's hat in her hands. The name inside suggests it belongs to Freddie Krueger; something her mother say is impossible as she was one of the people who killed Krueger, a child murderer, many years before. She hatches a plan to pull Krueger out of her dream she will need her boyfriend Glen to stay awake though.<br/><br/>This is an effective low budget horror film that is rightly considered a classic of the genre. The idea of somebody killing people in their dreams is a great concept as sleeping, and thus dreaming, is one thing we all do. There are plenty of good scares and some particularly gory moments. Freddie Krueger is a great horror monster although when we learn about his backstory it seems a little far-fetched as we are meant to believe that none of the kids have heard about somebody who had killed twenty children in their area even if that took place before they were born. The special effects are a little dated but still pretty decent. The cast isn't the best in the world but they are okay; a young Johnny Depp certainly doesn't hint at his later A-list status. Overall I'd certainly recommend it to fans of the genre as it had quite an influence on future horror films; not just the numerous sequels."

This one actually gives you a different connection with Freddy though. He looks and acts more like a dream demon, and a maniac, more so in the original than all the others. <br/><br/>There was some really creepy scenes that gave me nightmares when I was little. There was the introduction to the child murders (creepy kids jump-roping) and talking murdered people all cut up in body bags. This one isn't so goofy far fetched as the rest of them. Also, everyone knows it's Johnny Depp's first movie. He gets killed by getting sucked into the waterbed. This movie had pretty good acting for its time as well.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this movie if someone started out with the Nightmare series with another title, other than the original. An icon of a movie. No one can replace Robert Englund as Freddy. So I wish they'd stop trying to remake the series. Why mess with perfection?"

","I grew up on the slasher movies from the 1980's; those being ""Friday the 13th"", ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" and ""Halloween"". And this first installment from 1984 in the ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" franchise is certainly entertaining, but it lacked the zest that was established with the Freddy Krueger character in the later movies. And as such, then this first movie just turned out to be an adequate slasher movie. But all beginnings need to start somewhere.<br/><br/>I assume that you will already be familiar with the storyline, especially if you are a fan of the horror genre. But shortly recapped, then it is about a deviant killer who strikes terror and deals death to the youth of Elm Street from the dream world.<br/><br/>Granted that the Freddy Krueger character and the story concept was refreshing to the slasher genre of the early 1980's, then I just doesn't find this movie to be all that outstanding, especially compared to the later movies.<br/><br/>Heather Langenkamp was quite good in the role as Nancy, a she carried the movie quite nicely. And being more than overly familiar with the movies, then it is a nice character that she will reprise again in later movies. Robert Englund was a great choice for the Freddy Krueger character, just a shame that he didn't have the chance to be as much in-your-face with the Krueger wits and jokes as he is in the following movies.<br/><br/>The effects were quite good, and having good effects in a slasher movie is a must. Especially as the effects can be a deal breaker for the movie if they are bad.<br/><br/>While it is a no secret that Freddy Krueger is not my favorite of slasher characters, then he is a close runner up. I like the part that he kills in people's dreams and the dark, perverted humor that he has. His appearance is also remarkable and it is one that is easily remembered.<br/><br/>All in all, a fairly adequate start to the ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" franchise."

","Wes Craven's classic about a killer named Freddy Krueger who attacks teenagers in their dreams because of something their parents did years before. One of the best and most creative horror films of all time. It's often lumped in with movies in the slasher subgenre, and it does use many of those tropes, but it's much more interesting and imaginative than 99% of the slashers out there. Freddy Krueger, wonderfully played by Robert Englund, became a pop culture phenomenon like nothing that had been seen with horror movies since maybe the Universal movie monsters of old. The guy was on lunchboxes, for crying out loud.<br/><br/>The cast is pretty good, with Englund a standout for obvious reasons. Heather Langenkamp is one of horror's best ""final girls."" She has a relatability and normal quality about her that is rare for Hollywood. Compare her to any of today's young horror movie actresses, who are almost always glamorous bimbos who are aspiring pop music stars or at least look like they are. Admittedly she's not the strongest actress but she does well with the role of Nancy. John Saxon is good as Nancy's father. Johnny Depp makes his film debut as Nancy's boyfriend and does a fine job. The only stinker in the cast really is Jsu Garcia (billed here as Nick Corri). Every scene with him is a little cringeworthy as he seems to be trying to be the James Dean of horror. The movie's full of memorable scenes and striking images, such as Freddy's face coming through the wall above Nancy's bed or his glove reaching up between her legs in the bathtub. Wes Craven's direction is excellent in what is arguably the highlight of his long career. The script is smart and inventive. Charles Bernstein's iconic score deserves more praise than it gets. It's an atmospheric and influential horror film that gets better with each viewing. The sequels, TV show, and remake that followed only served to highlight how great this first Nightmare on Elm Street film is. If you haven't seen it yet, please do yourself a favor and watch it. For the love of all that's sacred, please watch it before you even think about watching the 2010 remake."
"framptonhollis","8","1","2","14 September 2015"," Awesome Movie!
","Wes Craven died recently, and I was shocked that, not only had he died, but I'd never even seen one of his films! So, I watched his two most iconic films, ""Scream"" and this film. If I had to choose a favorite, it'd probably be ""Scream"", but I still adored this film, even though it has a few flaws.<br/><br/>The main flaw, in my opinion, is that, when a character dies at the beginning of the film and Nancy goes to school, nobody's talking about it or acknowledging it in any way at all. I mean, a student at this school is found brutally killed and nobody seems to really care? I mean, in ""Scream"" the school made a pretty big deal at the murder of another student. <br/><br/>It also seemed to get a little goofy when Nancy set up booby traps and they attacked Freddy. However, the film does seem to have a little bit of humorous and, as I've heard, the other films in the franchise have way more gags.  However, what DOES work in the film? Practically everything else! The whole film has that classic 80s feel, which is always really enjoyable, the dream sequences are wonderfully surreal and weird, and I was constantly engaged throughout the film. It was a really fun, entertaining, interesting, and creative horror film.<br/><br/>If you're a big horror fan, than you've probably already seen the film, and if you haven't, than you totally should! It is definitely one of the absolute best horror films I've seen, and I believe, personally, that all of the hype that this film has gotten is very well deserved. Way to go, Wes Craven!"

","The biggest problem with this movie comes from the fact you don't enter the dreaming state of sleep until much later in the sleep cycle, thus making this entire movie stupid and pointless.<br/><br/>/End Review Actually this is a pretty good slasher film. Freddy Krueger was a child killer back in the day and now haunts the nightmares of a group of kids. This eclectic bunch is nothing more than your typical horror movie cannon fodder. The main girl is about the only character that I enjoyed slightly, and even she wasn't great. The idea of her perhaps going insane rather than actually being in a horrible situation could have been used to much better effect. The whole movie seems like Inception where there is a dream within a dream within a dream. There's no physics or laws that Freddy works within and he appears pretty much everywhere. That's why I'm led to believe this is dream within dream territory.<br/><br/>Nonetheless some of the effects are really good, Freddy can be really funny and has a lot of personality for a slasher villain, and the movie, overall, is a relatively good example of the genre. A little confused but definitely watchable and fun."

","Some high school kids start dreaming of a scary burned man with knives on his gloves. And soon he starts killing them in their dreams.<br/><br/>I just waited too long to watch the movie. It isn't hat it used to be. I mean, I am sure it seemed terrifying back in the days as it has created such a cult and I also heard to many people refer to it as a scariest movie ever. But watching it now as an adult who saw many slasher movies this one just didn't do anything for me.<br/><br/>I do like the idea. The fact that one is killed by someone in the dream is a scary thing since one can't escape sleeping, it something one just has to do and then is out of control. Too bad it didn't age well.<br/><br/>Was also fun to see Johnny in his first film role. The acting of his and everyone else in the cast doesn't seem so impressive, but I guess this is part of the genre. And the fact that the laughable dialogues make it harder.<br/><br/>Fred Krueger is an iconic villain. Greatly done by Robert Englund. I may not find this movie scary but whenever I think of the perfect slasher he is the one who comes to mind. And his back story actually makes me root for him, I can't stand people who perform their own executions when not happy with justice system. So go on Freddy, kill them and their families off!"

","I still really want to say good things about this movie.<br/><br/>In some ways, this movie doesn't hold up. The special effects are cheap and the synthesizer music is kind of corny. Unlike other films in the franchise, this one had a cheap budget. <br/><br/>The key weakness is Heather Langenkamp. She's a better makeup artist than an actress, which is why her career as an actress was limited after this. <br/><br/>The other problem is Freddy himself. Now, we all know Freddy from the later movies as the wise-cracking, find inventive ways to kill teenagers character we saw in the sequels. Here, he's just a straight up monster, no witty comments or clever gags. He just straight up murders people. <br/><br/>Speaking of Murder, we have only four murders in this entire movie. That's it. Freddy is kind of a slacker compared to Michael Myers or Jason Vorhees. <br/><br/>The film does have some great moments from Wes Craven, who does know how to frame a shot to make it scary."

","I saw this film was directed by Wes Craven, so I decided to give it a go seeing as one of my all time favourite films is Scream and he was the director for it. This film is classed as a Horror film and while the idea is quite a frightening one this is not a very scary film.<br/><br/>I think the problem is that there simply isn't enough blood and violence, modern day horror is filled with it and that is what makes us jump. There are a few jump moments in this film but overall it is actually quite a dull film... I expected to not want to go to sleep ever again or something extreme like that but really it was just... Dull... Although this is the case, the acting is still very good, believable and strong. Most of the characters don't get developed enough throughout the film and this lets it down though. The cast is good and the story is original and well thought out. The execution of it all - sadly - does not live up to the hype...<br/><br/>The ending was predictable and the rest of it was too, the shock moments that people desperately crave just weren't there. I'd recommend this if you're bored but don't expect to finish watching it and say ""Wow what a fantastic movie!"" because it's not... I thought Craven would have directed this better but it is just another mediocre horror film..."

When her friend Tina is horrifically murdered, the police suspect her boyfriend, Rod, of the crime. But Nancy begins to believe that the man from their dreams is killing them in her sleep.<br/><br/>She deprives herself of rest in a desperate attempt to stay alive. Finally she learns that the man is Freddy Krueger, a child murderer who was burnt alive by the townspeople years ago. Yet as more of her friends are killed, she realizes that Freddy is alive and dangerous in the dream world. She must face him on his turf if she wants to survive.<br/><br/>Nightmare on Elm Street is undoubtedly one of the greatest horror films of all time. Few slasher films have successfully created such an all encompassing atmosphere of tension, suspense, and terror. The film features a mix of decent and poor acting, with some of the better performances coming from Heather Langenkamp (Tina), Robert Englund (Freddy), and Johnny Depp, who plays Tina's boyfriend Glen and dies in one of the most classic scenes in slasher history. Nightmare is brilliant from start to finish, even if a couple of the special effects are a little cheesy, and some of the music is a bit hokey. <br/><br/>Of course Nightmare on Elm Street has the dubious reputation of being one of the greatest horror films, but also spawning one of the worst series of sequels. Seven sequels followed the 1984 original, most of which were relatively poor all around. Freddy rapidly deteriorates into a wise cracking comedic character and the films transforming into cheese-fests composed of goofy kill scenes and plentiful female nudity strung together with feeble plots. The main exception to this sad rule being the 1994 sequel Wes Craven's New Nightmare, which saw horror master Wes Craven's return to the franchise as writer and director. The film was also remade in 2010 with additional unfortunate results, although nowhere near as dismal as the majority of the sequels."

This movie really has what it is supposed to have. A lot of scares and a lot of gore. Robert Englund has really made a name for himself after the release of this movie.

"danpaul1","10","1","2","19 October 2011"," My personal opinion on the Nightmare series
","I first saw a Nightmare film when I was approximately nine years old - that was the fourth one. Keen to see more, I got hold of the first three. Out of all 7 original Nightmares, 1,3,and 7 are my faves - due to Nancy (Heather Langenkamp - who I admire as an actress not because she is a 'Scream Queen' but she works to make money on the side, it is not her life). The first NOES is much darker, scarier, and I recently watched the 're-imaging' and the original, and although I love the remake, this is one movie that stands out of the entire series. <br/><br/>Even though the kill count is not high, the terror, suspense and horror is. He is a killer than cannot be stopped, getting us in the safest place - our dreams. I will not give away plot points but I will say this movie is a benchmark for many movies that followed, also spanning a pop - culture franchise that, to this day is still massively popular. Freddy was his scariest in the first, the killings were more thought out and more gruesome. In a way, it is a shame that Robert Shaye has more control over the series than Wes Craven. Four 'Scream' movies and I want more. Wes is the horror king, and I also want to thank Langenkamp for returning twice, and Englund for doing eight movies. He is the ultimate Krueger. The sequels were all good but none beat the original. Guess it comes down to Sidney (Neve) in S4 saying, ""Don't f*** with the original!"". THIS IS ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVE MOVIES - IN ANY GENRE."
"mensmagazine","Null","1","2","19 July 2011"," Laughable dialogues
","I guess why I rated A Nightmare on Elm Street only 8 stars is because of the laughable dialogue, the inconsistencies and irregularities. For example, some things can come out of the dream when captured, such as the hat and (spoiler – someone else) but then the trellis she doesn't even hold onto comes back with her. A feather from her pillow is seen floating but the mirror Fred crashes through survives. Nancy requests 20 minutes to capture the killer and still has time to set half a dozen traps, have a nice mother-daughter talk and fall into deep sleep. And Fred is only supposed to appear when one's asleep; yet, Nancy receives a call from him and the ending blows any of the story's mythos out the window. Literally.<br/><br/>I'm not just talking about goofs, as all movies have them, but they set up a premise, a good and original one in a series of horror movies that relied on a masked killer stalking in the shadows. At least they tried here to change the trend. But, unfortunately, they kept breaking their own rules. It actually would've made more sense to have him as a ghost and then all bets are off. (Granted, he's sort of a ghost, but with rules.) As for the dialogue, though some of its iconic by now, it really doesn't hold up. A few years back, I saw A Nightmare on Elm Street in the theater for a one-night presentation. Being a huge fan, I arrived way early to get good seats, but still thought hardly anyone would show up. Well, it completely sold out. And to my surprise, everyone practically laughed all the way though it and it appeared both at and with the movie. I had to, myself. Even though I grew up on the series and loved them, the movie really was silly, namely for some of the lines, acting and characters – Oh, that drunk mother! Alcohol should be part of any nutritious breakfast! I don't think the audience was really criticizing the movie, they were just having fun.<br/><br/>Aside from negatives, I am still awarding the movie 8/10 due to the movie being enormously inventive, original, fun and despite Fred(dy) not being in it too much, he was extremely iconic, an instant super-villain. Also, I'm glad it started a cult following since a lot of the sequels explored a lot more and were, in a lot of ways, far superior to this original one. So, it did set the stage, introduced a whole new world and just as Jaws did for swimmers, this one did for sleepers. Only, with Jaws, you could choose to stay out of the water. Here, and in real life, you eventually have to sleep. Maybe for the last time."

","I'd never seen the first Nightmare on Elm Street until a couple of nights ago, though I have seen some of the others. Parts 2 and 3 were my first introduction to Freddy, back when I was 12. Can any kid born in the 80s and beyond truly say that they haven't had a nightmare about Freddy? Wes Craven really has no idea how much he stuck fear in the public subconscious with this character.<br/><br/>You all know the story at this point, so I'm guessing there's no point in summarizing it, but with a small cast and limited locations/budget, Craven proves just how much you can do with a good script and lots of determination. If only all horror wannabes realized this before saturating their movies with ugly CGI.<br/><br/>Depp had the most successful career of all the actors, but special mention must be made of Robert Englund, who played the character of Freddy for 21 years after this movie. He's probably one of the most iconic horror villains of all time, and make-up or not, it's ALL Robert Englund.<br/><br/>The mythology of Freddy certainly does lend itself well to numerous sequels. ANOES sets up so much potential that I have never really found the series and spin-offs to be stale or repetitive. The film itself hasn't really dated that much either, which is a common flaw of older horror movies.<br/><br/>I'm not really sure why I put off watching it until now, I feel like I'm a 'little bit' late to the party. It may be kind of tame by today's standards, but it's a great low-budget horror with plenty of imagination."

A glove with razor-sharp knives attached to his fingertips. The title of the movie appears. A title every fan of horror cinema should know and remember. A Nightmare on Elm Street.<br/><br/>What's not to love about this film? It's intense, original, scary and has a great feel to it. It's dark, funny at times and really shows some groundbreaking stuff. I mean, the death of Tina Gray is something you will not forget for a very long time. But let's not forget those little scenes; the moment where Tina appears in the school when Nancy falls asleep, the moment where Nancy falls asleep in the bath or where Glen gets pulled into his bed, following a re-enactment of the elevator scene from The Shining, only this time located in a teenagers' bedroom. Wes Craven shows us things we haven't seen before and things we won't forget.<br/><br/>But there's another reason why A Nightmare on Elm Street is different from a lot of other horror films. The characters are believable, likable and you really want to see how they make it out. Heather Langenkamp is the ultimate girl next door (next to Jamie Lee Curtis in Halloween) and the same goes for Depp and Wyss. No horny blonde teenagers who have so little braincells they almost beg to be killed by the murderer in the woods here. And it's not just the teenagers, what to think of Blakley and Saxon, who are terrific as the parents of the main character Nancy Thompson.<br/><br/>But last but not least we have the killer. No cliché killer here. Freddy Krueger is the ultimate boogeyman. His looks, his sadistic laugh, his powerful one-liners, it just perfect. Robert Englund, who at that time was known best for his role as the friendly Willie in V, clearly has a lot of fun playing the character. A character that without any hesitation can put himself next to Frankenstein and Dracula.<br/><br/>And that just leaves me to praise  well, everything else. The soundtrack by Charles Bernstein, the camera-work of Jaques Haitkin, the effects by Jim Doyle, the make-up by David Miller, they all do such a great job. Sure, at times the movie might seem a little dated, but it's fascinating how many scenes still have a tremendous impact on the viewers, even today. You might even say A Nightmare on Elm Street was far ahead of its time. Any way you slice it, you can clearly see there's blood, sweat, tears and love in this film. And it shows.<br/><br/>Thank you, Bob Shaye; for taking a risk and producing this film. Thank you Robert Englund; for giving us one of the best monsters in cinema history. And most of all, thank you Wes Craven. Thank you for giving us one of the best horror films of all time. Thank you for giving us A Nightmare on Elm Street."

","A group of friends (including Johnny Depp) all have the same nightmare: a man with claws and a Christmas sweater is trying to kill them. Unfortunately, the man is not just some bad dream: he is Freddy Krueger, and if you die asleep, you die forever.<br/><br/>This is Wes Craven's big break. His earlier films, particularly ""Last House on the Left"", may have been better, but this is the one that grabbed everyone's attention and today even those who haven't seen a single ""Nightmare"" film know who Freddy Krueger is: this film made Craven a master, and established a horror movie icon.<br/><br/>With one exception at the end, the special effects are also top notch for the time period. Bodies thrown into the ceiling, blood geysers spraying like mad. The makeup and costuming isn't bad, either... Freddy's burnt face gets even nastier when he starts to bleed maggots.<br/><br/>Mike Mayo is a bit cynical when he says, ""Because his powers are so elastic, this little moneymaker can be killed and resurrected as long as he stays in the black."" This is, of course, very true... at this point Krueger seems limitless, and even his origin is vague. Exactly how much sway this had over producers, I do not know. I can't see Craven in the office arguing that the film has sequel potential, especially since this was New Line's first major release.<br/><br/>If you see only one Wes Craven film, I guess I have to say make it this one. ""Last House on the Left"" and ""Hills Have Eyes"" are stronger, more edgy films, but they have not had half the cultural impact as ""Nightmare"". It is no exaggeration to say this film is a part of American history."

It is less one dimensional than the other two movies. <br/><br/>This movie is headlined by the character of Freddy Krueger, who not only has a unique appearance, but also has a unique personality. He is not all about business, such as Jason or Michael, but he is more about fun. His weapon of choice is also quite unique and adds a lot to his character.<br/><br/>This idea that he is able to kill in people's dreams is a neat take on a slasher film. How do you beat the need to sleep? <br/><br/>There was definitely a lot of silliness in this movie and even so much that it bordered and crossed into the realm of stupid. When Freddy was walking into all of the booby traps it felt as though I was watching ""Home Alone"" rather than a horror movie. I also really hated the end. The ""Freddy's not really dead"" ending was fine, but he was a convertible car? I just felt like they should have went out in a more frightening kind of way rather than a goofy one."

It was called An Angel at My Table and he said I should go see it. Standing outside the Prince Charles Theatre in Leicester Square I was standing there looking at two posters advertising the films playing. One was Angel the other was Nightmare on Elm Street 5. Needless to say I went to see Freddy. My cousins friend was disgusted. I upheld my decision which was the right one because I went and seen The Piano three years later and that is two hours I can never get back.<br/><br/>It is a tribute to Freddy and his creator Wes Craven that I still enjoy the odd scare, although there hasn't been a horror film since Nightmare that has come close to that feeling of exhilaration and fear.<br/><br/>Thanks."

","This is the most memorable horror movie of all time. I mean if you ever come across a person who don't know who Freddy is they quite possibly are the only one. You don't even have to say his last name really. I don't know about anybody else but Freddy was the most frightening thing in my childhood. The movies scared the hell out of me. For some it was the Exorcist, Jaws, or Friday the 13th. For me it was A Nightmare on Elm Street. Even now I watch it alone and in the dark, it still kinda freaks me out. Peple give all the the other Nightmare movies a bad wrap. I think they are nowhere as scary as the first, but in my opinion are entertaining as hell. Bottom line I love them all. The Halloween movies are good too."

","Freddie Krueger has been milked pretty badly over the years, mainly because Hollywood has been out of ideas for quite a while, but it doesn't make his first appearance any less intriguing. While in the later sequels, and anywhere else Freddie appeared for some reason, he's more of a horror comedy type of thing, here's he's just a straight-forward monster. The only extravagance he gets in the cool voice Robert Englund gives him, he doesn't take up the spotlights. Wes Craven knows how to handle his creation, and while he's at it he creates a lot of tension as well. His directing has never been better, he even puts in a girl hanging on the ceiling just for the heck of it, just to see if he could pull of that trick with the spinning room. And it makes for a great scene, but then again this thing is pretty much nothing but great scenes. It also has a sympathetic girl next door, which is rare in a horror movie. I didn't even want her to die or anything like that. Pretty groundbreaking."

Okay, if anyone has not seen this movie, try doing what I did. I was probably 13 when this happened. Try to get this movie, wait til its about 11:30 at night when everyone else in the house is asleep, shut off all the lights except for maybe one in the next room so it creates a creepy floor shadow...and turn this movie on. Needless to say I didn't want to go to sleep after watching this movie because I didn't think I was gonna wake up without those claws jutting out of my stomach.

Made in the era of blood and gore. This movie perfected every little thing the 1980's were all about. I was afraid for 2 weeks after watching this movie. I had to watch it again just to try to convince myself it could never happened. It didn't work but eventually I got it out of my system. One thing I didn't like...the ending...because it lead to Freddy's Revenge (sucked)...leading to Dream Warriors (not bad)...leading to Drewam Master (bad)...leading to Dream Child (WORST)...leading to Final Nightmare (at least its over? nope)...leading to New Nightmare (good)...basically any movie with Nacy as the main character and Wes Craven as either Director or Screenplay is decent horror...everything else tries to hard to be comedy...""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" TERRIFYING THRILLER FROM WES CRAVEN! 9/10 P.S.-If you want untraditional Wes Craven, but still a good movie...go see Red-Eye"

","Well if one thing's for sure it's that Mr. Depp has certainly come a long way, not just career-wise but with his acting ability as well. I have the funny feeling that if you told this young man back then that he'd become one of the most sort after people in the moving picture business today that you'd only receive a laugh as a response. This was actually pretty good for a early-80's horror movie. The concept was great since it differed from all the regular slasher flicks and it gave the villain an eccentric personality.<br/><br/>Some CGI could've been used but all in all the cheesy special effects did their job. The look into dreams was interesting as it is a subject that fascinates most people since we still don't know the exact cause of and reason for them. Unfortunately the first installement in horror film sets is usually the best and the series did tend to go downhill after this (although there were a couple others that were decent). The idea gets beat to death though when producers try to milk an idea for all it's worth and all that is left is just a corny by-product. Wes Craven did a fantastic job in this and deserves to be called one of the masters of horror!<br/><br/>Final Dream:<br/><br/>Movies: Not in modern times!<br/><br/>DVD Purchase: Has become expendable.<br/><br/>Rental: A good way to reminisce of old times!"

The sounds and opening title indicate this a lot, and that's fine.

"klheintz","6","1","3","7 November 2016"," Classic Horror that bleeds into the films of today
","A Nightmare on Elm Street is the first movie in a series of films that did become the ""typical horror movie"" but this one doesn't suffer from it. It's got an interesting story, a solid villain, and some awesome scenes of brutality. It has just the right amount of those 3 elements as well.<br/><br/>The acting in the movie is about what you can expect from the 80s, the dialogue is a little cheesy and the line deliver is nothing Oscar-worthy. But that doesn't detract from the film or even feel out of place but what does feel out of place is the music. The music is not good, may have worked back then but it did not age well.<br/><br/>Going back to what I said about the right amount of the three categories I listed: The scenes of gore are really well done. Especially the first death in the film, It's one of the best scenes from a horror movie I've seen. Even the rest of them are well done and are very original.<br/><br/>Overall it's a good classic horror movie with some crazy effects and a creepy villain."
"Rickting","6","1","3","26 November 2014"," A load of preposterous nonsense
","This 80s slasher flick follows a group of teenagers who are, as usual in slasher films, facing a terrifying killer. However, this is no ordinary villain. It's Freddy Krueger, who attacks them in their sleep. And as we all have to sleep sometimes, this is a very frightening idea. Sadly, the actual film fails to do it justice. Hailed as a terrifying horror classic, A Nightmare On Elm Street is anything but. It's not without its highlights. Robert Englund is a treat as Krueger and turns him into one of the more menacing horror movie monsters. The make up artist deserves praise as Kruger's appearance is horrifying and adds to the limited fear of the movie. The acting is good in a horror film for once (Look out for a pre fame Johnny Depp getting gruesomely dispatched in the film's most memorable death scene) and Wes Craven shows there is plenty of reason to call him the master of horror. His direction is overall pretty good and there are 3 genuinely startling moments (The fourth was spoiled by the trailer).<br/><br/>The script is pretty lame and the dialogue is very boring. The dream sequences soon become repetitive and the film doesn't go as far as it could have done. It feels like it doesn't meet it's full potential. It's very irritating and totally ridiculous as the way the protagonist defeats Krueger is pretty lame. As usual, the killer inexplicably reappears and sets up a sequel. The main problem with ANOES is that it's not scary. It has some tense moments but it's not interested in tension or creepiness. What it is interested in is loads of fake blood, undeniably impressive special effects and nightmares. At times it feels like some laughably awful Halloween joke shop advert for fake blood and Halloween masks. It's not scary; it's just showing off how good its gore effects are and this is very off putting. Also, this is nasty, preposterous slasher fare with no real purpose. Cowering in the shadow of Halloween, Psycho, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Scream and even Child's Play, this is definitely not one of the horror genre's finer offerings.<br/><br/>4/10"
"uroshnor54","4","1","3","3 August 2014"," Not Bad but More Sad than Scary
","Other than this I've only seen two other horror movies: Alien and Poltergeist. Alien is a good sci-fi movie but not a good horror movie. I think the writer actually thought that using Freudian imagery would make it scary, which it didn't. I'm not going to think a monster is scary simply because it's head is shaped like a penis and I'm not going to think a spaceship is scary because its entrance is shaped like a vulva. And Poltergeist is not scary either. There are a bunch of weird scenes and a lady who spouts pseudo-philosophical gibberish but nothing that's actually scary.<br/><br/>As a horror movie, A Nightmare on Elm Street was more successful than these two other movies but it's still wasn't very scary. I'm not trying to act tough or impress anyone here and I'll admit I saw this at home on a bright and sunny day a little bit after noon and not in a darkened theater.<br/><br/>The whole idea of people coming out of dreams was too strange. I mean, the Xenomorph is believable because Alien didn't take place in an suburban American town in the 80s. And the ghosts in Poltergeist were alright because, well, ghosts have been a part of the horror genre for a very long time. I don't believe in ghosts, though I'll admit it's fun to speculate about them and other supernatural entities, but if a writer says that ghosts exist within the universe of his/her story, I can suspend my disbelief. But I can't be scared by something that's so far- fetched as people being attacked by people in dreams, even if the attacker has finger knives. <br/><br/>But I must say I was impressed by Wes Craven for creating some ambiguity in the dream sequences regarding whether they were real or not. I honestly thought ANoES was more confusing than Inception (which is not actually a very confusing movie) and I didn't really understand it until I went through a thread on the IMDb message boards.<br/><br/>I thought A Nightmare on Elm Street was more sad than it was scary. The ending made me tear up a little, since it's only a dream and Nancy's mother and friends are dead. <br/><br/>I did think the actors did well, especially Heather Langenkamp. I'm guessing the special effects were good for their time and I thought they still held up well in 2014. As a movie, it was okay. But as a horror movie, I didn't think it was scary enough."
"RJBurke1942","5","1","3","8 August 2008"," Where Craven images succeed excessively
","This review leads to my interpretation of the whole story. Some major plot points are detailed. However, if you know little or nothing of the film, then read no further because this review may spoil the ending, such as it is, for you. See the film, then come back another time, perhaps?<br/><br/>But first: I think we all know what is meant by the term 'chop-socky', a term that references physics-defying martial arts films from Hong Kong.<br/><br/>Nightmare is a film that I put under the heading of 'chop-sicky' and a film that I deliberately avoided when first released, simply because I wasn't too interested in another specimen of what many call a horror movie, but which is in fact a terror-fantasy or a fantasy-terror, if you like. Chop-sicky just seems more appropriate to me...<br/><br/>{For real horror, however, start with House of Wax (1953), then on to Psycho (1960) of course, then Peeping Tom (1960), perhaps The Shining (1980), Blue Velvet (1986), definitely Cronenberg's Dead Ringers (1988), don't miss Lost Highway (1997) and  if you can stomach it  Audition (1999), my own choice as the piece-de-resistance of horror movies. There're many others of course.} <br/><br/>There are already some excellent retellings of the Nightmare story here. So, I'll mention it only briefly: Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) was a serial child killer who was murdered by angry parents years prior. Now, he resurrects in the dreams of some of the children of those murderous parents because Freddy now seeks revenge by killing their children. Hence, the plot traces how Freddy serially eliminates Tina (Amanda Wyss), Rod (Nick Corri), and Glen (Johnny Depp), the first and the last in particularly over-the-top (pun intended) gory scenes. The plot continues with Nancy (Heather Langenkamp) setting out to confront and defeat Freddy, while her father, Lt. Thompson (John Saxon) and her mother, Marge (Ronee Blakely) try to keep her from any harm.<br/><br/>Now, if you buy that as a viable story, then you've bought into a fantasy where anything goes. Which is precisely what director Wes Craven wants when he has Tina torn to shreds on the ceiling by Freddy's unseen hands; when he has Freddy's knife-encrusted hand appear between Nancy's legs while she's in the bath; when a hole opens up under Glen in bed, and he's sucked down, minced up and then squirted back in a fountain of blood; when Nancy runs through the dark streets pursued by Freddy, but she eludes him, but only just; when Nancy, in class at school, appears to hallucinate about Freddy; when Nancy is trapped inside her home with Freddy and nobody outside, particularly her dad and the cops across the road, will respond to her frantic cries and gesticulations for help; and when Nancy descends down to the basement (oh, my, all alone again) to then wander through a labyrinth to finally defeat the nightmare of Freddy Krueger...<br/><br/>All pure fantasy, of course. But, all dreams are fantasies, of one kind or another, with nightmares the worst kind. And this one is heavy with sexual symbolism, but not so far from some of the nightmares that some people have in real life, perhaps. So, does Nancy really defeat her nightmare? In this movie, she doesn't because, the story  the whole caboodle, from opening to closing scene - is revealed as Nancy's own nightmare that is still in progress  thus easily allowing the continuation of Freddy's rampaging in the sequel. In short, we're inside Nancy's head from the get-go. So, good night and good luck, Nancy, continue with your nightmare... and so also you, dear viewer, says Craven.<br/><br/>Now, whether the resolution of this nightmare (with all the subsequent Freddy Krueger films) ultimately turns on fantasy or reality, I don't know. Frankly, I don't care because having finally seen this one, I'm quite sure that all the sequels are worse. With few exceptions, sequels do tend to go that way, don't they?<br/><br/>Having said that, there's no doubt that Wes Craven (with a less than stellar cast) did a great job with the visuals, the special effects, makeup and editing. Sure, typical slasher stuff, but still technically very good and with great shock effect for the unwary. John Saxon plodded, competently, through the story as he does, usually; Heather Langenkamp overacted and was just too shrill, in my opinion; Johnny Depp was a welcome addition in this, his first movie (and the real reason I finally decided to see this film); and Robert Englund has, arguably, become a legend, but for all the wrong reasons, I think. The stand-out act, however, must go to Amanda Wyss (Tina) with the death sequence on the ceiling {over the top  get it?  and yes, a direct steal from Friedkin's The Exorcist (1973) when the devil raises Regan (Linda Blair) up to the ceiling} that is graphically and bloodily shocking, while also technically quite fascinating.<br/><br/>What's that old saying? Yeah - the greatest flattery is copying! Craven, here with buckets of blood, obviously had barrels of laughs making this movie.<br/><br/>To sum up, I guess I'd say that, as the first of the series, Nightmare is worth seeing  just so that you can say that you've seen it.<br/><br/>Not recommended for kids twelve or less."

Maybe it was groundbreaking for its time, but for today's standards, we can see every jump scare that is coming from a mile away, every shocking moment, it never genuinely thrilled me. <br/><br/>The dialogue in the film is also very poor. It is all very typical and delivered by its performers in a very fake, unbelievable manner. Even actors who would go on to show off their talent as a performer, such as Johnny Depp, failed to do anything effective with this horrendous dialogue. <br/><br/>While it may be a classic for some, it never did anything mind blowing for me.

However, the film is plagued by terrible dialogue, and Oscar-nominee Blakley's delivery is horrendous. Depp is surprisingly forgetful in his debut. Despite its overwhelming flaws, it's still worth a replay every five or so years.

His blade-fingers are like a character in and of themselves. This is one movie that no horror-fetishist can afford to miss.

","A good, simple question to ask about a movie that now has a kind of hollowed, pop-culture (not simply cult, like full-blown, mainstream) status in the industry - the kind of flick that's crossed over to the point where Kruger, via the sequels, is like the horror movie Mickey Mouse, a verifiable commodity as much as a scary boogeyman - does it hold up? For the most part, absolutely. Wes Craven knew how to make a helluva concept; indeed, that's in large part his legacy (look at the premises for Scream, Hills Have Eyes, People Under the Stairs, they're fantastic 'log-lines' in industry parlance). How he develops them, by himself as a writer or with another scripter, is the key thing.<br/><br/>The great thing about Nightmare on Elm Street is that when it intends to be a horror movie with its sequences set in dreams - a good 20/25 minutes of this film are the nightmares, if not more - it's scary. Or it sure does try its damndest for 1984. And as a younger person, this first one was a legitmiately good time in the dark or with friends. It would come later for flicks like 4-5-6 (especially 6, good god) for the laughs, and those are enjoyable on their own. But this original, and to an extent 3 and 7, are meant to get under your skin. And for the budget they had, they do a lot with it.<br/><br/>The blood supply certainly helps, but also the stunt-work and the effects are incredible; the shot of Kruger poking through the wall to look over his main target, nancy, is massively impressive, and it hasn't dated. Certainly as well the other main set pieces like the body in the hallway at the school being dragged by seemingly no one (that was the image that stuck with me seeing it at a too-young age) and the attacks on the other teens. But what's really crucial is atmosphere is built, piece by piece.<br/><br/>This isn't a guy in the woods with a sack or hockey mask, nor is it some creep over a telephone (not that Freddy won't use a phone - he does, and it's the only goofy moment in the movie with him). These are dark, boiling furnace rooms and cellars, creepy alleys where Freddy can stretch his arms wide so that his finger-knives can get you quicker. The camera and editing in these scenes, like the opening and other parts - Nancy does, indeed, go down to the cellar, making this quintessential horror in that sense - is taut but it takes its time. There are a few jump scares, but they feel earned in a way; leave it to the dream aspect to make them acceptable.<br/><br/>The acting is good too, especially from Langenkamp, who sells this teenager who is half sure she's in control and half nuts that she might be losing her mind, and Depp in his debut is solid. I think the only issues seeing it today come in a few story choices that don't totally make sense. It might not be distracting if the rest of the movie were lessor, but because so much of this is potent and effective (even the knives coming out of the bathtub, in-between the legs, is an obvious but awesome image), when it falters it shows. How Nancy is able to put together so many traps in her house, for example, is something that seems implausible, even in the scope of a ""slasher"", and I'm surprised just how blase the parents are. Maybe Nancy's mother's reaction has some point to it, and she may have a little more depth than the other adults, certainly more than straight-arrow cop John Saxon - but just when she gets interesting she drinks herself into a stupor and (very, very quickly, like as soon as Nancy leaves the house for what seems like a couple of hours) all the windows have bars over them. For... what reason? Foreshadowing? <br/><br/>But in the grand scheme of what Craven is trying to do, these flaws are excusable. This is still an awesome effort in the ways that count; setting up a real, original threat that is like taking a Luis Bunuel premise and setting it in a demented-haunted house; the characters are not all completely worthless (even the idiot-jockish guy is more like Bobby in Twin Peaks than the jerks in Friday the 13th flicks); and I like how the concept of fear being the driving force behind Freddy's power as the conduit, something that would get more developed in part 3. It may not be my favorite slasher, but it's up there, and is certainly Craven's legacy. 8.5/10"
"ashturner-79373","6","1","5","9 March 2019"," A menagerie of creative kills and set-pieces, but not a classic.
","In typical horror movie fashion, the characters in this film are boooring. Heather Langenkamp does a good job developing Nancy as she goes through the grief and distress of the film, but the other performances are just fine, nothing more. Even Robert Englund's iconic Fred Krueger is just a hammy villain with goofy dialogue.<br/><br/>Fred's backstory is more interesting than Fred himself, and Marge's involvement with Fred's death is a nice reveal. Generally, the plot unfolds at a good pace and doesn't really slog at any point - the film opens with a nightmare, and soon after we see the first murder. The murders after that cross over with Nancy herself being haunted by Fred in some pretty creative (and visually compelling) nightmare sequences. I admire the way the film seamlessly and unpredictably blurs the line between dreams and reality, although the dream-within-a-dream ending stretches things and becomes incoherent.<br/><br/>While I don't like the silly nursery rhyme (in fact, horror movies making children's things creepy in general is just lazy), the film has a neat synth score. I wasn't blown away by the cinematography outside of specific set-piece moments (Fred looming over Nancy in bed, Tina appearing to Nancy in a bloodied body bag, the whole bathtub scene), and some of the special effects were lame but admittedly charming (mannequin Marge being dragged through the window, Fred's super-long arms). The revolving room effects sequences are deservedly iconic though.<br/><br/>There are some religious and sexual undertones to be found, but they're too vague and don't amount to much. The least a slasher movie can do though, no matter how boring the characters, is at least have fun and creative kills, and that's something this film has in spades.<br/><br/>6/10."

","I'm not a big fan of slashers; they tend to be a bit dull and samey, but every now and then an intriguing and interesting one comes out, and A Nightmare on Elm Street is most definitely an intriguing and interesting one. The film revolves around Nancy, a young girl that dreams of a badly scarred madman with knives for fingers and a serious grudge against the children of Elm Street. However, Nancy is not the only one having nightmares and the fun really starts when her friends start turning up dead.<br/><br/>Freddy Krueger, the badly scarred madman of the piece would go on to become one of cinema's greatest icons. I even dare say he's up there with the likes of King Kong and The Terminator. In the inferior sequels to this movie, Freddy would go on to become something of a comedian; but here he's every bit the insane madman that slashers would go on to become known for producing. Freddy is brought to the screen by Robert Englund. Robert Englund has managed to get himself something of a cult following for his work on all eight of the Nightmare films, but unfortunately, Freddy is the only 'big' role in his career. The rest of the cast is made up by John Saxon, who also starred in one of the slasher genre's trend setters; Black Christmas, among other films; also appearing is Heather Langenkamp, who would return to the series for part three, and she played herself in the tongue in cheek spin off; New Nightmare, and of course the movie features the introduction of a man that is close to becoming a film legend; Johnny Depp.<br/><br/>A Nightmare on Elm Street is directed by Wes Craven; a man that has almost his entire filmography in the horror genre, and has created a number of the genre's milestones along the way; films such as The Hills Have Eyes, his debut The Last House on the Left and the film that brought slashers back; Scream are among his best works, but A Nightmare on Elm Street is the film he will always be remembered most for by the majority of horror fanatics.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the Nightmare franchise isn't as respected now as it could have been, due mostly to the amount of lacklustre sequels it spawned. However, don't let those sequels fool you; the first film is original, inventive, suspenseful and atmospheric, and is without a doubt a classic of the horror genre."

","I thought the premise of this story was an interesting and creative one: a serial killer who now stalks and kills his victims in their dreams. It turned out to be a flop in my opinion. I thought the effects were quite good for something from the mid 80's and hadn't really seemed to age. Some of the writing was poorly done especially that Kruger back story: ""Don't worry honey, Mommy killed him."" Talk about cheesy and stupid. The biggest beef I had with it was their choice for a main actress. She was horrible and had about zero talent. It is ironic that they gave Johnny Depp (a complete unknown) his debut in Hollywood in this film yet couldn't find a better girl for their main role. I wasn't a huge fan of that ambiguous ending either, it just seemed like a setup for a crappy money making franchise."

I would not have minded so much if the evil one in the film met with a gruesome end (I think the killers in these films should die the worst)but in this film evil does not die and it really is an evil experience to watch this film.I know that its a horror movie, but I think thats why it should be judged more harshly.

","It's fame and popularity managed to spawn an entire franchise, ludicrous amounts of pop culture references and I'm sure a massive sale in gloves with knives as finger tips. This is a story of a group of teenagers who, when they dream, have nightmares of a killer named Freddy Krueger. So what's the main lesson here? Don't sleep if you live on Elm Street...just don't. Krueger is then able to kill these teenagers in reality as well...or so we think. Its surrealism and reality bending story means nothing is certain. The whole damn film could've been a dream...so let's take the whole plot with a pinch of sweet sweet sugar and just enjoy what's on show. What we have is a pretty intense horror that, due to the realm of dreams, is able to be creative and innovative with its scares. Yes, watching this now for the first time is slightly tame, but there are moments of tension particularly as these teenagers try to not fall asleep. Some of the deaths are incredibly iconic, especially a young Johnny Depp (wait...let's take a moment to admire how fluffy his hair looked!) who is sucked into his own bed and sprayed back out in litres of blood. That's sure to be one of the best deaths is cinematic history. Wes Craven created one of the most iconic horror characters ever: Freddy Krueger. Burnt face, knife glove of doom, striped shirt of terror, crooked hat of dread...he is what haunts people at night. The horror imagery that Craven conjures up is rather visceral, so whilst the film lacks in jump scares it makes up for in creepy atmospheric tension. This imagery and gore is what makes it the horror film that is today. Acting is your standard 80's teen flick. The repetitive musical score was slightly infuriating by the end of the film, although that theme tune is embedded into my mind forever. As a first-time watch in 2017, it's tame...but back in 1984 I'm sure it was a genuinely terrifying experience. Creatively scary is how I would describe this."

"MaximumMadness","9","0","1","29 October 2016"," ""A Nightmare on Elm Street""- While not quite as flawless as you might remember, it's still a wonderful and creative take on the slasher-film genre.
","The world lost one of the great forces in filmmaking with the tragic death of Wes Craven in 2015. A mastermind of chills and suspense, Craven repeatedly changed the face of horror throughout his decades- long career. Redefining it many times and demonstrating a skill and class that set him apart in a league of his own. The world may very well never again see another with as fine and complex a view as his own and he will be sorely missed by the filmgoing community.<br/><br/>One of his most well-known and widely beloved works is also one of his most innovative. The 1984 supernatural slasher-flick ""A Nightmare on Elm Street."" While perhaps best remembered as the film that introduced audiences to the wildly popular cinematic boogeyman Freddy Krueger, the film itself is an accomplished and complex piece of horror storytelling, and it stands tall as a very good and fundamentally solid piece of entertainment. And while it may be a bit shaky around the edges, and does have its share of flaws that some more hardcore fans either cannot or will not admit to seeing, it's still very much well-worth seeking out for fans of spooky stories and quality cinema.<br/><br/>A group of teen-aged friends discover that amongst them, several have been experiencing eerily similar dreams about a man with knives on his fingers and terrible burns covering his face. When one is suddenly killed by a seemingly invisible force in her sleep, the rest are rocked to the core, and decide they must try to figure out just what happened to their friend. Soon enough however, they discover that they're the targets of a deadly, supernatural force that seems to only exist within their dreams- the vengeful spirit of a man known as ""Fred Krueger"", who has the ability to kill them in real life should he capture and dispatch of them in their sleep. And so we follow our lead heroine Nancy (Heather Langenkamp) and the others as they attempt to thwart the dark fate that Krueger has planned for them.<br/><br/>The film's biggest benefit lies in just how creative and innovative its concept is. The idea of a killer that stalks his victims in their dreams promises limitless potential, and it's here that Craven really excels. The film is visually arresting, and has a wicked sense of style and tone. From the dastardly images of Krueger mutilating himself only to instantly heal, to the appearance of things that simply cannot occur in the real world, it helps create a haunting and unique environment of dread, and really builds up the atmosphere and in a wonderful way. In addition to his wonderful direction, Craven's script is very sharp, concise and has a great sense of pacing, so there's never a dull moment and every scene counts towards the overall narrative and the continued development of the characters. Craven really does knock it out of the park here.<br/><br/>Robert Englund tackles the role of Krueger for the first time here, and he's simply a revelation. He is one of the best cinematic bad- guys to emerge from the decade, and seems to relish in being a twisted and devilish freak of the supernatural. It's frankly shocking that the studio-suits behind the scenes even thought for one second they could recast him in follow-ups (which they tried and failed to do), as Englung simply IS Freddy. I also gotta give big points to this film for being one of the earliest to feature future superstar Johnny Depp as Glenn, one of our lead protagonists. He's by far the best of the lead cast members (outside of Englund, of course) and he makes for a really sweet, fun and compelling hero to follow. John Saxon also stands out in a very fun supporting role as the father of Langenkamp's Nancy. He's just gruff-yet-supportive enough as a troubled father that you'll want to root for despite being a bit of a jerk at times.<br/><br/>However, the film does very much have a set of flaws that I believe hold it back from absolute perfection. Flaws that I think many in the horror community commonly ignore or excuse too often. And while they are not a deal-breaker in any sense, I do feel I need to subtract a single point for them. To start, outside of Englund, Depp and Saxon, the rest of the cast is very troubled. Particularly Langenkamp's Nancy. While you do inherently like and root for her as a character, Langenkamp isn't believable in any real sense as a teenager haunted by her circumstances. While she did a decent job in some of her later work (including several other films in the series), I do think she was miscast here. Even for the time, some of the scares were pretty weak as well, which robs a lot of the atmosphere during a few key moments. And there's one particularly troubling sequence in the third act that is so ridiculous, it's almost impossible to take it seriously. (While I won't spoil anything, I will give a subtle hint: There's no way all that happened in only 20 minutes.)<br/><br/>Despite those flaws however, ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is still very much a horror classic that stands the test of time even thirty years later. It's creative concept still chills to the bone. It's lead villain is still an icon of horror that is feared by audiences even to this day. And it's still a great bit of eerie fun to behold. Despite hit-and-miss follow-ups and spin-offs and an atrocious reboot that came out a few years back, Wes Craven's iconic original still holds up.<br/><br/>I give it a near-perfect 9 out of 10."
"ThomasDrufke","8","0","1","9 October 2016"," Don't Fall Asleep
","Not many films really dare and try to encapsulate the mysterious relationship between the dream world and reality, but A Nightmare on Elm Street is one of the few films to tackle it, and have a ton of fun in the process.<br/><br/>Directed by the horror legend, Wes Craven, A Nightmare on Elm Street came out right around the peak for the 'Slasher' film. (some even credit it for revitalizing the genre) The popularity for the genre and the film specifically is obviously through the roof. But I was interested to see just how well it holds up 32 years later, especially for a casual horror fan like me. But it surprisingly fared well for my tastes. Certain aspects, such as the vintage 80's soundtrack/score are a bit dated, but the ideas and themes can live on for multiple generations.<br/><br/>The premise of having a serial killer haunt and murder people in their dreams is a fascinating idea, and one that plays extremely well in a horror flick. Not being able to sleep with the lights off is one thing, but not being able to sleep at all is another thing entirely. It's a villain you can't run away from or kill the way you can kill a normal person, which definitely adds to the mystique and wonder to the great Freddy Krueger. At first, you question what the real stakes are for a villain who is essentially a fantasy in a few teen's imagination, but Krueger certainly puts an end to that question rather quickly.<br/><br/>Craven brings plenty of nuance and uniqueness to the story, but I do think the dialogue and acting could have been a little bit better. The cast isn't full of Oscar winners or anything, but I wish I would have been more attached to the characters so that when Freddy strikes, it's a meaningful death. However, I give Craven credit for pulling a bit of a bait and switch in terms of main characters and obviously finding the talent of Johnny Depp.<br/><br/>A few logic issues and character tropes don't prevent this from being one of the horror classic of the 20th century. Simply Craven's imagination is enough to give this film more than one look. A Nightmare on Elm Street is a treat even the most hesitant horror fans.<br/><br/>+Craven's neat direction<br/><br/>+What an ending<br/><br/>+Dream/reality ideas<br/><br/>-Dialogue/acting could be improved<br/><br/>8.1/10"

"CinemaClown","Null","0","1","6 September 2016"," Wes Craven's 'A Nightmare On Elm Street' Lives Up To Its Legacy
","A cleverly envisioned, multi-layered & stylishly violent slasher that keeps its viewers guessing by blurring the lines between dream & reality, A Nightmare on Elm Street is one of the most popular works of 1980s horror that spawned a franchise of its own, and is also notable for bringing one of the most iconic villains in cinema history into existence.<br/><br/>The story of A Nightmare on Elm Street revolves around a group of teenagers who are tormented by a clawed killer who stalks & kills his victims in their dreams. The plot follows a young girl who finds herself to be the chosen one after she begins having nightmares of being pursued by the same killer and must soon find a way out before it's too late.<br/><br/>Written & directed by Wes Craven, the story features an interesting concept and Craven brings it to life with finesse by continuously challenging its audience throughout its runtime. The execution works for the most part, a foreboding sense of terror is skilfully maintained, and even though the human characters aren't that compelling, their peril & confusion is still relatable.<br/><br/>The technical aspects are finely executed. The small-town setting fits its narrative, camera-work is controlled and firmly elevates the suspense when required, Editing paces the story amazingly well, and music only enhances the overall experience. However, the most impressive thing about A Nightmare on Elm Street is the input by its special effects crew & make-up department.<br/><br/>The practical effects may have dated today and bits n pieces of it even looks cartoonish but there is still much to admire about it, for some scenes are filmed in a truly inventive manner. Its make-up team also deserves a mention, for they played a vital role in realising the physical attributes of the villain on the film canvas and their painstaking effort does stand out in the final print.<br/><br/>The cast comprises of Heather Langencamp, Robert Englund, John Saxon, Ronee Blakley & Johnny Depp in his debut role. Langencamo is hyper at times but for the most part, she does well. Saxon & Blakley just tag along, for their characters are mere caricatures. Depp sleeps his way through most of the story but signs off in spectacular style. Englund chips in with an over-the-top performance but it works in favour of the movie.<br/><br/>There is a level of uniqueness to every single characteristic of the antagonist, and Craven smartly uses all of it to amplify the tension & creepiness. Be it the burnt face or metal-clawed glove or red- n-green striped sweater or even the fedora hat, the smallest of these features contribute to shape a nightmarish figure on the silver screen while Englund takes him up by a further few notches and wholly embraces the nightmare-demon.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, A Nightmare on Elm Street is an excellent blend of imagination, creativity & old-school suspense that has etched itself into the annals of horror cinema over the years and remains a staple of pop-culture after all this time. Its dated effects & exaggerated violence may result in a few unintentional laughs but the way few of its scenes are shot nevertheless evoke a deep sense of respect & admiration. In short, Wes Craven's signature film lives up to its legacy."
"Leofwine_draca","8","0","1","5 September 2016"," Minor horror classic with some genuinely scary bits
","Wes Craven's 1980s horror classic delivers a memorable villain in the shape of Freddy Krueger, who's been burnt alive and looks a lot like a half-regenerated Uncle Frank from HELLRAISER, only with less blood. Robert Englund is suitably loathsome as he rips apart his victims with his knifed glove. Heather Langenkamp is a typical scream queen as Nancy Thompson, the girl who watches her friends die at the hand of the dream demon, helpless as her parents (her father, a police lieutenant, is played by John Saxon) refuse to believe her. Johnny Depp has an early role as her boyfriend whose life ends in literally gallons of blood.<br/><br/>Krueger is killing in revenge for his burning by the teenagers' parents. He only appears and kills in dreams, which makes it hard to catch him, as although he is the stuff of dreams, when he kills it happens in real life. There are some suitably scary moments, especially the part where Nancy is beckoned by one of her dead friends in a body bag. Some nice gore adds to the film, one effect where a girl is slashed by invisible knives standing out. The film has some violent, frightening moments and the use of the ""is this happening or isn't it?"" is put to good effect. An effective film by Wes Craven, although I fail to see why it spawned numerous sequels as the formula is quite restrictive (although the same can be said for HALLOWEEN and Friday the 13th). However, it does deserve status as a minor classic, as it summons up a few genuinely scary moments which terrified me as a child."

It was chilling, scary and a darkness that has never been topped by another horror film.<br/><br/>Heather did a fine job in his first role, outshining the entire caste, except for Robert Englund of course.<br/><br/>In fact she was sick and had a sprained ankle because of the staircase scene yet pulled out a brilliant performance. <br/><br/>The make up looks spectacular for low budget. It actually made Wes Craven work harder to figure out ways to make scenes work like Fred's arms stretch out in the ally way was made by using fishing line and Tina being shredded on the roof with a rotating panel.<br/><br/>The studio wanted Wes to end it on a happy more so as not to scare the audience. He refused and re-shot your endings leaving is ambiguous on the characters fates. This was the best choice since it meant Fred was freed to haunt your dreams next.<br/><br/>I never saw anything like it. It kept me up for weeks thinking of that butt face and razor sharp claws.<br/><br/>The lullaby by the jump rope girls still send shivers down my spine.

","I might be a little subjective with this movie because it is because of Freddy that I fell in love with horror movies and with cinema in general. But the more movies I watch the more I appreciate this one.<br/><br/>Wes Craven took the elements from an already existent genre and rose them to a new level. With a little inspiration from real events and lots of imagination Wes and his team managed to create one of the more horrifying horror movies of the 80s and of cinema in general. Horror movies are not just about jump-scares or how you feel while watching them. True horror is about what is left with you after you watch them. Maybe we can argue that A nightmare on Elm St. looks dated, but still the final result is modern enough to be watched nowadays without that unintentional comical effect that movies like Friday the 13th have.<br/><br/>With several memorable scenes like the first one, the bath scene or Glen's death, the movie makes us fear daily objects or activities such as beds or taking showers. But it is Nacy's death the one that made everyone cringe and that passed to the history of cinema. Wes Craven knew how to create an intense atmosphere since the beginning of the movie and, more important, he knew how to keep it during the rest of the movie, keeping us in constant tension until the ending credits.<br/><br/>But the most important thing about this movie and, above all, Freddy, is that it will accompany you for your whole life in those moments before you fall asleep and will make you wonder if what you saw was just a movie."
"Wuchakk","7","0","1","15 June 2016"," Innovative teen slasher featuring Johnny Depp's debut
","Released in 1984, Wes Craven's ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is about a psycho specter (Robert Englund) who haunts the dreams of four teens on Elm Street in Springwood, USA, with intent to kill. The four teens are played by Heather Langenkamp, Johnny Depp, Amanda Wyss and Jsu Garcia. John Saxon and Ronee Blakley play the parents of the heroine.<br/><br/>I like the way ""Nightmare"" takes the slasher genre and adds a new dimension—a ghostly killer who slays people in their dreams. I also appreciate how the story builds as it progresses; things aren't as simple as they seem in the first act. Speaking of which, the first act features an innovative murder sequence that takes place as a teen couple is locked in a bedroom. The horrific way a girl is shown ""climbing the walls"" (or however you want to put it) didn't come into vogue until over a decade later with those Japanese ghost flicks. I also like how the hoodlum teen (Garcia) APPEARS to be the culprit when the viewer knows this isn't true.<br/><br/>In addition, Heather is a quality protagonist and its interesting seeing Depp in his very first movie. It goes without saying that Freddy Krueger became a horror icon and deservedly so. Lastly, the ambiance of the movie is decidedly early-to-mid 80s, like the soundtrack and the (lame) electronic drums, but how can you hold that against the film? It's part of its charm. Nevertheless, I prefer the Friday the 13th flicks due to the camping-out locale and superior women.<br/><br/>The movie runs 91 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles & Venice, CA.<br/><br/>GRADE: B+"

","Horror movies aim often aim to keep their frightened audience up at night, and no film has made this their aim more that the Nightmare on Elm Street series. This classic horror film is very much of its time but its rather original concept will leave you paranoid once the lights go out for bed.<br/><br/>The acting of this film is as expected from an 80's teen slasher movie. Heather Langenkamp makes a decent scream queen but overall its not great, but it did introduce the world to Johnny Depp who plays the incompetent boyfriend who just can't stay awake to save his life (literally). Robert Englund doesn't have much to do in this film at all, hiding in the shadows for the majority of the films run time, but there are many sequels to which he features more heavily.<br/><br/>The film is interestingly both generic and original. The idea of a man killing people in their dreams is a really unique concept that is one of the reasons the film has become infamous, but the film also follows many teen slasher movie genre conventions. The parents are useless, the teens are dumb and there is also a scene where a teenage girl investigate strange sounds in the dark while wearing nothing but a mans shirt. The film has this interesting concept with creative kills but at the same time divulges into another generic slasher film.<br/><br/>One thing I came to notice about watching this film in 2016 was how of-its-time this film is. I slept like a rock after watching the film, it did not scare me. But I realise that if I was watching this film in 1984 then it would most likely be the complete opposite, but then again i'll never know.<br/><br/>Overall A Nightmare on Elm Street is a generic teen slasher film with a creative concept that appears rather dated today. I have no idea what happened at the end of the film other than it was still a dream but maybe there are Easter eggs hidden throughout the rest of the series to explain that. P.S. I swear the street name is never addressed at all in this film."

","What is there to really say about this film that hasn't been echoed in thousands of glowing reviews around the world for the last 32 years? The original film in a shaky franchise took an amazing idea for a story and was worked on by a cast and crew with a clear passion and love for what they were doing. Atmosphere, terror, backstory, great special effects for the time, interesting kills in a genre where the original ideas for them was starting to run dry by 1984.<br/><br/>Wes Craven's direction and writing have almost always been on top of the horror genre. Every actor in this film gave it their absolute best that even when it's not exactly ""great"" acting, you can tell they've developed their characters so well that it's believable. And Robert Englund managed to evoke an iconic character who will be remembered by fans for years to come.<br/><br/>The only thing that keeps this film from being stellar perfection is some VERY small pacing issues throughout the film. It adds a much needed depth and story compared to every other slasher films lack of character development and story. It could've benefited from an additional character or two, a couple more creative kill sequences, but that's just me being nit-picky on the tiniest things. This is a masterpiece and what Craven would've mainly been known for had Scream not come along."
"The-Social-Introvert","7","0","1","18 April 2016"," Quickie Review: A Nightmare on Elm Street
","Like all classic movies that spawned countless interchangeable sequels, what can be said about A Nightmare on Elm Street that hasn't been said already? The concept alone is mesmerizing – a man haunts the dreams of children, and as their fear and awareness of him grows so does his power. Any pain that is inflicted on them in their dreams also affects them in real life, and if they die in their dreams yup you guessed it, they die in real life. Not only is it a unique idea but a clever one – try not to think about Kruger's iconic pizza face, jumper and clawed glove before you go to sleep and chances are you'll end up dreaming about it anyway. I know I did on many occasions. And how do you avoid sleep, to stop him from coming? That's the challenge our protagonists face in A Nightmare on Elm Street.<br/><br/>Freddy Kruger's own story, in which he, being a child murderer, was burned alive by the parents of Elm Street after the Law failed to put him being bars, makes for some ponderous thinking about vigilante justice vs official regulation. Either way, the teenage children are now paying for their parents' sin. <br/><br/>Nightmare has an unrelenting raw energy that was missing from Craven's later films, like Scream. It feels angry, feels vicious, like it wants to punish you as well as entertain you. Kruger is in complete control during the dream sequences – every time a character's eyelids close we are in his terrifying world, in which anything can happen. In fact, a lot of the film's tension stems from not even knowing whether a character is currently dreaming or not. A lot of the nightmare scenes play out just like a regular nightmare would. That, and the fact that the film's protagonist are normal teenagers (frustrated that no one will believe their wild tales), adds to the immersion. <br/><br/>Even today the movie stands up pretty well (as long as you can stand an 80's disco track accompanying your chase scenes). The only part I remember not liking was the weird ending, which cheapens the film slightly. <br/><br/>Best Scene: There are a number of stand outs but my top pick goes to the insane death scene where Tina is dragged up to the ceiling and mercilessly butchered, right in front of her boyfriend (who ends up getting the blame, too)."

","I can honestly say that this is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. The opening Scene of ""Nightmare On Elm Street"" is a very intriguing one, one of the better opening shots I have seen in the horror movie. After watching these opening shots, you know this is not a normal slasher flick.<br/><br/>The story of ""Nightmare"" concerns a group of friends who all slowly come to the realization that they are all being stalked by the same character in their dreams. Their nightmares become fatal, for as soon as they fall asleep, the killer will come into their dreams and butcher them. Give or take a few minor plot details, but that's about it.<br/><br/>The movie is not a classic, but it is so well crafted I always felt threatened whenever the characters grew tired and nodded off. You've got to love the heroine, Nancy, who carries the film and learns quickly. Although, in this movie, the first installment of the series, Freddy Krueger is much more hidden and darker, and ultimately scarier. He truly enjoys scaring these kids to death and then brutally killing them. Yet, despite all this, he's almost a heroic figure and definitely larger than life.<br/><br/>If you're going to watch an 80's slasher film, be sure to watch one with style! Overall rating: 7 out of 10."

","A Nightmare On Elm Street (1984): Dir: Wes Craven / Cast: Heather Langenkamp, Johnny Depp, John Saxon, Ronee Blakley, Amanda Wyss: An original horror film idea that regards facing one's fears. Freddy Krueger is introduced as the child killer burned alive by protesting parents and whose hellish burned image haunts the dreams the their children to the point of death via his razor blade glove. Director Wes Craven achieved success in the genre with Last House On the Left and The Hills Have Eyes but this is his masterwork giving us a visually scary nightmare of effects. Heather Langenkamp plays Nancy who not only must cope with the death of her friends, but also fend off and outsmart Krueger. Johnny Depp plays her ill fated boyfriend who attempts to help her but fails to heed the warning regarding falling to sleep. They were both present during their friend Tina's shocking murder that had her boyfriend as a wanted suspect. John Saxon plays Nancy's father who is Lieutenant of police, and Ronee Blakley plays her alcoholic mother who tries to get her daughter help before revealing the true nature of Krueger's past. Amanda Wyss plays the original victim whose famous murder has her spiraling aimlessly about her room. Craven's film examines the nature of dreams and nightmares while delivering groundbreaking special effects and a villain whose very name is the stuff of bad dreams. Score: 8 / 10"

","In all Horror films the killer immediately seems to be a blood-thirsty, grotesque, un- relatable monster that preys on the weaknesses and fears of the characters. Horror is defined as ""an overwhelming and painful feeling caused by something frightfully shocking, terrifying, or revolting; a shuddering fear."" As the bounty of Horror movies grow, we see clichés, and poorly casted films that we could produce better ourselves. Looking deeper we find movies that are cinematic successes; movies estimated to be a ""blip on the radar"" and end up being Historic.<br/><br/>Similar to ""Psycho"" the killer causes extreme confusion at at the start of the movie slaughtering the main character. Unable to predict what will happen next you are pulled into the obis. What stands out about this movie is the difficulty to tell the difference from the dream world and reality. The main character seems to change, after Tina's untimely death her friend Nancy takes the position as main character. We experience the realistic dream world during school with no way of knowing if Nancy has fallen asleep or not. When Nancy takes a bath her mother reminds her not to fall asleep, scoffing flippantly she minds her own business nodding off a few minutes later. Freddy's glove of knives slowly emerges from the water, a creative closeness to the shower scene in Psycho. <br/><br/>Not only does this movie define the horror genre with its frightfully shocking scenes, we find A Nightmare on Elm Street to be a movie that is suspenseful and pulls your fears to the exterior. The suspenseful music sets every scene with a dark, sinister mood; anticipating Freddy's appearance. Wes Craven added countless astonishing surprises, as the viewers experience the unforeseen actions of Freddy. We become attached to the characters, reminiscing on the reoccurring nightmare we all have; fearing the unforeseeable outcome. We are given information on Freddy close to the end of the movie, as Nancy's mother Marge explains to her that Freddy was a ""filthy child murderer"" caught but set free. Marge with intention to ease Nancy's mind shares with her that a group of people including her found Freddy's hideout in an abandoned boiler room. Setting it on fire riding Freddy of ever murdering again, Nancy racks her brain of how Freddy is able to haunt her if he is ""dead"".<br/><br/>The horror genre persuades its audience to resurface their deepest fear and relate it to the movie. A Nightmare on Elm Street is recognizably a top movie in the genre of Horror, Freddy becoming one of the greatest villains in cinema history. As the ending locks in the inability to define the dream world from reality you are left wanting more understanding. A movie that could never be forgotten, and will be a Horror classic for generations to come."

","A group of teenagers are experiencing strange dreams whereby a mysterious person is trying to kill them while they sleep. At first it seems that this is just happening to one member of the group called Nancy (Heather Langenkamp), but when Nancy starts discussing these strange dreams with her friends it appears that a couple of them have experienced similar nightmares. However, Nancy soon learns that the dreams her and her friends have been having about an insane killer are more real and frightening than they initially realised.<br/><br/>Nearly everyone knows one of the most iconic quotes for this film is ""Whatever you do, don't fall asleep"". Whilst you may have trouble sleeping after watching this film there is no way on this earth that you will fall asleep during its 90 minute or so running time because whilst Nightmare on Elm Street may be a lot of things one thing it certainly isn't is boring.<br/><br/>I watched A Nightmare On Elm Street about 15-20 years ago and I was worried that it wouldn't seem as good after all these years and I was actually surprised that I thought that it was every bit as brilliant as I remembered it to be. The thing that struck me about this film all those years ago (and again today) is how imaginative it is as a concept. Wes Craven has created a film that shows a killer going round picking off victims one by one (giving it its slasher element), but he gives this film an extra layer in that the killer only kills you when you're asleep. Whilst the slasher element makes it exciting and undoubtedly will be enough to satisfy the masses I actually think that the idea of Freddie Kruger killing people in their sleep is the most terrifying aspect about this film. With other slasher films there's always a sense of hope that a victim can escape from their killer or that they can outwit their killer and get the better of them, but how do you do that when someone tries to kill you while you're asleep?. Looking at the bigger picture it's also impossible to survive without sleep so effectively there is no apparent solution to the problem. It's this aspect that makes A Nightmare On Elm Street so terrifying and is what makes it rise head and shoulders above a lot of other horror films. Craven even manages to expand on Kruger's character which again gives it a sense of depth which most horror films seem to ignore.<br/><br/>As well as the imaginative concept, Craven also proves to be just as impressive behind the camera. Some of the horror here is merely suggested and that actually helps to crank up the suspense and keep the film both relatively scary and interesting. It was also nice to see that cheap jump scares were kept to a minimum (which is something many modern horror films seem to depend upon to get scares). Craven also really goes to town to make the flick scary - 2 of the death scenes did shake me up a bit and Craven's imagination and directional flair really showed in these two scenes. The score is also excellent (although I personally thought the slower score was more effective in drawing tension than the faster score, but the latter was still very good).<br/><br/>Finally we come to the performances; every good horror film needs a good killer and Robert Englund's excellent performance as Freddie Kruger has made the character one of the most iconic killers around. Englund makes Kruger sinister, terrifying and creepy and his performance here was sublime. Heather Langenkamp was also excellent as the protagonist Nancy. A Nightmare On Elm Street is notable as being the debut picture of Jonny Depp and all I can say is that his acting has definitely improved over time - this is not one of his better performances, but he was still OK I suppose.<br/><br/>A Nightmare On Elm Street really has it all; imagination, a creepy killer, a terrifying concept, impressive direction and some memorable performances. It is a landmark film and is up there with the likes of The Shining and Psycho as being one of the best films that the genre has to offer."

","When Nancy Thompson's best friend, Tina is brutally murdered by her boyfriend, Rod, she isn't one hundred percent sure that he is the culprit even though all evidence suggests that he is.<br/><br/>The day Tina died, she confessed to Nancy that she'd had a nightmare, so terrifying that it left her fearing for her life. She'd dreamt that she was being chased through a dark boiler room by a horribly burnt man named Freddy, who was trying to kill her with a bladed glove. A typical nightmare, except that Nancy had the exact same dream.<br/><br/>After Rod confesses to Nancy that he, too, dreamt of Freddy and is found hanged after Nancy dreams that Freddy visited him in jail, it confirms her suspicions that he is not the real killer and that something much more sinister is going on.<br/><br/>The nightmares start escalating and she begins to wake up with real injuries on her body after having them inflicted upon her during her dreams, until she is literally forced to stay awake in order to stay alive.<br/><br/>Nancy starts to believe that she is going crazy until her alcoholic mother confesses that Freddy was once a real person; a serial child killer who was burned to death by outraged vigilante parents when Freddy evaded jail due to a technicality.<br/><br/>After she discovers that she is able to pull objects from her dreams into the real world, Nancy sees this as an opportunity to defeat Freddy and take back control of her dreams and her life.<br/><br/>A Nightmare on Elm Street came out at a time when the slasher genre was getting very stale but writer and director Wes Craven managed to put a unique and refreshing spin on it.<br/><br/>In contrast to the fictional movie serial killers that came before him (Leatherface, Michael Myers, Jason) Freddy is neither mute nor robotic. Instead, he is very animated and relishes in verbally taunting his victims before he kills them. <br/><br/>Robert Englund was clearly having the time of his life playing Freddy; so much so that it has become synonymous with him as an actor and it's hard to picture anyone else in the role (sorry Jackie Earl Haley) and he even went on to star in all seven sequels (eight, including Freddy vs. Jason) plus the short lived TV series 'Freddy's Nightmares.'<br/><br/>Heather Langenkamp does a decent job as Nancy, and is everything a horror movie heroine should be; vulnerable but strong.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp provides some delectable eye candy as Nancy's boyfriend in his first movie role. <br/><br/>I have personally never seen Ronee Blakley act in anything else (supposedly she is a credible actress), but I have a hard time deciding if she is just bad in the role of Nancy's mother, or whether it was a conscious acting choice to play her as over dramatic and over the top to make her seem more detached and in denial of the situation."

","""One, two, Freddy's coming for you"", I have to start my review with that eerie rhyme that is heard throughout this movie, it not only strikes fear but also lets us know that Freddy Krueger is near. A Nightmare on Elm Street is a horror movie classic and one that years after it came out is still watched constantly and ranks highly among horror movies out there. What is there not to like about this movie, it's scary, the villain is scarier and the way in which it sets itself up is fascinating from start to finish, basically just don't fall asleep. Wes Craven is the man behind this and what a job he does, he seem to make a teenage slasher movie different from others out there because this is just so damn interesting, you want to learn more about Freddy but also see if there is anyway out of this nightmare.<br/><br/>The plot of course is about Freddy, he jumps between dreams and haunts the people who dream about him, chasing them usually through his own dream boiler room, until he finally kills them as they keep dreaming. The story does play out a little basically but I mean listen this isn't 100% perfection, it is though an excellent piece and one that is very near to being perfect. Nancy Thompson is the girl who everyone thinks it a little crazy, she's been chased by Freddy, she even has evidence with a cut on her arm, but no one believes in her crazy rants. The plot see's teenagers dealing with Freddy and different people keep meeting him throughout, Nancy is in a race against time to save her friends from this maniac with knife fingers.<br/><br/>The movie is not the scariest out there, the jumps do come thick and fast but you won't be hiding your eyes from this one. The real scare factor comes with Freddy himself, it's the way in which he runs and looks at the people in this and that makes him one of the most sinister looking villains ever. Robert Englund does a fine job as Freddy and his movements are insanely good, he reminds me of some kind of weird goblin type thing, the way in which he arcs his back slightly and yet lurches forward, and the hat, the damn hat is for me the scariest thing about him! <br/><br/>As for the rest of the cast Craven picks, we see Nancy played by Heather Langenkamp and she is well in her role, we also see a young Johnny Depp playing her boyfriend Glen and he is similar, he does well. It's hard for any of the cast members to become truly memorable because of Freddy, Robert Englund just creates this character from himself that overshadows anything anyone else does and all throughout you just want to see more of Freddy because he makes this such thrilling fun.<br/><br/>I'll mention Wes Craven again because he wrote this movie too, memorable quotes dotted throughout the entire script and that makes this movie yet again different from some other horrors because it has decent dialogue. Jacques Haitkin's cinematography is wonderful, he and Craven create a sense of fear around every corner and the shots just make you think Freddy can come out of anywhere, some top top stuff. <br/><br/>Overall you can't deny the popularity of this movie, spawning so many sequels as well, it goes to show also that this is still so highly rated decades on. So yes, A Nightmare on Elm Street is a well known example of how to do horror and do it well too, in fact if anyone ever claims that they ""don't like horror movies"", well make them watch this because this is some of the best stuff around."
"NateWatchesCoolMovies","10","0","2","27 October 2015"," A classic that still holds up
","Wes Craven's original masterpiece A Nightmare On Elm Street is the real deal out of the franchise. While some of the further entries are well done (#3 is a standout), this first one gives us Freddy Krueger at his simplest and most menacing, before the sequels saw him calcified into a one liner wise guy. Here he keeps the talking to a minimum, letting his grotesque presence itself, and otherworldy powers do most of he communication. Robert Englund creates a boogeyman that's perhaps the most distinct, specefic of the slasher bunch, as he's not just a silent, formidable masked dude, but an actual character with personality and better, a sense of humour. Freddy, for those who haven't seen this (shame) was a child killer in life, burned alive by the parents of his victims, and haunting the dreams of their children. Heather Langenkamp is striking as Nancy, the resilient one of the group. Amanda Weiss plays her friend Tina, who is not so fortunate and suffers torment at the hands of Freddy in a feverish, impressive early sequence. Johnny Depp in his first ever film role plays Nancy's boyfriend Glen, a shallow goofball as most dudes in 80's horror movies tend to be. Nancy's sheriff father (John Saxon) is skeptical at best, and the kids find themselves alone and at odds with this ticked off, cackling dream demon. It's special effects heavy as well, as Freddy manipulates his world to terrify them and conjure up all kinds of creepy horrors. Langenkamp has an easy likability, fragile yet unflinching, qualities that often are often lacking from horror protagonists, but is nice to see here and makes her relatable. Englund has a ball his first time around as Freddy, and as per usual with the first film of any horror franchise, less is more. He's used minimally at first, mostly as sound before sight, but when they do see him he shakes their nerves up pretty good. A horror classic, and the second corner of the slasher trifecta I mentioned previously."

","The film is more of a clichéd yarn than a story about nightmares. Generally the film is a might-have-been. True, it has its moments, but things are pretty tame. The film unfolds in two halves. There are some nightmarish moments but they are too briefly seen. There are gaping plot holes. Can anyone work out what's going on? What really lets this film down is its weak ending. Surely the script-writers could have come up with a better ending than this. Even all the side characters are brilliantly played. I also find this movie being really creepy sometimes, what is not usual for slasher films. Another high point in the film is the cast."
"TheBlueHairedLawyer","5","0","1","30 August 2014"," Decent but not as wonderful as its reputation
","Freddy was a serial killer targeting younger kids until the parents in town killed him. Now he's haunting teens in town... in their nightmares. He's killing them and it's up to a couple of 'em to stop him beyond the grave, once and for all.<br/><br/>This movie has great but unmemorable soundtrack, decent acting and a creepy plot, making for a good horror film. But it is a little confusing, the teenagers are typical and boring suburbs kids and the film just wasn't as good as its reputation. It is the first film to come to mind for a lot of slasher fans, and for teens often the first horror film they watch in life, so its high rating may be from nostalgia. My favorite movie is the 1981 film My Bloody Valentine, I'll get a lot of people who disagree but I like it more than this movie. NOES just doesn't seem as great as it is believed to be, it isn't bad but isn't amazing, either.<br/><br/>Somehow it ended up with several sequels and a remake, none of which I've bothered to watch. The main reason I watched NOEM is because whenever I say to my friends that I love movies, they always bring up the horror films The Ring (2002), Resident Evil (2002), Friday the 13th (1980) and A Nightmare on Elm Street. I don't know, maybe I missed something? The Freddy character is certainly not scary with his funny and ugly sweater and Edward Scissorhands knives, although his face makeup is excellent. The parents were all overdramatic and strange, as well as totally oblivious to what was going on although they did act suspicious. In My Bloody Valentine the entire film had amazingly dreary scenery from the small Canadian town of Sydney Mines, Nova Scotia. It also had an amazing (sadly unreleased) soundtrack score by Paul Zaza that I'll never forget and great acting from most characters. NOES has very little if no scenery, just boring houses and a boring school, nothing that stands out. The soundtrack is dull and repetitive although good for the first few moments of it. The acting was bad, yes, even from Johnny Depp. Without these elements a movie is pretty pathetic.<br/><br/>Overall it just wasn't the big thrill-ride it's depicted as by reviewers. I'm not saying it was a bad movie, far from it. All I'm saying is that it was pretty average and not very original. Freddy was cool but looked like he was the product of the McDonald's Hamburglar and Edward Scissorhands conceiving a baby together. Like in Stephen King's IT, he provides horrible nightmares and can alter reality with his supernatural powers. I'm not really sure how he's considered a slasher character, yes he kills people, but so do zombies, vampires and werewolves. Slasher movie killers are most often humans, living humans who use weapons rather than sci-fi style powers to do their murders.

","What i love the most about Nightmare on Elm street is the realism that the film pulls off; whether if dreaming or not.

Total contrast compared to the sequels where the dreams become over imaginative and cheesy.<br/><br/>By no means is it scary when watching it today - unless you're below the age of 10 - but from start and finish the whole experience is thrilling. 'Halloween' brought you indefatigable suspense, 'Friday the 13th' gave is a twist and ' Nightmare on Elms' brought us a original and timeless concept.<br/><br/>If you know who Freddy is - like many folks do - but have never watched a film of his, then please cleanse yourself from the sin of eluding the film for so long and watch it."

A truly brilliant creation. This is the REAL Nightmare movie. Forget the sequels. They showed too much of Freddy. Here he is seen as a menacing figure cloaked in shadow.

","""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" was in my opinion a classic original movie and stood alone in its time and genre. Sad to say, the sequels went in and out, with some of them okay in a sense, and others very lacking. All said, none compared to the brilliance of the original. The movie features a teenage girl and a group of friends menaced and stalked by a scarred dream-killer, who wears a dirty green and red sweater and a old rusty hat, with knives intentionally in the replacement of fingernails. He makes his appearance in strange and unexplained ways through his victims dreams of choice. Some are slaughtered, some are spared to linger on his presence. There are people in town who know of the ghosts past and how he perished. But we never quite find that out, which leaves the film hanging by its silk. The setting looks innocent at times, and plays on the audience by usage of eerie music...manifested by the ""DEAD"" children singing their tormenter's warning ""One-two, Freddy's coming for you...three-four, better lock your doors...five-six, grab your crucifix...seven-eight, better stay awake...nine-ten, never sleep again"" A creepy melody that dug under the surface of the viewers, and left an uneasy feeling of clamor. The special effects are mediocre, but the acting fares well for the kind of horror it dispenses. Wes Craven does a fine job with his direction, but could have satisfied us with a more tight ending...it didn't do to much for me. Elm Street does, anyway, top most predictable horror films by a single ""Slash"""

","""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is a fantastic film. Horror movies aren't my thing but I thought this was great. It had my attention the whole way through and there wasn't a second where I was bored. Freddy is a great character and I love the way he is shown in this movie. One thing I didn't like was the scene with his long arms. That just looked stupid. Some of the acting isn't great . Heather Langenkamp was good and fit her role but in a few scenes her acting wasn't great. She got better in Nightmare 3. However the worst performance was Ronee Blakley as Nacy's mother. She was very bad and lacked express. Tina was a horrible character as well. So anyways the film is good, the music is very fitting and creepy and I recommend watching it. Nowadays most people just want 1000 gory bloody deaths in a movie but this movie doesn't need that to be scary. In fact the body count is only 3(or 4?) people. Anyways just watch it."

The actor plays the unforgiving demon, with flying colors. John Saxon is good. Johnny Depp, in his debut performance, is decent. Heather Langenkamp is effective. Ronee Blakley leaves a mark. Amanda Wyss is passable. <br/><br/>On the whole, If you want to get spooked, watch 'A Nightmare on Elm Street'. It's one winner of a motion-picture!"
"farah-1372","Null","0","1","19 July 2011"," The direction is not as superb as ""Halloween
","The sequels became sillier and gorier. Fred's name changed to the less menacing ""Freddy"" (which we all now know him by), he was given more screen time, the makeup on his face was not quite as horrific, he began to crack jokes more often and his voice evolved into a less demonic cackle. In the original ""Nightmare"" it is interesting to note that Freddy is rarely given screen time at all -- we see his infamous hands (wearing gloves with butter knives attached on the fingers to slice his victims), we see his hat, we see his sweater, we see his outline in the darkness of the shadows, but even when we finally see Freddy up-close, Craven manages to keep the camera moving so that we never gain a distinct image of the killer. Now, twenty years later, there's no mystery anymore -- Freddy's face is featured on the front cover for most of the films and his very presence has become the cornerstone of all the movies in the franchise. But in 1984, long before Craven predicted his character would become a huge part of modern pop culture, Freddy was mysterious and not very funny at all.<br/><br/>The acting is one of the film's weaknesses -- Heather Langenkamp is never totally awe-inspiring as Nancy, truth be told (although she does a decent job); Depp -- in his big-screen debut -- shows a sign of talent to come but basically mutters clichéd dialogue most of the time. The co- stars are acceptable at best. However the greatest performance is -- not surprisingly -- by Robert Englund, as Freddy, who is in the film barely at all. Ironically, as mentioned above, this only makes the film succeed at scaring us.<br/><br/>The direction is not as superb as ""Halloween,"" and for that matter either is the film. Over the years, ""Nightmare"" has arguably been given an overrated reputation, although it is inferior to ""Halloween."" However, compared to some of the other so-called ""horror films"" released during the '80s -- including ""Friday the 13th"" and other dumb slasher flicks -- ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" does seem to stand as one of the best horror films of the decade. Despite its flaws it is quite smart with a surprise ""final"" ending and one of cinema's greatest villains lurking at the core"
"MostafaJamal","8","0","1","24 March 2011"," one of my favorite horror movies from 80's
","By 1984, the slasher genre was wearing thin. Halloween bombed out with number 3, and Friday the 13th was falling into the dreadful mix of completely cliché horror. Without A Nightmare on Elm Street, that could have been it for the slasher film. With it, however, the genre was brought off the respirator for another 10 years when Craven did it again with Scream, but I digress. Wes Craven delivers a very original, creative, and well played out horror film that has the perfect level of plot, fright, gore, and imagination. The balance of these elements is key, as it gives you the best of all of them, without becoming too cliché, too bloody, or too silly. The movie keeps you with the characters throughout, who, unlike in the Friday the 13th series, aren't there only to be lined up for slaughter. To top all that off, there's the smart, fear-inspiring bogeyman Freddy Krueger, who is one of the greatest villains in cinema history. The combination of all these factors makes A Nightmare on Elm Street easily recognizable as a landmark in classic horror.<br/><br/>Nancy and Tina are a little upset. They both are having terrifying nightmares of someone they can only describe as a man in a dirty sweater with knives for fingers, and Tina is having some guy issues. In fact, this nightmare shook Tina up so much that she has her friends over to keep her company, and has some great makeup sex with her man, Rod. Well, the man with the dirty sweater visits her subconscious once again, and she is inexplicably dragged to the ceiling and butchered, in an incredibly brutal, horrifying scene. Rod is arrested for the crime, and one by one, this mysterious specter assimilates Nancy and her friend's dreams. She keeps being stalked by this bogeyman, and after several episodes (that nearly puts her in the nuthouse), Nancy learns of a certain child murderer, Fred Krueger, who happened to use a glove with knives to kill the kids, and was also burned to death by the parents of the neighborhood. Now knowing what she's up against, Nancy prepares for battle, but how do you fight your dreams? An interesting approach is taken by Craven to solve that problem, leading to the final show down between the lion and the lamb. The whole ordeal ends with a twist so bizarre that you can't help but love it.<br/><br/>When this movie was made, Halloween had set the stage, and Friday the 13th turned into what is now known as a cliché slasher. Wes Craven picked up on the psychological terror of Halloween, and the gore in Friday the 13th, and made it a psychologically chilling gory movie, while not turning to exploitation just to keep your interest. It stays terrifying by unbelievably violent and scary scenes while not going over-the-top. What makes these scenes effective is not only Craven's imagination, but the movie has a good, fear-inspiring villain. Freddy Krueger is the perfect horror villain because he's so brutal that it's terrifying. He hits home with everyone's idea of the bogeyman, but instead of hiding in your closet (where you can be safe from), he gets you in your dreams. There's virtually no way to stop him. How do you resist sleep? How do you resist dreaming? Of course, the idea is so outrageous that no one believes Nancy, which leaves the audience and the characters frustrated. The problem is, the person with the power is the person whose in control, and that's him. That's what allows Craven to build the tension in the movie. Again, like Carpenter's Halloween, Craven gets you attached to Nancy and her friends, instead of presenting characters in hopes of you being scared when they die, or just to pad the body count (and he still makes it gory without that factor). They're ordinary teenagers that a young audience can relate to, which is the target audience for this film.<br/><br/>If you think about it, the movie is kind of goofy. A clown-like bogeyman who haunts your dreams with various wisecracks. I guess we needed something less cliché. This is one of the most original horror movies I've ever seen, and is one of my favorites. Craven brings the evil, scar faced bogeyman that was considered a flop by Hollywood into one of the scariest, most memorable movie villains of all-time. The acting by relatively new actors is pretty good (holy crap, Johnny Depp's first!), especially for Heather Langenkamp as Nancy and Robert Englund as Freddy. The screenplay is very well written, as the dialog isn't cheesy and it goes with the time period. No event is put in only for exploitation (like random strip poker in Friday the 13th), so the atmosphere stays chilling and doesn't turn stale. Not just a great horror movie, but a great scary movie. A real gem from Wes Craven (who gets to be called the master of horror for this epic) that arguably saved the slasher genre from itself."
"Toronto85","9","0","1","21 March 2011"," A Nightmare on Elm Street
","A Nightmare on Elm Street is a refreshing and imaginative scary movie by a master of horror; Wes Craven. This first Nightmare is probably the darkest of the series. Freddy has some witty one liners in this, but it isn't full on comedy like we see in Nightmare 3-6. The story is about a group of teenagers who are having nightmares about a burned man that is trying to kill them. The man is Freddy Krueger and years ago he killed many of the children on Elm Street in a town called Springwood. After the police let him go the parents gathered and killed him, burning him alive. Now he has found a way to exact his revenge on the parents. He can kill their other children in their dreams. After her friend Tina is murdered in her sleep by the evil madman, Nancy must find out the town secret and stop Freddy from killing all of the teenagers in Springwood.<br/><br/>There are some things about this movie that don't make sense. The ending is the big thing that stands out. Did the mother die or not, what was with her being sucked into that mattress? And the ending in general was pretty weak. But the rest of the film is brilliant. The acting is very good, of course Johnny Depp stars in his first movie. And Heather Langenkamp does a strong job in the role of the survivor - Nancy Thompson. Wes Craven created a horror icon in Freddy Krueger that has lasted many many decades. <br/><br/>A Nightmare on Elm Steet is the one that started it all. It isn't the horror comedy that the recent Nightmares have been, definitely the scariest of the series. A must watch.<br/><br/>9/10"

","I have seen this film nearly 500 times and I have to say that this is a movie that no one will ever forget in the future years to come. I did like the costume that Freddy had worn throughout the film including the makeup on his face. But if anyone hasn't figured this out yet, our screams give him his power to kill us and to get him stronger in his world. I was scared out of my wits when I had seen Freddy's claw come out of the bathtub, his face come through the wall, the scratch marks or screeches his makes, all the death scenes, and the thing about Nancy pulling Freddy's hat out her dream+ her hair turning gray. It really scared me when I had first seen this film. My favorite death scenes were the Tina death scene and the Glen death scene. I do suggest this film to anyone 12 yrs. or older, but anyone younger should be beside an adult at all times. If I had offended anyone let me know!

An instant commercial success, the film's total United States box office gross is $25.5 million.<br/><br/>The film is credited with carrying on many clichés found in low-budget horror films of the 1970s and 1980s, originating in John Carpenter's 1978 horror film Halloween, including the morality play that revolves around sexual promiscuity in teenagers resulting in their eventual (usually graphic) death, leading to the term ""slasher film"".<br/><br/>Critics and film historians argue that the film's premise is the question of the distinction between dreams and reality, which is manifested in the film through the teenagers' dreams and their realities. Critics today praise the film's ability to transgress ""the boundaries between the imaginary and real"", toying with audience perceptions.<br/><br/>Plot(for kids only): Krueger is a child murderer who killed at least twenty children over a decade before the film takes place. Furious, vengeful parents burned him alive in his boiler room hideout when he was released from prison on a technicality.

This man is named Freddy Krueger and he is also known as the Springwood Slasher. One night while living on Elm street, Nancy begins to have these horrible nightmares about a man with knives for fingers. She begins to talk to her friends about these nightmares, and she quickly learns that they are all having the same nightmares. Nancy then decides that she must first find out who this man that is tormenting herself and her friends is. In the meantime, Nancy is also trying to figure out how to get these nightmares to stop. One by one she watches her friends get slaughtered by this Freddy character. After awhile she then figures out that her mother knows something about just who Freddy is and why he is doing what he is doing. Nancy talks to her mother and finds out that Freddy was once a gardener at the school where she and her friends went to school at when they were little. She also finds out that he took them into a boiler room and molested them. Nancy listens in horror to her mother as her mother tells her this gruesome tale about Freddy and his demise. Finally, her mother tells her that she and all the other parents of the children end up trapping him inside the boiler room and burning him to death. It is then that Nancy's mother reveals to Nancy the gloved hand of Freddy with the knives attached to the fingers. Nancy stares in horror and then tells her mother that Freddy is after her in her dreams and she must put a stop to him once and for all before she ends up dead. Nancy then forms a plan with her boyfriend that she is going to go to sleep and inside her dream she is going to stop Freddy. She then begs that if her boyfriend hears her screaming or sees her thrashing about in the bed to wake her up. Well, her boyfriend ends up falling asleep and Nancy is left to fend for herself. Nancy eventually ends up face to face with Freddy and tells him that she is not afraid anymore. This stops Freddy in his tracks and he then leaves. The theme for this movie is definitely Human Mortality. The major actors in this movie are Robert Englund (Freddy), Heather Langenkamp( Nancy Thompson), and Johnny Depp (Glen Lantz)"

","I usually have a strong dislike towards terror films, especially modern ones or from recent years. This one had the age advantage for me to watch it, to see how it would be like. But I also watched it, following the suggestion of two people. <br/><br/>It's significantly better than I expected (for a terror film, of course) but it's not a great movie, just okay. But then again, there are much worse in this genre.<br/><br/>There is no denying that this movie had a deep impact on this type of films, not only because it was followed by a ridiculous number of sequels, but also because in later years many slasher/terror/horror (whatever) films were made, inspired on this. Even now this still happens.<br/><br/>This movie is, as any film like it, disturbing. There is brutal, graphic violence. Plus, the character Fred Krueger (today more known as Freddy Krueger) is more than just sinister: he is nauseating, to say the least. It gives one nauseas, makes one feel sick just to look at him, even through we don't see him that well (at least in this one). Fred Krueger, with his razor-sharp knives on the fingers, makes me wonder if somehow he didn't inspire Edward Scissorhands (even though they are completely different type of characters). Ironically, Johnny Depp is in this (and he was Edward Scissorhands). Johnny Depp was really young here, looks so different that he is almost unrecognizable (and was still far from becoming an actor famous for portraying weird, eccentric characters).<br/><br/>As much as the film is terrifying, it also is confusing. The way it transgresses the boundaries between dream (more appropriately, nightmare) and reality often made me not knowing what was real and what wasn't real. And it's strange (and scary) how nightmare becomes reality in this. <br/><br/>The cast was nothing special in terms of acting, but I liked Heather Langenkamp as Nancy. She is beautiful and hot!"

","I've been wanting to watch this for years, and I finally found it(and the rest of the series) on sale. This was as great(right from the opening credits up to the *excellent* ending) as I thought, and better. And no, the fact that this is the first thing I put on after going to Inception is basically a coincidence. This builds up an atmosphere(and Freddy himself) immensely effectively, and it is unbelievably terrifying and shocking. With smart use(that is not excessive) of disgusting and sexually suggestive content, we are repulsed by the monster of this. It's interesting to note that he barely talks in this; that part of his image comes from the sequels, evidently. This is incredibly creepy, eerie and mysterious(nicely helped by the spot-on music), and truly does evoke the feeling of being in a nightmare. What helps it all a ton, in addition to how creative and inventive the dreams are(honestly, they are utterly unforgettable), is how full of surprises this is. We are continually led to believe that we know what will happen, and then the carpet is pulled out from under us. This is intense. The FX hold up astonishingly well, including make-up. This is all the more impressive in virtue of the fact that *this was actually low-budget*. Wes directs it all so well that you really can't tell. While a lot of these films, especially from this period, have obnoxious characters, this one has likable and reasonably developed ones. The relationships between them are credible, as well. This is well-cast, as well, and our lead is cute and attractive. The acting is good. There is a lot of bloody, brutal violence and disturbing content, as well as a bit of strong language in this. The Ultimate Collector's Edition 7-Disc DVD set comes with an informational and funny commentary track with Langenkamp, Saxon, Haitkin and Craven, a self-explanatory feature entitled Jump To A Nightmare and a theatrical trailer.

","A Nightmare On Elm Street (1984)<br/><br/>""I'm gonna kill you slow""<br/><br/>In the event of my death, please cease all life support systems that may be even biologically or genetically in place.<br/><br/>Why?<br/><br/>""This Is God!""<br/><br/>I was young when I first saw Freddy in a dream, probably in my early teenage years. He was sitting in a greenish-yellow hued, dark room with nothing aside from a disappearing window that bleakly shown the light of a black moon through a white sky.<br/><br/>Have I gone crazy since the night of that particular dream? Definitely.<br/><br/>Have I recovered and became readjusted to the side of dreams that are more lucid and easier to mentally digest? Yes and no. It was in reality one of many nightmares that I had in my youth that I could not control, so it will always be my self-employed job to control myself during sleep.<br/><br/>Am I still concerned that the dream may reoccur? Indefinitely. A quote, not from the original Nightmare on Elm Street, that I'll use here, is the one sentence spoke by the monster of my own unconscious creation, after a long night of staring dreadfully at the shrouded face of Freddy Kreuger. At the end of the dream he merely said this before hopping out the window.<br/><br/>""I'll be back""<br/><br/>A year before I was born, the masterwork of infamous director Wes Craven was released worldwide. It was unquestionably the most original work of horror in history.<br/><br/>"" Count myself a king of infinite space""<br/><br/>The lucidity of the dreamer's is questionable. Is Freddy in charge of the dreams, or is he merely an invasive force that beckons them deeper into lucidity? It becomes apparent that the fearlessness of the heroes is partially an effect of the dreams, as we become acquainted with the characters whose fears of sleep become dangerously unhealthy. It's only when they fall asleep that their irrefutable anxiety becomes pure angst that lashes out at the filmviewer's conscience.<br/><br/>Scream ""Stop!"" Scream ""Don't go down the stairs!"" ""Don't fall asleep!""<br/><br/>But they will. They are superheroes within the dreams that they are victims of having.<br/><br/>This brings to mind all of the intricacies of dreaming and the completely repellent hoax of rapid eye movement. The mind's eye is working, in our dreams, this is for sure The eyelids which quiver beneath the pillow's lulling are more likely merely a lullaby to the soul.<br/><br/>I have never seen a movie that has been more overlooked as well as underlooked in it's effect on popular culture. Either your looking at it as the greatest film of all time, for the wrong reasons Or your looking at it as another campy 80's concept flick For again, the wrong reasons.<br/><br/>In truth, this is one of the top ten films of all time. It preys on self-esteems of everyone that can watch it from beginning to end in one sitting. I watched it myself, for about the fifth time before writing this review. I was still jumping out of the chair at certain points. I am not someone who scares easily, especially from movies.<br/><br/>So why is a movie that is so difficult to understand worthy of such praise? It's not how you watch it, why you watch it, where or when, or even who watches it. It's what your watching. It's the same every time, and it will always be funny, as well as scary. But I've heard that laughter is the sincerest form of insanity known to exist within the physical spectrum of emotion.<br/><br/>Fear the night, but if you do Don't forget who's watching behind the other sides of your eyes.<br/><br/>Goodnight, folks til next time<br/><br/>""Whatever you do Don't fall asleep""<br/><br/>By the way his glove is missing from the face of the planet. Wonder if I still got it? I definitely have the hat to match<br/><br/>A Nightmare On Elm Street 10/10"

","""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is, more or less, a pretty formulaic horror film in the sense that there's a killer on the loose who's murdering the cast one by one. Been there, done that etc. Stylistically-wise it's a so-so affair as well, with some of the horror sequences and effects being cheesy and others being nicely-made and well thought out. However it works quite effectively where other horror films only hint at: the killer as a symbol for sexual desire.<br/><br/>As soon as the teenage cast becomes sexually active, whoosh, there comes the deformed monster Freddy Krueger (in their dreams of all places) to deal with them. Furthermore, their parents refuse to acknowledge the existence of Freddy (aka sexual libido), though Nancy's mother eventually admits to coming face to face with him in the past and killing him. It is also worth noting that the females (Nancy and Tina) both go on in their dreams looking for Freddy, whereas the males (Rod and Glen) seem oblivious to his existence and are much more easily murdered.<br/><br/>""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" adds this twisted psychological framework in the background and that is why it's a worthwhile film to watch."

","""Whatever you do, don't fall asleep."" A Word of Warning:This user comment is for those who have seen the film.<br/><br/>You know, I often take away the memorable frightening images when watching this film, but this particular viewing had me focusing on something else..the ending. If you think about it, the entire film until that baffling final scene is one long nightmare. I was trying to wrap my head around it, because it seems we often overlook this very story arc. I always just told myself, that these four teenagers were being stalked by a nightmare slayer, whose perhaps targeting the children of those who burned him alive. But, it's all(supposedly) a scary concoction in the realm of Nancy's(Heather Langenkamp)sleep. I'm not sure if I just woke up from being under a rock or what, but it was something that startled me. Then the ending comes(..from what I understand, this confusing conclusion was set up by Craven as a favor to producer Shaye who was hoping to benefit from a sequel, and boy was rewarded!)and I was once again, as I always am, left with my jaw swinging open. I'll never truly make sense of that final scene, but Craven leaves enough lasting nightmarish images to take away that I'm completely satisfied each time I watch it. The shocking murder of Tina, sliced across the stomach, blood all over the place, dragged up the wall and across the ceiling. Then later, Tina in a body bag(yikes!)calling Nancy's name, later seeing her body, in bag, being drug across the school hallway leaving a blood trail. The invisible hanging of Tina's thuggish beau Rod(Nick Corri)in his jail cell, locked up as the one responsible for what Fred Kreuger did to her. The monumental death scene of Johnny Depp's Glen, pulled into a void in his bed(..television in tow)with a gushing water fall of blood erupting like a geyser throughout the ceiling and room. The imaginative occurrences which terrorize Nancy(..the telephone-tongue gag, the quicksand steps, the bladed glove slowly creeping from between her legs as she lies in her bath tub nearly asleep). Maybe Craven's overall product has flaws which seep through, but he provides so much to make your skin crawl. What playful ground Craven has to operate his ghoulish tricks..the nightmare world provides such freedom to kill innocent teens anyway you wish, as they run for their very lives with nowhere, it seems, to escape. A ""filthy child murderer"" who would brings kids to a boiler room to kill..certainly not the hero many would cheer down the road. Interesting, isn't it, that we often forget the evil fiend he really is. Craven gives this psycho free reign to torment and terrorize, the idea is certainly scary if you think about it. And, as far as Nancy, I was doting on the idea that this film is almost entirely(..if not entirely, depending on your opinion with that crazy finale)inside her nightmare, regarding her parents. Interesting that her mom is an oddball drunk and her dad is always gone. They rarely have anything nice to say to each other, and one can sense that this is in the nightmare for Nancy to deal with..a daughter bothered by the separation of her parents and how her mother deals with it through downing alcohol. And, it's always nice to see Freddy before he was the jokey psycho-clown. You rarely ever get a full glimpse of his face, he's the epitome of a prowler in the shadows who is always near yet hard to find..until it's too late, and you are caught in his grip. While I think the Shoulder's ""Freddy's Revenge"" has the scariest incarnation of Freddy, he's certainly given moments in Craven's film..such as that one scene where his arms stretch wide as he comes towards Tina, or when he ""stretches"" through a wall spying on Nancy. And, the smashing sequence where he elastically stretches from the center of a bed after ""carrying away"" Nancy's mom into some sort of abyss, ripping open the sheet from behind his arch nemesis who has seemingly figured out his ultimate weakness..he preys, like many a predator, on the quarry's fears. If one doesn't fear him, then he's vulnerable. Anyway, the film is always a roller coaster ride I hate to get off of..maybe it doesn't scare the hell out of me as it did when I was a kid, but I appreciate and admire the creativity and imagination Craven's supernatural slasher has."

","I compare A Nightmare on Elm Street to such classic horror standards as Psycho and Halloween, with an incredible twist: a murdering child molester returning from the dead to terrorize the kids he didn't kill in their dreams! The concept is as terrifying as it is original and it will send chills down your spine.<br/><br/>In this outstanding film, the suspense literally captivates, haunts, and grabs the viewer. You never know what will happen next! The cinema genius of Wes Craven is brilliant. My interpretation of this film is one can never be sure what part of it is in a character's dream state, and what part of it is actually reality (i.e in their ""awake"" environments.)<br/><br/>The plot involves a child molester named Freddy Krueger who was tried for murdering the neighborhood Elm Street children. He gets off on a technicality and an outraged group of parents seek to track him down and kill him for what he did to the kids. Now the current Elm Street kids are all seeing the same visions of a horribly scarred burned man with knife-life fingernails and a brown hat in their dreams.<br/><br/>The local law enforcement are baffled and slow to believe, and the main protagonist named Nancy witnesses Freddy's killings and she begins to emotionally break down right before our eyes. She and her friends must do everything they can to stay awake so that Freddy not only does not kill them, but also so they can bond together to convince their parents and the police that Freddy is the killer. The only way that they can bring him to justice is for Nancy to try to bring him out of her dreams.<br/><br/>Nancy is the main character that Freddy is after because her Mother, (who has turned into an alcoholic and paranoid basket case) took Freddy's trademark finger knives and dirty brown hat. Now Freddy is after Nancy and her friends for revenge! The music sets the mood of the film and never lets go. The scripting is fast-paced, and every character has important dialog to add to the suspense of the film.<br/><br/>SPOILER: I love how Nancy's friend Glen tells her how she is able to channel her energy to take control of her dreams. You will have to see the movie to find out whether it works.........or not! The ending is pure genius and you will be stunned, and scared not only at the conclusion, but through much of the earlier scenes of the movie as well! This is the best film of the series. The third sequel called ""The Dream Warriors"" is also very good. The rest of the sequels are poor. See this modern classic, (or I am sure for many of you) see it again! Horror films don't get much better than this. Oh, and whatever you do, ""DON'T FALL ASLEEP!!!!"""

"Howlin Wolf","10","0","1","13 June 2007"," My favourite horror movie. I doubt I'll ever see anything to surpass it.
","My memories of this film reach back about as far as for any other movie out there. I remember sitting in my grandparents darkened back room when I was about six, no older than seven. I asked my uncle what scary film he was starting to watch, and he told me this title. The very first shot we see is absolutely masterful, it almost has the feel of a counterfeit recording, although I can assure you it wasn't. Freddy and his homemade 'item', then a jumpy credits sequence replete with haunting music. It's the most effective way to open a horror story that I believe I can think of...<br/><br/>Mostly the proceedings are kept tightly organised from thereon in. It's worth mentioning that I've never happened upon any male fans complaining about the plot featuring a teenage girl as the most resourceful character. It's a welcome change, and thankfully due to good scripting it never feels like a mistake or a crass gimmick. The ratio of 'dumb' victims is less than usual, too - you can't really blame them for succumbing to a predator who attacks them within the realm of their subconscious. The back story of the real Kreuger - let alone his spiritual manifestation - is sickening enough to conjure up some serious shivers. If I was nitpicking I'd say that the climax felt a bit rushed, but that hardly mattered considering that everything had been handled so well up until then, and this slight dip is more than compensated for by a terrific last shot, anyway. Finally, how could I fail to adore a fright-fest featuring the reliable and reassuring presence of the legend John Saxon as a concerned father? It ticks all the boxes, I tells ya!<br/><br/>So much thought appears to have gone into the concept, and it's this attention to detail that helps it resonate. Freddy's sweater, for example, red and green because those colours clash horrifically... No wonder this sleeper effort put New Line on the map. It was the studio house that Freddy built, and it kick started my realisation that movies could leave a lasting imprint on the mind. 9-10, never sleep again? Someone should have told that to all of the directors who deputised for Craven, because disappointingly they were found to be asleep at the reins of a franchise that had been given such a roaring start."

","A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984, Dir. Wes Craven) <br/><br/>Story <br/><br/>Back in 1984, a new horror franchise was introduced by Director Wes Craven. This was the third franchise to hit cinema screens during this period. The Friday the 13th series and the Halloween series both introduced silent killers, which slowly moved around killing each victim off one by one. The killer here is very different and offers quite a cocky mood with many jokes and one liners said as he delivers unique ways of death to the individuals. The concept of the killer is very different, as he can only kill you in your sleep. Unlike Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers, Freddy Krueger quickly finishes you off as you try to stay awake. Like most horror movies, there are a group of 'teens' to work together to try and survive their nightmares.<br/><br/>Actors <br/><br/>There are only 4 primary hero characters and 1 villain, although other minor characters do appear at different times. Heather Langenkamp brings to life a wonderful heroine in the form of Nancy Thompson. She brings so much life to the character and you really do start to feel for her, but there are times where she doesn't feel sad enough after so many deaths. A very young looking Johnny Depp also appears. For his feature film appearance, Depp delivers a performance so convincing, that he looks like he was born with the acting bug. It's hard to believe he would go on to be the idol he is today.<br/><br/>Music <br/><br/>The music is one of the few things which are not very memorable in the film, but this is a good thing. Charles Bernstein does make a theme for the 'Nightmare on Elm Street' series which still sends shivers down your spine to this day. I feel that in horror films, music can disappoint the audience with its slow sweeping soundtracks as a death is about to happen. I prefer it when it's deadly silent.<br/><br/>Special Effects <br/><br/>The special effects in this film are very basic and simple, yet are still very, very effective. The make up transformation which Robert Englund goes through is remarkable and a lot of effort has been put into it. The deaths aren't very brutal, although some can be considered gory. They have been done in a way which are not the usual deaths, whilst still doesn't go over the top. Some effects are unrealistic, such as super long Freddy arms, but still fit into the dream like work.<br/><br/>Conclusion <br/><br/>Overall, 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' is an wonderful horror fan, which anyone who fancy some frightful fun should watch. It has everything from horror to comedy, and even a bit of romance.<br/><br/>""When I get nervous, I eat, ""  Glen Lantz (Johnny Depp)"

I had to keep staring and I still wasn't sure.<br/><br/>Anyway, Wes Craven has written and directed a classic horror picture. Is it real or is it a dream? What is real? It had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. I guess that means it was great horror. I especially liked the bathtub scene. That was definitely creepy.

"BA_Harrison","7","0","2","28 April 2007"," Introducing Mr. Krueger...
","After years of tepid stalk 'n' slash films, Wes Craven's A Nightmare On Elm Street gave the horror genre a much needed shot in the arm with an altogether different kind of scary monster: Fred Kruegera dead child killer who is able to attack and kill people in their dreams.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the victim of a bad case of sequilitis, A Nightmare on Elm Street was also responsible for spawning that staple of the 80s and 90s chillerthe bad guy that makes bad puns whilst slicing up his victims. With each subsequent chapter in the franchise, the mystery behind Fred was stripped away, and he became less and less a figure of fear, and more of a wise-cracking pop culture icon to be loved and not loathed.<br/><br/>Is it still even possible to watch the original movie and put this image out of one's mind? After many years of not having seen Wes's 1984 'classic' I decided to sit down and revisit Elm Street to find out.<br/><br/>Craven's film starts with a credits sequence in which an unseen person crafts a pair of wicked looking razor-fingered gloves (all the better for slicing up teens with). We are then plunged into the first nightmare of the movie, as experienced by terrified teen Tina Gray (Amanda Wyss): the poor girl is stalked by a hideously scarred man wearing the lethal gloves. This, of course, is Fred Krueger (Robert Englund), back from the dead to slaughter the children of those that took the law into their own hands years earlier, and sentenced him to death by fire.<br/><br/>It seems that Tina is not the only one suffering from night-time visits from Fred: most of the other teens on Elm Street have been seeing him in their dreams too. And when the kids start dying in mysterious circumstances, it is up to plucky Nancy (Heather Langenkamp), daughter of local policeman Lt. Thompson (John Saxon), to stand up to kiddie-killer Krueger.<br/><br/>Whilst not perhaps deserving of its almost legendary status, A Nightmare On Elm Street is still, for the most part, a solid, fun and innovative movie which is well worth a watch. Craven makes good use of the whole dream idea, delivering some suitably nightmarish visuals accompanied by unnervingly creepy sound effects (most notably, the sound of Fred's 'fingers' scraping on metal). I can't say that I found the film particularly scary, but am willing to accept that this is probably due to my over familiarity with the whole Elm Street franchise.<br/><br/>Craven builds the tension well, and the likable cast (including a young Johnny Depp) give reasonable performances, making the silly premise seem almost believable. And when the story threatens to drag, the savvy director has the good sense to pop in some creative and very bloody death sequences in order to regain the interest of the viewer.<br/><br/>In fact, the film is pretty good up until the final showdown between Nancy and Fred, when Craven's script becomes a bit of a nonsensical mess, with our heroine dragging the killer into reality and luring him into several rather hastily set-up booby-traps. It is here that the film falters badly, with Nancy defeating Fred in a decidedly lame fashion (by ignoring him!). And then to make matters worse, the film finishes with a 'twist' ending which will leave you questioning what the hell just happened.<br/><br/>If you are totally unfamiliar with the Elm Street series (which is unlikely, I know), then it is advisable to watch this one first to get the most from the film. As for the rest of us, don't watch this expecting to experience absolute terrorit won't happen. Instead, sit back and enjoy one of the most influential horrors of the past few decades safe in the knowledge that, with the exception of maybe two of the sequels (Pts 3 and 7), they got a whole lot worse."

It will scare them senseless. I myself would have been scared of it only a few years earlier. But suddenly, hitting my mid-teens, I'm not very scared of movies anymore. But this is the sort of movie that will definitely scare a little kid.<br/><br/>The goriness is minimal. Sort of like Jaws. Nowhere near as bad as Texas Chainsaw Massacre. And some of the violence is overdone almost to the point of corniness. Like, about 400 gallons of blood spewing up from the bed where a young man was pulled down to his death. C'mon. There was enough blood for like five people in that shot. But anyway.<br/><br/>There is NO NUDITY. YAY! Nudity only detracts from a films value. Had there been nudity, my rating would have been an automatic 4 or less, regardless of the other content. There is implied sex however, accompanied with some very exaggerated ""sounds"" from the bedroom.

","Wes Craven's horror classic holds up remarkably well, and remains a truly scary movie.<br/><br/>Freddy was always a more chilling villain than Michael Myers or Jason Voorhees. Whereas the other two went about their ritualistic killings like zoned-out zombies, Freddy delights in his, and enjoys the fear his victims feel as he toys with them before he murders them as much as he enjoys the murders themselves. And he's just physically scarier as well: he runs, darts around, can pop up anywhere as anything.<br/><br/>Wes Craven's genius in this entire series was the plot hook that has Freddy only able to murder in his victims' dreams.

","'A Nightmare on Elm Street' may be the greatest horror movie ever made.<br/><br/>**SPOILERS**<br/><br/>Teenager Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp) is having a weird series of dreams. In her dreams, she is being assaulted by a strange man in a torn red and green sweater. She confides in her friend Tina (Amanda Wyss), who tells Nancy she is having the same dreams. Suffering from several sleepless nights, Nancy decides to have a sleepover with her boyfriend Glen (Johnny Depp), Tina and her boyfriend Rod (Jsu Garcia). Rod and Tina immediately have sex with each other, but after it's done, the strange man from their dreams returns and kills Tina before Rod's very eyes. At the police station, Nancy's policeman father (John Saxon) asks what happened, but nobody knows anything, not even Rod. Convinced she is suffering from amnesia, he orders her to go home and get some rest, but is still tormented in her dreams by the mystery man. She asks her mother (Ronee Blakley) what is going on, and she reveals that the mystery man is Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund), who was a child molester that the parents in town killed after he was released from prison. She tells Nancy that he can invade the dreams of the children of the people who killed him, but never told Nancy because she didn't believe his threat to come back. Nancy must now deal with the fact that Freddy is coming after her and her friends, and that no one is safe from his terror.<br/><br/>The Good News: This is perhaps the most-well known horror movie in history, and it is also among the best. What makes the movie so good is that it takes the tired and routine slasher-film formula and injects new life into it by making Freddy have a little more personality than just about every other slasher, as well as making the kills so creative. This is due also to the creative idea of having Freddy go after everybody in their dreams, thereby allowing people to never by safe awake or asleep and giving Freddy the power to do anything in the dream world. He rules the dream world, so he can do anything to people in that world. The best example of this is the first time we meet Freddy, by outstretching his arms out at least six feet long and chasing after Tina. That is brilliant in its execution and design, as well as the idea to do a scene like that. I also would like to say that this film made me jump so much for a movie made at that time. I jumped at least five different times during the movie, which for an eighties movie is a lot. The highest one was the scene where Nancy is walking along this dark walkway and is mentioning hoe she isn't afraid of Freddy, who then pops out behind her and grabs her. The other big scene is towards the end, where Freddy is in our world, and Nancy has him in her room, but can't see him because her room is covered in pillow feathers. She exclaims that it must've been a dream, and then Freddy pops up next to her from underneath the bed. Classic, as well as so many other scenes. Who can't love the bed scene with Johnny Depp getting sucked in, and then one of horror's greatest gags shows. It is a memorable scene, and for those who haven't seen this, see it for that one scene, it is shocking. This also formed many great slasher rules that movies like 'Scream' poked so much fun at. 'Don't run up the staircase when the front door is a few feet away,' 'People of authority never believe the truth about the killer,' 'Parents are always hiding a very dark secret that comes back to haunt them,' 'It never really is the end, even when you think it is,' and tons more are highlighted here. It may not be the first to have them, but it had a ton of them showcased. I could talk for years about why this movie is so good, but I think you need to see it for yourself to know what I am talking about.<br/><br/>The Bad News: Other than maybe showing some more nudity, this film has no faults.<br/><br/>The Final Verdict: For the few who are interested in horror movies that still haven't seen this landmark movie needs to. It contains a lot of classic scenes that will take your breath away, and so much has been inspired from this movie that its greatness knows no bounds. Everyone needs to see this, I can't recommend it enough.<br/><br/>Rated R: Graphic Violence, Brief Nudity, Adult Language, and an off-camera sex scene."

","The Concept:  'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' meets 'Terminator' meets 'Carrie'<br/><br/>It's hilarious watching these ""horror"" films--we know the cliches by heart, but gladly accept more.  The acting is daft (even Englund's) but I saw this with 'Fast Times' because some of their players later went through the ""Oliver Stone Camp.""  In this case, Depp (with Whitaker) in 'Platoon.'  This is Depp's first work, but he's superior to everyone on the playing field.<br/><br/>This is your only spoiler warning...<br/><br/>The production values are definitely 'Highlander', even the photography borrows similar lighting and angles.  By today's standards, the energy has evaporated because Craven invests all of it into the score...and the score is unbearably thin.  David Fincher mastered the shot, chop, and idea with his projects.<br/><br/>By comparison to the shallow 'Halloween' and 'Friday the 13th' garbage, this actually has better points.  Kruger is the Martin Riggs of the genre, except here where he's the one-dimensional bogeyman.  He'd later add the human element; outclassing the foolish actors (and directors) that didn't understand it. <br/><br/>Some interesting notes:<br/><br/>--The whole premise, 'Halloween' with 'Alice', was later expanded in 'Matrix'.  The hero, by modern standards, is a prude.  Just goes to show how this has dated in 20 years.<br/><br/>--Craven retains his hypocrisy from 'Hills.'  Here he takes from 'Exorcist', 'Psycho', 'Caligari', and 'Evil Dead.'  Ironically, Raimi would bring a new vocabulary to the genre with 'Dead 2' and 'Army.'  Still, Craven is slightly smarter than Carpentar.<br/><br/>--Kruger bleeds anti-freeze.  He resides in an industrial lair.  His weapon of choice, naturally, is his razor glove.  Being possessed by the machine fetish, he kills kids.  The adults don't understand the myth since they're raised on science, so the superstitious kids conquer him.<br/><br/>Now only of historical interest.  Craven got it right with 'New Nightmare' by mixing real and movie worlds; and it's darn fun.<br/><br/>Final Analysis = = Midrange Material"

"Elswet","8","0","2","2 April 2004"," A clever new malediction has come to Elm Street.
","Based on a true story from the late 70's and published in the LA times were articles concerning young people were dying while in the grips of a nightmare. This is to be one of the freshest innovations of the horror genre of the 1980's. These articles detailed a particular young man who, after his death, was found to have hidden a coffee pot in his closet; utilizing caffeine as a means to keep him awake rather than facing his nightmares. He had even told his family that these nightmares did not ""feel real."" Written and directed by Horror Maven Wes Craven, this series took on a phenomenal success rate with this first installment in what later became the ""Freddy Franchise."" He incorporated a man from one of his early childhood memories in the characterization of his newest nemesis by giving Freddy the characteristics of this stranger who had frightened him as a child.<br/><br/>As a risky endeavor, this film turned out to be one of the surprising innovations in the slasher sub-genre of Horror. Indeed, this film was extremely risky for New Line, as they had a credit limit of around $100,000.00 and was forbidden by the bank to use a dime of that in film production and had to raise the money to begin production on this endeavor.<br/><br/>As a variation on the news paper articles, this attempt needed something which would bring in the ladies, to widen the target audience and give it a stronger feeling of reality. The element of ""Beauty and the Beast"" was written in and played upon in such a darkling twisted way that this film was pivoted into the horror movie Hall of Fame, so to speak, by recreating the modern myth of the ultimate battle between good and evil.<br/><br/>Another credit to this production is that it does not take itself too seriously. It pokes fun at the horror genre itself, thereby lending a solid reality base to the fantastical subject matter. Something which was also done in Craven's later slasher trilogy, ""Scream."" This vehicle does more than provide the element of humor, it also sets up the audience and commences the process of drawing them into the story by giving them various points with which they can relate to the lead characters. It also homages other horror greats, as many movies will later homage this one.<br/><br/>The character development here was extravagantly done. You felt like you knew them and thereby it mattered what happened with them. The process was never slow, tedious or boring, always drawing you in and making you feel like you were a part of the ""team."" Starring Heather Langencamp and John Saxon, this movie has the distinction of introducing Johnny Depp in his first screen role at the age of 21. While these performances were nothing Oscar-worthy, they were way above and beyond what the average movie goer would expect from a low budget teen slasher movie. It seems that Johnny Depp was destined for stardom as his portrayal, even then, was that of a polished professional.<br/><br/>The camera work here was creatively done, but the real achievement in this department goes to the lighting crew. The shadows and lighting choices here were an integral part of what created the incredible atmosphere of foreboding this movie held. Using split-mirror shots and an innovative eye for shadow and light, you never seem to notice the low budget aspects of this film. The liberal use of blood shows the audience that this villain is not afraid to get his hands dirty. Nay, he revels in it; hungers for it; exists for it.<br/><br/>The sets were realistically designed; the Thompson house felt like a home; the police station felt authentic and that boiler room...Great sinister feel, it had.<br/><br/>This movie had a beautiful element of suspense; dark and foreboding tension which builds with a rhythmic fretful crescendo to the climax.<br/><br/>But does it scare? I have to admit there are several scenes which made me literally jump. Some were predictable, but most were honest thrills.<br/><br/>All in all, while this is not THE best of the many horror franchises of the 1980's (That distinction goes to the Hellraiser run, in my opinion), it is definitely one OF the best, and second only to Hellraiser. (Some would class Halloween in here somewhere, but in all fairness, it was released in 1978 and therefore does not qualify as an ""80's film."" <br/><br/>This first installment rates an 8.4/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."
"CaptainNemo11","10","0","1","25 March 2004"," An Endless Scare!
","I have seen this movie a little more than 10 times.  First time being 12 years ago.  I recently just bought the DVD at Best Buy.  And now that I finally own it, I want to review it.  I think this movie is just brilliant. Freddy Krugor has to be the only killer that can make me scream, and make me laugh both at the same time.  He's the perfect killer invented.  For one, he talks!  If someone like Jason or Michael Myers came up to me without speaking, and just attempted to kill me, I'd be pretty scared.  But I would be petrified if the Killer talked to me and teased me before he slashed me. Also the music to this movie definitely gives you the chills.  Halloween's music, Jaws' music, and other Horror movie's music is fun.  But I get chills down my spine hearing the Nightmare On Elm Street music.  What also makes this a great horror flick is that it scares you right from the beginning. Unlike some horror movies where it's just suspenseful, and only like one or two parts that make your heart jump.  The horror scenes are evenly spread out in this movie.  I just love it.  And if I ever want to just scare myself to death, I'll always just skip to the part where Freddy says ""This is God!"" Classic!<br/><br/>10/10"

","I remember seeing a nightmare on elm street part 1. This was the first ever nightmare on elm st movie. It was made in 1984, Freddy Kruger is a serial killer who's in people's dreams, he tries and kills people when they are dream and they are asleep. Freddy Kruger became popular in the 1980's when people first heard about the serial killer."
"Anonymous_Maxine","9","0","1","6 July 2003"," Oh, you KNOW they're gonna make a sequel!
","For the first third or so of the original Nightmare of Elm Street, I was trying to figure out exactly what Freddy Krueger's motive was, since he seemed to just be some boogeyman that was haunting the dreams of a few high school kids, and later on it turns out that his motive is to get revenge against the people (and their kids) that killed him. So Freddy was a child molester, and after having been released on a technicality, the citizens decide to take matters into their own hands to get rid of him. I actually like that he's back to exact his revenge for what I believe to have been a justified death, because it makes you even more interested in seeing his demise. As if molesting kids wasn't enough, now we get to see him killed for what he does to these teenagers, too. <br/><br/>I think that what sets A Nightmare on Elm Street apart from other slasher movies is that it has found a way around the fact that movies like this are only scary if you're really young or just really high strung. While the movie itself is not scary in the slightest, it does know about that line between consciousness and sleep and it utilizes it very effectively. You never really notice the point at which you fall asleep, you just suddenly find yourself dreaming, and this is why you never really know when Freddy could show up in the movie. This reminds me of all those times in high school that I would dream that I had gotten up and taken a shower and eaten breakfast and gone to school, and then I wake up still at home halfway through third period. The scares may have grown completely obsolete, but the movie remains interesting because it's not as predictable as so many other movies of its kind. <br/><br/>The whole theme of teenagers being slashed by relentless killers (often seemingly in response to them having sex with each other) is not new at all, but A Nightmare on Elm Street takes that theme and adds in the clever addition that the killer resides in their dreams and can kill them through them. The movie has no memorable score at all besides an old nursery rhyme, but it is a testament to the quality of the rest of the movie that it remains memorable even without something like Halloween's infectious film score. It may not be scary anymore, but A Nightmare on Elm Street is still a signpost of the more interesting horror films made in the 80s."
"Aaron1375","8","0","2","4 April 2003"," The best of the series, period!
","In fact it isn't even close.  This is about the only Nightmare I fully enjoy.  It is a creepy, highly atmospheric horror that delivers.  It centers on these teenagers that seem to be having the same dreams of this strange man.  This man in their dream menaces them and terrorizes them.  In fact, if he injures you in the dream you will have the injury when you awaken.  This movie had a very good story and a great killer in Freddy.  Unfortunately, in later episodes Freddy became a comedian and his overall creepiness disappeared.  This one, however, is great as there are some very memorable death scenes."

From Wes Craven comes a classic that must be seen, a mixture of blood and gore and suspenseful scenes combines for a top rate movie.

","True, I am a Freddy fan. I think you would have to be to praise A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET so highly. But this movie is so fun to watch. As a kid I got so scared of this movie, I would run out of the room while the tape was still playing (!)<br/><br/>Now it's just a great movie to watch with some friends. The effects are kind of crummy compared to the ones in the sequel, but the scares are homemade pure. (""This is just a dream, it's all just a dream!"")<br/><br/>The acting is deliciously campy, just like the writing. I think this represents the surrealism and forgery of good dreams, but maybe I'm just saying that to cover up the flaws. But I love those lines! ""Screw your pass!"" or ""This..... is God!"" This classic flick also features the great Johnny Depp in his feature film debut, ""Me? Why would anyone wanna kill me?""<br/><br/>But despite the not-so-hot acting of the young cast, Wes Craven somehow has the superior power to creep you out with just a ring of the phone or little girls jumping rope and singing. Not to mention a slimy, bass-voiced, burnt-faced Krueger who is not afraid to take your (or his own) face off with his infamous glove. The music by Charles Bernstein plays throughout the movie and literally gives you chills down your spine.<br/><br/>I don't care how old you are or how many times you've seen this movie.

So when you watch this movie understand that Shaye and Craven gambled on their careers with this film. Actually, Craven had nothing to lose... his occupation before his outstanding filming career was a taxi driver. So, he was use to non extravagant living.

","This is definitely the best horror movies of later years. It came out at the same time that the horror genre was experiencing a re-birth, with films like ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Halloween"". Freddy is now the icon of evil, and with the upcoming ""Freddy vs. Jason"" he'll just get more popular. Robert Englund does and excellent job to portray the dream stalker, Freddy Krueger in this chilling horror masterpiece. It is the best in the long series of Nightmare on Elm Streets and is imitated by many, many films. No, there are just no really good horror films of the nineties, so let's take a time warp back to '84 and experience the best of the horror films, ""A Nightmare on Elm St."" Dun nu nuh!"

","Great, imaginative premise: Freddy Krueger comes to you in your dreams, and if you believe he's real, he can really hurt you, even kill you.<br/><br/>Executed in a fun way, with Johnny Depp in his first onscreen role, as one of the main characters, boyfriend to THE main character, in fact. He has quite a bit of screen time. If you're a Depp fan and haven't seen this, you'll love it. He's very young, 21 exactly.<br/><br/>Genre pictures which are self-referential, and don't take themselves too seriously, and are made by someone who loves the genre are always the most fun. This is why The Matrix Reloaded was one of the least fun sci-fi pics ever, and why The Matrix series was just asking to be spoofed in the worst way - there's not a single joke about the sci-fi genre in it, or a single moment where it doesn't take itself seriously.<br/><br/>Nightmare on Elm Street does not compete with most ""serious"" movies due to its incomparably bad acting (with the exception of Johnny Depp, who even at 21 captured the half-serious tone here), but in this case these unconvincing performances actually benefit the movie by drawing attention to the fact that this is only a movie, and further allowing the audience to enjoy and have fun with it. I was thinking, while watching it for the second time that if the performances WERE incredibly convincing, Nightmare on Elm Street would be rather unpleasant to watch. If you REALLY thought these teenagers were dying, and the central character was REALLY having to deal with their deaths, then it wouldn't be as fun. In an interview on the Scream DVD, Wes Craven says: ""People don't go to scary movies to be scared, they go to them to have fun."" The fact that he thinks this is what makes his horror movies the most fun. I sometimes wonder whether he'll be known for anything other than Nightmare on Elm Street and Scream. I hope he does give us something new and original, but if not, he has at least started two great fun modern horror series (even if their sequels are mostly garbage)."

I thought its concept was original, well-directed, adequately acted, and had gobs of great atmosphere. There are some truly frightening scenes in the film.  But...and I guess you knew that was coming...but I felt the film was just too incomprehensible to make it a true classic. The plot is riddled with holes.  We get a little expository information on this Freddy Krueger, but then nothing is done with it.  Also, the status of what is a dream and what is reality is never clear, and certainly adds to Wes Craven's ability to get you jumping out of your seat - with no accountability on his part to be anything but ambiguous. That said, this is a fine film.  For those of you that like lots of blood and special effects, this is like a motherlode.  I thought they were inventive, but the best scenes are the ones that use our imagination a bit. Look for the scene where the female lead boobytraps the house.  This is a trademark of Craven's.  You can see similar scenes in The Hills Have Eyes and more notably in Last House on the Left."
