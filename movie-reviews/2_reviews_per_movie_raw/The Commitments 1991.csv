","Who needs expensive movie stars when a group of unknowns can light up the screen like this lot?<br/><br/>On paper, it sounds like a failure - a cast comprising almost entirely of untrained and untested performers, set in working class Dublin, based on the novella by Roddy Doyle.  By God, does it defy expectations.<br/><br/>Jimmy Rabbitte is a working class Dublin lad who's been collecting unemployment benefits for two years.  But he dreams of bigger things, namely making it big in the music industry.  He sets out to form a soul band, and assembles a motley crew of musicians and singers, most of whom don't know each other and many of whom can't stand each other.<br/><br/>The look of the film is gritty and realistic - nothing is glossed over. North Dublin is presented in all it's glory.  The home lives of the band members are depicted warts and all - their private lives set the scene for the inevitable personality clashes that are almost as explosive as the music.  In the mix is the unique character of the Irish people - at one point Jimmy enters a tenement block and, as he waits for the lift, looks over to see a boy with a horse.  ""You aren't taking that in the lift, are you?"" he asks.  ""I have to,"" the boy replies.  ""The stairs would kill him.""<br/><br/>The real star of the show is the music - this film spawned two hugely successful soundtrack albums.  The band members were cast partly due to their musical ability, and the results are superlative.  The stand out is Andrew Strong as Deco - would you believe this kid was only 16 when the film was made?  His amazing voice belies his tender years, and suggests that he's been smoking a packet a day since the age of about four.  At the end of the day with is a fine ensemble piece, much like the band.  The acting may be a little wonky at times, but the hysterical dialogue makes up for that.<br/><br/>Most remarkably, this is a feel good film that does not rely on any of the conventional feel good plot devices.  There are no group hugs, no plot conveniences, no trite happy endings.  Just a shrewdly observed and wittily captured human story about people who dream of making it out of their dreary world.  And isn't that something we can all relate to?"
"Enemy-2","Null","49","54","27 March 1999"," How hope can elevate the hopeless
","I must confess that this is my favorite movie of all time, and the  music plays a large part of why I enjoy it so much. Don't expect  stellar acting in this movie unless you want to be let down--though  make no mistake, the acting is certainly adequate. The key players in  this movie were not chosen for their acting abilities, but rather for  their musical talent. The people you see on stage in the movie are the  same people who play the music you hear. (If you appreciate soul music,  do not pass up the chance to purchase The Commitments Vol. I and Vol.  II.) And what a talented assembly of musicians they brought together  for this movie. Most astonishing is the lead vocals of prodigy Andrew  Strong (playing lead singer Deco Cuffe) whom, at 16 years old at the  time of filming, possesses ""a voice that Bob Geldof would starve for.""  More than anything, this film is about hope. It is about the hopes and  dreams of a handful of poor north side Dubliners striving to beat the  odds and make something of themselves. The film follows the near-rise  and eventual fall of a band that, on the verge of a record deal, could  not bear to watch success interfere with their destiny to remain  destitute.  But was destitution their destiny after all? ""Success of the band was  irrelevant,"" the main protagonist and band manager is told moments  after the band breaks up. ""You raised their expectations of life--you  lifted their horizons!"" And indeed, the epilogue reveals that, even  though the band itself was a failure, virtually every band member had  achieved a greater level of personal achievement than they had hoped  for before they had joined the band.  This is a movie about the raw appeal of soul music; it is a movie about  Dubliners; it is a movie about the economic conditions in general that  grip Ireland; it is a movie about poor folks who endlessly toil in the  vain hope that they can make ends meet. But more than anything, it is a  movie about how hope alone can be the ultimate salvation of of those  who have nothing else to look forward to."
"Adrianne","Null","48","53","20 May 1999"," Funny how the Irish dig Motown...
","I've lived in Detroit all my life, and the great soul music of the 1960's and 70's which was created here (and is still enjoyed here) is featured throughout ""The Commitments.""  The Irish lads and lasses really do up the soul staples, from ""Try a Little Tenderness"" to ""Mustang Sally.""  The actual musical talent is reinforced by the strong character development, industrial setting (North Dublin), and masterful plot, adapted from the novel of the same name by Roddy Doyle. ""Say it once, say it loud...I'm black and I'm proud,"" is never more irreverently humorous than when questionably repeated by Jimmy Rabbite's soul disciples. I own this film, and I could watch it over and over.  The soundtrack is excellent, and the pop culture references throughout the movie are hilarious (especially during the audition scene.) This film delighted both the hard-core Detroiter in me, as well as the Irish lass.  The working class Irish youth depicted in the movie are sincere, and so is their project, The Commitments. (All the great bands were a ""The ..."")"
"Torch-7","Null","50","56","3 February 1999"," A movie made with the Soul!
","The first time I saw ""The Commitments"" I got surprised because it doesn't seem to be a Hollywood-like movie (talking about money) but it's a great example of good script and great performance of the actors/singers. When you see the movie, it seems to be a real-life-documentary.<br/><br/>The music is great! And the best of all is that some of The Commitments' members really play and sing... I recommend to buy the soundtrack (Vols. 1 & 2) if you really are a fan of soul-music. You're gonna love it!<br/><br/>Really... it's one of the best movies that I've seen! It's a movie made with the Soul!"
"sev127","10","31","35","17 May 2005"," Brilliant!
","I first heard of the Commitments when I heard someone playing the soundtrack on their car radio. I quickly bought myself a copy and played it about 10 times a day - the music and the singing were unlike anything I'd ever heard before, even though all the songs are covers.<br/><br/>It wasn't until about 6 months later that the film was on an obscure cable channel, and I literally got goosebumps as soon as the opening credits rolled with ""Treat her right"". It was so incredible to actually see the characters performing the songs that I'd grown to love. It all became complete actually seeing the story unfold, and by the end you're really rooting for the band to succeed. When they perform ""Try a Little Tenderness"" I've never managed to watch that scene without tears in my eyes, it's such a fantastic version of the song and the energy Andrew Strong brings to it is just incredible, especially as he was only 16 at the time.<br/><br/>Anyone who loves music has to see this film, even you're not familiar with soul music - I promise you'll be hooked after seeing The Commitments!"
"munjak","10","67","84","12 March 2004"," ""You raised their expectations of life, you lifted their horizons!""
","My one line summary consists of the most profound statement in the movie. ""Jimmy ""The Lips"" Fagin telling ""Brother Rabbitte"" what he has achieved, when Jimmy thinks he has achieved ""Nuttin'"".That being said, I am overjoyed at the amount of people giving their wonderful comments about my favorite movie of all time.I can't tell you all the people I've turned on to this movie. I remember I didn't see the movie when it first came out, then they came out with some god-awful TV series kinda based on the movie (Americanized, of course),which,thank god, met a quick & merciful death. I bought the VHS version, then the Laserdisc version, then the DVD, and am now awaiting the 2 disc special DVD, just released, to come in the mail.I have watched this film countless times & never get tired of it. I've even pretty much deciphered the dialogue(try reading the book sometime,if you think the movie is hard to understand!)One of my most prized possessions is a ""Commitments"" Promotional kit consisting of a ""Making of"" tape and a booklet about the movie in a photo-illustrated 6x15 box that I bought from a long-closed video store about 10 yrs ago. I also found the ellusive ""Commitments Vol.2"" CD in a ""cut-out"" bin about the same time.Anyway,I love the movie, and the whole premise of taking a bunch of unknown,talented, singers & musicians,with pretty much no hope of rising above their surroundings individually,and put them together to form ""The Hardest Working Band in Show Business"".To me, the highlight & peak of the band(and movie) was when they played ""Try a Little Tenderness"". It still gives me goosebumps & brings a mist to my eyes,whenever I see it.I'm still in love with Natalie & Imelda!! And Deco(Andrew Strong) only being 16yrs old!!I always hoped there would be a ""Part 2"", but as Joey said to Jimmy(after the band broke up) ""The success of the band was irrelevent.You raised their expectations of life, you lifted their horizons. Sure, we could have been successful, & made albums & stuff, but that would have been predictable. This way...it's poetry"". What a wonderful philosophy. That whole scene will never leave my mind."
"emm","8","36","44","2 February 1999"," Excellent story about the rise and fall of Irish ""saviors of soul"".
","Alan Parker's brilliant directing effort on THE COMMITMENTS really shines. More than an entertaining spectacle, it has a whole lot of influence on the soul music circuit. Shots of Dublin city life are nicely photographed. The musical acts are extremely well talented and well done, if only the occasional dialogue breaks didn't interrupt the awesome sound. There could've been some more new tunes instead of old ones, but it's amazing to discover the fictional band's lead singer pull them off out of his lungs. Phenomenal! At least you can try to find the soundtrack album. One thing stands out the best: the casting. We need more of today's movies to do the same thing: to provide creative acting talents. The musical genre of modern Hollywood needed something like this to keep it afloat. Highly recommended!"
"Watcher-37","10","31","39","14 August 1999"," Absolutely great movie
","I love this film. Everything about it might seem like it is just another cliche ridden story about the rise and fall of a band, but this movie is totally different somehow. It rises above anything previous in its genre. The characters are all both interesting, and their personality flaws are used to greatly illustrate the ending  of the movie. The writing was superb, and acting from a cast of mostly unknowns top notch. The musical sequences were great, and served as an introduction for me to the songs and artists that they covered. Colm Meaney was hilarious as the very skeptical father of Jimmy."
"Benedict_Cumberbatch","Null","28","35","26 January 2008"," ""This way it's poetry...""
","This is the simple and captivating story of Jimmy Rabbitte (Robert Arkins, fantastic like the whole cast), a young guy who decides to form a soul band in Dublin, and all the amazing people who join him. They've got musical talent and big dreams, but is that enough to climb to the top (and stay there)? <br/><br/>Alan Parker has made some very diverse films (""Midnight Express"", ""Angel Heart"", ""Mississippi Burning"", ""Angela's Ashes"") in his long career, but you can see that music is in his blood and one of his favourite themes (""Bugsy Malone"", ""Fame"", ""Pink Floyd The Wall"", ""Evita""). He orchestrates a mostly unknown cast (which includes a very young Glen Hansard, from the recent hit ""Once"") in a tale of hope, determination, and great music. The British have a great eye for the bittersweet side of life and misfits in general (""The Full Monty"", ""Little Voice"", ""Billy Elliot"" are fine examples), often with music as an important factor in the background (coincidence? I don't think so!). ""The Commitments"" is a beautiful, cheerful film, as passionate and memorable as Cameron Crowe's masterpiece ""Almost Famous"", and certainly one of the best music films of all time. 10/10."
"daybreak","10","20","26","26 December 1998"," Absolutely Brilliant!
","I've just watched 'The Commitments' for about the 100 time and everytime I see it it's like watching it for the very first time. It doesn't get very much better than this, let me tell you that!<br/><br/>Some really superb acting by Andrew Strong. Even if he's not really an actor, is he. I've seen him live once, as for summer of 1998 in the very south of Sweden, and he was terrific!<br/><br/>However, as written the movie was really superb with lots of views of how some people live in Ireland.<br/><br/>That's all for me,<br/><br/>Regards,<br/><br/>Jens Jadesjö."
"barryhartigan-1","9","12","16","2 November 2006"," For it's time it's a classic
","The Commiments holds a very unique place in Irish modern movie history. For a start you have to understand that the Dublin that the film was shot in was incredibly bleak in the early '90's. Unemployemt was huge, money was scarce etc. When the film opened in Dublin it was a genuine phenomenon. The biggest cinema in Dublin (The Savoy) showed the picture around the clock on it's opening weekend and it played to pretty much full houses at all shows. I watched, for the 4th time, with a crowd of approx 500 at 6.00am on Sunday and the atmosphere was electric. This was a film we could relate to, it was about us and where we lived. Suffice to say it was a monster hit in Ireland at the time. I was working in the cinema business at the time (managing UCI) and I was lucky enough to be at the premiere. When the cast were introduced one by one the roof lifted. I attended the party where The Commitments (all of them) played in a tiny club on the docks called The Waterfront and to say that was pretty special is an understatement. To this day I'm still friend with Dick Massey (Billy Mooney) and and from to time to time he will remissness about his time with the film. The Commitments only played live together three times, the Dublin premiere, the NY premiere the LA premiere. I saw then in their home town! While the movie is certainly flawed it is still a classic for it's time."
"junymom","10","11","16","27 July 2007"," Awesome Story, Awesome Music, Awesome Movie
","This movie is by far one of the greatest. The music is fantastic. The comedy aspect is hilarious (imagine naming your band And And And...). Giving you a sense of the real black souls of Dublin in the bodies of working class white kids, this movie touches on the good in life, hard in life and just plain humorous side of life. Having a mom obsessed with Elvis Presley brought home great memories and Colm Meaney is the best obsessed fan ever. The soundtrack features song sung by Jimmy Rabbitt himself - you may find his voice annoying during destination anywhere, but man, that boy can sing!! The cast is original, talented and truly believable in their roles. <br/><br/>If you like music and comedy you will LOVE The Commitments!"
"lee_eisenberg","10","10","15","14 February 2007"," committed to greatness
","In what may have been Alan Parker's (happy birthday, Alan!) best movie ever, a gaggle of working-class youths in Dublin decide to form a soul band. It's hard for say which is the movie's best aspect: the look at working-class life in Ireland, or the soundtrack. You feel a little depressed seeing people's lives - as expected, families have more children than anyone cares to count - but also feel like jumping up and dancing as they play their music.<br/><br/>Anyway, ""The Commitments"" is a really great little movie. The great soundtrack, fascinating characters, and other things combine to create something that everyone should see. I guess that any Roddy Doyle novel adapted into a movie starring Colm Meaney is sure to come out masterful (the others were ""The Snapper"" and ""The Van"")."
"agmoldham","6","11","18","22 December 2003"," Great Fun
","A comedy about the rise and fall of a band in Dublin. This film is really funny and energetic, but you'll probably need to like the music to really enjoy it. The Commitments are a rough and ready group of kids that get together with an aging trumpeter Joey 'The Lips' Fagan. I'm not sure whether the cast were singers or actors before the film, but they're certainly pretty good at both during the film. The band plays 'Black' soul and the films set piece concerts make the story fairly zip along. Joey tells stories about all the famous musicians he's played with, but is he telling the truth ? When he arranges for a jam between the Commitments and Wilson Pickett we are going to find out ... or are we ?"
"69-Eddie","10","16","29","3 July 1999"," One of the best movies I saw in 1992

"Howlin Wolf","10","8","13","7 August 2007"," ""It's my pleasure to introduce to you the hardest working band in the world: Yes, yes, yes, THE COMMITMENTS!""
","That's quite a billing, but by the end of the film I can almost guarantee that you'll feel the group have lived up to it. If only they'd managed to hold it together - but then it wouldn't have been poetry...<br/><br/>I can't be anymore blunt and truthful than to say that I adore this film. Right from its visually plain credits, the restless Irish soul music performed entirely by the youthful cast should get your feet tapping. Then Alan Parker takes us to an urban landscape that might be gray, but by God it's bustling. We can relate to Jimmy Rabitte immediately: the youthful entrepreneur who has innate confidence in his own salesmanship, and in his pre-fame existence grants imaginary interviews from the comfort of his bathtub. He's approached to provide guidance for some friends who are struggling to make their mark as musicians. Soon they have a direction and are banding together by applying for more members. A call is sent out far and wide that the Irish brothers are in need of some soul...<br/><br/>Almost every member of the group is memorable and has their own particular idiosyncrasies. There's a palpable sense of adventure as they start out and their potential rapidly expands, because when they're on stage together they click. All of this success is undercut in a typically understated and deadpan example of Irish wit from Jimmy Rabitte Sr. He himself fancies the perks of stardom but isn't brave enough to pursue them, so instead is limited to crooning into a sauce bottle at home. In a very funny film its one of several memorable roles, but this time with a recognisable face playing it: Colm Meaney of ""Star Trek"" and ""Con Air"" fame. He isn't the only 'hidden talent' in the family either - look out for Andrea Corr as Jimmy Jr's younger sister! <br/><br/>Natural performances and earthy humour combined with raw talent make this a winner from start to finish. Please don't miss this, otherwise you'll kick yourself. I'm very tempted to give a good shake to anybody who hasn't seen it yet, myself. It's an absolutely fantastic film!"
"munjak","10","6","9","10 July 2008"," Like a Whole New Movie For Me
","I know this is my second review/comment about The Commitments ( my first one being over four years ago) but I gotta say I just watched it for the first time with the ""closed-captioning"" on, and it's like a whole new movie for me!! I highly recommend this to everyone who's ever watched the movie and I'll guarantee you'll be amazed at what you missed in dialog. As many times as I've watched the movie, I always picked up a little more (dialog-wise) than the previous time. Now I know the whole story & all the background dialog. It's almost like a ""Director's Cut"" or the ""Uncut"" version. Don't knock it till you try it! Still my #1 favorite movie.<br/><br/>On a side note, I'm sure most of you know Glen Hansard, who played ""Outspan"" in the movie won an Academy Award for Best Original Song this year from the movie ""Once"". I bought the movie used at Blockbuster for $5,just on the strength of the box's liner notes. I loved the movie, but had no clue the male lead was ""Outspan"". But the more I looked at his facial expressions, especially his eyes, I kept saying to myself,God, I know this guy! Picked up my Commitments DVD, but no actors names were on the box, so I got my Commitments CD Soundtrack out and sure enough, Glen Hansard's name was listed. If you haven't seen the movie(""Once"")give it a try. It's got some great songs in it( almost all original, written by Glen and his co-star Marketa Irglova) Well, that's enough for me. I'll write some more in another four years. Marty"
"Mack2611","10","7","12","16 April 2003"," Spot the Corrs! (may contain spoilers)
","As the summary says, if you look closely you can see all four members of the Irish band the Corrs as they were in their younger years. As with their current performances, Andrea steals the limelight (she actually HAS lines) but you can find them all.<br/><br/>I should probably also mention that this is one of my all-time favourite films. I grew up being told by my brother that I just had to see this film, and being told by my parents that I was too young (strong language etc.) Then one Christmas I finally saw it, and years later, it's still in my top five.<br/><br/>As a Dubliner, I was really pleased to see an accurate depiction of life here. Of course, certain things have changed in the last decade, but this film is more honest than much of the Hollywood fuelled ""Oirish"" stuff you see in the cinema. There have been debates on whether or not we are really like this like this, telling each other to f**k of at every opportunity. As I said, the film gives an accurate description of real life Ireland, Dublin in particular, although we're not necessarily ALL as angry as the band members. They were stressed. Just thought I'd clear that up.<br/><br/>Robert Arkins plays Jimmy, an unemployed Dub with a vision - to put together the hardest working band in the world. A soul band, called the Commitments. He gets together a bunch of unknown amateur musicians (including an ass of a lead singer - played brilliantly by Andrew Strong, who was amazingly only 17 at the time. His singing voice is just fantastic!) who all crave fame. The band move from woeful rehearsals to pathetic community hall gigs to being just inches from success, but rivalries within the band and the pride of certain members jeopardises everything.<br/><br/>The music is simply fantastic - the soundtrack is an absolute must-have. Their renditions of 'Try a little tenderness', 'Chain of Fools' and others are great. It's a shame that we never actually see Arkins singing in the film, as he does two songs on the soundtrack. His voice, like Andrew Strong, is superb. For whatever reason, if you are having trouble understanding what people are saying (hell, I found it hard sometimes!), I urge you to endure. You won't regret it, especially when the music starts up. Mustang Sally, brothers and sisters!<br/><br/>In all, if you're sick of Irish films that are only about the Troubles, the priests or the green pastures, then the Commitments is for you. And if you still think that 'Far and Away' and 'Darby O'Gill and the Little People' are films about the real Ireland. And if you like really great music and great comedic one-liners.<br/><br/>Also, if you are not yet convinced that admittedly excellent Hollywood actors like Kevin Spacey, Julia Roberts, Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt cannot hold an Irish accent to save their lives, then watch this film.<br/><br/>Or, if you just want to see the Corrs with bad post-80s hair, then watch this. Love the quiff, Jim!"

Some of them would become quite interesting. It's based on the first of novelist Roddy Doyle's lower class Barrytown trilogy. It's heart warming and then sadly inevitable. The portrayal of the Irish lower class is one of loving profanity. The one word I would use is life. This movie is full of life.

It's a good thing I haven't seen the flick for years because I can only remember one detail: the band are going to one of their apartments in a huge, gritty Dublin public housing development. They all squeeze into the failing elevator. At one stop on the way to the top of the building, a kid and a horse get on. When asked what the hell? the kid replies, ""AAH, the stairs'll kill 'um.""

","For Gary who felt that the dialogue was too fast and difficult to understand, may I suggest a weekend in Dublin to help him get to grips with English as it is spoken here? The dialogue, and the speed at which it is spoken, is representative of how people in Dublin speak. If you don't understand it then please don't diss the film on this basis; it's not the fault of the script. As for subtitles, I think a translation might be more use to you!<br/><br/>Other Roddy Doyle books, and their subsequent films, are reflections of the early 1990s in Dublin.

"hall895","8","4","7","21 October 2011"," Dublin soul
","Bring a bunch of destitute Dubliners together to form a soul band. Crazy? No, brilliant. Jimmy Rabbitte is the young man with the dream. He's unemployed (who isn't?) but that's OK because he has the idea, the passion that will change everything. Drawing from the down-and-out youth of Dublin he's going to put together the world's greatest band. And he has just one type of music in mind: soul. Does this make any sense? Not to anybody else. But Jimmy's got the vision. And somehow it all begins to come together. His band, The Commitments, is on its way. But it's not a straight ride to the top. There will be struggles and conflicts and life lessons along the way. But the journey is worth it because, despite all the odds stacked against them, it turns out The Commitments are one heck of a band. Playing their wonderful, unique, rockin' Dublin soul.<br/><br/>It's a great ensemble cast that makes up this movie's band. Robert Arkins plays Jimmy, the guy who brings it all together. And then the musicians do their thing. Never for a moment do you not buy into these performers as a real band. Their acting is fine but it's the music they play that makes the movie shine. Unlike so many other movies of this type almost all the singing and playing is actually done by the actors themselves. And when The Commitments cut loose this movie rocks. Jimmy Rabbitte might take exception to that. It's not rock, it's soul. Whatever it is it's absolutely bursting with energy. And that is thanks largely to one exceptionally talented young man. While everyone in the band plays their role well there's no way around it, Andrew Strong is the star. Unbelievably just 16 years old when the film was made, Strong plays lead singer Deco Cuffe. And he's got the voice of a singing god with the charisma and star power to match. But there's a problem. Deco is a completely insufferable jerk. Everyone else in the band hates him, and rightly so. Deco may well tear this group apart.<br/><br/>The movie follows the band's rise, with all the drama Deco causes threatening a fall before they hit the big time. Which would be a shame because this band is awesome. When first thrown together they understandably make a stuttering start. But once they get their act together they are something to behold. The music they play is fantastic and it makes the movie so much fun. Whether performing a tender ballad or a really rocking number The Commitments hit all the right notes as they run through a soul classics songbook. Try A Little Tenderness and In The Midnight Hour are two obvious highlights but every song really works, not a musical misstep to be found. The music is so great it largely overshadows the rest of the film. The story largely takes a back seat but there are plenty of good moments in between the big musical numbers too. For as good as he is on stage Strong is also excellent portraying the boorish lout Deco offstage as well. Arkins is terrific as band manager Jimmy, holding his band of misfits together. One other standout is Johnny Murphy as Joey 'The Lips' Fagan. He's the wise old hand of the group, a trumpet-playing philosopher who's played with all the greats. Here is a man who appreciates the journey. He also appreciates the opportunity to bed the band's three lovely female backup singers. The band in this movie goes on a magical ride. And lucky us, we get to go along. This movie is a rollicking good time. Dublin soul rocks."

This has some of the greatest soul I've heard in a long time. I constantly play the CD in my car, and watch the DVD at home. Since 1991 I've been hooked! And I'm proud of it!"

","I was sit very bored a hot July afternoon when I turned on the TV & I began to watch a movie. At the beginning, it was a simple cable movie, nothing too relevant. But as the minutes began to pass I was more & more interested in it. It's a great movie, very fun to see. The plot is quite simple: a group of guys that want to start a band, & all the process of formation, development & division of the band, named The Commitments. Also shows the different aspects on the life of this guys, including the manager, who seems to be the protagonist of the movie (Jimmy Rabbitte). There are great performances like Deco Cuffe, the singer, who sings like the angels but behaves in a very arrogant, stupid & childish way ( Is this guy really a pro singer???), Imelda (gorgeous), Joey ""the lips"" (like an old wolf teaching the younger cubs), etc. Also I have to say that in this movie appears, although in a secondary role, one of the most beautiful women I ever saw: Andrea Corr. Andrea, here is one of your humble servants...Can I say I love you? HEHE"

","The Commitments is a hilarious blend of the ups and downs of an emerging soul band in north Dublin, Ireland. It contains fantastic soul selections from some of the giants. The fact that the actors were real musicians made the personal dynamics seem more realistic. The movie also gives a very accurate portrayal of the lives of the young working class of Dublin before the boom of the 90's. Anyone who has ever thought of being in a band should see this movie. And everyone whose been in a band can relate wholeheartedly to the characters, events and melodrama. Overall this is a great movie with a wonderful soundtrack. A must see. (Because of thick Irish accent it should probably be seen more than once)"

","The music makes this a very entertaining film but there are severe drawbacks: at least to people who aren't familiar with the accents or maybe don't approve a the Lord's name in vain or the f-word said every two seconds as the Irish do in this film.<br/><br/>The singers in this film are good, particularly the lead singer who, supposedly, was only 16 years of age when this film was made (but he looks 30). He has a great ""soul"" voice. The story is interesting and there is some good humor in her, too.<br/><br/>The bad news is that it portrays the Irish as extremely profane people who do nothing but scream at each other and tell each other to f-off. That wears thin after awhile. Everyone says this: young and old. One hopes this isn't representative of the entire country.<br/><br/>The movie also has as one of the characters an older trumpet player who is portrayed as a ""religious"" man who wears crosses and says the Lord told him to do this and do that. Hen then proceeds to have sex with every female in the group. Talk about anti-religious cheap shot. Well, that's typical of filmmakers.<br/><br/>In a nutshell: great music, fairly interesting story, but profane, blasphemous and full of scummy people."

","There so much to love about this movie, and I am watching it on television 18 years after I saw it for the first time. In the meantime, I was in a band and could see that there are parallel processes of coming together to make a great sound and dissolving internally due to personality conflicts, artistic differences and egotism.<br/><br/>The story of the Commitments is the story of so many bands. The best they can do is make others happy when they perform, but their personal lives are in ruins and the performers can barely keep it together when the show is over.<br/><br/>The music from the Commitments is one of the great all-time movie albums. The covers they perform of great soul sounds are better than, or at least as good as, the originals. I bought the tape, then later, the CD, which I wore out and replaced.

Its still great today as it was back then. I'm glad no sequels were ever made cause it wouldn't have the same feel. It's actually the only Alan Parker movie I ever liked. Cause Fame sucks. I'm really surprised that none of the actors were able to sustain the success from this movie and branch out into other roles.

"itamarscomix","9","3","5","22 August 2006"," Dublin Soul
","One of the most versatile and promising directors of the '80s, Alan Parker's run of good fortune (Midnight Express, Fame, Pink Floyd The Wall, Birdy, Angel Heart, Mississippi Burning) seemed over when he came out with the mediocre war drama Come See the Paradise in 1990. In 1991, however he had a surprise hit with The Commitments  which was his first comedy since the bizarre Bugsy Malone in 1976. The Commitments was nearer to home than any of his recent films  it was about Dublin, while all of his last dramas were decisively American; it also marked the end of his dealing with war and world-level ethical issues in favor of the small lives of working-class men; and also a return to his love of music, which was prominent in his early films Fame and The Wall.<br/><br/>The Commitments is not a musical though; and to call it a comedy is also difficult. It is hilarious though, as well as touching, and it has as much a sense of rhythm and groove as the great songs within. It's a small film, certainly  especially when compared to melodramatic epics like Mississippi Burning and Angel Heart  a small film about small people, but it's tight, and it's highly enjoyable from start to finish. A wise choice was made in comprising the cast entirely of unknowns (with the exception of the great Colm Meaney in a side-bit as Jimmy Rabbitte's father) and other than Bronagh Gallagher and Angeline Ball none of them had any interest in acting afterward. That makes the characters and the story all the more believable. And that's the main thing that makes The Commitments work so well  it's entirely believable, and the characters are convincing and true to life. They're all very unique characters in a true and human way, and there are no stars to steal the show. The story is believable too, and the ending avoids the clichés of similar British comedy-dramas about working class people in creative fields, which have become so popular in recent years  films like The Full Monty, Billy Elliott and Brassed Off, and manages to be feel-good and yet entirely convincing.<br/><br/>The Commitments is not a major and important film like Mississippi Burning, but to all intents and purposes it's a better one. For anyone who loves soul, blues or funk music it's a must  for any music lover in general, in fact; as well as any lover of English and Irish cinema. Its message may not change the world, but it will stick with you, guaranteed, as will the film. The Commitments is one of the most enjoyable films you'll see, and may be Alan Parker's best creation. An experience not to be missed."

","I ""had"" to watch this film for a college course I am taking (""The History of Rock and Roll"") and I have to say, I enjoyed it immensely. It was a movie I probably would have chosen to watch on my own. The scenes are realistic and the plot is interesting and funny: the band attempting to introduce soul music to Dublin. The characters are witty and endearing, especially Jimmy's dad who idolizes Elvis (""Elvis is GOD!"") and the gritty, urban guys and girls of the band. Another aspect of the movie I loved was, of course, the soundtrack. Finally, I also found the cast exceptional, especially when my teacher mentioned that only Jimmy was an actual professional ""actor"", the rest of the cast was chosen randomly ""off the streets."" This is probably why the movie had a very authentic feel of the Dublin projects."

Robert Arkins is the definition of cool as the lead character, Jimmy Rabbit. I am surprised that he didn't go on to make other films after this one. This is one of those movies that seems to get better and better with each repeated viewing. Bravo to director Alan Parker who keeps the pace of the film quick and entertaining. I also must recommend the special edition DVD that gives an update on where all of ""The Commitments"" are today. I would love to see a sequel or an actual reunion of the Commitments today (since all of the actors in the film were musicians first). I think it could be great."
"burroughs3","10","3","5","20 July 2005"," One of my top ten favorite movies!
","This movie has SOUL! There's something so true and visceral about the music, message and dialogue of this movie. Its music and the hope of moving upward rings true. Growing up in a working class, white, small town America in the Sixites, rock and roll and soul fueled our dreams and youthful ideals. The voices of Elvis, Orbison, James Brown, and Wilson Pickett spoke for us otherwise quiet, shy types. With our bedroom doors closed and our hi-fi's and radios turned on, we became animated by this music. I sung and danced ""in my room"" and became a worldly, brave person. That same passion enabled many of us poor and blue collar kids to move out and up. A quarter century later, the young people in The Commitments are doing the same thing. Finding passion and voices for their dreams. Each time I watch this movie, my energy is rekindled and I am grateful for life's journey."

","It gets better with each viewing. A Dublin friend of mine, a musician, commented that it really hit the nail on the head in terms of capturing the Dublin music scene back then. I kinda liked it initially, and liked it a bit better the 2nd time around. It turned out to be a movie I chose to watch several times over the years. Each time I find some new and charming angle I had somehow overlooked before. A new viewer not up on the Dublin vernacular might miss some of the hilarity. The caption button will help fill in some lines you might otherwise lose.<br/><br/>The cutting is seamless and precise. Parker must have spent a lot of productive time in the editing room.

","What's not to like about The Commitments?  An absolutely brilliant film in terms of story, acting and, last but not least, fantastic music.<br/><br/>Director Alan Parker delivered a wonderful film with an ensemble cast that give outstanding performances.  Ironically, most of these talented actors weren't actors at all, but rather musicians.  Parker took the brave step of casting singers and musicians in the hope that they could act rather than the other way around.  And the gamble pays off brilliantly.<br/><br/>One of the things I like most about The Commitments are the small, non-sequitur moments peppered here and there throughout the film.  Like the boy waiting at an elevator in a highrise tenement holding on to a horse. ""You're not taking that thing in the elevator,"" Jimmy Rabbitte says.  ""Yeah, I have to,"" comes the reply ""The stairs would kill him.""  Like The Snapper, The Commitments is full of real, surreal and beautiful moments.  Mix them together with an outstanding cast and great music and you've got a perfect film."

Most of them are looking for a way out of an apparently pre - ordained future as shelf - stackers or baby factories.Playing Soul gives them a release,however fleetingly,from this promised drudgery. The one grown - up(if you can ever refer to musicians as grown - up)in the band is the trumpeter,a fifty something who has been there,seen it and got the album credits.The others are deeply respectful of his ability and experience . The Commitments improve gig by gig and by the time they appear at the ""Miami""club they are on the verge of securing a record deal and having a shot at the Big Time.But there is to be no fairytale ending. The boys are wildly hormonal,the girls profoundly distrustful.There are petty jealousies and musical differences.As the saxophone player's technique improves he takes on a jazz - like tone.""Jazz is music for w*nkers"",says the band manager dismissively.The drummer leaves because he can't stand the lead singer and they are forced to ""train up"" the local psycho to take his place.The band becomes a disaster waiting to happen and the it implodes after the ""Miami"" gig when a promised appearance by Wilson Pickett fails to take place. Perhaps if they had been older the testosterone would not have flowed so freely,but their sheer energy was a large part of their appeal. So,in a whirlwind of boots,fists and recriminations The Commitments spectacularly self - destruct. But all of them have been changed in a positive way by the music. Their experiences have broadened horizons and raised bars. None of them will ever be the same again. I have deliberately refrained from talking about performances because right across the board they hardly seem like performances at all. That is artifice of the highest order and Mr Parker and his cast are to be congratulated on bringing it off so triumphantly. Finally ""The Commitments""is a movie about the unquenchable human spirit, the refusal to accept the ordinary and the fires lit in adolescence that some of us,if we're lucky,carry through the whole of our lives. Whether it's Percy Sledge,Charlie Parker or Yehudi Menuhin,it's all music and whatever gets you through the night is all that matters."

","Spawning a cult of imitations, and a highly memorable theme tune in ""Mustang Sally"", ""The Commitments"" is written by Ian Le Frenais, Dick Clement and Roddy Doyle, working from Doyle's novel of the same name. Director Alan Parker has worked with this sort of story before, in the film ""Fame"" released 11 years earlier. That film saw kids from bleak, unforgiving backgrounds hotly pursue stardom in downtown New York. So it is here, with a rough-and-ready Irish soul band from working class Dublin.<br/><br/>Local music salesman Jimmy Rabbitte (Robert Arkins) is disenchanted with the local music scene in his home town of Dublin. He decides to reinject some passion and soul into downtown life, and places an ad in the local newspaper saying ""Have You Got Soul? If so the World's Hardest-Working Band is looking for you."" A lot of door-slamming and lousy auditions later, he assembles his soul band. The group includes Decko (Andrew Strong), the pig-headed but gifted lead singer; the mad, veteran trumpet player Joey The Lips (Johnny Murphy), the group's mentor; and Bernie, Imelda and Natalie (Bronagh Gallagher, Angelina Ball and Maria Doyle), the group's feisty backing vocalists. Together, they form 'The Commitments', and set about redefining soul for modern-day Ireland...<br/><br/>In true Parker style, ""The Commitments"" is well shot, and captures the environment perfectly: the downtown skyscrapers, cracked, puddled pavements, run-down tenement blocks and noisy, boozy nightclubs are all filmed with uncompromising realism. The music overall isn't too bad, but ""Mustang Sally"" is the standout. There are few who won't be humming ""Ride, Sally, Ride"" when this movie is over.<br/><br/>The plot is unconventional and thankfully does not fall into the clichéd, against-the-odds success story. Unfortunately the story careens around hopelessly but regains control in time for the ending, which is, as one character puts it, 'poetry'. The script captures the inflections and accent of working class Ireland but contains only one or two memorable lines and even then they're in the mouth of only one character. <br/><br/>This limits the range of depth developed by the acting, which is very good nonetheless. Arkins is very much at home in as Jimmy Babitte, and Johnny Murphy imbues Joey with an earthy, mad relish that is a joy to watch. Bronagh Gallagher, Angelina Ball and Maria Doyle are tough and sexy as the three female singers. The cast also includes ""Star Trek"" actor Colm Meaney as Jimmy's dad, and Andrea Corr (of Irish band 'The Corrs') as Jimmy's sister.<br/><br/>Likable drama, and worth a look."

Furthermore, the film is set in a deprived area, meaning unattractive sets and locations. All these things make the film unattractive to me. It is made worse by the poor lighting.

","I think anyone who has ever attempted to organize and direct a group to achieve success in any artistic activity can appreciate this film.<br/><br/>The thing I found heart-warming about this story was how a group of white teenagers from Dublin seize upon the idea to study 'Black Soul Music' as their route out of the Irish Ghetto and as a ticket to success. The notion is actually the brainchild of Jimmy Rabbitte, and having directed plays in High School and straight out of Community College, I could easily identify with what he was trying to do. He forms this motley crew of singers and musicians; some of whom can barely stand each other, all of whom can't stand the lead singer Deco Cuffe.<br/><br/>Most stories on film will find Blacks emulating the successful actions of White people in order to achieve success in life. Sometimes they would take this too far and to their chagrin receive the censure of their peers for 'trying to act White'. This film was refreshing because you saw white kids intently studying James Brown and Otis Redding and others in order to analyze the dynamics of what makes Soul Music work. All the while with Jimmy Rabbitte exhorting them to ""-say it once and say it loud, I'm black and I'm proud!""<br/><br/>Quite a stretch for teenagers in Dublin and just when you think they've got it down and the flywheel is finally connected to the engine of their emotions and transmitting force; well, you'll see what I mean. I really enjoyed seeing them practice their lyrics while ironing clothes or practicing their moves while hanging the wash on the line. It reminded me of what it is like for working class people to struggle and claw their way up on the path towards a dream. Many of the claustrophobic interior scenes reminded me of places where I visited friends in the Projects and quite frankly, it was a revelation to me that there were White People who lived in Ghetto conditions too. This gave credence to the tagline, 'They started out with nothing, and were ready to risk it all!'. It also explains why they were even ready to grasp at the straw of 'Soul Music' for a leg up if they could get it. This is the burning desire of the poor person to raise him or herself up by any means and comes across as a universal aspiration.<br/><br/>There is also this air of youth blooming into adulthood not quite certain what is out there for them, but ready to explore and try anything. This is the spirit that is the salvation of the Human Race and says, ""-let me try this viewpoint on for awhile and see what its value is for me and what I can take from it to create a personal life expression."" Between Jimmy Rabbitte's pep talks and his father declaring that Elvis is God and two of the female backup singers berating sexy Imelda Quirke for 'prick-teasing' and Joey 'The Lips' Fagan shagging one of the ladies to Barry White or Isaac Hayes, we're happy to be their running buddies as they stroll the streets and alight from the buses of Dublin into their own version of Soul Music.<br/><br/>I found that moment when it seems as though they have risen above the limitations of conflicting personalities and environmental pressures especially elegiac and poignant. There is that moment in the life of many a youth where it seems as though they have grasped the whole world and taken a glimpse of what is possible for them. There is that moment in this film. What was exciting was to see what each of the characters took as a Life Lesson from this particular adventure into Soul Music once the smoke cleared and the dust settled.<br/><br/>When Jimmy Rabbitte speaks to the interviewer from the future about his inevitable success while in the bathtub or while washing his hands and looking into the Restroom mirror, I was reminded of my own attempts to sign on the dotted line the contract with myself for triumph.<br/><br/>'The Commitments' is a great way to find out what it all means."

","They rock. They roll. They're obscene. They're Irish. And it's for these reasons that I love The Commitments. It's about a group of misfits and oddballs who create a band together aptly named The Commitments. They all have personalities as big as their beer mugs (sorry I couldn't resist an Irish stereotype joke) and so it's no surprise to see how this rag tag gang of rambunctious kids operates. But after wading through all the argument and personality clashes, the band discovers they actually have an incredible amount of talent. The movie's sole focus is on the band and it never strays to unnecessary side plots. What side stories there are all come back to the central focus around the band, each story influencing the band's progression throughout the movie. It is incredibly focused and respectfully handled filmmaking, and for that I love it.<br/><br/>The Commitments is extremely fun, yet also a very high quality of film. It's consistent in its pacing, timing, and overall level of energy that never falters. The movie remains at a sharp, witty, and fast paced rate that directly reflects the energy level required to hold this band together. The whole film remains exciting without going over the top. From the opening scene we are drawn in, not to be let go for another two hours. And surprisingly enough, the film is so captivating, yet never gets over-dramatic, and never takes the easy way out in drawing its audience in. It is consistently lighthearted and scene after scene put a bigger smile on my face.<br/><br/>What really makes The Commitments work though, is the characters. The bizarre bunch of people brought together to form this soul rock band are all so expertly written and ridiculously fun characters to watch interact. The band is formed of the strangest grouping of people, the kind you would never expect to have anything to do with each other. You have people like the lead singer, Deco Cuffe (Andrew Strong) who is short tempered and extremely rude and obnoxious to all his band mates. There is the trumpeter of the band, Joey 'The Lips' Fagan (Johnny Murphy) who claims to have played for all the greats (The Beatles, Otis Redding, etc) yet might not have all his screws securely fastened. We have a laid back and easy going guitarist, a stylish and independent saxophone player, and of course the three female backup singers who perform a trifecta of vivacious and snappy beauty. And then of course there's the band manager, Jimmy Rabbitte (Robert Arkins) who is a respectful guy who's only wish is to create great music. Such steadfast and differing personalities make for some of the most exciting and hilarious interactions I've ever seen.<br/><br/>And as icing on the cake, The Commitments has a soundtrack so incredible and so sincere that it almost borough a tear to my eye. Obviously in the movie itself the story plays out that this band is surprisingly incredible and contains a lot of unexpected potential. Yet amazingly enough, this would be true if the band weren't even a movie band. The music in The Commitments is absolutely incredible and the people in this movie can actually play. The highlight is definitely the lead singer who has a voice so rugged and so grand that my jaw practically dropped the first time he started singing. I would have to say that about 30 to 40 minutes of the film is just the band performing and there is nothing wrong with this, other than the fact I would have liked it to be even longer! Unlike certain genres of music that I can really only enjoy in the context of a good film (I'm looking at you country music) I could enjoy the music of The Commitments in any setting and I'm strongly considering buying the soundtrack.<br/><br/>The Commitments was an incredibly enjoyable movie to watch and it is definitely one of those I feel I could watch again and again and never get tired of its greatness. There is something so sincere and so real about this film that just makes it hard not to enjoy. The music is so great but even if it's not your style, I would still highly recommend checking out the film, just for the sake of watching a truly well made movie with a fun plot and exciting characters that make for just a purely great time."

","The most surprising thing about this gem is that the cast have not gone on to film careers. Many of them can hold their own with the overpaid prima donnas we are subjected to ad nauseum in the celebrity magazines and TV shows. Perhaps this film is proof that acting talent is not really necessary in films, it all lies with the director and the film editor! Nevertheless, this film is just hilarious, and can be seen over and over as each viewing reveals something not noticed before. The cast of unknowns is so good that it is hard to pick the best. The most memorable to me was Joe Fagan, who may or may not have been telling the truth about his ""career"". Whether or not he was, he was spinning the line that everyone wanted to hear. There are so many brilliant cameos in this film that it is hard to single out anyone in particular, or the visual touches, such as the picture of the Pope on the wall of the Rabitte household, with Elvis' picture above. I loved also the depiction of the street markets and the clubs. I have this film on VHS and often show it to friends, but now I want the DVD with the ""extras"". Now if only the DVD's also came with a copy of the book from which the film was made, that would be something!"

","Alan Parker does it again! Boasting a canon of varied but always high-quality work (Midnight Express, Fame, Mississippi Burning, The Wall),this man, it seems, can't go wrong. The music is, of course, superb. That Parker managed to get together such a bunch of talented unknowns and had them working well enough to launch a number of chart hits is part of his genius.The other part is sheer storytelling ability. Humor abounds  in the film,perhaps a typically Ulsterian brand (""You're working class,aren't you"",one member is asked.""We would be if there was any work"",he replies). There's also some pathos to balance this and,perhaps,a small lesson on the perils of booze,sex & rock'n'roll.

","""The Commitments"" burst on to the scene in 1991 and immediately garnered much critical acclaim. It was nominated for an Oscar for Best Editing, but it was the music that would make it the film that it is. The soundtrack went on to sell millions and achieved triple-platinum status. Set in recession-stricken Dublin in the late 1980s, Jimmy Rabbitte is a young unemployed man who wheels-and-deals and dreams of music stardom. He has a strong passion for soul music and when he puts an ad in the paper for musicians to audition for the band he wants to put together and manage, he attracts a wide variety of nutjobs and pure talent. He assembles a line-up, and they hit the stages around working-class Dublin. They become a hit in no time, and with whispers of deals and contracts only down the line, and with Wilson Pickett himself rumoured to be lined up to play with the band while he is in Dublin, all that is going to hold this motley crew back is their hatred of each other.<br/><br/>""The Commitments"" is a funny and unique film in that the rags-to-riches tale is turned upside down and we are left with a rather sad ending that evokes, as much of the rest of the film does, real life. There is nothing glamorous here, and director Alan Parker hammers it home by filling the movie with dreary, rain-drenched shots of social poverty and ruin. Choosing to film with subdued lighting also helped, as the film always appears to be in darkness. The characters are rough and very talented and they range from the mysterious and sleazy Joey ""The Lips"" Fagan - who may or may not be what he says he is - to the films finest attribute, the voice of Andrew Strong, who has to be the oldest looking teenager to ever appear on film. He was only about seventeen in this, but he looks and sounds thirty, at least. But what a voice. The rest of the cast are very good, and it is hard to believe that none of them went on to do much else after this - film-wise anyway. Robert Arkins who plays Jimmy vanished into obscurity in the years that followed. Andrew Strong never became as big as he should have. Glen Hansard, however, did go on to become a household name for his band and for the 2007 film ""Once"". Far from a masterpiece - its humour is dependent on Roddy Doyle's writing where we have a bunch of young Irish men and women roaring abuse at one another in between some fantastic musical performances - it nevertheless carries a strong personality and is a credit to the music that it celebrates, and to Irish life and the era it comes from."
"eric262003","9","0","0","8 December 2019"," Ireland May Have Changed But The Music Lives Is Still Valid
","It's been 28 Years since Alan Parker directed the 1991 film ""The Commitments"" and though Ireland has went through a major makeover in the last three decades, the music featured here has never lost its step. Based off of a novel by Roddy Doyle as part of his Barrytown Trilogy series about a folk band who's rise to fame was very short-lived, but the impact it had on the band member's lives was eternal. Much like the cobbling together a group is in similar fashion to Parker's other film ""Fame"", ""The Commitments"" looks into youth who live in destitute who have no music education program provided to them, so in order to make a name for themselves, they have to do all of this on their own, which is a very inspiring and satisfying movie.<br/><br/>Set in Dublin, Ireland in the late 1980's , we are introduced to Jimmy Rabbitte (Robert Arkins) as an aspiring talent agent who has a dream. Though fearing doubt from his Elvis loving father Jimmy Sr. (Colm Meaney), Jimmy sets out on journey to audition a band of musicians to play soul music inspired by the likes of Aretha Franklin, Wilson Pickett and Otis Redding. With this new band, Jimmy hopes this band will become the next big breakout group this side of Emerson Isle.<br/><br/>Under the name ""The Commitments"", Jimmy's first acquisition is an older trumpet player named Joey ""the Lips"" Fagan (Johnny Murphy) who claims to have jammed with soul performers back in the 1960's, though it's questionable if he really did or if he's just looking for opportunity. Either way he is fond of Jimmy's dream and wants in feeling this is an essential calling for a long-awaited comeback. He would be the band's team leader.<br/><br/>As time goes on, other band members pass the auditions each bring their musical traits with them while all the members have diverse characterizations to keep the film rolling. As the band's lead singer is Deco Cuffe (Andrew Strong) is an enigma of character due to his high ego, uncouth mannerisms that are a turnoff towards the other band members but his vibrant singing pipes make up for all of his shortcomings. On drums we have Billy (Dick Massey) who's drums were obtained from a pawn shop. On bass there's Derek (Kenneth McCluskey) who practices during his free time when working at the slaughterhouse. On saxophone there's Dean (Felim Gromley) who has more interest in jazz than in soul. The group's guitarist Outspan Foster (Glen Hansard of the group Once) joins the fray. Finally we have keyboard player Steve (Michael Aherne) who performs the organ at the local church and has great fondness for Procol Harum. In addition to them, Jimmy hires three lady singers to provide backup for the group. They are Bernie (Bronagh Gallagher), Natalie (Maria Doyle) and Imelda (Angelina Ball) who everyone in the band seems to be attracted to the most.<br/><br/>The movie focuses in the immediate success of the band and also embodies the grave reality that all good things don't last forever. From the clunky rehearsals in the pool hall attic to the wowing of the fans in local pubs and nightclubs to the sad breakup due to personal reasons, massive egos, and bitter lack of co-existing from fellow band members. It shows that even though making a band looks easy at first glance is much harder to maintain. Aside from the musical standpoint of this movie, the audience gets a tour of the squalor conditions the musicians lived where their hopes and dreams were tarnished due the economic collapse back then. But performing as The Commitments, the singers and musicians have been offered something they never had before which was confidence. Through their confidence, they now can look back on their experiences as a way to guide them through whatever endeavors they wish to pursue in life. Aside from the musical performances and the dramas each individual are facing, there is some comedic moments in this movie as well. From Deco's erratic mannerisms to Jimmy's begging for favours, to the handling of their bouncer (Dave Finnegan) who Jimmy hires and later become the groups drummer, and Joey's fondling with the girl backup singers.<br/><br/>According to Alan Parker during an interview featured on the Blu-ray, he spent weeks looking for local talent to audition for his movie, which is amusingly similar to the scenes where Jimmy is listening in on the various genres of music each band member plays during his auditions. The musicians portrayed here may have had some musical experience, but a lot of them were first time actors, with the exception of Johnny Murphy who needed private lesson to play the trumpet. With combined singing and music to the tracks, Parker was able to successfully cover such soul classics like ""Mustang Sally"", ""Try a Little Tenderness"", and ""Chain of Fools"". In fact the sounds were so good, they eventually were made into a two albums that came out in 1991. When award season came up, Gary Hambling was nominated for Best Editing in a movie. This falls in the category of a great underdog story of ragtag destitute musicians finding their way through their doldrums in gaining the gift of confidence that was never given to them before. They pushed the boundaries they never thought they had and made something of themselves. Sure they're no Van Morrison, but the're no longer pathetic chumps.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of soul music, you might find this movie ""The Commitments"" will hold a special place in your heart. The film succeeds in keeping the music real, the characters believable and the locations real. In the end you will sing your hearts out."

"bbewnylorac","9","0","0","22 November 2017"," A wonderful film
","One of Alan Parker's strengths is capturing young unknown actors performing music. Another is portraying everyday people's stories in an exciting way. And I guess, because they're not big-time actors, the acting in roles in The Commitments has an unforced, fresh appeal. Dublin's grey tones and the locals' dry wit is used to great effect - for example, a drab train is used as an exciting vehicle, for the soul song Destination Anywhere. Parker is good at trusting that the grittiness of each location, be it a shopping mall or a suburban back yard or a chip van, can be lyrical - many Hollywood directors would have to glam it up, and create something artificial. He also is not afraid to show how terribly people can stuff up their own opportunities. Here is an immensely talented and energetic group of young people, yet they throw it away because they can't get along. There is no cute ending, and I really like that. For me the spirit of this film is summed up by the veteran muso character Johnny Murphy's assurance to Jimmy Rabbite towards the end of the film, after the blues band Jimmy founded, The Commitments, has fallen apart due to in-fighting. ""You raised their expectations of life!"" says Johnny. He's saying that Jimmy's mad dream - to create a smash hit soul music band from a ragtag band of poor Dubliners - was worth pursuing, even though it failed. Young people - who otherwise would have gone on to be buskers, or bus drivers or be unemployed - now have a whole other world opened up for them. It sounds corny, but that's what music can do. Or if not music, then someone who gets young people involve in a big project, that allows their individual talents to shine."

","Alan Parker is a generous filmmaker, in the sense that he allows himself to merge into the fabric of his themes, to allow the film to have its own life. That's something i wouldn't appreciate in Kar Wai or Welles, whose personal way to bend stories is the very reason why i go to their films. But Parker seems to have his biggest strength in understanding what the film needs, and allowing it to breath. That's a great quality.<br/><br/>Here he tackles soul music appropriated by irish workers, and Dublin, as tokens for the irish spirit. <br/><br/>The mere quality and expression in the execution of the songs justifies the cult this film as grown around it since it came out. The music is not original, everything we hear are covers of songs for the masters of soul, but the interpretations are so engaging that you can hardly not be driven by them. It worked so well, that a band composed by several actors from this film, performing under the name of the band in the film still has a career today, still performs live gigs. <br/><br/>Among all the good things there is to say about the musical performances, i'll mention the lead singer's face. Andrew Strong's voice delivers all the passion necessary for these songs to work. But his face, apparently so unappealing, forms a series of otherworld expressions, shapes, painful phrases coming out of some upper fantastic world. Parker understood it, and that's why he frames it so often when he sings, in close-up. He engages us in ways hard to understand. <br/><br/>Of course than we have a funny plot that surrounds the musical moments, but that's a mere support. The music is the main character, not the supporting bits to a central story.<br/><br/>Irish jokes and the black soul of America. That has proved a powerful mix. This film deserves credit, it's a fine moment.<br/><br/>My opinion: 4/5<br/><br/>http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com"

","The Commitments is an entertaining and very good movie about a man who wants to start an Irish soul band. He eventually recruits a full band with back-up singers that is pretty good. It shows their formation and overcoming obstacles and petty jealousies only to fall apart as they are about to possibly hit the big time. While the story sounds like a kind of tragedy it is well done, entertaining, funny,  and very different. Colm Meaney is excellent as the father of the band manager Jimmy Rabbite, who idolized Elvis even above the Pope and possible even with God.The band is filled with characters ranging from boars, nitpickers, hotheads,bitchy attitudes and just average people who love music. The most heartwarming part of the whole movie was where they were riding the bus and all singing Destination Anywhere. They were never closer, except for a few times on stage as a band.Even the lead singer wanted to hog the spotlight and become an even bigger prick than he was. The whole cast as well as the story was excellent. This has to be one of the better movie soundtracks to come out of a movie ever.As it is, this movie is worth just a look for the music alone.

"luisab99","Null","1","2","9 October 2001"," Music to escape from a narrow world
","The simple plot of this movie ( the rise to success of a group of Dublin working-class soul musicians, and their consequent decline, owing to petty, trivial inner quarrels) is just a pretext for a vivid, effective picture of Dublin life. The outlook on that part of society aims mainly to explore the wish, among the young generations, to escape from a narrow-minded world, from squalid urban suburbs, from unemployment, from a reality which has nothing to offer them: lacking any prospects for the future, young people own low expectations and narrow horizons (Joey's final sentence to Jimmy summarizes efficaciously this mood: ""the success of the band was irrelevantyou raised their expectations, you lifted their horizonsthis is poetry""). The forced urbanization, in a country of rural traditions, has produced paradoxical effects: a little boy tries insistently to enter a horse in a lift; the music critic (who also writes crime news) is met while reporting an accident occurred to another horse in the road traffic. Parents are unsympathetic as they have different values (on the wall in Jimmy's home there are pictures of Elvis Presley and  Pope Giovanni XXIII), or they are simply struggling to get by (Bernie's mother). The heavy influence of the Catholic Church is shown throughout all the movie: Steven practises on the organ of the Church; the first gig of the group is in the Church Community Centre; sacred images, processions, confessionals, recur in the scenes underlining the constant presence of religion in people's daily life. Another feature which is pointed out is the young people's moral behaviour: an unexpected moralism lurks among boys that do their best to be ""transgressive"" but run into gossip and heavy malignity when a girl seems to be involved in a love affair (Bernie with Joey, or Imelda seen on Joey's motor-cycle). Pregnancy, however, seems to be the obvious cause of great part of marriages: both Imelda's sister's wedding, which opens the film, and the one of Imelda herself, in the end, happen for this reason; at her sister's wedding party, at the sentence: ""I suppose you'll be next"" she answers ""I'm not pregnant"". Not yet. Dangers such drug and street violence are taken into account too, but are developed in a non-dramatic way, with an ironical outlook, in the characters of Duffy, the drug-dealer who also rents music gear, probably stolen, and of Mickah Wallace ""the savage"" who loves fighting in the street, but fears the reproach of his friends' mothers. To be recommended to teachers dealing with Ireland present life: it's better than a textbook."

The story is simple but its the dialogue and the acting that make it so great, (not to mention the soundtrack).  Parker assebled a group of unknowns (Excluding Colm Meaney as Jimmy's Elvis worshiping dad) and when he finished he had a dynamite band that also prove to be able actors as well.  The band is a diverse group of people and their escapades throughout the film are heartfelt yet laughable at times.  Standout performances go to Robert Arkins (""Brother Rabitte""), Johnny Murphy (""Joey The Lips""...and the band's spiritual guide), and Andrew Strong whose incredible voice fronts the band (its hard to believe that voice belongs to a 16 year old).  Strong is essentially a younger Joe Cocker.  The film is never boring, the music is fantasic and the cinematography and direction are excellent.  All in all ""The Commitments"" is is one of those films that you can watch over and over again and not get tired of.  Its just a whole lot of fun.<br/><br/>

"zman-20","9","1","2","7 November 1999"," One of my personal favourites
","I'm not sure how many times I've watched this movie since I first saw it in 1994, but I watched it again tonight and it was as fresh as it ever was when I first saw it. It's one of those movies that I can watch over and over again without tiring. I can guarantee you that I'll watch this many more times.<br/><br/>One reason is obviously the fine directing of Alan Parker. As with ""Mississippi Burning"" and his other films, he has done a wonderful job. But what makes this effort even better than his other films is the fine casting of virtual unknowns. The characters, each and everyone of them, was very genuine and believable. Andrew Strong is simply amazing. The cast did a great job of drawing me into the story, and of course a lot of credit has to go the writing, it was absolutely wonderful.<br/><br/>Technically, the film was extraordinary. The Dublin photography was impressive, and the editing was equally as fine. The pace was good, I never grew bored during the movie. Some have criticised the ""live"" concert footage, but considering the locations the band played, it was a perfect fit for the film.<br/><br/>It goes without saying the music is the focal point here, and it simply left me slack-jawed. They say you can't wear out a CD. I don't know about that; I'm on my third copy. Oddly enough, after so many viewings, I pick up on something new every time.<br/><br/>If there is one video that everyone needs in their collection, The Commitments must surely be considered. 10 out of 10 stars."

","This movie, the first of three based on novels by and written by Roddy Doyle, is a hilarious look at one man's attempt to make the ""hardest working band in Ireland.""  Following Jimmy Rabbitte, perfectly played by Robert Arkins, and his earnest attempt at creating the next big deal, the film catches the ups and downs of these 11 Dubliners and the surprisingly great band they form.    The musical performances are wonderful and do an honor to the history of soul, and are by the actors themselves, a bonus to their appropriate performances.  Directed by Alan Parker, whose work with previous musical films, namely Fame, certainly helps here.  The writing is certainly not for kids, and might offend a few, but odds are they wouldn't pick this movie anyway.  Definitely the lightest of the three films written by Doyle (The Snapper and The Van completing the quasi-trilogy), odds are everyone will find something to like about this flick (or at least they should). I'm still waiting for Arkins and Andrew Young to show up in another film.  Also watch for a hilarious performance by Johnny Murphy as Joey the Lips, and a subtle performance by Maria Doyle Kennedy that keeps things going in the right direction.  If you haven't seen it yet, go watch this movie to put yourself in a good mood.  If you have seen it, go watch it again."

However, I was unable to give The Commitments more than a 5 out of 10. My main problem with the film was the rapid fire, unintelligible dialogue. I stopped rewinding and replaying once I realized that, ***SPOILERS AHEAD** if their voices were low they were imagining how soul music would change their lives (yeah, right), or if it was loud it was the band members about get into another fight. Do Irish people really treat each other that way? The exchange of dialogue between the actors was also so rapid as to be unbelievable. The unfolding of the story and the characters were hard for me to believe, too. ""Hey, I've been unemployed for 3 years, but I suddenly have a clear vision of exactly what kind of band to put together, and the motivation to do so!"" Then, ""Hey, here's this veteran musician that has nothing to do but answer a newspaper ad, and will join us and show us the ropes""! Then ""We'll practice awhile, then sound great!"" Bloooody s***e, anya upinya bullocks, fookin deadly s***e. Aye. Not trying to be a jerk, but this film looked like it was written in a day and filmed in a week.

","I remember well the (MTV) hype surrounding TC. One would have thought that Jesus wrote and directed this movie, the way it was pushed by the media, the video clip having been played incessantly by every music programme/channel. Fact is, it's a decent little movie, but absolutely nothing special - especially if you get headaches, the way I do, when exposed to more than 3 seconds of so-called ""soul"" music. (Is it called that way because it kills the soul?)<br/><br/>There are obvious similarities to Parker's earlier ""Fame"". The one that sticks out the most is how adamant Parker must have been in picking out an ugly bunch (with very few exceptions) once again. (It's the old ""ugly people = realism"" credo.) Still, no need to panic: the cast of TC is not nearly as visually unappealing as the one in ""Fame"". However, unlike ""Fame"", which gets serious occasionally, this Irish-based rags-to-almost-riches story can be classified as a comedy. A comedy musical, alas. The second half features far too many musical numbers, and they drag on for too long. As I said, ""soul"" can be rather migraine-inducing; it is rather simplistic, unimaginative, lowest-common-denominator music, designed to please the true tone-deaf non-connoisseurs among music fans. Andrew Strong may have a great voice for this dull style, but whenever a (white) guy tries to imitate the annoying throat-barks of James Brown, or that overrated bore Joe Cocker, I am overcome with an urge to throw things at whatever the source of the sound may be. Strong is also the funniest cast member.<br/><br/>If it's true that Parker picked out only non-actors for the band, then hats off to him, because there is nothing wrong with the acting; there is very little to indicate that all these people were amateurs. That, naturally, also brings us to the distinct possibility that basically anyone can act - given the right director. The bleedin' obvious, of course...<br/><br/>There aren't any true laugh-out-loud moments, but the gags don't totally bomb, either. TC is basically interesting rather than funny.<br/><br/>One of the things I liked is that musicians and singers are portrayed as the true morons they (mostly) are in real life.<br/><br/>As far as Bronagh is concerned: if you've never seen her, just try to visualize the name ""BRONAGH"" and you might come close to imagining her face. It's no wonder Lucas had her killed off within minutes of the start of ""Phantom Menace"".<br/><br/>Why is one of the Corr sisters in the movie, but without a singing part?"
"Irishchatter","6","1","3","11 June 2017"," Music= brilliant Movie= needed to be a lot better
","I never heard or ever seen an Irish movie like ""The Commitments"" that is based on soul music and getting a band as if it were the Blues Brothers (which is way better I'm afraid). I absolutely loved the music, that was what kept me watching this movie, but I think it would been a lot better if there wasn't any involvement with the whole group bickering the whole time and then breaking up because of it. It kinda made the movie itself more distasteful in my opinion like c'mon not all of us Irish like to be snobs and on top of each other! I thought they made Andrew Strong's character a sleaze bag and like, it didn't really suit his role to be a doofus, I prefer if he was more of a chilled and hippie like person yknow. He was brilliant at the same time with singing like a legend, its too bad he didn't make a big career out of it!<br/><br/>I'm afraid I have to give this movie a 6/10, I think the storyline and the character of Strong's characterization would need TLC here even if this was based in a novel!"

","I have to say, I started off watching The Commitments in a bad mood. I don't know why... maybe it's because of the really dumb comments my film teacher had made about it (he was showing to to the class). He said 'its a film everyone likes, just like Amelie'. It didn't help that I disliked Amelie... A LOT. So I had already started seeing this with low expectations, but it eventually grew on me, and I gave into its charm. The wonderful, BRILLIANT music had me falling for it, and the realism it had while they played. I wouldn't say this film is incredible, but the music made it work completely. I just hope my film teacher stops saying dumb comments about how 'everyone' loves it. Now, where can I get the soundtrack?"
"Dr_Coulardeau","Null","1","3","6 October 2011"," The film has slightly aged
","At the time when it came out it was the story not so far away of the attempt to import soul music into Ireland and make Ireland the Soul of Europe, I mean the Negro of Europe singing soul music to the proletarians. Today it has aged and it has become some kind of a rather nostalgic recollection of what things were back then when Ireland was not yet in anyway the Celtic Tiger it has become in the meantime.<br/><br/>But the film has kept some depth about life and young people. For one young people, and in this case the main front musicians and vocalists, cannot succeed if they do not find some older more experienced people to help them find a vision, a path, an inspiration that makes them encounter the superior layers of their souls.<br/><br/>The second lesson is that no one can go anywhere if they don't have a clear vision of what they want to do and where they want to go. They may be confused, not clear enough, follow the wrong star and change stars and directions several times before finding they way, but if they are inspired along the way they will find the path that leads to their realizing the deepest desires of theirs.<br/><br/>But the film is sad because in the end it is the story of a failure since the group that is being built meets with success and as soon as they meet with that local success they become aggressive, violent to one another as if each one of them wanted to be the main star, as if the Milky Way only had one star. It is even painful to see how they come close to something and then reject it for plain selfish reasons.<br/><br/>The last words of the older trumpet player do not make up for that failure? Each one of them has been lifted to a higher level of consciousness and will go on looking for a way to realize that expectation of theirs? That might be true for one, or two out of the whole lot but the others only step back into banal humdrum routine because they have learned very little from the experience that will remain for them a sorry experiment."

Jimmy Rabbitte comes along and gathers them all together to form a soul band, which gives them ""something to look forward to."" I think that the two funniest characters in the entire film are Joey ""the lips"", and Jimmy Rabbite Sr. (Colm Meaney). Joey comes along to play the trumpet for the band and he presents himself as some type of mentor who claims to have jammed with all of the greats. At the end of the film, you still don't quite understand what this man was about, which is very funny. Jimmy Sr. is the father of the band's manager, Jimmy Jr., and he's obsessed with the late Elvis Presley. As he says, ""Elvis is God!""

","A couple of working class kids in Dublin decide to put together a band that mirrors the soul music of the USA in the 1960s. Not the Beatles, not Elvis, but do-wop and Motown. ""The Irish are the blacks of Europe. Dubliners are the blacks of Ireland. And North Enders are the blacks of Dublin!"" As they audition other young semi-hoods of varying talents, I kept thinking of what a curious diffusionary path this musical style -- with its African rhythms and call-and-response technique -- had taken: from West Africa, on slave ships to the Southern US, morphed into Christian gospel music, adapted by Detroit, and back across the ocean to Dublin.<br/><br/>It's not a style I groove to. The three young ladies who are backup singers are, by and large, okay, but the lead singers screeches and shouts and weeps with simulated transport. The sidemen on alto sax and trumpet are kewl, however, although one chides the other for spiralling -- ""That's JAZZ."" It's a movie that elicits smiles rather than laughter. The young folks are all pretty quirky and have problems dealing with unemployment and baby sitting. There's an almost constant use of a word pronounced ""fook"" or ""fewk,"" which I take to be some kind of Dublin slang, possibly relating to fish and chips.<br/><br/>And there ARE a number of smiles in it. They watch tapes of performances by one of their heroes, James Brown, who does his emoting on stage, then falls to the floor after one particularly strenuous number, as if knee-capped. Aides rush to him, help him to his feet and guide him off stage. ""Fluke!"", says one of the kids, ""Oi'd bust me knees!"" Another assures him, ""It's all part of the ACT."" If you enjoyed ""The Full Monte,"" which appeared six years later, you'll get a kick out of this. Also if you grew up during the Motown era."

","Alan Parkers masterpiece mixes superb acting performances from a largely unknown, but talented cast,(notable exception being Colm Meaney of Star trek and Con Air fame) with a soundtrack that will be in the viewers psyche long after the final credits roll. The Commitments is unique in its subject matter, set against the urban backdrop of Dublin in the 90s, it follows the trials and tribulations of some of the city's more colourful characters, and the efforts of one Jimmy Rabbit (Robert Arkin) to escape the life of monotony by forming and managing a band with ""soul"". Whilst the synopsis might not sound anything extraordinary, the results are truly comical, especially when he auditions for band members. The resultant throng encompasses every musical taste (or lack of it) including one Boy George look alike, and a guy who thought the queue he was in, was to buy drugs. The scriptwriting is right at the top end of the scale, with the cast and crew deserving full marks in breathing life into the characters that make this heartwarming film sparkle. The genius of this film is very subtle, and its clear that a lot of homework was done researching the project before a frame of film was shot. The Commitments is peppered with great one liners, and scene after scene show snapshots of Irish people and their ""real"" lives. There are too many to mention here, but amongst my favourites are the scene where a young lad is standing in a tower-block basement, waiting for the lift with a large horse. When Jimmy Rabbit (who is visiting Bernie the backup singer) exclaims ""your not taking that horse into the lift?"", the lad replies "" I'll have to , the stairs will kill him"" -if you have ever been to Dublin and seen the horses grazing by the roadside, and on every bit of green, you will know that this is not beyond possibility, a fact that makes the scene all the more comical. Another is the band auditions mentioned earlier,and Mr Rabbits (Colm Meaney)obsession with Elvis. The viewer gets a real affinity for the characters right from the outset, and I defy anyone to sit and watch this film without cheering the Commitments on. The musical performances are quite simply superb, and as a band they really deliver the goods, making this a film that you could watch for the musical aspect alone.The directing is slick, the acting is gritty,and so believable by every single cast member, that I could never visit Dublin without looking for Outspan & Derek busking in Grafton Street.

I've played in dozens of bands starting with The ""Doo Wop"" vocal groups in the Bronx to the circuit of church halls we played in New Zealand prior to a club opening up in 1964 where you could have a real stage and lights (such as they were) Anyone who is even thinking of joining a band should see this movie. Anyone who wants to have a real good time and meet some great people should see this movie. ""Long live The Commitments"""

","Speaking as someone who has friends/acquaintances in a couple of bands, and other friends who publish a local music magazine and/or run an independent CD label, i can't say enough good things about the accuracy(and sympathy) with which this film portrays such people.<br/><br/>The fact that the musicians are portrayed by actual musicians, rather than the producers having hired actors and taught them to fake it, is so unusual for films that it took me a while to realise that the performances were actual, filmed-on-the-fly performances, and not miming to pre-recorded tracks.<br/><br/>The various members of The Commitments see the band as a way out of the horrible socio-economic conditions in which they find themselves (""Mr. Rabbitte, you've been drawing unemployment for three years; are you *sure* you can't find a job?"" ""Let's face it, Missus, we're living in a third-world country..."").  The scene in which the normally-sardonic Bernie, seen in the tiny apartment she shares with three generations of her family, breaks down and pleads with Jimmie not to kick her out of the band because she's had to be absent, caring for her sister's child, confessing that she sees no other way out, is both telling and poignant.<br/><br/>A line from another film -- ""O Lucky Man!"" -- always comes to mind when i watch ""The Commitments""; when Mick Travis [Malcolm MacDowell] meets Alan Price and his band he says ""Musicians -- are you rich, then?"" and Price replies ""No -- but me manager is..."" Poor Jimmie Rabbitte doesn't even manage to get rich as a manager (though the Afterword-type scenes imply he's doing fairly well); he's too devoted to the music to really sell (and sell out) his friends the musicians.<br/><br/>As another reviewer has said; this is one film (and associated soundtrack CD) that belong in the collection of anyone with the slightest interest in music, even if you don't -- normally -- go for soul music.<br/><br/>I need to hunt up the DVD; all i have so far is the VHS.<br/><br/>Five out of Five -- or Ten out of Ten -- or whatever"

","Ah, after many years I eventually managed to watch this movie, and I must say it didn't disappoint me at all. It's really great! There are all the elements: the group of friends without a dime in desperate search for emergence, the guy with a Mission, the atmosphere of Dublin, the great music performed and a well dosed humour that makes the movie very pleasant. ...and I love that Irish accent!  ;)"
"JimMackrell","10","0","1","29 January 2002"," One of the best films not starring John Wayne I've ever seen.
","The Dublin setting is great.  The characters are perfectly cast.  The music is amazing.  The auditions are hilarious.  The more I watch, the more I like.  It is no wonder the tape and DVD are tough to get hold of.  It's a cult film that anyone, but particularly British Ex-Pats, would love.  A bit strong on the language.  Long live Joey The Lips."

","This is probably the best music-related movie I've ever seen. I can't say anything bad about it. The acting is superb, staying away from cliches, the soundtrack is very good and the story, pace and direction are great as well.<br/><br/>Warning! - There might be spoilers.<br/><br/>The Commitments is one of those movies you can see over and over again without getting tired of it. One of the best aspects (if not the best) is how realistic the storyline is. The process of putting a band together results complicated for Jimmy, there are rows between some of the band members and, when they finally seem to have managed to get over all obstacles, their first gig  goes wrong because of an electricity-related accident. Later on jealousy and animosity surface again, causing the band to split up. The scene when Jimmy is walking alone at night and a car with Wilson Pickett in (He was supposed to attend their gig) passes by is so cool. Yes, the finale is not the classic happy ending we are used to, so what?<br/><br/>To sum up, an awesome movie from beginning to end.<br/><br/>10/10."

","A relatively simple tale of young people trying to be musicians and how they nearly made it in the city of Dublin turns out a great movie about friendship and the missteps of life. Aided by convincing actors and a very funny script, the premise of soul music played by white people and the obsession of young Jimmy Rabbite to manage a band which fits these parameters is a treat which never wears out, due to a voluntary lack of pretensions from the whole producing team. Made with the simplest budget, shot in the simplest way possible, the films turns out quite surprising, as it really leaves a mark in its viewer with a clever and very good-tasted use of soul music and the powerful voice of Andrew Strong. Johnny Murphy as Joey ""the lips"" Fagan is also a find, and pushes the film forward as well as Robert Arkins' central character. An achievement, this one leaves you actually wanting to view it a second time. Great work on all departments, due in great part to a self-containment policy from the director. A funny film, which stands out from the rest."

","When I read about a sequel of 'The Commitments', I was getting interested in the first movie. So here I am, talking about one of those unforgettable experiences in your life. The music is great but the movie itself rules! If you have trouble understanding people who speak with a genuine Irish accent, you're probably thinking it wasn't that great after all. But that's not the point. <br/><br/>There are so many nice things to say about 'The Commitments' that I can't figure out where to start. All right, it's a funny movie, because of many things, but I'm not going to say more. You know now that you HAVE to SEE 'The Commitments'. Don't just say the second movie is good enough! Most of the cast was superb. Can't say who, because the list would seem endless. Uh, that's it! 10/10"

","Alan Parker worked miracles with a group of (largely) young non-actors. The joy and fun of this movie is palpable, but it's not a fairy-tale. The band's travails end in tears, but the final scenes are perfect, the soundtrack's wonderful. I can't say enough about this picture. Despite the grit and grot, I wanted to fly Aer Lingus to Dublin the minute the movie was over, to sup Guinness and have some talkative Irish fellow tell me about his band that soared and flopped..."

","Just looking over the movie several times,and find a fresh group of music enjoying with Soul, Guinnes, Irish are the black of Europe...I love these quotes, as well as the lyrics, I miss two of them:too many fish in the sea, and I never loved a man. So, anyone who wants to exchange lyrics with me, feel free to write me and I love Irish atmosphere:-)<br/><br/>Carlos (Salamanca, Spain)"
