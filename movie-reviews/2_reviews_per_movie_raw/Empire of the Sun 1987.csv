","This is the first time I commented on a film. I saw this yesterday night for the first time. And I just cried.<br/><br/>I cried for Jim. I cried for the pain our country caused in the innocent civilians. (Japan can be so stupid!) I cried for the pilots of the Zero-sen.<br/><br/>I've read and seen lots of movies of these pilots. They're called tokoutai in Japanese. They get on their planes knowing they will die. It's a suicide mission, and they were very proud of it. I know if you're on the winning side you may not sympathize these pilots, but they were just fighting for their country. In those days, the emperor was everything. They taught you to die for the emperor at school when you were only in 1st grade.<br/><br/>But I don't know the war. I've never experienced it. I can't understand the concept of dying for your emperor. So I sympathise with Jim. Jim is a symbol. A symbol of innocence, of the horrors of war. His singing proves that too. He's also the ray of light for these prisoners. His energy and vitality are important aspects. It brings out some human characteristics in the sergent as well.<br/><br/>Christian Bale was remarkable. He should be commemorated or something for this performance, cause it was just brilliant. So was John Malcovich.<br/><br/>Overall it was great. One of the best movies I ever saw. It made me think, a lot. About war, about Japan, about history, and about humans in general."

","I had put off watching this until recently, I do not know why, I had not read reviews and for some reason imagined it to be a movie about a young Japanese prince(!!).<br/><br/>I was captivated by the performance of Christian Bale as a privileged young boy named Jim Graham, growing up in Shanghai, very far removed from the poverty and despair all around him. When war breaks out, this changes him forever and hence the story.<br/><br/>After some harrowing experiences he winds up in a prisoner of war camp where he befriends some interesting characters and quickly adapts to a life of conniving and subterfuge to survive.<br/><br/>The transformation of Jim is beautifully captured, Steven Spielberg is a gifted director of child actors and gets a maximum performance always.<br/><br/>I was enthralled from beginning to end, young Jim was forever changed by his experiences and this change is portrayed starkly here when he is finally reunited with his parents.<br/><br/>8 out of 10 for equally impressive performances from John Malkovich and Miranda Richardson, but Christian Bale's performance deserved an Oscar."
"artzau","8","188","238","19 August 2001"," Extraordinary film
","Reading through the reviews, there were a lot of people who didn't understand this film.  This is Spielberg's venture into the realm of art in cinematography.  This film is a visual masterpiece and you are swept along from beginning to end.  Yes, the tale gets a bit loose in spots and you never know what's going to happen next.  But, if you're willing to give up warm and fuzzy for lush visual images and startling leaps of character, you'll see what Spielberg's trying to accomplish.  This film makes use of the talents of Miranda Richardson and gives some early exposure to the likes of John Malkovich and Ben Stiller, but young Christian Bale steals the show. The reviewer that commented on the ""gothic"" effect of the Tai-Pan's going to the costume ball being driven through Shanghai was right on.  This film is rife with such scenes and does not disappoint.  It's wholly misleading to look for some kind of action story underlying this film.  The tale, taken from the book, is straightforward enough:  a young boy's boost into manhood through the second world war.  The film is full of memorable moments and visually very, very pleasing.  As art, it is excellent.  That's likely why it wasn't a blockbuster, as say, e.g., Poltergeist, Close Encounters and the Jurassic Park films, were.  But, hey.  That's the cost of creating art as opposed to crap. And, crap does draw a lot of flies..."

","I saw this movie 17 years ago as a ten year old in the theater and saw it again for the first time since then last night on a TV movie channel. I have to say I'm almost ashamed that I forgot what a great movie this was...what a great movie it still is. The film contains parts very competently played by the then relatively un-knowns John Malkovic, Joey ""Pants"" and Ben Stiller. The lead was played, and very well done at that, by a then young actor Christian Bales (sp?). The acting in this movie is fantastic and the story line is is as rich as any other of the best movies I've seen. Following the trials and tribulations of a child from an affluent family separated from his parents in China after the Japanese invasion. This movie will make you angry, it will make you laugh, it will make you cry, it will frustrate the living daylights out of you and in the end you'll feel warm and fuzzy: but the hollow kind of warm and fuzzy that only comes after a very harrowing experience. If you don't like war movies don't worry!!! When you watch this film you'll see it's not as much of a war movie as it is a story of survival and the brutal realities of life when the world has been turned upside down. The movie really spoke to me partially b/c I was a young kid when I first saw it and the main character is also a young man. However, this movie also spoke to me on a much different, deeper level. Ever since I was child I was always fortunate/blessed enough to have my family along with everything I needed and most of what I wanted. This movie depicts what happens when all of those familiar things and creature comforts are taken away...it makes you ask yourself: What would I do in this situation? How would I react? A fantastic movie for almost all ages!!!"

","I came across this film while I was flipping through the channels on my t.v. This is truly an astounding film. The inimitable dialogue, the dazzling scenes, and most importantly the profundity of its premise make this film unforgettable and worthy of sycophantic obsession. I was completely enraptured by the brilliant acting. I believe this is Steven Spielberg's most noteworthy film. His other movies pale in comparison to this one. John Malkovich and Christian Bale are incredible as usual, but in this film they bring to life a story of a boy who loses everything due to a country trying to conquer everything. The physical and mental destruction of war and the injurious effects of loneliness are very clich√©d themes, but this film conveys them in an incomparable way. This is undoubtedly one of my favorite films, and I suggest that everyone take the time to watch it. It would be exceedingly foolish of one to not watch it."
"carebear-7","Null","112","155","4 December 1998"," truly inspirational
","When I saw this movie for the first time I was a fifteen year old kid more interested in the fact that Christian Bale was in it than what it was about. I had no idea what it was about or how it would effect me.  From the opening frames of the film to the last scene of young Jim's eyes slowly closing, it is  a masterpiece in film making.  This film should be regarded as one of the most visually stunning films of all time.  Spielberg, in his infinite wisdom, has created a film of such beauty and sadness, that I can't compare it to anything else I have ever seen.  Bale's performance brought me to tears.  I had never seen anyone his age or older give such a performance. He has remained, not just a pretty face, but a true jewel in the craft of performing.  Entranced by each moment and each actor in the film, I was inspired to continue my own performing in hopes to move someone the way the actors in this film moved me. I also began to study more on the period and read the novel itself. Speilberg was so true to the novel that you can even pick up the most minute details in the film.  I recommend this film to anyone who hasn't seen it. It is my favorite film of all time and will continue to be an inspiration to me as a performer and as a person."
"thecohen","Null","88","128","30 November 2001"," This movie was a visual, character driven movie of superior quality,
","This movie was a visual, character driven movie of superior quality, even for Steven Speilberg. Some say that Speilberg has too much the eye of a child, but I tend to disagree. Too many filmmakers today are producing slick, throw away action flicks that at first seem promising but eventually fall into predictable, fluff and special effects laden, thinly plotted, dialogue-poor, characterless movies that are gone before the popcorn. Yes, this film has a lot of great Special Effects (So did Schindler's List.) Moreover, a lot of great action to keep the story pace from dragging. The idea of a movie is for the actors and directors to show their stuff (Hopefully around some good writing.) This movie did it for me. I have to agree with all those who praised Christian Bale for his performance in this movie. He was brilliant. In addition, I got to see Ben Stiller in an unusual role for him. I thought that John Malcovitch acted perfectly for this film and yes he was a Han Solo/Indiana Jones character, but with even less depth. His role was pivotal only in so far as it affected the boy. We were not as concerned with his character in so much as his shadow was cast on Jim through out the movie. The war was bigger than this little  boy was and it was exquisitely done. Steven Speilberg gives us wonder, mystery, action, adventure and history in everything he does. He's the consummate filmmaker."
"Ben Lankester","Null","80","116","3 January 2001"," A masterpiece in every sense of the word
","When I first saw the epic film 'Empire Of The Sun' by the inspirational director Steven Spielberg I became emotionally involved in the story and could not help but shed a tear for the truly remarkable piece of cinema. Christian Bale performs, without question, better than any other actor has in a Hollywood film that is twice his age. As he closes his eyes at the end of the film in one of the most moving scenes I can remember, you see what a simply fantastic job Spielberg has done to bring J. G Ballard's classic book to the screen. Not ever has a film been more inspirational to me whilst following my dream to become a director as this. At the end of it you feel you want to move people when making a film as much as you were moved by this one. Wonderfully acted, beautifully shot - no other film will ever compare to this."
"tegg96","10","96","143","27 January 2004"," Very emotional film, with brilliant young Christian Bale.
","Empire of the Sun, I have just revisited this film on DVD and was amazed the effect it left on me. This is almost an unknown film relative to most other Spielberg work. The DVD is not even available in Australia, so I had it 'Amazoned' from the US.<br/><br/>Christian Bales performance as the 12 year old Jim is mesmerizing. He is in virtually every scene of the 2.5 hour movie and gives us the full range of emotions. He also one of the best looking kids I've seen, which add tremendously to the viewing appeal of the movie. A true heart throb in the making.<br/><br/>As a history lesson Empire give us an insight to the happenings in China in WWII, and the ambitions of the Japanese Empire, which are never touched on in other WWII movies.<br/><br/>The most emotional part of the film for me: Jim is looking through the fence at the Japanese airbase, the sun is setting, he is dreaming of flying in those incredible machines, pilots are smartly uniformed and decorated, offices passing drinks to the young pilots, superb music playing, Zeros ready to go, Jim salutes the Japanese heroes as they are flying out. What we know is that the war is lost for Japan and these pilots are surely on Kamikaze suicide missions. We feel great empathy for these fellow human beings despite the fact that they are the enemy.<br/><br/>The images in Empire are beautiful to look at, the movie is thought provoking and provide some history lesson, if somewhat fantasy and sacrine sweet. A behind the scenes war movie with heart. My favourite Spielberg movie and in my top 15 of all time. Other favourites in no order. Titanic, Patton, Unforgiven, Airport, Terminator, Salaam Bombay, 2001, Bridge on River Kwai, Minority Report."

","Empire of the Sun is about a wealthy British boy living in British controlled states of China during WW2. He is torn from his parents and placed in a camp for British citizens. He tries to find a way to connect the good of his old life to the good life in the camp and a life filled with war, but finds that no matter what there is no good out of war. This is an amazingly underrated film that should be watched by a mature, attentive person. This film is laced with compassion and power put in one. A must see for war buffs (or for Spielberg buffs). No matter what even if you hate this film, you will have a favorite part. One of Spielberg greatest films ever made (personally his greatest). 10/10"

","it was one of those movies i never expected to watch. it was late, i was bored, and i happened to stumble upon a channel i barely ever watch. and while i sat watching events unfold in front of me, i slowly forgot about my usual program of interest. there is something about this film that truly captivates you and leaves your eyes glued to it every second. Christian bale displays his talents wonderfully in this movie, and the most striking thing to me was his ability to give such a realistic, yet youthful performance. his subtle acts of defiance against authority, his brave expeditions that left older men in awe, the fact that a little boy could irritate a general so much. friendships were forged, even with the enemy and it was by far one of the most astounding movies i've ever seen. it's long, it's good, and if you haven't seen it - do so."
"Theo Robertson","7","54","87","22 July 2004"," A Movie Of Great Moments Without Being A Great Movie
","From Spring Of 1940 to the Summer of 1941 Britain experienced "" Its finest hour "" where an island people found itself fighting alone against Nazi Germany and fascist Italy . We experienced Dunkirk , the blitz , the battle of Britain and 36,000 British and commonwealth troops held back a force of 400,000 Italian troops in North Africa . If Britain had accepted the Nazi peace deal on offer the history of the human race would have been entirely different and not in a good way either . Ironically after this zenith of British courage we went onto lose the peace which is something we've been resentful about ever since <br/><br/>I'm being neither nostalgic nor nostalgic when I point out the above . It's just in the early scenes of EMPIRE OF THE SUN the Brits in China are shown as being arrogant , ignorant phillistines who all live in nice big houses . Maybe this might have been true of those Brits living in ivory towers running the empire but it's an atypical view of the average Brit during the second world war . I might have let it pass but seeing as the director's Steven Spielberg who insists on always casting British actors to play Nazis in all his movies and who put the boot into Monty in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN I can't help thinking he's somewhat Anglophobic . Read my opening paragraph and you'll learn more about Britain in the second world war than you will from seeing this movie <br/><br/>There's other flaws in the screenplay ( Written by Tom Stoppard who's not an American by the way ) which people have noticed . It is rather disjointed and episodic . The audience is shown the events of the Japanese Imperial Army invading Shanghai in 1941 where all the Westerners are put into a holding camp then events jump forward almost FOUR years later where the prisoners are held in an internment camp . What ? Nothing of any interest has happened in four years ? Some critics have also mentioned the rather clich√©d characters and I agree . The Brits are all rather stiff upper lipped types while the Yanks have a cheeky extrovert attitude with plenty of scams going on . Did the Americans have a monopoly on scams during the war ? I also have serious reservations on the way the Japanese are portrayed in this movie . When Alexander Solzhenitsyn said "" The only difference between the Nazis and the communists is that the Nazis used gas "" it's a statement that could have been used to describe the Japanese occupation forces of the 1930s and 40s , but here they're shown as noble warriors ( I don't dispute the raw courage of the Japanese of the time but there's nothing noble about mass murder ) who salute the young James . If the author of the book JG Ballard said it this scene happened then it happened but I do have many reservations about the Japanese portrayal <br/><br/>There are many positive aspects to EMPIRE OF THE SUN . Technically it's very good with some fine scenes like the above saluting scene and the mustang flying over the internment camp with the pilot waving to young James in slow motion and the scene where the young protagonist believes he can resurrect his dead friend but for me the best scene is where Basie is allowed onto a truck where he turns his back on James who is left behind in a heart wrenching moment . It's these moments that linger long in the memory and certainly make EMPIRE OF THE SUN a far better regarded film than it certainly deserves to be <br/><br/>It's also a film with a very good cast who rise above the material . It's surprising to think this now but when the movie was released in 1987 both Nigel Havers and Miranda Richardson where only known for their sit com roles. Richardson ( So awful in BLACKADDER 2 ) is very good here and went onto to become more or less Britain's best actress in the early 1990s and there's early screen appearances by Joe Panoliano , Ben Stiller ( Yes that one ) and Paul McGann . Despite playing an irritating character ( And characters don't come anymore irritating than a 14 year old boy with a bi-polar disorder ) Christian Bale is excellent and it's nice to know he still gets regular employment as an adult actor . The only disappointment is John Malkovich but I've never been a fan of his "" Stoned Jack Nicolson "" type of acting and like I said he does appear in the movie's best scene <br/><br/>EMPIRE OF THE SUN has it's moments but that's all they are - moments . They stay in the mind making you believe that it's a far better movie than it actually is . It's not by any stretch of the imagination a bad or even average film but it's not a masterpiece either . Perhaps the fact that it was nominated for several Oscars ( None of which were for best film or director ) but failed to win any shows up it's true worth"
"JMichaelAtchue","8","6","7","21 November 2019"," An Underrated Classic
","In 1987 Steven Spielberg's ""Empire of the Sun"" opened to mixed reviews and disappointing box office returns. But the film's reputation has grown with time, and it's now rightfully considered an underrated Spielberg classic. ""Empire of the Sun"" tells the true story of Jim Ballard, an English boy who's separated from his parents in China during World War II. Featuring an excellent performance from the young Christian Bale, ""Empire of the Sun"" is an emotional and visually striking drama about loss, family, and the horror of war. Spielberg also uses Ballard's story to address thought-provoking questions about social privilege, militarism, and the lengths that humans will go to in order to survive. Spielberg doesn't provide easy answers to these questions, making this one of his more mature and contemplative works.<br/><br/>Having seen ""Empire of the Sun"" multiple times, I've grown to deeply appreciate it as both a sweeping historical epic and a powerful tale of a traumatic childhood. The movie isn't perfect - at two and a half hours it's too long. The second act in particular drags and this causes the movie to lose much of its dramatic momentum halfway through. But despite its length ""Empire of the Sun"" does more than enough to maintain your interest with compelling performances, amazing visuals, and of course John Williams' award winning score. 8/10."
"webmaster-49","3","46","86","28 October 2005"," Mind-bendingly stupid
","I read some of these comments and I'm totally floored. The acting was horrid and forced, mostly due to the director creating scenes and instructing his actors to respond in completely unrealistic ways, such as when the parents of the ""lost"" children simply stand around staring at the assembled children until, after an eternity, one parent recognizes their kid. Um, yeah, right. Nobody would shout out a name, right? None of the kids recognize their own freaking parents. And this movie is full of moments like this.<br/><br/>The Japanese come off almost like clownish figures, the Chinese as mere backdrops in their own country. The set pieces are ridiculous and none of this is even remotely close to actual history. I don't care if this is told from ""the boy's perspective."" That's not an excuse for lazy, unfocused, and completely unrealistic work. OK, so it's not supposed to be realism. It's ""surrealism."" Well, it fails on that level too as it doesn't produce a sense of wonder or fascination, but rather a sense of endless irritation and boredom as scenes go on and on, or simply cut to another unrelated scene. If Spielberg was shooting for some kind of ""war as seen from a kid's point of view"" he really blew it, unless we're to believe children are on a permanent happy acid trip.<br/><br/>Scored like a soaring Disney kid's flick and sanitized to the point of being an insult, this movie is worthless. Another example of Spielberg's total inability to cover serious subjects with anything other than the mentality of a semi-autistic child. Jim's transformations are completely phony, based on nothing more than the script. Annoying English boy turns into bad-acting English boy.<br/><br/>Don't let the high ratings fool you. You have been warned."

","Fascinating story of a boy left alone in China during world war II has movie potential. Unfortunately mr.

The film though, is entirely without suspence and mystery. So the boy runs around being obnoxious and dreams of joining the big American boys. It is the work of a man who isn¬¥t very mature and does not know how to handle adult or serious issues. The film is more like a boy¬¥s adventure at summer camp than world war!

","The story of an atheist who dreams about God playing tennis, while the boy grows up in China during the Japanese occupation (1941). The boy is also fascinated with military aviation and hopes to some day join the Japanese air force. Oh, did I mention this boy is English? And a very, very young Christian Bale? Oh yes! But things change when the war heats up and his parents become separated from him. Then he gets really annoying and tries to surrender 20 times (could have been cut to ONCE) and his accent gets thicker and more irritating. I wished he would die after the first 30 minutes, but no such luck.<br/><br/>And why does this movie make the Chinese and Japanese armies look like a bunch of incompetent monkeys? And who's stupid idea was it to throw Ben Stiller in here? At least John Malkovich is cool. But, seriously, what's Steven Spielberg's obsession with little boys? Anyway, the film is both really good and really bad at the same time. While I must say it drags a bit too long for my liking, there were many good things about it. The focus being on the scavengers of a POW camp rather than the actual war made the film entertaining. And the way reality was blended with fantasy was brilliant, although I admit I didn't catch on right away and would probably appreciate these things more with a second viewing... though I have little desire to sit through this again. I am not a Spielberg fan, as his incredible tameness in the world of cinema leaves me feeling empty inside. This film, while better than many of his, still felt like there wasn't enough in it to justify the length.<br/><br/>But, who knows, maybe it's just me. Recommended if you're a Malkovich or Bale die-hard ,but otherwise you're not really missing out on anything by skipping this film."
"sdfriar","3","41","78","17 June 2002"," Boring and uninteresting
","I can not believe all of the positive reviews I have read on this board. I saw this film was on TV a couple nights ago, and seeing that it starred John Malkovich and was directed by Steven Spielberg, I decided to give it a go. The film has an interesting premise.  From the start, it appears that this premise will grow throughout the picture.  It doesn't.  First of all, the child is the most annoying lead character I have ever seen.  It is impossible to feel for this kid throughout the rest of the movie.  The remainder of the film is spent building towards great emotional climaxes, but then the scene is uninteresting and really has no bearing upon anything. The depiction of internment camp life is something out of a post-apocolyptic movie.  The title is misleading, the film really has nothing to do with the Empire of the Sun (Japan).  Instead it is a aimlessly wandering film looking for a plot.  Some scenes simply don't make any sense. Just when we think the movie is taking us somewhere, it drops us off in the middle of nowhere wondering where it went."
"GRWeston","5","13","21","1 March 2002"," A disconnected experience
","""Empire of the Sun"" is an awkward and uncomfortable film. Spielberg is usually very good at melding character interaction with the cinematography and music, but in ""Empire,"" it's as if these elements are working against each other. Since all of the characters are at a distance, not fleshed out enough or both, it never seems like the sentimental direction or the evocative score are appropriate. What should be an expression of the characters' turmoil ends up feeling like obvious overcompensation. The best parts of the movie are the memorable visuals - the sparks flying from a WWII plane in particular - but like everything else in the film, the overbearing direction and music either dilutes the effect or feels out of place."
"bkoganbing","8","15","25","21 November 2016"," A great adventure for a child
","I can see that a tale told from a child's point of view how it would stir the imagination of one Steven Spielberg. Empire Of The Sun is a really imaginative story of a young boy stuck in World War II China in a truly terrible situation cut off from his parents. Yet young Christian Bale turns the whole thing gradually into an adventure of sorts. <br/><br/>Up to the age of 11 young Bale has lived in the British quarter of Shanghai and in fact has never seen the United Kingdom, his father Rupert Frazer owns a textile factory. Bale and his parents live in luxury among the millions of Chinese.<br/><br/>What one should remember when watching Empire Of The Sun is that since the Opium War of 1841 western powers and Japan joined them took small little nibbles out of China and in fact were granted by the weak Chinese governments special treatment in their quarters. Frazer, Emily Richard his wife and young Bale lived under British law and did not answer to the Chinese. The other powers did the same, even the USA had its own quarter in Shanghai as well as other large Chinese cities. That only ended with the Communist takeover in 1949.<br/><br/>It ended a bit prematurely for the west in 1941 when the Japanese attacked America, Great Britain, the Netherlands. That's when Bale's well ordered world falls apart.<br/><br/>I had to marvel at how when Bale came home and the parents were gone and some looting had occurred how his reactions were. Without any dialog Bale runs through a gamut of emotions. Great job of acting and directing.<br/><br/>Later on Bale is rounded up and taken to an internment camp next to an airfield. Fascinating how Bale who had an interest in aviation looks at the Japanese planes and become almost worshipful of the enemy. He even makes friend with some of the Japanese, a group not known for treating prisoners well in World War II.<br/><br/>Joe Pantoliano and John Malkovich are a pair of American adventurers, no better than they ought to be. They're caught along with Bale and sent to the internment camp. Our adult eyes see them as a pair of bottom feeders. But we see them through the child's eyes also and they become sort of devil may care rogues that one reads in pulp fiction the kind Bale no doubt read. <br/><br/>Steven Spielberg did a marvelous job of recreating wartime China and it certainly helped to shoot the film there. Just part of the People's Republic's post Mao entry into the community of nations.<br/><br/>The adult performers are fine. Empire Of The Sun got a flock of Oscar nominations in technical categories, no gold though. But it did inaugurate the career of Christian Bale who's done pretty well for himself as an adult actor too.<br/><br/>This one is highly recommended for its realism and encouragement of imagination."

Plus we get a privileged snivelling kid who is devoid of empathy, and certainly not deserving of my sympathy.<br/><br/>Please rent ""Paradise Road"" or the TV series ""A Town Like Alice"" for a closer representation of what civilians faced in the the internment camps.

What does THAT signify? Spielberg tried to prove that he was Academy Award material with this one> Truth of the matter is this film is the cinematic version of a Mc Donalds hamburger- no substinance in it anywhere. True, Spielberg did produce Shindlers List a few years after this abortion, but aside from that the body of his work is truly designed for mass appeal-his name will guarantee big bucks at the box office.

","I just saw this movie last night. It really ended up being quite disappointing despite a very good beginning. The scenes near the start of the film really do a good job of transmitting the ominous feeling of looming war. When the war broke out, I was feeling the kid's fear and confusion. I was thinking it was going to be a good war journey film, like the Pianist. Unlike the Pianist, this story just seemed to spread itself to thin. Throughout the movie the kid gives all sorts of philosophical ponderings, at one point he declares, ""I have become an athiest."" Statements such as these seem like they should have meaning, but I couldn't find it. It was like much of the dialog and actions of the characters was just put out there with no insight to what caused them to speak and act in such a way. It seemed as though this got worse through the film. By the the time the end came, it seemed as though each scene was meaningless and unconnected to the next. If the character's motivations and psychology were made more apparent through the dialog, this could have been an excellent movie. The film was technically good, but the lack of insight into the characters leaves only a meaningless bore."

The streetwise American proved to be a fairly stale character - he began to look as if Spielberg was simultaneously reaching for the cynical American in ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"", and Han Solo, and failing to grasp either.  And the central character, I noticed, undergoes a hell of a lot: war breaks out over his head, he loses his parents during an outbreak of mass panic, he nearly starves, he's imprisoned by the Japanese and rescued by the Americans - and what, then, is the moral of it all?  That people change.  The story is a good deal less interesting than I first took it to be.<br/><br/>Well, I now realise, so what.  It's not the film's fault that I first saw it when I was seventeen.  The whole may be less than the sum of the parts, but the sum of the parts is a pretty big sum.  There's that wonderful extended sequence, which lasts from when Jim loses his parents until he (and I admit that this part is a turn for the worse) meets the American: for a while it looks as if Spielberg cannot set a foot wrong.  The way he returns to his old house and haunts it like a ghost.  The way one of his old Chinese servants stops packing, methodically walks over to him, slaps him across the face, and then resumes her packing.  It was the most economical way of getting through to the boy, it needed to be done, she'd wanted to do it for a while - and having done it ONCE, she could now move on to other things. The latter stretch of the movie, while disappointing, continued to serve up moments like these.  The cinematography is a delight throughout, and not just because these are pretty pictures.  Spielberg uses flawless images and cold, starry music to distance us from the scenes of war and privation and death and this is, I think his finest achievement: the whole film takes on the quality of vivid memories of things that cannot now be altered.<br/><br/>Apparently David Lean tried and failed to turn J.G. Ballard's book into a film - and indeed it looks as if Spielberg, too, tried and failed to make a David Lean film.  But Lean soars so high there's plenty of room for others to fly beneath him without crashing.  It may be the influence of Lean that makes the best film Spielberg made between ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and ""Schindler's List"".  It's a far better study in war than ""Saving Private Ryan"".  That film is as cheap and unsubtle as can be: it shocks us with blood and guts, then wears us down with inane spoken platitudes.  ""Empire of the Sun"" lets us conclude the nature of the horror, and draw lessons, for ourselves."
"milty908","1","45","93","13 February 2002"," Horrible movie with even worse playing of history
","Somehow, I don't understand why Spielberg chose to make this movie.  It was essentially a prison camp movie but why set it in China?  If it is in China, then why is it about white people?  In the entire movie, the Japanese are glorified as a warrior nation, while the Chinese are portrayed as dirty people.  If Spielberg wanted to make a prison camp movie, he should have just skipped to Schindler's List or make a movie about a REAL prison camp perhaps.  It seemed like Spielberg simply wanted to make a movie in China, since he haven't done so before.  But Spielberg decides to completely neglect the real victims in the war, the Chinese, and decide to make a movie about a tiny minority that was stupid enough to still pursue their imperialistic fortunes even at a time of war.<br/><br/>Some historical concerns.  In the beginning of the movie, it states that China and Japan has been in 4 years of undeclared war already, therefore the starting scene was set in 1941.  Shanghai fell in 1937.  Also, Shanghai fell only after the largest battle of WW2, the Battle of Shanghai, and in the movie it seemed like the Japanese all of a sudden walked into the city and caught everyone by surprise.  The Battle of Shanghai took 3 months!  You would think people would know to get out of Shanghai by now, especially Westerners who had the means and a place to go, BACK HOME!  Also, Shanghai was liberated by the Nationalist army, not by Americans, but whatever, its a Hollywood movie.  This movie only had a couple historical mistakes because there was only a couple scenes of history in it!  The prison camp could have been anywhere, anytime, any war, just change the subjugators.  The scenary of the camp was also bland and generic enough to make you think it was filmed in Bakerfield.  The generic camp also made the movie completely generic.  All this makes you wonder, why China?  If China, why this?  It's not like the China war had much movies made about it.  Spielberg could have made much better movies with China in WW2 as the background, such as something about the Nanking Massacre, or the Chinese defense against the Japanese, or even the American ""flying tigers"".  Instead Spielberg chose the most unrealistic and obscure nook to make a grand epic about.  Baffling. The movie itself was bland except for the boy, who made you wonder if he had gone crazy from the change around him.  One minute he was a pampered kid from a western imperialist family, the next he was a refugee, although still better treated than the Chinese.  Atleast he wasn't shot immediately on sight.  Watching this movie makes me sad about how the world is treating the 2nd Sino-Japanese war from 1937-45 as a forgotten war."

","Just because the movie is good looking and directed by one of the best movie directors of all time doesn't automatically mean that the movie itself is good as well. ""Empire of the Sun"" has a slow story that isn't always told from the right perspective.<br/><br/>Really the biggest problem of the movie is the perspective it is told from. The entire movie is told through the eyes of a child played by a young Christian Bale. Sure, Christian Bale is a great actor and he now is Batman and all, so people will only love him more in this movie now but that doesn't all mean that Christian Bale as a kid was good and strong enough to carry an entire movie on his own. And this movie is really about Christian Bale's character alone. There is nothing wrong with telling a story through the eyes of a child and it can work really powerful but a movie like that also needs a good supporting adult cast to give the movie more credibility and give the movie some more characters to relate with. The movie does has a great supporting cast (John Malkovich, Miranda Richardson, Joe Pantoliano and a young and 'serious' Ben Stiller in an early role.) but none of these actors are used consistent enough in the movie, with as a result that Christian Bale has to carry the entire movie on its own.<br/><br/>Visually the movie is really spectacular to look at. The cinematography by Allen Daviau is magnificent and there are some well directed and good looking sequences in the movie. Also lets please not forget the brilliant musical score by John Williams that makes some of the sequences work extremely well and gives the movie some extra boost and power.<br/><br/>The movie is not always correctly paced and there are some death moments in the movie were nothing really interesting ever happens. The movie does concentrate well on the emotions and feelings of especially the young boy Jim/Jamie but that doesn't always make the movie interesting to watch. It has never really been a movie that I particularly enjoyed watching, because of the at times low pace and narrow minded and very one-person sided perspective the movie is told from.<br/><br/>In its emotions and dramatic moments, the movie really goes over-the-top at times. The movie can be seen as an over-dramatized one that doesn't always is believable in its story. There is some typical and predictable Spielberg sentimental stuff in the movie. The over-the-top level of this movie does provide the movie with some wonderful and unforgettable sequences but at the same time its a killer for the story and the movie its credibility.<br/><br/>Yes the movie is perfectly watchable and its beautiful looking and all but the story and perspective makes this not really a movie that I like to watch. One of Spielberg's lesser movies. I'm sure that the book is great though! But the story doesn't really work in a movie.<br/><br/>6/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"Quinoa1984","6","15","29","4 September 2006"," an episodic story laced with David Lean influence, impressive sights, though not enough
","Empire of the Sun must have been something that made Steven Spielberg all the more excited to work on being that, before each film he directs, he watches four specific films- The Searchers, Seven Samurai, It's a Wonderful Life, and Lawrence of Arabia- the latter of those four, and the fact that Lean originally intended to direct this film, indicate how he wanted to go with the style, the sprawling and epic tone. But if in the end I didn't feel as totally satisfied as I thought I should (it's been called one of the most underrated films of Spielberg/the 80's), it might be that parts become more interesting and worth watching than for the whole. Acting-wise the two main forces in the film, one a young, brilliant-as-a-child actor Christian Bale embodies Jamie/Jim as a kid who does go through a transformation, the typical 'coming-of-age' where he loses more than just his parents in the chaos but part of himself. The other is John Malkovich, who plays the surrogate/friend during war-time to the boy, a more hard-edged but sharp guy who's out for himself but not completely shut-off from others.<br/><br/>And as with any given Spielberg film, at least one or two visuals will strike up as being pretty close to what could be called ""pure cinema"", where you feel a kind of rush on the back of your neck at what can be done with color, light, composition, people (optional), and music. One of these might be in the first hour of the film- maybe my favorite chunk for just consistency- as Jamie first goes through the toughest part, put into the disillusionment of his fantasies of aircrafts and flying and out on his own. Jamie gets lost from his parents in a massive sea of a crowd in the city, and it's a reminder how astounding Spielberg can be with the control of it all, and how every detail adds up to an emotional toll. Once Ballard's original story (based on truth, how much I don't know) reaches into the prison camp, it becomes spotty; sometimes parts of the story work, and sometimes they don't and become a little dramatically inert. Never does Spielberg completely lose his craftsmanship, but there's something not there. Part of it might be the excision of the main chunk of war years (1941 right to 1945 in a fade), but another part of it might be somethings that just ring a little more to the sentimental than Spielberg might realize. <br/><br/>When Jim, for example, sees the Japanese fliers on the airfield in some minor ceremony, and he starts to sing his old choir-boy song, it just didn't seem right after such better, smaller scenes between Malkovich and Bale. Still, through this Spielberg does provide another point of great cinema, in the shot that inspired the poster of the towering sun with the plane flying across it. It's little rousing moments like this that do make the film worth seeing, but if you're coming into it after already seeing many of his great works (Schindler, Private Ryan, Munich), the real devastation from being in this situation is never as fully realized as past some kind of brighter nostalgia. There are some darker moments, but it never adds up, and certainly not from the point of view of a conflicted boy who goes through this experience of Japanese internment like Lawrence in a small way- he's a little mad, though courageous. But through Spielberg's own epic ambitions, there's something lost with really making it entertaining. It's bound to find more viewers as the years go on, and it was unfairly maligned upon its original release. Yet the irony doesn't escape me that it is sort of a minor work for the director, working on a huge canvas of locales, extras, and actors both Western and Eastern."

Spoiled, airplane-obsessed British lad (Bale) lives a pampered, sheltered life in Shanghai, but when the Japanese invade, he gets separated from his parents and has to survive many hardships, first on the streets and then in an internment camp. An ambitious epic, but one without much focus or a clear statement; the first hour is often effective, but the movie drags during the more muddled final hour. Despite a good performance, Bale's character doesn't garner much sympathy even as he overcomes the expected coming-of-age and loss-of-innocence hurdles. Even more emotionally distant than Spielberg's previous stab at ""big, serious filmmaking"" (""The Color Purple""), it's an extraordinary true story given a rather ordinary treatment in all ways but the professional polish. At the very least, this is a magnificent looking film with fine period detail, but it's sometimes wasted; like John Williams' heavy-handed score, if the movie had earned its stirring grandeur, Allen Daviau's beautiful photography would have served a greater purpose. Although a familiar cynical-but-resourceful type in POW/prison movies (think: William Holden in ""Stalag 17""), Malkovich's characterization is the most diverting.<br/><br/>52/100"

","Based on J.G. Ballard's autobiography, ""Empire of the Sun"" portrays spoiled English boy Jim Graham (Christian Bale) getting taken prisoner by the Japanese army in WWII-era Shanghai. In the POW camp, he meets several American POWs and is forced to totally grow up.<br/><br/>You really see how good this movie is when you understand the issues that it portrays. All of these foreign powers were trying to colonize China. The British felt that they could just live there with no fear; they were oblivious to the coming of the Japanese army. Some really good scenes show Jim in the choir (showing how the English were trying to continue their lifestyle), and then as his family is driving home, they drive past a homeless Chinese man, a reminder of the effects of colonialism. One important point is that the men whom Jim gets to know in the POW camp are not particularly desirable men; specifically, Basie (John Malkovich) is sort of a pirate. The point is that this experience forces him to grow up. In his debut, Ben Stiller also plays one of the American POWs.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Empire of the Sun"" is a great movie.

"Bucky-11","Null","9","16","16 September 1998"," More Than Meets the Lazy Eye
","The problem with Empire of the Sun is that it *was - is - will always be* completely misunderstood. <br/><br/>Written by Pulitzer Prize winner Tom Stoppard and based on J.G. Ballard's award-winning semi-autobipographical account of his adolescence in a Japanese internment camp, the entire film is a treatise on the human gifts for self-delusion and denial in the face of an overwhelming reality. In the film, character after character fights to avoid their grim circumstances by retreating into their inner world - they feverishly hang on to their previous lives and dreams, and only the characters who shuck off that treasured skin survive the new world created in the wake of World War II.<br/><br/>One of the chief misunderstandings of Empire of the Sun is the visual strategy Spielberg employs throughout the film in service to his theme. Time and again, his camera shows us scenes and shots that aren't actually happening in the 'real' world - Situations are seen as they are perceived or as they have been re-imagined in the memory of the film's twelve-year -old protagonist, Jim Graham (an astonishing Christian Bale). Jim is a pampered child of privelege given to flights of fantasy as the film opens - by its end, he will have all of those predilictions towards childhood dreams beaten out of him. By the end credit scrawl, he is the ultimate pragmatist, his collection of childhood memorabilia literally floating alongside the dead in the Shanghai Harbor.<br/><br/>As is unusual for a Spielberg film, the film's narrative events all support the central idea, instead of the ideas supporting a headlong narrative. Empire of the Sun is unique in the Spielberg canon in that its plot is secondary to the main dramatic action. Those expecting the normal Spielberg gift of A-Z storytelling were confused by a film that was less interested in story than it was on symbolism, allusions, ideas - many of these presented in throaways and visual gimmicks that went completely unnoticed.<br/><br/>Here is an example of the enormous texture of the film -- just one of the little unnoticed treasures in the movie that Spielberg pulls out like so much pocket lint -- early in the film, Jim's parents put him to bed, and Spielberg's editor Michael Kahn does a quick dissolve of the same image on top of itself. At first, it seems like a bizarre technical goof - only later when Jim makes the revelation that he has idealized his parents so much that he can't remember what they actually look like -- only then does the image zing home: A painting by Norman Rockwell from Life magazine hangs next to Jim's makeshift prison bed - This painting is the exact same image of parent and child from the beginning of the film. <br/><br/>All of this serves to subtly illustrate that the line between reality and remembered reality has been blurred by the War and the characters' need to escape.<br/><br/>Unfortuantely for Spielberg, his brilliant technique was taken at face value - his startegy was so complex, so smart, that it sailed completely over the heads of people not used to doing analytical thinking when watching a film with the moniker ""Spielberg"" attatched. This wasn't ""E.T."", and it left people baffled. Eevn some scenes that clearly are Jim's fantasies were taken as ""real"" -- such as a pilot waving a salute to Jim, or a refrigerator spilling open, revealing a treasure of glitter and toys. But critics completely missed the boat, and chided Spielberg for his ""fakery "".<br/><br/>The problem with works like ""Empire of the Sun"" is the tendency to reduce the film's moments into a sort of intellectual parlor game. The film's many many asides certainly don't discourage this (one quick throaway shows the British prisoners performing a reading from Shakespeare's ""Midsummer Night 's Dream""), but when a film is somewhat dependent on the symbolic asides to relate its message, and the audience misses the boat, you have to rely only on your story to satisfy them. Time and again, this is what critics complained about - the films less-than-urgent third act.<br/><br/>For over a decade now, ""Empire of the Sun"" has languished in some sort of filmic netherworld, referenced only as some sort of prep course for Spielberg to get up for ""Schindler's List"", ""Amistad"", and ""Saving Private Ryan"". It is my opinion that the failure of this film - one labored and planned over so meticulously - was a giant blow to Spielberg. The incredible success of the uninspired ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" must have been equally disheartening.<br/><br/>In all, for those of you who have been quick to write off ""Empire of the Sun "" as Floppus Spielbergus, I say to take a second look, except this time, take the moments to ask yourself what the film is really about, and then notice all the work being done by Spielberg and Stoppard to sell you on that idea. It is a rapturous, wondrous piece of filmmaking -- one so beautiful there are moments that actually hurt to watch.<br/><br/>If you don't expect ""Raiders of the Lost Prison Camp"", I think you'll find much to reward you."

This is SS at his worst, trying to make something incredible and meaningful when it just isn't. Ordinary things are so important, why, we don't know. One pointless scene after another, almost like a bunch of MTV videos chopped up and thrown in the air and where they lay is anyone's guess. Lots of nice shots of people yelling, moving rocks, planes, etc but not a soul to be found.

","When I saw the previews for this movie almost two decades ago, I was really excited about it. I like the director. I was interested in the subject. My father served in the China-Burma-India Theater of Operations and little film or ink is dedicated to that part of World War II. And the movie seemed to start off well. But it devolved into a disjointed, unfocused boring waste of time. I regret watching few films but this is one of them.<br/><br/>There were some nicely done scenes -- the Japanese marching into town, the P-51s attacking the airfield (however I must note that a boy kept in a prison camp since the U.S. entry into the war would hardly have heard of a P-51, much less be able to recognize one; it wasn't developed until after the war started). But they were bright spots in a long boring movie.<br/><br/>It's not that I don't like character-driven movies. Schindler's List shows what Spielberg can do with that type of film. It's stunning. But there was little in the movie to make you care about the characters. And the boy's admiration for the Japanese after years of captivity seems awfully strange. I can see how he might admire them as warriors before the war. I've had European friends who were children during the war say they admired the Germans military prowess even though they were enemies. But I've talked to a lot of World War II POWs from the Pacific Theater and none of them ever acquired the slightest admiration for the Japanese during their captivity. I doubt a young boy, cruelly treated by them, would either."
"dl43","2","16","34","27 September 2006"," Utterly offensive
","Whatever its artistic merits, the subtle implications of Spielberg's Empire of the Sun convey a far more sinister impression both of the director's distorted view of history and his readily apparent hypocrisy.<br/><br/>It still shocks me the sheer number of individuals who seem to have misinterpreted this film as condemning atrocities as perpetrated by the Imperial Japanese Army. As such, consider the facts.<br/><br/>In the film, the Japanese Army regulars never kill so much as a single person, implying that the worst of its conduct relied upon repossessing real estate and partially neglecting the medical and sustenance needs of westerners in captivity.<br/><br/>The Chinese are portrayed as babbling idiots, whose ( as Spielberg implies) readily apparent hysteria ultimately separated Jamie from his family. In fact, the biggest nemesis to Christain Bale embodies that of a homeless Chinese boy who attempts to rob and beat him. Furthermore, the fact that Japanese troops apparently perpetuated little more than a repossession of real estate and confiscation of a slightly greater portion of food resources tends to imply the panicked crowds of Chinese attempting to flee the Japanese occupation as guilty of rampant paranoia and hysteria, considering that (according to Spielberg) they had little to fear from their impending occupants.<br/><br/>Mind you, I have no qualms whatsoever of Spielberg's incentive to portray the Japanese as multidimensional humans, offset by some individuals who perpetrated reprehensible acts; that's fine. However, comparing his readily apparent sense of moral outrage as a contextual misinterpretation leads to the killing of a well-intentioned Japanese pilot by one of the main characters to the more than subtle implications of Saving PRivate Ryan that attempts to perpetuate excuses for Americans who executed unarmed German prisoners lays bear the directors affinity for insufferable hypocrisy.<br/><br/>And, as one reviewer already pointed out, the story focuses primarily on the (not so severe, as Spielberg implies) maltreatment of white detention camp victims, rather than upon the Chinese who endured far worse at the hands of a doctrine that, like Naziism, perpetuated a sense of racial purity. Indeed, one cannot help but wonder whether Spielberg shares this imperial doctrine by envisioning the Japanese as racially superior the remaining occupants of the Pacific and Southeast Asia.<br/><br/>Only after Munich has Spielberg begun to show even the faintest traces of either maturity or objectivity. However, he'll require a lot more deeds before overcoming his legitimate (however non-official) status as one of the world's pre-eminent hypocrites."

Based in the real life of James Graham Ballard, with the great director Steven Spielberg, everybody should watch this movie to see how the Second World War Affected the east side of the world,specially China and Japan.<br/><br/>Jamie Graham is a spoiled brat that was born in Shanghai in 1930. His parents are rich, and he has a great life,living in a big and beautiful house with comfort and many servants and maids,and also studying in a religious school for the upper class.Aware about the problems of the war,Jamie lives his life as usual, going to the British parties and playing with his airplanes. Until one day, where the diplomatic relations of Japan with USA are not working anymore,and the city of Shanghai is invaded by the Japanese Army.

Besides that, he sees that Basie is a jerk, and never was his friend for real.

","I first saw EotS as a child, and was transfixed by the imagery of the film, swept along in Jim's story, and thoroughly entertained. Now, a dozen years and as many history books later, I found (and was indeed interested to note) that this time I engaged more with the adult characters in the story, rather than simply being swept along with Jim, so it was a totally different viewing experience. Understanding vastly more of WWII history now I was also able to put into context the amazing scenes of the Japanese advance into Shanghai, making the sequence all the more powerful and compelling. And I finally understood the significance of the young Japanese pilots and the ceremony...it never occurring to me as a kid they were preparing to go and suicidally smash their planes into American warships. Like the thousands of German youth convinced by their leaders they would one day stand at the forefront of a powerful world empire, these young Japanese men must have felt the crushing weight of the allied forces' advance more that I could ever imagine.<br/><br/>Kudos has got to go to the Production Designer and Cinematographer. The scenes shot in China are magnificent, and the exploding Zero and subsequent scenes of the P51 raid on the camp are some of the finest shots ever committed to film. This is also one of the truly great moments from young Christian Bale, as his character Jim, in a surreal few seconds, suddenly realises who the ""good guys"" are. Simply outstanding. While some of Bale's role-choices are somewhat questionable, his acting talent is undeniable. The set of the American section of the POW camp was also very well done. You feel like you are there, amongst the bunks and hanging clothes, rowdy Americans...you can almost smell the sweat and sawdust.Likewise with the rest of the film, its atmosphere is absorbing and rich, there are myriad details to this film that ensure its re-play value over and over, there are so many stories behind the characters and events in this film, some you can read in a history book (Japanese invading China mainland, Hiroshima/Nagasaki bombs/British habitation of Shanghai etc) and others that are simply wonders of the imagination as you think about each of the characters (especially Basie and the Doctor, but even down to the servants in Jim's household) and where they came from, how they came to be there at that time in history, and if they survived, where did they go after the events of the film and what did they do? John Williams provides a very rich score, in particular a boys' choir, that enhances the film dramatically. Id even not immediately guess this was a Steven Spielberg film...as there is very little of the ""insert emotion here"" film-making so prevalent in something like Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>This one is going into the top ten.

On the bad side, Spielberg just can't resist making the 14 year old boy the wonder-kid, who can through a crowd and without stopping for a breath, immediately understands how to defuse a potentially deadly situation with some guards. The adults just stand around while the kid doesn't need to think. Sorry but this type of thing just detracts from the movie. It's the kind of movie you want to lose yourself in, forgetting you are watching a movie - then somethings like that are thrown in and you are jarred awake, oh yeah this is just Spielberg being Spielberg. It's funny how the kids are so smart in his movies, at one point do 14 year old boys become stupid adults? When do you lose your spark of intelligence? I know, this is a bit overstated but it's like Peter Pan in a Japanese prison camp, it just doesn't fit."

","I watched this film when I was a teenager, and for years I wanted to write a review on this. Now that I have read some of the comments here, I have recently made an exception to rent and watch this again, hoping that I would somehow find it less, er, upsetting as I am older now and less affected by my own self-imposed political correctness. The answer is, still NO. And I will continue to make a point NOT to see any Steven Spielberg's movies JUST because of this film.<br/><br/>Here's my problem. As a Chinese, I feel this strong empathy with the Jewish community as we, as a race, were both victimized during WWII. Them by the Nazi, we by the Japanese. I can also only watch with envy as a lot of Jewish film makers (especially those in the US, including Mr. Spielberg himself) continue to make movies/documentaries to remember the victims and the courage of many people that were trying to make a difference and save a lot of people from the sheer brutality of the aggressors.<br/><br/>And what the most important Jewish film maker (or just film maker) of this generation did with a story that happened in China during WWII. The film is obviously not about our suffering, and that's fine because it's based on a story of a British boy who got caught. However, in the first 15 mins of the film, when Chinese characters briefly appeared, they were either very cruel (like the housemaids trying to steal things from the British boy's home, and hit him when the boy trying to stop them) or just simply thugs/thieves.<br/><br/>If that's not enough, the boy, no doubt was in a lot of distress and going through a lot of unstable emotions while in the war prisoner camp, found some sort of emotional alliance with a young Japanese soldier who had been trying but failed to become part of an ""elite"" team of pilots whose only duty at that point of the war was to carry out suicide missions. As commented by another user here the brutality of the camp was kept to a minimum, I don't know why as there is plenty in the book. But what we see in this movie, correct me if I am wrong, is that those pilots are being glorified (or in some symbolic sort of way, the ""courage"" of the Japanese army) as told by film maker's version of the boy's prospective.<br/><br/>One could only imagine what reaction it would provoke IF this film, with more or less the same storyline, was about, say, a British boy in Prague being capture and sent to a camp by the Nazi during WWII.<br/><br/>A bit of history. Shanghai was a safe haven for a lot of Jewish people in Germany and Europe who couldn't make it to the US and Canada from the 1930s onward. They could go there without passports and, though had to face the Japanese army like the Chinese, at least be saved from systemic murders in Europe. From all historical accounts, they were being treated kindly by the local Chinese.<br/><br/>And here's the reason why I have not watched a single film directed by Mr. Spielberg even since I saw the Empire of the Sun (mid-1980s)."

I did not care for Christian Bale's character so it made it really hard for me to care about the movie.  I also found the scene where he gets separated from his parents far too unrealistic, in fact preposterous. I have a young child and there is no way I would allow myself to be separated from her as easily as Jim's parents did, especially his father. I would have made some heads roll before I gave up and moved on without my child. The end was so unemotional it was ridiculous. I didn't even get the feeling that his parents really cared that much and they had a very difficult time recognizing their only son. You spend 2 hours watching this young boy grow up in an interment camp without the film ever attempting to show the struggle of his parents to find him. This was a glaring weakness that I just can not look past.<br/><br/>John Malkovich's character reminded me of someone out of the Mad Max movies (go figure) and added nothing.  ""Empire"" never penetrated to the heart of the characters and didn't penetrate my heart either.  Where was the storytelling in this film?  None of the characters were developed fully to identify with their struggles. Jim did not have enough substance to be the entire focus of the film. Aside from a few good cinematographic moments, this movie was way too long and way to dull.  It is different than most movies you will ever see, but that doesn't make it good.  I rank this Steven Spielberg film along with Amistad as his worst.  Forgive me for giving an honest opinion."

","Here I am, watching Empire of the Sun, expecting a decent film about a real time in world history since it is directed by Steven Spielberg and starring a young Christian Bale, one of my modern-day favorite actors. However, don't be fooled; this movie is total disappointment from start to finish. It starts with giving us some basic information about the events that shook up Shanghai in the 1940s, but then it descends into almost total nonsense that I am still trying to decipher. Don't get me wrong, Bale is pretty good here and Spielberg adds some nice shots of the landscape of China, but the script is absolute crap. There is no sense of direction or clairvoyance of where the story should go. It is more of showing us Jim go from one Japanese prison camp to another, meeting John Malkovich along the way, and running around trying to avoid being killed despite being right in the middle of warfare. Overall, Christian Bale disappoints but you can't really blame him since he was only thirteen and has done much better since. As for Spielberg, the 80s weren't real good to him except for the Indiana Jones trilogy and ET. This one is certainly not one his best work and it doesn't even feel like a Spielberg film. So, skip this and don't waste two and a half hours watching Christian Bale run all over China. There is nothing here to walk away with."

","Decided to re-watch this movie as I hadn't seen it in a good 10 years at least. It is difficult to rate. It's obviously had some time and research put into it, and is grand-scale in budget and setting, but I thought it dragged and was curiously weak of energy. Christain Bale's debut is pretty good as a bratty kid thrust into survival and the earlier scenes of Shanghai were epic to be sure, but the prison camp felt like prison to watch. I enjoyed his desperation in the early parts of having to take care of himself. John Malkovich adds some depth with his shrewd survivalist character who befriends the boy. The movie becomes bogged down in slow pace and could've used some better editing perhaps. The actors at times don't feel too engaging either. Still it has some grand scenes and settings - along with an army of extras which it make it feel more authentic. There's probably a reason why I didn't remember it well - it doesn't quite hit the mark. Look for a young Ben Stiller as an American prisoner in the latter half of the movie!"
"Adargi","10","8","16","7 November 2015"," Steven Spielberg's Best movie ever!
","GOD playing tennis: that's what Jim Graham (Christian Bale), a privileged British schoolboy living in high colonial style in the pre-Pearl Harbor Shanghai of 1941, sees in one of his dreams. God taking a photograph: Jim thinks he sees that four years and seemingly several lifetimes later, as a starving, exhausted prisoner witnessing the brilliant light of the atomic bomb.<br/><br/>What transpires in between, the sweeping story of Jim's wartime exploits after he is separated from his family, is set forth so spectacularly in Steven Spielberg's ''Empire of the Sun'' that the film seems to speak a language all its own. In fact it does, for it's clear Mr. Spielberg works in a purely cinematic idiom that is quite singular. Art and artifice play equal parts in the telling of this tale. And the latter, even though intrusive at times, is part and parcel of the film's overriding style.<br/><br/>Yes, when Jim crawls through swampy waters he emerges covered with movie mud, the makeup man's kind; when he hits his head, he bleeds movie blood. It's hard not to be distracted by such things. But it's also hard to be deterred by them, since that same movie-conscious spirit in Mr. Spielberg gives ''Empire of the Sun'' a visual splendor, a heroic adventurousness and an immense scope that make it unforgettable.<br/><br/>There are sections of ''Empire of the Sun'' that are so visually expressive they barely require dialogue (although Tom Stoppard's screenplay, which streamlines J. G. Ballard's autobiographical novel, is often crisp and clever). Its first half hour, for example, could exist as a silent film -an extraordinarily sharp evocation of Shanghai's last prewar days, richly detailed and colored by an exquisite foreboding. Jim is first seen singing in a church choir (the Welsh hymn ''Suo Gan'' will echo again hauntingly later in the story), then gliding through crowded streets in his family's chauffeur- driven Packard. At home, he asks his parents off-handed questions about the coming war. When the three of them, elaborately costumed, heedlessly leave home for a party on the other side of the city, it's clear that their days there are numbered just from the way the Chinese servants wave goodbye.<br/><br/>That first glimpse of the choirboys will prompt audiences to wonder which of these well-groomed, proper little singers is to be the film's leading man. Mr. Bale, who emerges from the choir by singing a solo, at first seems just a handsome and malleable young performer, another charming child star. But the epic street scene that details the Japanese invasion of the city and separates Jim from his parents reveals this boy to be something more. As Mr. Bale, standing atop a car amid thousands of extras and clasping his hands to his head, registers the fact that Jim is suddenly alone, he conveys the schoolboy's real terror and takes the film to a different dramatic plane. This fine young actor, who appears in virtually every frame of the film and ages convincingly from about 9 to 13 during the course of the story, is eminently able to handle an ambitious and demanding role.<br/><br/>But other episodes are less sharply defined. When Jim, who has proudly won his right to live in the American barracks, returns to the British camp in which he formerly lived, it takes a moment to remember why he's back - not because the motive is unclear, but because his departure from the one place and return to the other are separated by intervening scenes.<br/><br/>Still, there are many glorious moments here, among them Jim's near- religious experiences with the fighter planes he sees as halfway divine (in one nighttime scene, the sparks literally fly). And there is a full panoply of supporting characters, including Miranda Richardson, who grows more beautiful as her spirits fade, in the role of a married English woman who both mothers Jim and arouses his early amorous stirrings. It is the mothering that seems to matter most, for Jim's small satchel of memorabilia includes a magazine photograph of a happy family, a picture he takes with him everywhere. For a surrogate father, he finds the trickier figure of Basie (John Malkovich), a Yank wheeler-dealer with a sly Dickensian wit. Basie, who by turns befriends Jim and disappoints him, remains an elusive character, but Mr. Malkovich brings a lot of fire to the role. ''American, are you?'' one of his British fellow prisoners asks this consummate operator. ''Definitely,'' Mr. Malkovich says.<br/><br/>''Gone With the Wind'' is playing at the biggest movie theater in Shanghai when the Japanese are seen invading that city, and ''Gone With the Wind'' is a useful comparison, at least in terms of subject and style. The makers of that film didn't really burn Atlanta; that wasn't their method. They, too, as Mr. Spielberg does, let the score sometimes trumpet the characters' emotions unnecessarily, and they might well have staged something as crazy as the ''Empire of the Sun'' scene in which the prisoners find an outdoor stadium filled with confiscated art and antiques and automobiles, loot that's apparently been outdoors for a while but doesn't look weatherbeaten in the slightest. Does it matter? Not in the face of this film's grand ambitions and its moments of overwhelming power. Not in the light of its soaring spirits, its larger authenticity, and the great and small triumphs that it steadily delivers."

","I love kids - nice, behaved kids but young Christian Bale in here, despite growing up to be a fine actor, plays a character as annoying as hell. He does nothing - at least in the first half of the film - but run around speaking gibberish, making no sense. Then he switches gears totally in the second half. Never is he a realistic kid; almost always is he irritating.<br/><br/>Also, a big factor in why this film disappointed me was that it simply was too long, and too melodramatic. I like the photography. I've never seen a Steven Spielberg movie that wasn't eye candy.<br/><br/>Another drawback of this film is needlessly confusing. Many people came out of the theater had no clue what this was all about. Some people are always afraid to admit it, so I am glad to see some reviewers here comment honestly on that.<br/><br/>I also see too many negative messages from Spielberg films, this being one more example. He likes to show kids being smarter than adults, he's extremely PC-minded, too much so, so ethnic groups are always shown better than Anglos, and cheating and lying are fine for kids and others as long as they help achieve the object. That's in here with Bale's character ""Jamie Graham.""<br/><br/>It isn't all bad; there are sincerely touching movies and, for many, profound messages. It has the usual anti-war message. The acting is great all around. John Malkovich, as always, is fun to watch. There is a good mixture of drama, intrigue, wonder and awe as in most Spielberg films. <br/><br/>It's just that ""Jamie"" dominates the film, start-to-finish, and most of the time he is a pain in the butt.

","I don't know what it is that I missed about this ""epic"" film, but from the 15 minute mark on I was weighing whether to press stop or not. Christian Bale did an excellent job, no doubt: an excellent job at being extremely annoying. The first half of the movie he is running around speaking nonsense like a mongoloid, and then he switches to being like an old senile man.<br/><br/>I admit, maybe there is some symbolism I should have picked up that I didn't, but the story had no form. I kept wishing that people would just stop helping this kid so that he'd get out of the story. John Malkovich did a good job (ie., I liked his character), but I had no idea who he was or why he did the things he did. It was the same with every other character: who were they? No one knows. Why were they going here? Saying this? Doing that? Total mystery. At one point, a japanese officer of some sort comes in to the dorm and beats a main character severely. But we have no idea why because they speak in japanese (I can't understand it, maybe you can). The only reason I can think of is that he stole japanese soap.<br/><br/>Other things that confused me: Some of Jim's (Jaime's) lines seem totally strange: like he's a mental patient or something. It makes no sense. One second he's a helpless child and the next he's some philosopher? And the crawling through the weeds being pursued by a Jap soldier? Why?<br/><br/>All in all, I just never understood what the movie was about. I appreciated the music (though boys choirs don't do it for me like they do for Mr. Jackson) and I liked the sunset scenes (with the pilots preparing to leave for kamakazi missions), but I never truly began to care about any of the characters, except maybe the japanese boy who is like Jim's counterpart on the other side - though I still don't know what his significance was.<br/><br/>I'd advise to skip this movie, unless you feel like mocking the annoying kid with some friends (over some alcohol of some sort, you'll need it). But it's not even one of those ""I'm gonna see this just because this guy hated it so much."" Just annoying."

"MartinHafer","6","8","17","28 December 2011"," A misfire....though a nice looking misfire.
","Like so many of Steven Spielberg's films, this one received a butt-load of Oscar nominations--but no wins (""Empire of the Sun"" was nominated for six technical awards).<br/><br/>The movie begins with a VERY young Christian Bale playing a bratty and rather annoying child of British nationals living very well in war-torn China just before the British and Americans were pulled into this war. Like too many westerners, his family seemed to care very little about the war or the Chinese people so it feels a bit like karma when the war does come and the child is separated from his parents when Shanghai is invaded. For the rest of the film, the child grows up a scrounger--eking out a survival in a Japanese-run internment camp. Life is miserable and the film VERY episodic--as it jumps very quickly from December, 1941 to 1945--with nothing in-between.<br/><br/>While the film has many glowing reviews, I couldn't help but feel extremely disconnected from the movie. Part of it, as I mentioned above, is the episodic quality of the film. Part of it is because Christian Bale's character is amazingly tough to like. Initially, he's a really annoying kid. Later, he's not as bad but with the ENTIRE film resting on young Bale's shoulders, it just becomes tedious. In fact, this VERY slow pacing is the biggest problem with the film, as about 30 minutes could have been sliced out of it OR they could have developed more of the adult characters. Regardless, I really couldn't wait for this technically astounding but very dull film to end."

I did feel empathy for him when he was alone in his house but after that I didn't feel much. There was something missing from the performance here-frankly, he wasn't a warm character. In fact, there isn't even one character that I truly loved in this film and for me that is very, very unusual. I like all types of films and I think my collection reflects that. But this didn't work for me. Therefore, I wouldn't really recommend this to anyone. I found the documentary that comes with the film much more interesting than the film itself.

Firstly I have not read Mr Ballard's book, but I seriously doubt whether any boy of his age at that time ran about acting like a three year old. Also the very strange way he can order the Japanese about. Good god, the Japanese prison camp guards were bloody sadists. Do you seriously think they'd take orders from a young boy who is an enemy. My backside they would. Another thing. Mr Spielberg seems to have a fetish for putting Brits, English people in particular as cowardly suck ups to Americans. This can be said of our current prime minister Mr T Blair, but not of your average Brit in the war. Absolute garbage, does not deserve any praise. Just a badly acted, stereotyped, film."

","EMPIRE OF THE SUN is a gem of movie-making. Visually arresting from start to finish, given a sumptuous musical score by John Williams and some of the finest cinematography ever seen, it is hard to understand why the film is not as highly acclaimed as it ought to be...nor is it fitting that it was nominated for six Academy Awards but received none.<br/><br/>It's a sweeping epic but depends on capturing your interest by giving the main burden to the young Christian Bale who certainly has one of the great child roles of a lifetime as Jim--and becomes the character so completely that his final reunion with his parents brings tears to the eyes. By that time, the viewer has been through so much with him, watching as he grows from spoiled rich kid to a wily boy who must fend for himself among the wolf-pack of prisoners interred by the Japanese.<br/><br/>Basically, it's the real life story of one boy's survival during the outbreak of World War II when he is separated from his British parents during the evacuation of Shanghai. It is a spectacularly staged evacuation scene that is topped throughout by other scenes of visual splendor and poignant moments that stay in the memory long after the film is over. The boy's fascination with the beauty of planes and the horrors of war are well documented--as is his strange fascination with the Japanese and his doomed friendship with a Japanese boy.<br/><br/>The film falls squarely on the shoulders of Christian Bale, so much so that the supporting players are never fully fleshed characters. However, all of them within a limited range--including John Malkovich, Miranda Richardson and Nigel Havers--do magnificent jobs. Steven Spielberg's direction cannot be faulted. He has given us a closeup glimpse of war and its effect on people that can only be rivaled by his later masterwork, SCHINDLER'S LIST.<br/><br/>Technically, the film is a brilliant achievement in all of its World War II details. And Christian Bale certainly deserved an Oscar for what has to be one of the strongest performances ever given by a child actor, with never a false step, every nuance just perfect."

The kid babbles incessantly and all I wanted to do was stuff a sock in his mouth. Not only that but there is very little that is believable about this child. Yes, he likes planes, but how many kids, in the middle of a crowd hysteria scene are gonna be playing with a toy plane rather than trying to escape like everyone else? Or how about when he goes back to his home and finds it empty - he just takes up residence until all the canned food is gone before even thinking about trying to find help. There is something so insufferable about this child that, try as I might, I never cared about him at all. He seemed totally self-involved - even concerning his parents. I'm not putting down Christian Bale here as much as I am the script that he is forced to follow. Same problem in a sense with John Malkovitch. He is basically a scurrilous character - but it is difficult to decide exactly what we are supposed to think about him. At one point he just completely abandons the kid - but that doesn't stop the kid from thinking they are ""friends""... doesn't hold together at all. Children understand disloyalty... instead of mistrusting him the kid does everything he can to please him. He finds a far more suitable mentor in the doctor - but is continually drawn back to Malkovitch. Not very believable at all.

","Before he was chopping up prostitutes on Wall Street, Christian Bale was the boy standing on top of an air-traffic control tower, cheering as American bombers laid waste to the airstrip of the Japanese POW camp he was currently a resident of. As a pampered British boy named Jim ""Jamie"" Graham who is separated from his parents following the fall of Shanghai before American involvement in World War II, Bale is simply astounding. A young performer at 12, he is forced to grow up fast as a prisoner of the ruling Japanese forces, making friends wherever he can, including American Basie (John Malkovich), his pal Frank (Joe Pantoliano), and even the young Kamikaze pilot who lives in the barracks on the other side of the fence. ""Empire of the Sun,"" an adaptation of the novel by J.G. Ballard, is often cited as one of director Steven Spielberg's weakest films, but I beg to differ. It is well known that he has a special place in his heart for WWII, and it's something he loves and loathes. It's a coming-of-age tale that really understands the grueling nature of the reality it depicts, and despite its ""PG"" rating, is still something for a mature audience. We're with Jamie the entire way, who is only 12, remember, yet he has already seen enough to last a lifetime. The only major gripe with this picture is its running time, and some scenes do tend to drag on for far too long, but that's only a minor grievance in a tale that is truly epic.<br/><br/>10/10"

","This is truly Spielberg's best movie. In my opinion, it is one of the best movies of all times. It is a movie so laced with symbolism and incredible imagery that it takes multiple viewings, sometimes in slow motion replay, to catch the significance of it all. The title, ""Empire of the Sun"" is not about Japan, but about the empire of the SON. This is a story about an amazing young boy, very gifted and a consummate survivor. The movie is about HIS empire that he builds in the midst of incredible adversity. The painting of a couple putting their child to bed and giving ""security"" is very effectively laced throughout the film. The very capable son seeks this security in earnest. Another special moment is when Jamie sees the incredible light of ""Mrs Victor"" going into heaven. The symbolic light was from the atomic bomb over Hiroshima, bringing to the ""victors"" what they sought. This movie is a true classic, unfortunately underrated by so many who have not taken the time to see the symbolism it contains."

","William Goldman got it right when he called ""Saving Private Ryan"" a detestable piece of crap for people who enjoy balloons. It belongs with ""Schindler's List"" in the realms of children's film-making, which Spielberg tackled better with the Indiana Jones films, but which here is marketed inexplicably as ""adult film-making"", thereby denigrating that term and infantilizing further the adult genre.<br/><br/>Watching ""Ryan"" is an entirely passive experience in which we feel compelled to admire the artistry with which an entirely trite and simplistic, but also flattering and complacency inducing, ""message"" is instilled in the audience. There's something altogether sinister about propagating the idea that tyranny/evil is an alien and foreign characteristic.<br/><br/>All Spielberg's ""serious films"" are stuck firmly in the past. He takes a historical event which we readily recognise - some event with motifs, symbols, easily recognisable moments, images and values - and then spits it all back out at us. ""Ryan"" is Spielberg's ""ultimate WW2 history lesson"", summing up American's most basic understanding of WW2: WW2 was a noble war, Uncle Sam cares about his troops, General Marshall takes personal interest in every fallen soldier, the enemy are faceless, skinhead Aryan barbarians, American is good, Hitler is evil, the SS intended to enslave the world, America won the war, remember this, be good, patriotic and earn it.<br/><br/>But it's all a myth. WW2 was not a Good War nor was it fought on altruistic grounds. It was a war based on staggering hypocrisies and waged for old fashion Imperialist reasons. All wars need to be sold and WW2 was one of the most carefully plotted lies in history. But Spielberg reduces it to false myths; a series of recognisable signs and second hand iconography. Flags. Heroes. Death. Honor. Shut up and love your country. <br/><br/>Like Gibson's ""Passion of Christ"", this is a supremely evil film which asks us to exalt dead Christ soldiers for dying so that we may be free. Both films offer orgies of cruelty and suffering, bogus mythologies regenerated with techno-wizardry and masochistic point-of-view shots which serve, not to disgust us, but to celebrate the necessity of gore. This is sadomasochism as public-consumption spectacle, succumbing thoroughly to the Cult of the Military/Church. The Cult which says that Freedom isn't free, and that the cost of freedom is blood which must be periodically sacrificed on the altar of Liberty by the military/clergy. This kind of thinking tends to believe that we only have freedom because we are allowed it by the government/God, and that, not only should be grateful for it and turn an unquestioning devotion onto the government/military/church, but that when the ""timeless call"" (the name of another Spielberg propaganda piece) comes, we should be ready and willing to die.<br/><br/>The film's only function is for the audience to exclaim: ""Look at those amazing special effects! Gimme more!"" While its covert purpose is the jingoistic and chauvinistic regeneration of nationalist ideology, the very ""evil"" that the film's context was supposedly attempting to overcome. Couple this with the film's warped sense of civic virtue (ie: to be a true member of society, you must ""be good"" and earn your keep) and you have a pretty fascist picture. <br/><br/>""Ryan"" pretends to be a realistic, morally nuanced film about the war, but in reality it's psychologically inauthentic slice of fascism. It's a character driven piece with no actual characters. It's a show reel of scenes stolen from at least 50 other war films (A Walk In The Sun, Beach Red, Bataan, Objective Burma, Guadalcanal Diary etc). End result, a couple of technically amazing battle sequences bookending two hours of propaganda. Simply shaking the camera does not equate to realism.<br/><br/>Far from ""revolutionising the way we see war"", ""Ryan"" adds nothing to our perception of war. There is nothing beyond the gunfire. Nothing to distinguish it from any war film released between 1943 and 1963. Ten years on and the film's sole effect has been to influence a series of next generation computer games which recreate the exhilaration of combat in this new, pseudo-documentary style. In some cases, entire scenes from ""Ryan"" are recreated as levels for kids to play. ""Ryan"" isn't war, it's just action. It's Spielberg playing with toy soldiers (Spielberg's first film as a kid was a playful war movie).<br/><br/>So make no mistake, this isn't realism. The real D-day landing was painfully slow and lasted countless hours. Combat is banal, mundane and always less seductive than its celluloid representation. What the film really ""accomplished"" was the successful marrying of the ""pornography of violence"", its unrelentingly brutal voyeurism, with extreme, pro-nationalist ideology. The audience responds by ""enjoying"" watching the film, never bothering to actually address the underlying fascism.<br/><br/>""Empire of the Sun"" is likewise a cartoonish film for those who like balloons. Jim (Christian Bale) is a wealthy child who lives in war torn Shanghai. Spielberg touches upon a couple issues (class, fantasy, loss of childhood) but the main gimmick is that Jim lives in a fantasy world of comic book heroes and fighter jets and so is able to somewhat resist the horrors around him. His fantasies are only shattered when the illusion of his parents is confronted by reality. Jim's reunited with his family and is now safe from harm, but spiritually, he's dead. Unfortunately, Spielberg never commits to the bleakness of Ballard's vision. For Spielberg, what Jim's been through was only a consequence of mommy and son being separated. <br/><br/>Ignoring the fact that the film is saccharine, tasteless and that the musical score undermines every emotion, it's annoying to see how Spielberg romanticises the Japanese Army and portrays the Chinese (the historical victims) as a bunch of idiots. Watch how the Japanese Army never kill so much as a single person, implying that the worst of its conduct relied upon repossessing real estate and partially neglecting the medical and sustenance needs of westerners in captivity. Oh the horror.<br/><br/>5/10"

"gheremond","10","5","10","19 August 2015"," Spielberg's magnum opus
","I consider this the best Spielberg film and one of the best anti-war films ever, right up there with the likes of Paths of Glory or Thin Red Line. Far from things like Saving Private Ryan or Schindler's List or Munich, where Spielberg tries to shoehorn himself into the persona of the mature and serious filmmaker, Empire of the Sun is as close to his sensibilities as any material could ever hope to be. The telling of the horrors of World War 2 through the eyes of a child has never been done better. I guess if Miyazaki ever made a live action WW-II film, you'd get something similar to Empire of the Sun. <br/><br/>Yep, that's Christian Bale there. Spielberg is well known for ferreting great child performances out of his young stars, but in this case, Christian Bale burns through the screen in his devastating portrayal of young Jim in what is probably the best performance by a child actor ever. During the course of the film, you see Jim going from his pampered existence as the son of a British diplomat in Shanghai through a harrowing physical and emotional transformation, as he loses his family, his home, his childhood and eventually his self. Ending up in a Japanese concentration camp where deprivation and death are on the daily agenda, the young protagonist finds himself desperately clinging to his last remnants of childhood innocence, his love for flight and airplanes or the British culture of a country he hasn't even seen in order to retain some semblance of sanity. I don't believe Bale ever topped this one in his later career.<br/><br/>Right from the first scene, with the boats moving through a harbor crowded with coffins to the final one, with Jim's childhood in the form of a bag floating on the waters, this is classic Spielberg, along with the haunting and poignant Williams score. If there ever was a film to land him Oscar recognition, this should have been it. Despite its rather heavy themes, its is also highly re-watchable. If you love the early Spielberg fare of the 80's but missed this one, check it out, you are in for a treat."
"its_jimbo","9","5","10","5 January 2014"," A must see for so many reasons!
","I will try to limit the spoilers but I just don't think you can review this movie without mentioning a few of the most powerful images. The scene when young Jamie (played by the then 13 year old Christian Bale) separates from his parents in an unraveling Shanghai and then of course at the end when his parents find him make the movie on must see on their own. The time between, watching Jim (Jamie) evolve to deal with the surroundings he faces are incredibly well depicted by Bale despite is very young age.<br/><br/>The movie is uneven and frustrating. There are times you wish someone would behave in a way we could actually like them, but none of them do. There are characters we do not expect much from but Bazie is someone we hope finally sees the value of Jim and caring for him, but he is just too cynical to do what he should. It is certainly a part John Malkovich is born to play, but still I was hoping he might be different by the end of the movie.<br/><br/>The visuals are sensational, the sound first rate and the film making excellent, but still one never quite knows for sure what the purpose of the adulation for the Japanese was. They clearly were evil aggressors in their behavior to all of Asia - I think Spielberg was a bit too forgiving with regards to the Japanese. Still these are more minor complaints, the movie should be seen by all. This movie brings tears to me face EVERY time I see it. I cannot think of any other movie that does that with such regularity. I recommend it to all!"

I also like all of the details it shows about the Chinese people and Japanese Army, such as the tanks close up. The only part that is too sad for me is that a really gorgeous blonde lady (Mrs Victor played by Miranda Richardson) dies. I like Jaime's comments about the atomic bomb.

","This was a poignant film about the loss of innocence, capturing the full depth of the semi-autobiographical book by J.G. Ballard on which it is based. With the Japanese invading 1940s Shanghai, British schoolboy Jim Graham is separated from his parents and undergoes a remarkable journey of survival. After losing his parents in the rush of the crowd, he follows his mother's instructions to go home, only to find the house seized by the Japanese. Nevertheless, he remains there for several weeks, surviving on canned food and hoping that his mother will return. Desperate for an adult figure, he tries to surrender to the Japanese in a funny and heart-breaking scene and is eventually taken in by an American fugitive, Basie. While Basie eventually fills that role, his motives are from pure; Basie's influence and the harsh circumstances of the internment camp see Jim gradually wisen up to the ways of the world. Despite this, Jim retains a certain warmth and goodness of heart that endear the viewer to him. We also witness Jim's conflict of loyalties - he recognises how cruel the Japanese are, yet admires them for the bravery and can't quite identify with England.<br/><br/>Jim experienced so many complex emotions throughout and Spielberg has done an amazing job of conveying them via the cinematography and dialogue. The soundtrack was perfection. Altogether, the film is highly commendable for distilling the book's essence and packing a powerful emotional punch. While I still think that people should read the book simply because it's a masterpiece, the movie is fantastic in capturing the heart and soul of the story."

His performance was great, even for a young actor who is less known at the time. John Malkovich and Miranda Richardson are great too.

Empire of the Sun is probably Spielberg's best film, without a doubt. The cinematography in this film is astounding. Everything is real, no CGI to throw the reality off in the mind which makes this movie so moving. I don't know how Spielberg filmed half of this movie, all I can say is ""a LOT of time!"".<br/><br/>Empire of the Sun is a very emotional film, and all aspects of being a prisoner of war are very detailed. John Malkovich and Joe Pantoliano had outstanding performances in this film, not to mention Christian Bale's performance was just uncanny for his age.

See Jim learn Japanese and ingratiate himself with the guards! See Jim's dreams come true as a B-51 flies so close to him that he can even see the pilot even waving at him! I felt nauseous at the end, not because of the magnitude of suffering and death depicted, but because in spite of it, the movie is nothing more than yet another paltry triumph-of-the-human-spirit-over-adversity flick.

","Never wrote a comment about a movie, this is the first time. About this movie ? I know that people does love or hate this movie...well I'm with the first group. Perhaps because I read the book from J.Ballard and found it a very interesting and compelling reading. The movie from Spielberg is a very original interpretation of the book. It's impossible to find a definition for this movie, it's not a common war movie or a common dramatic movie. As happens in the book, also in the movie everything is saw from the point of view of a boy that has a lot of imagination (...in fact he will become a writer). The reality often is merged with hallucinations ( the atom bomb ). Jim is a weird boy with a strong will to survive, attracted by the loneliness and sadness of Japanese pilots which he feels near to his own condition. I saw all the movie from Spielberg and I don't like him ( I'm the kind of man that like things like I.Bergman, Ozu etc. ) But this movie is different, it's the only movie from Spielberg that I really like. Perhaps, despite the falls that somebody see, it must have something magic inside that can hit somebody, but not everyone. For me it's an unforgettable movie."

I admit that not having seen all of it may seem to make my opinion less valid, but let me add that this is the first time ever I have been so disgusted and annoyed by any movie. I am usually very forgiving and don't mind a flawed film if it has some redeeming qualities. But this... Every single line of dialog and every bit of acting made me cringe. The main character, an incredibly dumb, mean and arrogant kid is by far the most annoying character I have ever seen. And yes, I have seen Jar Jar Binks. I stopped watching when I found myself thinking that even if the remaining two hours of the film would be scenes of this kid being tortured, it wouldn't make up for what was done to me in the first 30 minutes."
"savage-grrrl","2","9","23","2 February 2008"," Much Ado About Nothing
","Steven Spielberg is a sadist. If this movie isn't evidence enough then I direct your attention to ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" He tortured the animated shoes to death. Enough said.<br/><br/>This film centers around another ineffectual protagonist though it isn't his fault as he is the offspring of ineffectual parents. It is very hard to care much about any of them as they persist at calling their unfortunate fates down upon their own heads. One could try to argue that this is a coming of age film and that the young Jim isn't responsible for the actions he takes at the start of the film, but he isn't that young and he doesn't manage to evolve so much as become further damaged.<br/><br/>Visually this film would have been stunning if Spielberg wasn't busy beating the audience about the head with his ""poignant"" images -- footsteps in powder blowing away when a window is opened, a building sized poster for ""Gone with the Wind"" as the cruel wind blows on our downtrodden hero, the trappings of aristocracy gathered and abandoned in an empty arena that is occupied by the starving masses. We get it, but does he? Just to make sure we don't miss the point that war is hell he kills off Jim's young Japanese friend after the danger has cleared for everyone else. It is a senseless act of violence just like war; or is just gratuitous for the pleasure of a man hellbent on prolonging the pain of his audience? In typical Spielberg fashion, within moments the death is forgotten and a happy ending is had by all -- except, of course, the expendable minority character."
"rmax304823","6","8","20","6 April 2007"," This Boy's Life
","Just after Pearl Harbor the Japanese move into Shangai, separating Jim (Christian Bale) from his parents. After wandering around the city for a while he winds up in an internment camp, tutored by Fagin, I mean Basie (John Malkovitch), in the fine arts of theft, arrogating the advantages of the dead, swapping favors for fancy golf shoes, and so on. Basie doesn't really care as much about Jim as he does about survival and in the end has no qualms about deserting him and his best pal, Joe Pantoliano, without a word or, as far as we can tell, a second thought. When the atomic bomb demolishes two cities, the Japanese leave the camp. Jim wanders around a bit more before his parents finally locate him and take him away.<br/><br/>Now kids, before you get lost, this is World War II we're talking about here. The USA got into it in 1941 and it ended in 1945. Shanghai was on the coast of China and it was a very cosmopolitan city, and it's becoming one again. The Japanese fought on one side and the US, Britain, and China (more or less) fought against them. Now I hope you're paying attention because, if not, you will be punished by having to read a big fat book on Chinese history.<br/><br/>The performances are pretty good. Nice occasional use of Chopin, but John Williams' score tells us what to think and feel in no uncertain terms. In this respect it serves as an almost perfect complement to Steven Spielberg's effective and technically superb direction. Every shot of an airplane -- whether a home-made model or a P-51 -- is accompanied by a heavenly choir. So are celestial orbs. During moments that elicit sentiment we have a Welsh lullaby. The whole film is evocative and visually splendid.<br/><br/>It nicely joins art with artifice. Commercially it could be described as a ""crossover"" movie. There's nothing much in it to offend any of the ethnic groups it deals with. Yes, the aristocratic Brits are a little snobby and unfeeling. And the Americans are scoundrels. But those are projections from inside the social borders. Brits and Americans can take it from one of their own. The Chinese for the most part are anonymous, except that once in a while they slap the kid's face while stealing his piano or a street thug beats Jim while trying to pull off his shoes in an alley. (I guess if you're going to offend someone you might as well make it the Chinese.) <br/><br/>The Japanese are treated naturalistically. Some are friendlier and gentler than others but all of them show human emotions, even if the emotions are rage. We shouldn't be surprised that the Japanese at the internment camp whomp prisoners who defy their orders. My God, what they did to their own recruits at the Eta Navel Academy would make Parris Island look like Esalen. Japanese culture historically has been an odd blend of delicacy and cruelty, exemplified in the title of Ruth Benedict's ""The Chrysanthemum and the Sword."" The longest section has to do with the prison camp and it's a little confusing in its details although we get the general picture. Everything seems to depend on whether you can find those extra cigarettes or swipe an additional potato. Erving Goffman described this sort of ""total institution"" and its ""small reward system"" evocatively.<br/><br/>It's a big and generous film that spells ""epic"" with every frame. I don't know where it intended going though. There are some scenes that absolutely MUST have been lifted directly from Ballard's autobiographical novel. Footprints in the ashes that cover the bedroom floor. Jim, the central character, seems to have learned something. He begins as a superior snot, learns to survive while roughing it in a place where kids get no passes, and in the end comes full circle and goes home with his parents, presumably changed, in the sense of having discovered that, though survival comes first, there are boundaries beyond which behavior turns indecent."
"johnnyboyz","7","4","8","11 March 2012"," Near immaculately put together wartime tale about a boy winding up on a front-line of poverty and hard times.
","Empire of the Sun is a gruelling child orientated character piece which taps into a child's fear of isolation as well as going all out in being a thoroughly engrossing war drama with a keen eye on depicting the horrors such an event. The film will begin and end with that of a container, of sorts, floating easily along a water way. They are, however, two very different containers carrying very different things and yet are intrinsically linked by the fact that what they possess are effectively deceased and gone. Where coffins housing the dead line a river during the opening few shots, a small suitcase in possession of the belongings held throughout by that of a certain character is seen gently floating off and away; the image signifying times having moved on, that the 'old' character is gone and a new, more-exposed-to-the-world in ways which would have never normally happened, is here.<br/><br/>That character is Jamie Graham, played by Christian Bale; an infant initially living in the Chinese city of Shanghai just prior to Japan's attack on the American naval base at Pearl Harbour and as a consequence, the majority of the Pacific's nations official entry into World War Two. He lives an affluent life with his rich parents, a blazer-clad boy singing harmoniously in a church when we first see him and later chauffeured back to a huge manor house in a neighbourhood firmly informing us of how he lives. What is more revealing, however, is the trawl home through the grime of some of the less desirable places native to the country; paupers and beggars, one of whom sits outside the property, sharing eye contact with Jamie in a reflective moment like they were from separate planets.<br/><br/>Jamie loves his aeroplanes, and upon finding a downed fighter in a field during a function some miles away, clambers into it so as to enthusiastically act out war-games as if the pilot. Said notion is often found in war films which mistake acts of warfare as processions of action, and thus ought to be shot or constructed as exciting when the harsh reality of the subject is that they're anything but. Spielberg's film is more a project depicting someone taken from their bubbled existence and thrust into a limelight of real wartime poverty and survival thus forcing reflection. Events cause the film to progress into what is essentially a prisoner of war movie, but a prisoner of war film keeping clear of sugar coating such a situation and doing well to maintain a sense of causality mired down in the turgidness and ugliness of a wartime scenario moreover the bouncy, joyous one more inclined to rear up when escape is the sole purpose of the film's exercise.<br/><br/>Once everything has happened away from where we are, and the Japanese have formally invaded this territory given their entry into the war, Jamie is separated from his parents in a street-set panic so returns to his home for a series of scenes shot as if the apocalypse has just happened or a nationwide epidemic has occurred forcing isolation and hiding. What is impressive is how the film goes about depicting Jamie's central transition, a film full of extended sequences and unbroken takes of young Jamie stumbling through a series of post invasion streets as he evades thieves his age and strives for aid in places he will not find it. In the background, things are blurred and the choice of angles at specific times are effective. Later on, things will appear to aesthetically 'normalise', as inceptions give way to a getting used to this newfound existence, it is through Americans Frank Demarest (Pantoliano) and John Malkovich's Basie; a seaman who lives out of a wrecked freighter in a harbour Jamie finds his feet.<br/><br/>When one thinks back to Spielberg's oeuvre, specifically from that of the 1980s, Empire of the Sun is not the film which immediately comes to mind, and that is a shame - although not as much as the fact that the likes of 1984's Temple of Doom might very well do instead. It slots into a canon of around the time, let's say beginning in 1982 with E.T. and ending with Hook in 1991, depicting children or even children being exposed to a rawer situation than what was already evident in their lives √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú when the movies Spielberg is churning out aren't made with a childlike enthusiasm, he seems to be able to get into the lives of minors and pull off the depicting of their plights; plights which carry that uneasy sense of both adventure and awe at their finding themselves in an unparallelled situation in a far off place, but fear of what is essentially the unknown. In Empire of the Sun, Spielberg veers off and away into a depiction of such things more inclined to being as good as his tale of a young boy coming into contact with an alien in E.T. than he does explore the freewheeling emotions of a young boy caught up in an adventure akin to Indiana Jones' in Temple of Doom, or indeed any of the child characters in the aforementioned Hook. It is a well played, meticulously unfolded piece clocking in at two hours but without a moment that either drags nor doesn't feels somewhat unsettling."

So, given this movie's credentials, including some spectacular screen imagery and fantastic camera work, what on earth is wrong with it?<br/><br/>Perhaps it's just that screenwriter Tom Stoppard was unable to involve us in the events of the war and the camps, no matter how he tried, leaving us feeling as if we're viewing it all from a distance. Character development may be another problem, as both Spielberg and the cast struggle to endear us to the pivotal players. Bale's character Jim is particularly hard to embrace, being a pompous, know-it-all, self-important English brat.<br/><br/>In any event Spielberg has failed to do what he set out to do here. Though he has crafted a fine film, full of eye catching scenery and top notch craftsmanship, the entire show cannot truly move, involve or otherwise affect its audience. Therefore any message or point Mr. Spielberg wished to convey is lost in this crucial lack of depth. I am sure this missing element is in J.G. Ballard's book, so all I can suggest is that you read that instead. Surprisingly disappointing.<br/><br/>Thursday, February 29, 1996 - Video"

","Empire of the Sun focuses on the life of Jim Graham (Christian Bale) who is a privileged young boy living with his wealthy family in Shanghai. Jim ends up being separated from his parents during the outbreak of war and ends up under the wing of Basie (John Malkovich) and his friend Frank Demarest (Joe Pantoliano). Soon after Jim meets Basie and Demarest, they all end up being captured and forced to spend a considerable amount of time in a Japanese POW camp.<br/><br/>For me, there were a lot of problems with this film but I think I'll get the major problem out of the way first; it's so boring!!! There seemed to be long scenes that went on forever and went nowhere - even though the film was 2 and a half hours long I found that nothing really happened - it wasn't interesting, entertaining, tense, exciting. It wasn't even particularly moving which is an effect Spielberg can normally pull off in his sleep.<br/><br/>The next problem was that the film suffered from very thin characterisation; none of the characters were developed, the friendship between Basie & Jim wasn't explored very well. Jim also becomes friends with a Japanese POW camp soldier which could have been interesting, but again wasn't developed to its full potential. I literally found myself bored, having nothing and no-one to care about. I'm not exaggerating when I say that it was a chore to sit through this dull film.<br/><br/>The final problem with this film lay with Bale's character; his almost constant whining and shouting ended up getting on my wick for the majority of the running time. He becomes less irritating towards the end, but I still found his character too much for the most part. <br/><br/>There were a couple of positives and the most obvious positive is the Cinematography; it was absolutely beautiful and almost made up for the dreadful screenplay. I also quite liked Jim's gradual transformation as the film progressed. However, these elements alone aren't enough to save this film which to me was an over-long, dull and tedious film that almost put me to sleep."

","Having just watched this film, one dimension sticks out, namely the acting of young Christian Bale. He plays a believable role that explores a plethora of emotions felt by a child caught in the middle of a war.<br/><br/>It is a sad story yet one of hope, a young boy who lives in the lap of luxury is challenged through experiences that would break the strongest of adults. Something magical happens in this film, despite the range of giant actors in this film, young Christian Bale performs in a memorable way that would understandably be expected from him today and yet he delivers his masterpiece performance at such a young age."

","Empire of the sun is the second most underrated movie I have ever seen - right after Oliver Stone's ""The Doors"". Furthermore it is perhaps the best movie Steven Spielberg has done. Just like with ""The Doors"", you have to keep wondering why it has been accepted so poorly.<br/><br/>In the end whether you like this movie or not, goes back to the question of how you think about its perspective on the events of WW2 in the ""Empire of the sun"". Some people might not even have consciously noticed that the emotional perspective of the movie is purely guided by a child's few but felt just uncomfortable about its lack of realism - and those who did consciously notice, might have neglected it merely for the fact itself.<br/><br/>As defense those who did like the movie have pointed out the deep symbolism, others have for good reason referred to its uniquely beautiful imagery. But there is something far more valuable about this movie: It is just the perspective mentioned above. What you may notice as beauty inside this movie, what others may have felt irritated about, is just its emotional point of few, which seems ""out of this world"" in the true sense of the word. In a child's mind everything you see gets a meaning different of what we are used to and often shines bright for seemingly no reason. Like this the time in an internment camp can seem like a joyful adventure, while life's disappointments can easily break your world. Like this the borders between the sides might blur as well as between right or wrong. And like this you will finally see, and have to see, the absurdity of the witnessed events, of the war itself.<br/><br/>Like this and only like this, the movie develops a slow and highly surreal maelstrom of narration, which together with breath taking images might seem almost meditative. A seldom experience of a movie!"

","This is the reason I go to see the majority of Christian Bale films whatever the subject matter. As a young man who lived in Japan, studied the language, the people, the culture, later returned to the Far East on business trips to Manchuria and Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Osaka, I can only marvel at what Director Spielberg has achieved here with a young actor worthy of Best Performance from a Juvenile Actor 1987. The making of the movie with author J.G.Ballard is also very interesting, with wonderful rapport between Director and a 13 yr old actor Christian Bale. I am waiting for Spielberg to do The Fall of Singapore in 1942, the British guns pointing out to sea expecting a naval attack, whereas the 90,000 Japanese troops cycled down the Malay Peninsula to surround 130,000 British, Australian, Canadian and Indian troops. In the Malayan jungle the tires burst on the bicycles, the Japanese rode on with just the steel rims. This sound to the British indicated the Japanese were travelling with light tanks and the British withdrew. Yamashita wanted a simple yes or no, and Percival surrendered to a smaller force. There is so much more in the history of the Pacific War for Spielberg to cover and uncover.

","Empire of the Sun is just as wonderful of an example of the ethereal, soul-grabbing magic Spielberg creates as any. It's an aggressively arresting epic that develops heavily and suddenly takes a turn with a harsh whirlwind of a dramatic tempest.<br/><br/>In his very first role at the age of twelve, Christian Bale racks the audience like a barrage of machine gun bullets, delivering sensationally in maybe the most demanding, evolving, and extensive role for a child I've ever seen in a movie. John Malkovich, as he always has, steals every scene he is in, playing the coldest but most generally charming supporting character. Among other highlights of the cast are early performances from Miranda Richardson, playing a very sorrowful Englishwoman who augments as much as she can before the chance of diminishment heightens, Nigel Havers, playing a doctor who amidst all the pressure that keeps him on edge manages to keep Bale's rampagingly passionate youngster down to earth, Joe Pantoliano, even this early in his career playing life's punching bag in the form of a nagging sidekick, and Ben Stiller, the film's biggest surprise, in a bit part among many other no-names in the group of American boys at Malkovich's feet.<br/><br/>Empire of the Sun tells a dynamic, lavish, and heartfelt story of a young English boy, adventurous and wide-eyed as can be, obsessively fascinated by airplanes, belonging to a rich family in Shanghai during WWII who is hit like a ton of bricks by the Japanese occupation. The most impressive thing about the film is its portrayal of this young boy's alien perspective of all that suddenly happens and his furiously fast learning of his situation, adapting to all that devastates his life.<br/><br/>Those who feel that slight twinge of bias against Steven Spielberg for his mind-blowing and never-ending box office success, you are really missing out on the brilliant work of one of those filmmakers who is truly a master at what a movie, like a novel, is supposed to do, which is suck you into every sensory element of the world of its characters."

","Empire of the Sun I watched this again for the second time at the weekend a wonderful enriching film. Christain Bale's Jim is distinctly unlikeable a spoilt brat who when separated from his parent's and placed in an internment camp becomes a class one survivor and all of his hither-to hidden qualities emerge and flourish. The two most memorable scenes for me are when he looks at Basie (Malkovich) sat in the puddle of water after his Japanese friend has been murdered. In that scene Jim sees Basie for what he truly is enabling Jim to move on and seek his own rescue. The second very moving scene is when Jim's parents turn up to claim Jim amidst all the other lost children being reunited. Jim stands alone neither looking to the right nor to the left unable to move or seemingly to show any emotion, his mother can be seen standing at a distance and she has recognised Jim and moves towards him, very emotive. The film I believe is one of Spielburg's best although the critics slammed it at the time of its release. It also benefits greatly from having Tom Stoppard as screen writer a very gifted and talented man."

Now, decades have passed, and I decided to watch it once one more, to see if it stood the test of time. It does, and much more. The emotional core of this film is truly one of inspiration. I am so deeply moved by Jim's journey through the horrors of war, and the loss of his innosense. If ever a war film brought home the point of the futility of war, it is this one. Experiencing these events through the eyes of a child is a unique and moving experience. Separated from his parents and his previous life, touched me deep inside...more so now than ever, myself being a parent for many years...I have an entirely different perspective on the messages brought to light in this epic tale. Christian Bale's performance is perhaps the greatest of any child star that Ive ever seen, driving home an intelligence and longing far more profound than I could have expected. Perhaps Speilberg's talent in directing children was this films greatest asset, as his typical sentimentality really works on every emotional level. The final scene, when Jim is re-united with his parents, had me in tears in 1987, and again 2019. This is truly a rare gem of a film."

","Steven Spielberg is a funny guy. He wants us to believe that the dropping of the first nuclear bombs that resulted in the death of 250 000 people, mostly civilians, was like 'God taking a photograph'. Hey, Mass Murder of Women and Children is great, if it means that this poor little American kid finally gets something to eat. How arrogant can you get, really? This film illustrates nicely why American movies are every so often of little interest to anyone outside of America, especially if they deal with international themes. Never ever occurs it to anyone involved that there is probably a view apart from that of the western world, and so the whole complexity of the Chinese/Japanese war is reduced to how much fun our jolly British fellow has in the Prisoners Camp. Oh yeah, and the boy is pretty annoying, though I bet he's supposed to represent the curious and adventurous spirit of the white upper class. John Malkovich is the only redeeming quality as far as I can tell."

Spielberg's direction is superb, and there is a thoughtful script and very touching story. Empire of the Sun also has characters that I personally did care for, pacing that didn't feel too rushed and glacial and the acting from the likes of Miranda Richardson, Nigel Havers and John Malkovich is truly terrific. Three assets especially stand out. Empire of the Sun like all of Spielberg's movies is a triumph when it comes to visuals, the cinematography, lighting, scenery and effects are all lovingly crafted. John Williams' score is also fantastic and enhances the drama, not his most iconic of his scores, that would be a three-way tie between Jaws, Schindler's List and ET, it serves its purpose very well. Lastly, Christian Bale is absolutely extraordinary in this film, I do like him very much as an actor, but I don't think I have ever seen him this powerful or poignant. Overall, a wonderful movie and one of my personal favourites from Spielberg. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"slokes","3","4","9","16 June 2015"," Painful Coming-of-Age Story
","A tough film about the cruelty of war and the death of innocence, ""Empire Of The Sun"" seems dedicated to a single point, that Stephen Spielberg can make a serious film. Unfortunately, ""serious"" is not the same as ""good.""<br/><br/>It's December, 1941. Young Jamie Graham enjoys a life of privilege in western-controlled Shanghai, China. Those good times are about to end, thanks to the very same Japanese war machine Jamie idolizes. After the tanks roll in, he is separated from his parents and forced to fend for his own in a bleak landscape.<br/><br/>Based on the real-life experiences of author J. G. Ballard, ""Empire Of The Sun"" is a story about human suffering above all. Another review here, more positive, describes it as ""a small story told on a vast canvas,"" and that captures it for me, too. It's a painterly film, with vivid imagery abounding. In that way, Spielberg often channels the director originally slated to make this, David Lean. That said, I found myself thoroughly alienated from the people and situations involved.<br/><br/>Christian Bale is a stunning actor, able at 12 to deliver the kind of performance as Jamie that raps you on the head like a two-by-four. But he's a handful. Either he's talking a mile a minute or staring off into space in some kind of feral transport. He's also really obnoxious and unlikable. This is noticed by some of the other characters, too.<br/><br/>""You're starting to get on my nerves,"" says an American scrounger he runs into in Shanghai, Frank (Joe Pantoliano).<br/><br/>""Very difficult boy,"" is the verdict of Sgt. Nagata (Masat√É¬¥ Ibu), commander of the internment camp where Jamie is sent.<br/><br/>My favorite is the response given by fellow prisoner Mrs. Victor (Miranda Richardson), when Jamie asks why the Japanese closed the schools: ""To punish their parents.""<br/><br/>You have to find things to entertain you watching ""Empire Of The Sun,"" since this is one time Spielberg won't do that for you. Like Jamie, or Jim as it becomes later, this is serious business all the way through, with starvation and disease gnawing at your elbows and hardly any hope in sight. Don't look for a bright light here; it just may be an atomic explosion.<br/><br/>""First one side feeds you, the other side tries to get you killed, then it's all turned around,"" Jim is told by his sometime buddy Basie (John Malkovich). ""It's all timing.""<br/><br/>Malkovich is in great form, as movie-star ready as he ever looked on screen, and to solid effect, but I never got his purpose here. He doesn't bond with Jim, nor figure much in the outcome. No one does; Jim just wanders around until the scene shifts, after long languors, to something else. <br/><br/>There's a desperate need here to trim, especially in the beginning and the end, but Spielberg and screenwriter Tom Stoppard are more concerned with Big Moment Cinema. We watch Jim serenade kamikaze pilots with a schoolboy chorale, and a minute later he's cheering their deaths at the top of his lungs, chanting ""P-51! Cadillac of the skies!"" If Spielberg can't engage you, he'll overwhelm you trying.<br/><br/>Spielberg has gone on to make other serious movies, and to my mind, done so more successfully even if his tendency to overpush remains. You see moments here that remind you how good he is at scene-setting, but if I said I cared for five straight minutes watching ""Empire Of The Sun,"" I'd be lying."

""People will do anything for a Potato"" Spielberg excels at 'Point of view' and this film does not disappoint. This film is about a series of 'moments' that confront and face our reality. It is a confront we can relate to. For a moment when the P51 attacks the Japanese in their POW camp you can feel the humanity arrive back in Jim's lungs..<br/><br/>The photography is nothing less than spectacular. Angles & lighting. Incredible. Tired of digital people like Gladiator? They did not exist then. I like to think of this film as one of the last made with thousands of extras. Real people. Spielberg gave us a treat, an adventure in emotional torment and we are along for the ride. Trapped in a celluloid jail of which we do not get air until we leave the theater. Spielberg takes you where you don't want to go but cannot resist looking. Like a car wreck.<br/><br/>I recommend you set aside a rainy afternoon, some popcorn, turn off your cell phone and put down your tablet. Turn off the lights and watch what happens inside of you."
"freddiebaveystock","9","4","9","22 June 2012"," A powerful tribute to JG Ballard
","Being a reader of JG Ballard can only enhance your enjoyment of this film. I'd venture the opinion that this may well be the reason why this movie didn't hit the highs expected of it: Tom Stoppard took care not to over-narrate the film through dialogue or deliver a conventional narrative, choosing instead to craft something that acts as a deeply felt tribute to the peculiar genius of JG Ballard. I honestly can't see how anyone who doesn't read Ballard can truly get what this film is driving towards.<br/><br/>In other words, it is a story about the formation of a deeply odd artist. A man who revelled in the concept of violent collision as the presiding principle of our universe: the collision of man and machine made possible through the motor engine; the collision of cultures; the collision of old and young, male and female, sane and insane, sadist and erotic; the collision of fiercely opposed world views; the collision of natural beauty with ugliness and sadism.<br/><br/>Ballard was all this, and more. To get at this, there are worse places to start than 'The Empire of the Sun' itself. However, this is possibly his most conventional book. He left it until very late in his career to fictionalise the disturbing oddity of his childhood, and it reads a little as if the material he uncovered was almost too powerful for his established style as a novelist.<br/><br/>If you read 'The Kindness of Women', its sequel insomuch as it fictionalises his adult existence, you get a great insight into how the war shaped Ballard's aesthetic. Sharper people than I have defined this, so I will simply say that it revolves around shocking juxtapositions, be that of image or emotion. He's a past master of delivering deeply emotional moments with a disturbingly clinical eye.<br/><br/>Read Spielberg's opus through this lens and you will get its peculiar genius. I salute it as a terrific collision of image-maker and writer."

The movie is very well structured, an intense story line and brilliant settings and effect that just make this an outstanding movie to view. I have watched this move on numerous occasions and still find it highly enjoyable. It always brings a tear (or a few) to my eyes at the end as the closure is splendidly touching.

","I cannot fathom why so many hated this in their reviews, however I feel that it maybe they just wasn't interested enough to understand or patience.

The story is about this child who bullied his Chinese servants to do his deeds for them when all they wanted was to teach him good (don't know how this could be contrived to be racist or calling Chinese stupid as other reviewers suggest). All he wanted to do was to fly. Now some people got confused about his fascination with Japanese planes but they need to understand that he was born in China he never saw another airplane so he didn't know any better in fact he never been outside of China as i understand the story.<br/><br/>There was a clear example of this when a former Chinese servant woman gave what that young boy truly deserved a good 'ol fashion smack.... many people said he was obnoxious and he was early but then he had to quickly change his ways just to survive. This movie shows that no one is winners in war and just how hard it would have been for a child to survive.<br/><br/>The madness of war was creeping in and the emotions of each character was all there to be seen and it didn't treat the audience like idiots (perhaps it should have treated them simple as for some people just don't get his love for Zeros) If I could get my kids to watch it and really see it for what it is, perhaps they might learn something.<br/><br/>I didn't see racism and I saw the good and the bad of all humans .... it was sad to see these fine young Japanese flyers go on their last flight for country.<br/><br/>BTW what was it about so many asked???....

","A child's point of view can change your entire perspective. Steven Spielberg has always demonstrated a gift for bringing that child-like sense of wonder and working with young actors, most notably in writing ""The Goonies"" and directing ""E.T."" In ""Empire of the Sun,"" he shows us war-torn China and Japan through the eyes of a 12-year-old Christian Bale. The 1987 war epic marks the director's first of what would become several powerful war stories and only his second dramatic feature after ""The Color Purple."" <br/><br/>There's maybe a split-second shot of some people on the street wearing swastikas, but otherwise, ""Empire of the Sun"" is not a ""same old"" World War II film. Considering the war films he's know for, kudos to Spielberg for focusing this story on one fraction of WWII and the survival of a young boy separated from his parents who is forced to lose his innocence in the throws of war.<br/><br/>Jamie (Bale), lives in a lovely home with servants and his parents in Shanghai. He's lived there his whole life as the British have had a presence there for a long time. He has a wild imagination, loves airplanes and sees the world with rose-colored glasses as he ought to at his age. When the Japanese invade in December of '41, Jamie gets separated in the streets from his parents and begins a brutal journey that ultimately brings him to Soo Chow internment camp where he's known as Jim. He carves a new life for himself as a crafty and inspiring young man.<br/><br/>Tom Stoppard, who had just received an Oscar nomination for Terry Gilliam's ""Brazil,"" doesn't provide an eventful script, but does create a compelling portrait of Jamie/Jim. His journey could rank as one of the most complete and intriguing child story lines in film history. Although the film is based on the semi-autobiographical novel by J.G. Ballard, Stoppard finds the key moments and visual symbols and metaphors to guide us through Jim's journey. <br/><br/>At first Jim's painfully naive, running up to Japanese soldiers and shouting that he surrenders. Spielberg nearly convinces us he's going to get beat to death by one of them at any moment, but he's more so lost and clueless in these early stages. We watch Jim grow wiser throughout the film, or at least craftier and more tenacious, but Spielberg makes sure that he never looks or acts like a miniature adult. At a key, tender moment sometime in the bulk of the 150-minute film, Jim confesses through tears that he can't remember what his parents look like anymore. Neither can we -- it's been that kind of journey and we've been in Jim' shoes (a pair of golf shoes for much of the film) that whole time.<br/><br/>Jim's outlook makes him an inspiring character, certainly one that adds refreshment to a war story that could have been and has been told in many ways using many different wars. This character arch is the winning feature of ""Empire of the Sun."" Little else nominates it for discussion among all-time great war films, but the perspective of a boy changes everything for the better.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"

","I didn't see this film in theaters when it came out in '87-88. I saw it on video soon after and immediately regretted passing it up on the big screen. It is a beautifully shot, evocative war film that portrays a WWII story with which most are not familiar. We don't often think of civilians caught in colonial lands when we recount WWII experiences, and this film manages to convey that story and combine it with a coming of age journey for a privileged young British boy separated from his parents in the chaos as Shanghai (I think--it could be another Chinese city)fell to the Japanese.<br/><br/>Christian Bale is having a fine career as an actor, but from the first time I saw this film I knew two things: Bale's turn in this movie may be the best by a child, ever, and, second, I was instantly an admirer, and knew his would be a career to watch. His transformation from pampered brat to wily survivor is utterly convincing, and often heartbreaking as he confronts the challenges of early adolescence w/out his parents, and in so desolate a place and time. His surrounding cast is also excellent; John Malkovich gives one of his best performances, and the British camp inmates are, as the Brits so often are, superb in their craft.<br/><br/>The storytelling is also masterful, managing to imbue the story w/ enough humorous relief to keep it from swamping itself in the tragedy of its setting. At times visually stunning, it contains scenes w/ Spielberg at his best, such as the slo-mo fly-by of the American pilot, waving at eye level to Bale standing on the roof of one of the camp's buildings, or the horizon-line night shot of the bombing of faraway docks.<br/><br/>I have been espousing the virtues of this film for close to 20 years, and I still don't think I can name 10 people I know who've seen it. It is a treasure of American Cinema, in my opinion, and I hope in some way Bale's superstar success with the Batman franchise may re-awaken film lovers to this title, and introduce it to a new generation."

","I first watched 'Empire of the Sun' fairly recently and I'm appalled with myself for never watching such a masterpiece earlier.<br/><br/>Empire of the Sun is a film adaption of the popular autobiography by JG Ballard which follows the life of a young boy, Jim (played by Christian Bale) where he embarks on an unforgettable and life-changing adventure when Shanghai is invaded by Japanese troops during World War 2.<br/><br/>Jim is separated from his parents and is forced to fend for himself on the streets of Shanghai. He eventually befriends an American called Basie (John Malkovich) and together they survive the Japanese internment camps run by the Japs.<br/><br/>A spectacular performance by a young Bale and a realistic representation of the War marks this film one of the greatest of our generation."

","I saw this film in the theater when it first came out, simply because I had family in China at the beginning of WW2 who would also wind up in one of the camps. The depths of the film really surprised me...the idea that a CHILD could produce this kind of emotion in a film astonished me. The transformation from Jamie to Jim is almost palpable, and you wind up wishing that you could take this kid home with you, after he finally loses the spoiled little boy routine. Christian Bale was simply remarkable. John Malkovich, as Basie, was simply doing what he does best; playing the strange, disjointed character that he seems to gravitate to. You want nothing more than to shoot Basie himself when Basie tries to ""protect"" Jim from the young Japanese pilot. <br/><br/>The film stays with you for a long time. I know that Spielberg didn't get the kind of reviews that he did for some of his other films (Schindler's List for example) but while it didn't have the same kind of impact as Schindler, it still was miraculous in its own way. You can almost smell the exhaust of the ""Cadillacs of the Sky"", you wince with the pain of the bamboo rod across your back when the doctor is beaten, and you can feel Jim's pain and confusion of finding his parents again, but not being sure if it is truly them. A very belated congratulations to Steven Spielberg, and most of all, to Christian Bale. Christian, as Jim, was more than anyone could expect, and something every actor, adult or child should aspire to. <br/><br/>You are welcome at my home for dinner any time....."
"noralee","8","4","9","13 January 2006"," A Stunning Child's Eye View of the Clash of Colonial Empires
","I viewed ""Empire of the Sun"" on DVD as the first of Steven Spielberg's twentieth century historical films. In an interview on the DVD, he proclaims it to be a ""child's view of war,"" linking it to his ""E.T.""- oeuvre and predictively to his violent films to come, but it is unexpectedly about something else.<br/><br/>It is a child's view of the tectonic clash of colonial empires, as the one upon which the sun never sets (the British) is dimmed by the rising sun (the Japanese), with them both trumped by the even brighter artificial sun of the U.S.'s super atom and economic power. For the boy, the continuing visual symbols for nature and man are the sun ¬ñlots of beautiful sun rises, broiling noons and sunsets-- and airplanes¬ótoys, bombers, ruins, kamikazes and rescuers.<br/><br/>Through the autobiographical fiction of J.G. Ballard's original novel (and it is interesting to hear on the DVD interview what incidents are directly from his life), we start out seeing a Rudyard Kipling-like view of China. In this first act, we see arrogant, elitist Europeans hold court in an International Zone separated from the teaming poverty of Shanghai (and the filmmakers eerily recreate the original boundaries in the exact locale through the contemporary imperialism of Hollywood capitalism) that seems more pre-World War I than II. The added touch of having them dress up for a masquerade ball like Marie Antoinette, etc. is too heavy-handed.<br/><br/>While the adaptation is by Tom Stoppard, the film then becomes all about young Christian Bale's performance, in a Robert Louis Stevenson-like boy's adventure tale, and stunning visual set pieces by cinematographer Allen Daviau.<br/><br/>Bale is extraordinary. Watching him 20 years later, it is fascinating to see the mature actor within the child who even at this young age can produce boyish enthusiasm to desperation to exhaustion at the crack of ""Action."" Some of his best scenes are simply he alone, such as a resourceful kid who seems like a lone post-war survivor when he first misses the round-ups of Europeans.<br/><br/>It is probably because we are looking through his innocent eyes that the Japanese are shown far less stereotypically than most such movies, particularly as he establishes a tentative connection with a youthful flier (though through his young confusion distinctions between Chinese and Japanese are unfairly not clear). His youthful resiliency is a remarkably fresh take on war time conditions as he adapts to any situation and learns enough to help others as well as himself, recalling John Boorman's ""Hope and Glory"" that was released the same year.<br/><br/>A complete tonal shift occurs when he suddenly meets up with Americans who obviously recall characters from ""Catch 22"", marvelously played by a scheming John Malkovich and Joe Pantoliano as his side kick. It was very effective that we only hear them for many minutes before we see their faces, as we perceive them from the child's angle in hearing the clear distinctions from his upbringing in their styles, culture and language. (I only found out from the DVD interviews that their characters were stranded Merchant Marines as I didn't pick that up from the dialog.) The practicality of the Americans is coolly emphasized in one harrowing scene when they take bets on whether Bale's ""Jim"" will survive a chase.<br/><br/>Miranda Richardson is notably not a stereotype. Just as Malkovich is an extremely reluctant paternal protector for Bale, Richardson is neither a snob nor maternal.<br/><br/>The art direction and images then take over, overwhelming any theme about the absurdities of war or clashes or complements of cultures, from the increasingly desperate internment camp to an Allied attack to a useless march to another encampment filled with the luxurious detritus of the imperialists. Even as the exact time span is only indicated indirectly and the body count mounts, by the end we are seeing one striking tableau after another.<br/><br/>British civilization seems too easily restored at the end after all we've seen."

","I am amazed at the few who gave this low ratings. It is, for me, one of the great world war two movies. Told from the p.o.v. of a bright intelligent young English boy who has led a pampered life , we see how the larger world struggles force him to adapt and live by his wits in order to survive. Although the photography, special effects and scenes of battle are amazingly shot to make you feel a part of the action, it is the personal story of a young boy becoming a man that is compelling. We are shown how he experiences not only the horror of war, but the beauty of it as well, as emotions are heightened by life and death struggles. I wish I had seen this on the big movie theater screen, but still worth watching in any setting."

","If it weren't for The Last Emperor, which is also one of the greatest films I've ever seen, this one would have won the Oscars for which it was nominated for 1988. Everything about it is first rate. The story, the cinematography, the sound, the music, and Christian Bale. Maybe my favorite part is really the music. John Williams is such a genius! The ""Cadillac of the Skies"" theme is escapism come true. This young boy comes to manhood in the most confusing of circumstances and his toy airplane is his last contact with his innocent and protected childhood. It is also his hero, his deliverer, his champion. The music tells this story. Some of the scenes haunt me, perhaps most especially the reunion with his parents. They find their boy, who looks like a man, and his reaction, for me as a mother, is jarring, but probably very accurate."
"p-seed-889-188469","1","6","17","15 October 2017"," A 153 minute onslaught of stupidity.
","I stumbled across the existence of this movie just a couple of months ago, 30 years ago after its release. I'm not quite sure how I missed it back in 1987 but based on a score of 7.8 on IMDb and an overwhelming number of its reviews including the word ""masterpiece"" I was determined to seek it out and mentally prepared for a mind- blowing experience. I was therefore delighted to find it in the ""classics"" section of the movies on-board a recent international flight. It is not often that movies fail from the first frame, but this one did, literally. It begins with an overlong shot of some dirty water, some petals appear, then some pieces of wood, which in time turn out to be a number of wooden coffins. We zoom out to see a Japanese warship collide with them. So ends the first 2 or 3 minutes of this movie, showing a ridiculous situation which adds absolutely nothing to the story. We might be thinking, OK, well, the director has satisfied his ego and got the arty, gratuitous shot off his chest, now on to the real movie. But, alas, it was not to be so. The ""plot"" of this movie, and I use that word generously, is the picaresque meanderings of an obnoxious little boy to become an obnoxious slightly older boy over the period 1941 to 1945. This consists of a non-stop string of the most ridiculous, contrived, unnatural, laughable episodes you might have the misfortune to imagine. I made it to an hour and 20 minutes only because I could just not believe what I was seeing - it was, in its own masochistic way, fascinating, like watching a train crash. I will not bore you with the details of particular absurdities, but I am confident that if requested I could make a minute by minute itemised list of cringe-worthy examples. I was somewhat incredulous to find that this movie was based on a well respected ""semi-autobiography"" (whatever that is) by J.G. Ballard. That surely means that in its original form it had some redeeming qualities and that the author was not in fact anything like the ridiculous character in the film. Surely, hopefully, there has been a titanic ""loss in translation"" somewhere in the movie making process. I do not know if J.G. Ballard, Tom Stoppard or Stephen Spielberg is to blame but the screenplay is beyond execrable. It is as if it has been written by someone raised in a cave by wolves whose only knowledge of humans is from reading books. No man, woman or child I have ever known has acted, or spoken the way EVERYONE does in this movie. To say that EVERY character is a caricature would be an understatement, they are caricatures of caricatures. The Chinese are caricatures. The British are caricatures. The Americans are caricatures. The Japanese are caricatures. I also did not realise until after watching the movie that the ""boy"" was acted by Christian Bale. This I found astonishing as there are not so many movies about the 2nd Sino-Japanese war, the only one I know being ""The flowers of war"" in which Christian Bale also plays the lead role. Apart from staring Christian Bale both these films are similar in that they feature ridiculous characters in ridiculous situations. No offense to Mr Bale, he makes the best of a bad lot, but he does seem to be a bit of a jinx in this historical era. I realise that ""Empire of the sun"" is based on a ""semi-auto biography"" but it seems bizarre to me that the only movies of this historical era of China have British or American characters as their leads. Frankly, in an era in which millions of Chinese were being slaughtered or starved to death, why should I give a toss about the privileged treatment of a British boy, and a thoroughly unpleasant one at that? Perhaps one day we will get a real movie on this subject that will finally do it some justice. I do not know if the reverence for the Japanese that is so frequently flaunted in this movie is simply a reflection of J.G Ballard's original book, or something added by Spielberg or Stoppard. While I understand that in these enlightened times all the nations of the World are supposed to sit around the camp fire and sing ""Kumbaya"", it has to be said World War 2 was not Japan's finest hour as human beings. Therefore it seems not only strange but in poor taste that the Spielberg who recognises the horrors inflicted by the Germans on humanity in ""Schindler's List"" fails to recognise those inflicted by the Japanese in this movie, and in this respect it is an insult to the millions of civilian and military casualties. In fact, when I think about it, this movie is pretty much an insult to everybody. It is an insult to children, who do not behave like they do in this movie. It is an insult to adults, who do not behave as they do in this movie. It is an insult to every nationality represented. It is an insult to veterans. And it is an insult to the intelligence of the audience."

","I guess I'm in the minority here but for me this was excruciatingly bad. I had to stop watching after the first half hour and I can sit through practically anything. The invasion of Shanghai was just so fake and every scene so manipulative and clumsy. There is nothing real about this monstrosity. Bertolucci's Last Emperor is the closest thing I can think of as a comparison, but even that waste of money is less condescending and deeper. The simpleton view of the world can be entertaining and obviously comforting to many but I won't get into where that leads. More evidence that Spielberg is truly the Frank Capra of our times, naive and sickly sweet, fine for escapist fare but failing completely to understand anything deeper."

The magnificence of the Shanghai metropolis and the tragedy of the civilians facing the cruelty of wartime were remarkable.<br/><br/>However, the most amazing thing in this movie is the boy Jamie Graham (young Christian Bale). Having a rich imagination and wisdom, Jamie tells to his mom that God, in his dream, was playing in tennis, and he assumes that if people can see God in their dreams, perhaps God sees humans in His dreams too.<br/><br/>Jamie not only has his own opinions, but he also has his own vision. While adults, using logic and statistics, calculating the potential outcome of the war on the number of people and weapons, Jamie notes that the war will be won by someone who has COURAGE and that COURAGE is a national value of the Japanese.<br/><br/>Separated from his parents by a cruel destiny, Jamie tries to survive in his new situation.

","Quality: 9/10 Content: 7.5/10 There is a scene in Spielberg's film adaption of J. G. Ballard's novel, Empire of the Sun, where an imprisoned boy by the name of Jim salutes and sings the heart-piercing ""Suo G√¢n"" to three Kamikaze pilots in their pre- flight ritual. This little airplane enthusiast has no care ‚Äì more specifically, he doesn't know ‚Äì of the class and physical barriers that separated Japan and their captives. He respects and cares for all; everyone is equal in his innocent eyes. He salutes, befriends and surrenders to Japanese and American alike without a thought of wires or possible consequences, and everyone, even the brutal Japanese sergeant Nagata, enjoys his presence with a certain respect and adoration for him. <br/><br/>Like the author J. G. Ballard's own experiences, Jim, or James Graham (Christian Bale's first major role that brought him into the limelight), lives in the untouched International Settlement in Shanghai before Japan invaded it, while his well-to-do parents keep him oblivious to the intense nature of the war raging outside the metal barricades of the settlement. When the Japanese do finally march in, Jim and his parents are separated by the great throngs of chaotic crowds. Jim now has to survive on his own until he runs into a strange, snobbish American, Basie, whom he persuades to protect him. The war moves on, and our characters are moved to the Soochow camp, but we don't care as it makes no difference to unenlightened Jim. <br/><br/>Spielberg definitely succeeds in creating movies on World War II, and like any other of them, the oppressors bring down numerous beatings, though Spielberg curbed it to a PG rating, and mild language is spit out in intense, emotional scenes. Though Jim loudly proclaims his atheistic faith, his beliefs are radically different. He talks about God and what he does, possibly a touch in order to appeal to Christian viewers. <br/><br/>Throughout the movie, the tween-aged Jim often cries ""I surrender"" to anyone in a uniform, hoping to gain access to his parents or a guardian through that act. But I doubt little Jim understands that phrase, because, instead of a weak, fainthearted boy, we see one with a strong constitution and standing up to oppressors and respecting all (even the dead). Even in conditions so arduous and severe, his manners and respect last through the entire war, recognized by us and an admiring Basie who says, ""You've got nice manners. I appreciate that."" <br/><br/>Spielberg's powerful use of the camera and Bale's show-stopping performance emphasizes what man would do in harsh and demanding environments. On the other hand, Jim, scraping out a living through a complex network of theft and trade, lives unknowing to the motives behind the cruelties of the camp in his high world of airplanes. We follow Jim and his experiences like a close friend, but like everyone else, we can't convince him of the real dangers and truths he is ignorant of. Unlike Jurassic Park, Spielberg enhances the original material, and touches it with emotion, friendships and an inspirational story."

There are some parts that move us deeply because we know they are true. A boy in Shanghai sees a bright flash of light in the sky, brighter than anything he has ever seen. He has just witnessed the most horrific thing that has ever happened in the history of mankind, the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Later he is looking at his hands possibly feeling the first effects of radiation poisoning.

","Steven Spielberg, a gifted director and producer, has always liked difficult and controversial periods in human history. WW II is one of his favorite topics but the angle of depiction is sophisticated; the good are not always right and the bad are not always wrong - the same applies to wars and taking sides. <br/><br/>The real gems of the movie are Christian Bale and John Malkovich. Bale as the main character, Jamie Graham, a boy, is virtually in every scene of the movie and fills them with talent and brilliance (it is worth noting that Bale is still a good and well-known actor). As for Malkovich, he has always been a firm choice, I can not remember a movie where I have not liked him. The other performers like Miranda Richardson or Nigel Havers are good as well, but their appearance on the screen is quite brief. <br/><br/>The only ""minus"" is the length (almost 2,5 hours), some scenes could have been minimized. However, even then the movie does not become boring."
"didramos","9","3","7","18 July 2012"," Brilliant and touching!
","Starting from the way the story is conveyed and the dialogue is written to the superb acting that is delivered throughout the movie, everything about Empire of the Sun is magnificent. It oozes a touch of Steven Spielberg though in a very down-to-earth manner, which gives the piece a unique and interesting quality while still having the element of Spielberg's excellent storytelling. The story itself, though occurring alongside real events in the World's history, doesn't focus on any particular event or their importance to the world but rather on their importance on the main character's life and on how each event impacts him and the lives of those around him. It's much more than just a movie about war, it's about a boy's journey through adolescence after suffering an enormous rupture with his comfortable and luxurious life, following his struggle to survive, to find his parents, to keep his dreams alive and his despair to stay connected to the people he encounters. The main character, Jamie, is certainly one of a kind, being a devious and peculiar boy while still managing to carry the innocence and naivety of the child he is, which makes us be interested in this person and in the transformation he undergoes. Certainly, such a complex and multifaceted character could potentially prevent the general public from relating to him or understanding him and yet I still found myself doing exactly that and enjoying every moment of the movie. Most definitely, part of that is owed to the exceptional performance given to us by Christian Bale, who truly made Jamie come to life by making the character and his quirks extremely believable. Little moments in which the extent of his commitment shows through make his acting brim on perfect. After all, even just small details make the difference (like the fact that after shouting on a rooftop with all the strength his lungs allowed him he then tries to speak but his voice is raspy and nearly failing). The fusion of Bale's acting with the character's power and depth and the fantastic way of how things were put together make us go enthusiastic in one second to suddenly feel our heart breaking in the next. Just like Jamie, I was left feeling both amazed and in awe as I stood at the edge of a metaphorical abyss and though I could tell why I had gone from laughing at his childishness to start sobbing in the next second I couldn't tell how such transition had been done so swiftly and quickly, being yet so natural.<br/><br/>In sum, an excellent piece which I would recommend to anyone who enjoys profound but entertaining movie."
"mronrox45","10","3","7","28 June 2012"," A modern classic
","This is one of my all time favorite movies. There something about the idea of the story thats so appealing. Most stories about WWII are about battles. However, the two greatest movies about WWII, Casablanca and Empire of the Sun, go deeper into the personal trails of characters during a time when emotions and feelings were supposed to be on the back burner. The main character in this film is superb in showing what patriotism is all about. Hes English but has never been there and understands the Chinese (where he lives and grew up) better than his own people. Its a tale of the War that slipped through the cracks and never got told, the English that were trapped in China during WWII. I can see how this can be a little dry for some viewers but if you understand that this is a character study versus an action film it is a little easier to enjoy. Also, its strongly based on a true story with events that are spot on accurate. It is in my humble opinion the greatest ""coming of age"" movie ever made. Besides, when the producers of this movie are Steven Spielberg, Frank Marshall, Kathleen Kennedy and Robert Shapiro its a little hard to think this movie is a ""miss"". I don't think there is another movie in Hollywood that has ever had that powerful assembly of Producers, ever."

","This is one of the all-time classics and certainly one of the best war movies ever created without the banal fighting scenes. The full of emotions story benefits greatly from the performances of Bale and Malkovich, who turn the nearly 3 hour drama into a very enjoyable experience. The story requires the length of the movie as it is extremely deep and full of little details that need to be included in order to achieve the full emotional effect. Of course it is worthless to say that the big break of Christian Bale could not have been more impressive. He turns this into so much more than the normal coming-of-age movie with astonishing facial expressions and acting well beyond his tender age at the time."
"leplatypus","10","3","7","27 March 2012"," Baleman begins (cinematheque)
","I really like this movie for the same reasons that most people despise it: First, they say that Spielberg's choice to present wartime like a park game is inappropriate. Well, as the story is about a teen, I think that this angle is particularly accurate. When we were kids, we don't see the same world as adults and sometimes they can be joyful in the darkest hours. Next, they say that Williams score is too much. For me, this is one of his best score and he excels as much with the songs than with the music. How many score do you whistle leaving the theater? In conclusion, ""Empire"" is one of my favorite because with all this and more: emotion is everywhere and that's precisely what those critics ignore: at the end, the only question is how we feel? Here, i feel excellent, having touched the core of humanity as Jim touched the planes. And i can add more if you want: Bale is an extraordinary beginner and he really carries the picture all by himself. Then, we discover the world and the history of the Far East and it's cool to have a good epic nowadays. Again ? Well, Spielberg was particularly fit and inventive here because he really knew how to put together in the same frame, war, innocence, upper classes and people. If a lot of great directors have a favorite genre (Burton, Lynch), Spielberg is the only great with all: romance, SF, comedy, action.... Maybe people dislike the movie because they focus too much on Malkovich's character, which is indeed a very dark soul, completely driven by his self-seeking survival. He really haunts the movie and it's the black hole of this empire of the sun...<br/><br/>Pairing: ""Schindler's list"": another hopeful message from a war camp."

","When I was 10, my family was taken from our home by war, with only 20 minutes notice, never to return. Like the boy in the film, this event marked for me a transition from childhood to manhood. The glow of the A-bomb attack reflected the transition of the world to a new future. An amazing saga of triumph whilst maturing, the characters include the entire gamut of human emotion and morality. The challenge of the young boy to the POW camp officer is particularly instructive for those seeking motivation on success in difficult circumstances. Good versus evil. The film should be used as an educational tool to inform the spoiled current generation of young people who have been protected from the realities of history, a missing lesson that will most likely lead to a less fortunate future. All parents should watch it with their children."

","From the first glimpse of open caskets floating down the Yangtze River to the final image of the young hero's childhood baggage drifting away on the tide, it's clear Steven Spielberg is trying to challenge both himself and his audience, with a daring (for this director) adaptation of J.G. Ballard's autobiographical novel. For the most part he succeeds admirably, harnessing his state-of-the-art talents to an allegorical wartime fantasy (written from firsthand experience) about a young British boy in Shanghai, separated from his parents after the Japanese invasion and thrust into the alleys and gutters of an alien world, ending the war in a civilian internment camp. But this is no typical coming-of-age drama; in wartime the end of innocence often brings madness, not maturity, and Spielberg doesn't compromise the material with the expected blockbuster flourishes (as he did in 'The Color Purple'). Despite the director's distracting emphasis on flashy visual exposition, his film nevertheless makes demands on its audience that they may not be prepared to meet: fans of 'Indiana Jones' and 'ET' really can't be expected to shoulder the burden of so much arcane symbolism and haunting, dreamlike imagery. If for nothing else Spielberg deserves credit for taking a risk on such an uncommercial property."

This led to Spielberg gaining his well earn Oscar for Schindler's List.<br/><br/>Starting in 1941, the Japanese army was getting closer to Shanghai. Many British ex-pats are starting to leave China for other British colonies. Jamie Graham (Christian Bale) is a wealth child living in a British area of the city. Jamie is a spoiled child, disrespecting his servants and lives a live of luxury. He is also smart child, who knows a lot about military aviation. When the Japanese troops finally takes Jamie and his family try and felt China. But Jamie is separated and forced to survive in the occupied city. Jamie quickly has to tie his destiny with Basie (John Malkovich), an American who ends up stuck in city, and shows himself to be resourceful, but morally, a little questionable. Jamie and Basie are captured by the Japanese, and forced to live in an internment camp. Jamie has to learn how to survive quickly.<br/><br/>Empire of the Sun was based on the J. G. Ballard's semi-autobiographical novel, where he also had to live in Japanese occupied China. Here Spielberg shows his growing skill, working with a good script by Tom Stoppard. Spielberg tells a coming-of-age set during the horrors of war. Jamie really grows as a character, becoming a more caring character, shows how his innocence is clipped away. This is a more artist film by Spielberg with some of the scenes, aiming to put a lot of symbolism in the film. This ending up being very similar to the Soviet classic Come and See (highly recommended viewing). Spielberg shows the collapse of law and order in Shanghai, and tough conditions in a Japanese camp. But Spielberg also tries to show some balance in the film, with some Japanese characters in a more decent light, like a Japanese runaway technician. Jamie shows he has respect for the Japanese for their bravery, and from a distances the audiences slowly see the decline of the Japanese war-effort. Nowadays Spielberg uses CGI in his movies, like in Saving Private Ryan and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, but that was not option in 1987. This actually makes the film better because it forced Spielberg to use more old fashioned techniques, and the action felt a lot more real, using real planes throughout. Whilst this is a good film for the most part, there were some moments that felt a little forced and unrealistic. Spielberg also shows that he has a weak for over-sentimentality, but those moments are few and far between. The character of Mrs. Victor (Miranda Richardson) also felt very underplayed, and her part was properly cut from what was originally intended. <br/><br/>There is a good cast. Christian Bale at the age of 13 shows that even then he was a talented actor with a good future in actor. He offered an excellent performance and shows a real change in his character. John Malkovich is also a excellent actor and gives a strong performance as a mentor to Jamie. There also other good supporting performances throughout the film, such as Joe Pantoliano, Nigel Havers, Rupert Frazer and Emily Richard.<br/><br/>There is a excellent score by John Williams, a long time collaberator with Spielberg, adding to the power of the film. The cinematography by Allen Daviau was also wondering done, showing many different territories of China. Daviau and Spielberg worked very well together to film some very difficult shots. Michael Kahn also offers a good editing job throughout the film.<br/><br/>This was originally a project that the great David Lean wanted to direct, but Spielberg was pretty much following in his style. This is one of Spielberg's most surprising films and is well worth watching."

","I watched this movie the other day and I am so impressed by every single detail. Actually, I wish everyone to watch it. It tells a story about the pacific WWII through a child eyes. The movie begins at the Jim's fancy life (Christian Bale) showing the contrast life in Shanghai of the wealthy people (the British and the American) and the other Chinese people outside the international settlements in Shanghai. Then, and in a dramatic change, the Japanese forces invade those international settlements in Shanghai letting another era of Jim's life to begin. He meets his new American friend Basie (John Malkovich) and later on they are arrested by the Japanese and they moved to the camp. Jim quickly accommodate with his new life and taking the rule of a mature boy. The adventures begin till the American army come to Shanghai and the Japanese release the prisoners. The last scene of the movie is very very touching; it is the reunion scene, when Jim meets again his parents. Frankly, I couldn't deny myself from throwing tears at this sensitive scene. The soundtracks of the movie are fabulous; they are full of humanity and emotions. Thanks to Mr. John Williams for this masterpiece music. In my opinion, it is the best movie ever of the director Mr. Steven Spielberg. Actually, I watched the making of this movie (the Chinese Odyssey) and it is very obvious the efforts which done (dealing with the massive crowds, making the airplanes, shooting the powerful scenes). I can't thank Mr. Spielberg enough for this movie. It is sad fact that it didn't win any Oscar with regards to its 6 nominations. I think that it should be at the top of IMDb. It is really underrated; one of Spielberg's most underrated. I must say that it is one of Spielberg's most underestimated films. One last thing that I wish to have the ability to erase this movie from my mind and to watch again and again to have the feelings and emotions of this movie refreshed each time. My rate is absolutely 10 of 10."

I was, and still am, a bit of WWII plane enthusiast in my youth, and the scene where the P-51 fly's past Jim on the rooftop was just so awesome to behold! Spielberg is a master who can easily balance high drama with spectacle. Bale and Malkovich are both excellent and Nigel Havers is also very good as the interment camp doctor. My favourite parts of the film are when Jim returns to his house and stays there all by himself, and the whole second half of the film in the internment camp.

His ability to project a wide array of emotions on the screen should have earned him an Oscar. Filmgoers who only know him as Batman or the good guy in 3:10 To Yuma, simply must see him in this film.<br/><br/>The other cast members are fine, with Malkovich playing a character not dissimilar to that which he played in The Killing Fields. And I was surprised to see Ben Stiller as a very young guy in this film.<br/><br/>Spielberg, as usual, captures the realism of the moment, particularly in the Japanese prison camp.

"jryan9087","10","3","7","18 January 2008"," Empire of the Sun: an epic masterpiece from Steven Spielberg!
","Steven Spielberg is by far one of the greatest directors in history. His imagination and brilliance has reached us all on some emotional level. Of all Spielberg's films, Empire of the Sun seems to be his least known as well as highly underrated. It wasn't a blockbuster hit like his previous films Jaws, Close Encounters, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and E.T. Yet, Empire of the Sun is a huge hit with myself and many other fans who express their satisfaction with this film.<br/><br/>Empire of the Sun is the story of Jim, a boy who grows up in the least desired circumstances. He grows up in the outbreak of World War II, in a foreign country, in chaos, and, most depressingly, without parents. Jim, an extraordinary character, must learn to survive in this new world. What seems to be a frightening experience, Jim not only survives, but he exceeds well at it. Of course, the pains of war take their toll on Jim which makes for a very heart-wrenching story told very well by Spielberg. Simply put, it is a story about a child's loss of innocence. It is a story of war seen through a child's eyes.<br/><br/>Empire of the Sun is a film not fully appreciated as it should be. It deserves all the praise it is given. It was nominated for 6 Academy Awards, winner of 3 BAFTA awards from 6 nominations, and a Golden Globe nominee for Best Motion Picture and Best Original Score. It was given highest honors from the National Board of Review for Best Film of 1987 with Steven Spielberg receiving an NBR award Best Director, and Christian Bale was given a special NBR award for Best Juvenile Performance. With excellent direction from Spielberg, a very moving score from John Williams, and an unforgettable performance from the very young Christian Bale, Empire of the Sun makes for one of Spielberg's best. After seeing the film once, it became a personal favorite and an instant classic in my mind. Empire of the Sun is my personal favorite of all Spielberg's films, and I know after you see it you'll never forget it."
"griffolyon12","10","3","7","13 January 2008"," A Superb Artisitc Achievement for Spielberg!
","Empire of the Sun is a marvelous film about a young boy making the transition from child to young adult against the backdrop of the Second World War. The film is the story of Jim Graham (Christian Bale) and how he basically became a young man. The story begins in the British controlled Shanghai shortly before the Japanese invasion in 1941. Here we see that Jim is the son of a rich British business man and that Jim is essentially your typical spoiled rich kid who doesn't really care that much for anyone else. Jim is fascinated with planes, each day Japanese fighter planes fly above the city, and while everyone else is scared to death Jim is in awe at what he thinks is a beautiful sight. Soon though the Japanese invade thus shaking up Jim's life forever. In the midst of one of the many emotional scenes in the film Jim is separated by a crowd from his parents and becomes lost without anyone to help him find his way. The rest of the film is about Jim on a journey to survive in this dangerous Japanese territory while trying to find his parents.<br/><br/>All in all this is another amazing film from the great Steven Spielberg, definitely one of his best artistic films he has done (except maybe for Schindler's List). The film-making is simply beautiful and breathtaking, and so is the amazing score by John Williams who expertly blended choral music with a huge Hollywood orchestra to create something that is truly unique. One of the greatest things about this film is the amazing acting. The film has a superb cast including John Malkovich as a friend to Jim who later double crosses him, and Miranda Richardson who acts as a sort of mother figure to Jim, but the true stunner in the cast is Christian Bale. This was Bale's first film, but you can't even tell, he delivers one of the greatest performances, if not the greatest performance in the film. Bale is able to show both vulnerability and strength in this role and perfectly carries the film upon his back.<br/><br/>Overall I am surprised this film didn't sweep the Oscars the year it came out, it's just superb. As I've mentioned it is a truly beautiful film including some truly breathtaking scenes, such as my favorite when Jim sees what he thinks is a heavenly light, but is really the Atom Bomb dropped on Hiroshima. If you haven't seen this yet you need to right away.<br/><br/>A perfect 10/10!!!!!!!!!!"

","This Film was great! Steven Spielberg, did a wonderful job directing this film. This film was the 1st Hollywood film to be directed in China.Empire of the Sun was a great film for Chrisitan Bale to show what he was capable of. Since he was only 11 year old, I would expect him to do a horrible job of staying in character, but the young actor surprised me. This film was great, but there were sometimes I would wonder how long would this film last. The movie is two hours long. During some of the scenes I would get bored. Then the film would go back into action. This film is strong in narrative and I would recommend everyone to go see Empire of the Sun."
"ricardo_deakin","10","3","7","15 August 2007"," The Best Spielberg Film to Date
","I believe this is Spielberg's best film, and him being my favorite director means the best film ever. This is a bold claim for a film, but it lives up to the hype.<br/><br/>I saw this film when i was 15, about Jim's age in the end of the film. I thought that the film had affected me because of my age but not because of its quality (the remake of Lord of the Flies had that effect).<br/><br/>I spent a few years hunting down the DVD, and was amazed to like the film even more the second time around. Since i have lobbied my friends (who don't like this kind of film) to watch it. Not even one of them where disappointed with the film even with the high expectations they had after my boldest claims.<br/><br/>From the outset it is obvious why David Lean was originally set to Direct the film, it is epic in scale but like Lawrence of Arabia and Bridge on the River Kwai, the main character is very well developed as are the supporting ones.<br/><br/>The story in Empire is not plot based or moved but rather realistically follows the emotions of Jim, played masterfully by a young Christian Bale). From his easy comfortable living before the Second World War to his time separated from his parents in a Japanese internment camp.<br/><br/>This films only flaw, one i don't mind but many viewers might not like is that the film is quite slow. But like films like the last emperor the slow pace helps us care about the characters and gives them space to breath.<br/><br/>Everything in this film is perfect, the script, the performances, the photography and one of the best music scores ever written by the always brilliant John Williams.<br/><br/>Since i seen it only 3 other films came close to affect me as much as this did. They where the Shawshank Redemption, Lawrence of Arabia and Oh What a lovely war."

"maestroman","9","3","7","15 August 2006"," Powerful
","Empire of the Sun doesn't really fall under the category of action-packed war film. Instead it follows just one boy who is almost forced to grow up during the Japanese takeover of Shanghai in World War II. Jim, played by a very young Christian Bale, lives happily with his aristocratic parents, is a very spoiled boy and has huge interest in aviation. He's separated from his parents during a Japanese take over in an area of Shanghai that was protected by some sort of diplomatic immunity. What allowed the take over to happen was the declaration of the war from Japan to the US. Jim scared and alone has no idea what's to become of him. He meets with a couple of American merchant seaman Basie (John Malkovich) and Frank (Joe Pantoliano). Basie isn't necessarily selfish, but he does what he must do to survive, very cynical. They both end up in a Japanese prison camp and that's where they stay during the war. So after a brief synopsis, what I can say about this film is that it's ""powerful"" It's a story of survival and growing up for Jim and it has some powerful and genuinely sad moments that all come with war. Again this movie is not an action film it is very dramatic and intense. It may take more than once to watch to fully understand it, but when you do the feeling of this film will be worth it."
"cosmic_quest","9","3","7","14 May 2006"," A war film with a difference
","'Empire of the Sun' is probably one of the most unique war films out there as it doesn't balk from showing the harsh realities of war but we see it all through the eyes of a child. And, in many ways, it is a rather tragic war drama since it deals with both the deaths of soldiers and civilians but also the death of a child's innocence as he struggles to comprehend the brutal truth of the situation he is in.<br/><br/>The hero of the film is twelve-year-old Jim, an English boy living in China with his upper class family in 1941 when the Japanese invade. Separated from his parents, he is left to cope on the streets alone only to be captured and placed in a Japanese PoW camp. As he befriends fellow British and American captives, Jim struggles to find his feet in a world where the days of being pampered are over but also where he is forced to take his first premature steps into manhood when, at heart, he is still very much a child. When the war finally draws to an end with Japan's defeat, Jim is left to find his parents, no longer the little boy he was when they were first separated.<br/><br/>Welsh-born Christian Bale was just absolutely first class as young Jim. He would only have been twelve or so when filming but his performance proved there are some child actors who can show incredible talent that out-shines adult counterparts and he brings innocence, hope and spirit to his character. It's not surprising he is one of the few child actors who grew up able to carve an acting career in adulthood instead of falling by the wayside. The adult cast of John Malkovich, Miranda Richardson and Nigel Havers are also solid, supporting Bale's performance without pushing themselves to the forefront as this is very much his film.<br/><br/>One of the most beautiful things about this film is that it can be enjoyed by those of all ages. I was about ten when I first saw 'Empire of the Sun', perceiving it then as an adventure and cheering Jim along on his journey. When I saw it again about eight or so years later, I was able to better appreciate the themes of lost innocence, determination, loss, hope and spirit that saw a generation survive through World War Two. Much like the Japanese anime 'Grave of the Fireflies', this film strives to portray Jim's tenacity without losing the message that war is no place for a child and the innocent always suffer first in the midst of battle. Directed with masterful grace by Steven Spielberg, 'Empire of the Sun' is probably one of his best films yet."
"Withnail_fan","10","3","7","20 March 2006"," One of Spielberg's most underrated!!!!!!
","This film really is one of his most under-rated in my opinion, instead of his usual happy lovely every-things o.k endings, he really has a grown up ending. I won't say exactly what it is for those of you who haven't seen it...but watch it and you'll see what I mean.<br/><br/>Two words why you should watch this film alone, Christian Bale!!! I've never seen such a brilliant child performance as his acting here, as it is essentially a film about his character-Jim. A young boy who is separated form his parents during the Japanese invasion of China during the second world war. Bale completely held my attention throughout the film, and is really remarkable. John Malowich (spelling?) is also very good in this film too as the American who Jim befriends once his parents have vanished.<br/><br/>I can't urge you enough to see this film you won't be disappointed!!!"
"ejhstevens","10","3","7","13 March 2006"," I can only think of one word to describe this movie...
","Incredible.<br/><br/>This movie is about a young boy who must live through WWII on his own in an interment camp and the way the story is told is so moving that I doubt anyone could ever forget it. When I first saw it I was very young, probably too young to really understand war and death, but the movie stuck with me. It was incredible seeing this young boy, raised with every advantage in the world, thrown into such a complex situation without anything to fall back onto. He has to grow up in an unforgiving world, desperately trying to hold onto the memory of his parents.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is incredible, features veterans like John Malkovich, Miranda Richardson and Joe Pantoliano and a then new-comer Christian Bale. It's actually hard to just call it 'acting', because their performances feel so real. The direction is incredible, it's a side of Steven Spielberg we'll probably never see again, mixing real-life with a child's view of the war so seamlessly that you barely notice you're being shown a skewed look at reality. A reality created in an attempt to deal with the devastation of war.<br/><br/>This is probably the best movie I have ever seen, about war, about childhood, about life, about anything.<br/><br/>Incredible."
"sddavis63","8","3","7","9 January 2006"," Excellent And Believable
","Young Christian Bale offered a powerful performance in this drama about a young boy separated from his family after the Japanese occupation of Shanghai and sent to an internment camp, where he has to find a way to survive.<br/><br/>Bale's portrayal of Jamie (or Jim) was the highlight of this movie. I thought he captured the boy's confusion perfectly. Raised in Shanghai, as a child of privilege living in an opulent British enclave, Jamie has lost touch with his British roots (as he notes at one point in the movie, he's never even been to Britain.) He admires the Japanese and, although he never actually says this, one gets the impression that he'd really like the Japanese to win the war. At the same time, he becomes increasingly aware of the brutal treatment those interned with him are receiving at the the hands of their Japanese captors.<br/><br/>In the camp, Jamie is befriended by Basie (John Malkovich), an American prisoner with whom he establishes a somewhat complicated relationship. Basie comes to treat him largely as an adult; while Jamie depends on him more and more. Their friendship has its ups and downs, and Malkovich also put on a good performance in the role.<br/><br/>Although the story is fictional, it struck me as a believable portrayal of something that could have happened. I had a little bit of trouble with the timeline. The first half of the movie is set obviously in late 1941, just before and after the Japanese attack, and then there is a sudden shift to 1945 in the last half of the movie. The intervening years are left out. One wonders about what life in the internment camp had been like in those intervening years. I found that omission of 3 plus years a bit jolting, although doing much with it would have made a long movie even longer. Essentially, as I think back to the story, three scenes remain with me: (1) when Jamie, looking for his toy plane, stumbles across the Japanese soldiers; (2) when Jamie is separated from his mother (played by Emily Richard); and (3) the last scene of the movie, which I won't describe because I don't want to spoil it.<br/><br/>Overall, I thought this movie was excellent. 8/10"
"Barky44","10","3","7","31 December 2005"," Brilliant, beautiful, poignant, touching
","Empire of the Sun is such a terrific movie. It is a shame it never received the accolades it should have. I'll never understand why, even today, critics look down upon this film. It is truly brilliant.<br/><br/>The key to this entire film is the way the filmmakers framed the entirety of the Chinese wartime saga through the eyes of a British boy. The film is broad in scope, with sweeping vistas and immense crowd scenes. But the heart of the film is concentrated, focused, into the character of Jamie Graham, outstandingly played by young Christian Bale.<br/><br/>The writers really got into the head of this 12-year-old boy. This kid goes through so many changes, like all children do, and you're with him, every step of the way. They start him off as a spoiled brat, then suspend him in a state of shock as riots hit the streets of Shanghai. Then they put him on his own, where he makes safe yet foolish decisions. Then he becomes enamored with a less-than-savory role model. He moves through survivor to panderer and even has a touch of hormone-induced lust. Towards the end, he even investigates his own spirituality. All the while the effects of war rumble on around him.<br/><br/>The best of all war movies focus on a few, or even one, characters. It's so easy to wash away all the soul of a film by focusing on large battle sequences or broad vistas. By capturing the soul of the people caught up in war, you capture the soul of the war itself. Spielberg does this so brilliantly here, he has made a terrific film.<br/><br/>It's a shame others don't feel that way.<br/><br/>10 out of 10. A perennial favorite.<br/><br/>Barky"
"Penfold-13","7","3","7","7 September 1999"," Wildly overblown
","Visually, an utterly stunning film. Spielberg mounts a fantastic cinematographic display, every shot beautifully composed. There's a sweeping score too, huge crowd scenes, dream sequences, the works.<br/><br/>And there's a fine story of a boy's loss of innocence, of how a<br/><br/>pampered rich kid learns to survive, becoming a wheeler-dealer who knows how many cigarettes will buy a potato or cabbage. Though not quite as brutal as military POW camps, surviving the Japanese civilian  prison camps required courage and resourcefulness, and young Jim acquires and uses these qualities in abundance.<br/><br/>The whole trouble with this movie is that the story and the presentation simply don't match up. We have a little story of a young boy's determined little struggle against adversity projected on to the broadest of canvases. We don't need every scene to be a spectacular, to have a huge score to take every hint of emotion to absurd heights, to be invested with emblematic significance. Pairs of shoes,  battered suitcases, bicycles - these objects are far too mundane to be the leitmotivs of Wagnerian opera, which is the epic scale on which Spielberg has built his edifice.<br/><br/>Spielberg can make good little films about boys - see ET, for example - but placing his little story in such a grand setting obscures the tale and devalues the majesty of the filming.<br/><br/>This is much less than the sum of its parts, and it could well irritate you beyond belief. During the last third of the movie, I<br/><br/>found myself snorting or expostulating at each yet more overblown set-piece purporting to be deeply significant unfolded.<br/><br/>The Empire falls resoundingly between two stools (one made of plain wood and the other richly decorated and upholstered in regal style)."
"Brutusbiker","5","4","11","13 July 2005"," Excellent cinema, wrong philosophy
","This movie is, as is usual with Spielberg, extremely well filmed. This is cinema at its best. However, the underlying philosophy is dangerous. Spielberg's movies often have a negative message that underlies them. Some of his films are pure entertainment at its best (Raiders of the Lost Ark, Close Encounters, Jaws and Duel, for instance) and may be viewed over and over again with great pleasure without reserve. Some, however, surreptitiously plant a defeatist philosophy in the viewer's mind. This is all the more dangerous because the movies are so well made. This movie is an example of this. Not only are the Japanese portrayed too benignly, but the worst about this movie is the lingering impression that the world is wrong, and you can only survive if you yield to its unfair rules. The boy has to resort to dishonesty and theft in order to survive. How very different is the message from that of a true ennobling movie such as ""The Fountainhead"", for example. Or from Al Pacino's speech in ""Scent of A Woman""! Or ""Shane"", or ""The Seven Samurai""! Or Elia Kazan's ""America America""! Wrong, defeatist messages are something of which many, many movies are full (take, for instance, all of Oliver Stone's movies), but this does not bother me because most movies lack the force and the credibility of Spielberg's masterful films. The message passes without being imprinted on one's mind. With Spielberg, this is not sot: his films are so well accomplished that the message lingers, especially in children. I recommend every viewer should employ discretion, and advise his children about this movie's patent flawed message."

The acting was superb and had so many actors in it I had forgotten about. Some I didn't veven know who they were back then. For example I didn't know the main character was Christian Bale. I just started watching and there he was, such a good young artist. The cinematography was beautiful and the score was so beautiful. I realized that at the time another movie with a similar title took home all of the awards that year, and I suspect many people either forgot about this or never saw it. If you have never seen it then you are in for a treat and if you haven't seen it in a long time it's a good one to remember again. Directed by Steven Spielberg"

"dfleming2","Null","0","0","10 December 2002"," No more than what it is
","I reviewed the reviews. We all slam on critics for their obsessive broad stroking of films.  Yet I see much of that here.  The movie is more of a human charactor study than anything else.  Many slam the movie for not making a big issue of their particular perspective of wartime China.  But look closer at what is happening in the film.<br/><br/>You start with a kid that is spoiled.  Yes he gets slapped by his house person.  Given the implied behavior of the kid, I'd slap him too.  But let the story progress from there.<br/><br/>Take a spoiled kid and toss him into a new reality.  One that is unprotected.  He must now deal with every day using the behaviors as he only knows how.  So to some, many of his reactions may seem abstract or hard to follow.  Lets face it, kids do not see the world as adults do.  And reality is pretty tough to understand for them at times. But as time goes on, the kid is broken down more in to a child seeking survival.<br/><br/>
To look at this movie expecting political comment is unfair.  A child does not see the world in a political way.  As the film travels on, we see how a child must try and figue out just what is real,what is going on, where is safety, where is the security(of family) and adapt. This movie shows how easy it is for a young mind to get lost in all of the changes of the world around him.  I do not see any indication in the film that ""Jim"" aligns himself with anyone or cause.  What he see's in the Japanese boy in the camp is simply another boy.  (The contrast and clash of their pasts and destinies are interesting).<br/><br/>The exposure ""Jim"" is given to the confused World during wartime is real. In the end, we do not see him as the matured man of the world.  We see a worn out spent individual that is simply human and survided.<br/><br/>If you go into this movie without trying to politisize or over complicate it, you will find it quite enjoyable.  Go looking for a political statement or docu-drama, and you will not like it."

","After the unforgettable movie experience of the Color Purple the Master of Film has done it yet again with the most Heartbreaking, Glorious, Soaring, Uplifting, Inspiring and one of the most Unforgettable movie Experiences of my life it really is a soaring uplifting film of the human spirit and an inspiring coming of age adventure you feel uplifted and wonderfully inspired because the way in which the inspiring themes of the film are presented to in the patriotic direction the soaring uplifting score the wonderful redemption at the end when all hope seems to be lost and all hope is rediscovered and redeemed when the dreams and inspirations of Jim's new found life come true all because of a life changing experience of the horrors around him in the harrowing events of war because of one change one memory one moment that could all be slowly fading away really makes Jim wonder if his new found dreams are the right thing to do or does he help and look after the people injured and wounded? The Direction and Score tell the story of the film with the care and affection for the history it portrays it almost feels like a documentary not a film! Like the Color Purple the film has an idea a theme that runs through the whole film the theme of tolerance the idea of what are we prepared to tolerate and suffer in order to achieve the dreams we want the dreams we aspire to achieve the future of all man kind! I really feel strongly about the film as much as I do about the Color Purple they are underrated Masterpieces and do not get talked about any more among the Master of Film's filmography because they have not done well with awards or not gained the critical acclaim they deserve! Empire of the Sun is the Best Picture of 1987 for a number of reasons the inspiring themes of soaring airplanes and the dreams we all share the recurring motifs of memories that Jim has like the haunting melody that his mother plays on the piano similar to Celie and Nettie's hand clapping motif and song in the Color Purple which connects Celie and Nettie together the Haunting piano melody that Jim's Mother plays connects Jim to his mother he knows that he is safe and well and that is very powerful for me that a simple piano motif can bond and connect someone together! The film has a recurring theme of showing acts of malevolent evil and what the power of evil can and will do if necessary there are threats of danger and you see many sequences of danger and hurtful acts of evil which affects Jim and the people around him as the threat of evil increases and the hope decreases as Jim knows he feels anger for the evil around him but he never speaks his emotions the film shows it through the simple power of emotion and Jim's body language he really changes throughout the film he cares and respects all who know him he has a friend called Basie who he aspires to and when Jim explains the emotion of the heartbreaking experiences he has gone through throughout the war which are intertwined with the wonderful experiences of the planes soaring across the sky it feels heartbreaking and wonderfully overwhelming at the same time! Like the Color Purple you feel the overwhelming force of the ending as all hope is restored when the whole atmosphere of the whole world returns to normal no feeling of darkness peril or danger worries Jim at the end he is with his mother he is safe and well but there is a sense of traumatic memories that will never change the heartbreaking sequences of people reviving other people back to life which people should never have to do in the first place but they have to in order to survive the traumatic horrors of war! Last note I want to say that The Color Purple and Empire of the Sun are heartbreaking companion pieces and they need to be loved and appreciated more and we can share the Color Purple and Empire of the Sun with the world! Empire of the Sun is A Glorious Uplifting Adventure of the human spirit!"

","I watched this film when it came out as a child and enjoyed it. However, it doesn't stand up to rewatching in the 21st century due to the level of mawkish sentimentality - just how many times can Spielberg fall back on that cringe-inducing ""character-slowly-salutes-another-character"" device in one film? I think it happens FIVE times in this movie. It is perhaps the laziest and most nauseating device (at least to non-American audiences), and to use it so repeatedly in one film is unbelievable. 
Bale was undoubtedly a precocious talent but you can almost see the direction here, as if you can hear in EVERY scene Spielberg's voice ""Ok, now look around the room in wonder, now take a step forward, now put out your arms, now turn around"". It all seems so hilariously wooden, at one point I thought a chair and table were doing the best acting in the room.
The character of Jim, watched as an adult, is also so unbelievably irritating that in moments when we are supposed to be feeling tension and hoping he doesn't get caught, I was actually hoping that he get swiftly bayoneted so hat the whole tedious film could be over."

","As a fan of Spielberg's films, I felt obligated to see this film. While this is certainly a good film, this is not a great one or even one of Spielberg's best. Christian Bale does give a great performance, the visuals are spectacular, and John Williams gives a haunting score. This film though is very unfocused and aloof which can make the experience a bit of a chore to sit through. I have no issues with slow dramas as long as they keep me interested in the characters and their stories, but I felt no long attachment or affection for the characters other than Bale. There are great moments throughout that can make this movie worthwhile, but other moments that will make you wonder what is going on or why it should matter. Spielberg tries to make us feel emotion for this boy and his predicament, but all I could feel was emotional confusion. Spielberg's film unfortunately for me meanders from moment to moment showing signs of depth and understanding but ultimately feeling incomplete at the end."
"imransyed00","8","2","5","10 September 2014"," Would it be an oxymoron to say:""Vintage Christian Bale""?
","Take a bow Christian Bale. It's 1987: Christian Bale meets Steven Spielberg in this ""coming of age"" tale of a young boy, Jim, who is separated from his parents in the course of the Japanese occupation of China, that ended with the Hiroshima-Nagasaki bombings. And how that ""boy"" has come of age; this film is an unlikely metaphor for the life of Christian Bale, who is now one of the finest method actors of his generation. His early success almost saw him quit acting (now why does that not surprise me?); the film garnering six nominations and not surprisingly no wins, thanks to the Spielberg jinx, if such a thing did exist!!<br/><br/>In this adaptation of J.G. Ballard's award winning novel, Jim leads a comfortable existence with his parents in a tony white neighborhood in Shanghai, a clique of people who are convinced the war will not touch them. He is fascinated by fighter aircraft, a recurring theme in the film. As the Japanese occupy Shanghai and Jim is separated from his parents, his world abruptly changes from swimming pools and golf clubs to prison camps and scrounging for potatoes. His encounter with the street smart Basie and their interactions form a strong thread to the narrative. Its heartening to see the stellar John Malkovich upstaged by a teenager; two kindred souls who might have otherwise never met, given Jim's privileged upbringing. John Malkovich sneers at being told by Jim how he was ""presented"" to a personage of consequence.<br/><br/>Bundled off to a prison camp, young Jim is brave, resourceful and kind, always looking out for the other inmates, making friends with the kindly Dr. Rawlins (Nigel Havers) and Takatoro, a Japanese boy with whom he shares a love for aircraft. The Kamikaze pilots and Jim's fascination with their bravery underscore how he is still a boy; as he refuses to see them as the enemy. The film ends with the blinding flash of Fat-Man & Little-Boy hitting their targets in Japan, which Jim in his innocence assumes to be the soul of Mrs Victor reaching heaven. The incessant scrounging for foods yields to a cornucopia as the Allies airdrop cannisters of food, chocolates and Lucky Strikes. Jim's reunion with his mother is for me one of the defining cinematic moments of Bale's career; he was born for this!<br/><br/>This is one of those films with a rather meandering storyline, no strong plot and a fairly tame ending: the kind that has viewers frustrated as being vaguely inconclusive or not dramatic enough, the cinematic equivalent of Van Gogh's ""Still Life with Fruit & Vegetables"" that graces the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam."

"Altima","10","2","5","11 February 2002"," The Lost Spielberg
","Many years ago, Steven Spielberg's name was only associated with escapist blockbusters. His career was defined by Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T. the Extra Terrestrial. But now Spielberg is the man behind Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan. The man who, to many seemed like just a child posing as an adult filmmaker had grown up. But Schindler's List, Private Ryan and A.I. didn't just pop up out of nowhere. Spielberg began looking for respect before that, starting with The Color Purple (1985), which was a good melodrama about African Americans.<br/><br/>After that film, Spielberg began his first real war movie, Empire of the Sun. Adapted from the novel by J.G. Ballard, an autobiography, the film tells the story of twelve year old Jamie, played by twelve year old Christian Bale (Who could put Haley Joel Osment to shame.) He's spoiled British boy living in Shanghai, In a protected area for foreign nationals known as the International Settlement.. China's neighbor, Japan, is readying itself for war.<br/><br/>Jamie knows a lot about the things he really cares about (in this case, fighter aircraft) and is na√Øve about everything else, especially war. `I want to join the Japanese Air Force,' he muses to his surprised father, after mentioning he liked their planes.<br/><br/>When the film opens he is only beginning to assess the world outside his large house. His family, happy in their seclusion, doesn't help matters.<br/><br/>`We're very lucky, aren't we? To have everything,' he tells his father.<br/><br/>`Yes, well you notice how the harder I work the ¬ëluckier' we get?' The man retorts, while hitting golf balls into his swimming pool using large coins as tees.<br/><br/>When the Japanese mobilize, chaos ensues, and amid the events that surround and envelop him, he is forced to change from an affluent boy to a survivor.<br/><br/>His fascination with planes presents him with an admiration of the Japanese that eclipses any frustration he would have felt in his situation. One of the more powerful images in the film finds him saluting Kamikaze pilots who are making their final toast to the Emperor, and singing the haunting Welsh lullaby the film opens with (The theme of the hymn is sleep and night). He is, of course, unaware as to what their mission is, but his innocent desire to show his admiration adds a unique perspective. The different perspective is interesting, especially in light of recent events such as the September 11th tragedy. Maybe time heals such wounds. Maybe not.<br/><br/>His change from helpless and snobby to determined and cynical is very gradual, but it is incredibly dramatic, and is one of the best- illustrated character developments put to film. Christian Bale's performance in Empire deserved an Oscar. He truly brought life to the complex character. Also to be noted is John Malkovich, who acts as Jamie's mentor for his new spartan life. He seems to serve as Jamie's dark angel, a man with useful advice, but malevolent intentions of personal gain. Also appearing is Joe Pantoliano (The Matrix) as Malkovich's right-hand-man, and it features a young Ben Stiller. But this paragraph simply can't encompass how well illustrated and deep all these characters are. It literally must be seen to be believed.<br/><br/>It becomes obvious as the film plays out  what would have attracted David Lean (the film's original intended director) to the movie. This is an epic, a tale of huge scope. There are scenes with literally thousands of extras on the screen at a time. One can only feel awe in knowing that this was made before computers dominated the movie industry. Every crowd is real. Every plane is real (to an extent.) The whole experience is a feast for the eyes, with several artful shots brining magic to the movie.<br/><br/>With excellent performances of the entire cast, strong filmmaking and visual style and a powerful score by John Williams, Empire of the Sun doesn't deserve to be overlooked. Unfortunately, and it may seem pompous to say this, but audiences weren't ready for this new Spielberg style, and it had a lukewarm reaction at the box office, with one of Spielberg's lowest grosses ever. Being released alongside `The Last Emperor' didn't help matters either. But the fact that it was nominated for 11 Oscars should certainly mean that many people did enjoy it during its release.<br/><br/>(WARNING: This paragraph has slight spoilers. If you haven't seen the film, you may want to skip this paragraph.) One thing to look out for is Spielberg's rather inspired toying with time and memory. He said of the book that `half of it was a lie,' because the memories of the young boy were fragile things that his surroundings twisted. Look out for little details; such as how Jamie's parents stand at his bedside, remarkably similar to the magazine picture he sticks on his wall later in the film. At the end of the film, Spielberg actually sums up what he was trying to say with that little detail through one single split-second shot. As Jamie tries to resurrect his fallen Japanese friend, he's chanting `I can bring everyone back, everyone,' though it is clear there's no saving him. Suddenly, it shows him actually pressing his hands to the chest of a younger version of himself, prim and proper in his school uniform. He's not trying to bring his friend back; he's trying to return to his old self. And he's failing. (END of Spoilers)<br/><br/>Fortunately, this film isn't obscure enough that it's hard to find. Make the effort to see this film. I assure you that you won't regret it."

","Steven Spielberg's wartime epic, based on the novel by J.G. Ballard, is an exploration of life under Japanese colonial rule in China during the Second World War and just before it. Like many of Spielberg's worthy movies, it's a little overlong and sluggish, a little idealistic, and certainly far too sentimental for its own good, failing to particularly portray the true suffering and nastier aspects of the situation. However, it's also refreshingly unbiased, presenting the Japanese as a real people and culture rather than the usual demonised enemy you typically see in Hollywood productions. EMPIRE OF THE SUN is certainly a lavishly-mounted movie, well photographed throughout, but it suffers from some real flaws, not least the lack of sympathetic characters. Christian Bale does very well as the lead, but there's no getting over the fact that his character is quite insufferable."
"berberian00-276-69085","10","2","6","9 May 2016"," Chinese Blood Is Worth
","I have some reminiscences about China and Chinese, but let's first talk about the film. I browsed a long list of some 100 movies on this topic and decided to choose 3 titles - merited because are produced and directed by American European staff, shot on location in China and based historically on true stories. That makes a difficult combination, especially having in mind how little do we, white people, know about Chinese National Psychology during 3000 years of China history and culture. So have the list:<br/><br/>1. Empire of the Sun (1987) - about a lost English boy in Japanese occupied Shanghai during WW II;<br/><br/>2. 55 Days at Peking (1963) - about the Boxer rebellion in 1900. Earliest big budget Hollywood movie shot in China, I presume;<br/><br/>3. Last Emperor (1987) - about the end of Manchu Dynasty in China and ensuing National Democratic Revolution. I guess, film 1 & film 3 were intentionally produced in one and same year to counterpoise directors Spielberg versus Bertolucci.<br/><br/>Seemingly, Chinese cinema devoid of it's martial arts status subsequently lacks much artistic value. Or at least this is my opinion as non-Muslim, non-Communist white spectator. For instance, John Lone and Joan Chen may look different in perspective of the Asiatics because of peculiar outlook (eyes are not slanted and skulls do not protrude) but nevertheless they remain Chinese if estimated by European and American referees. So Yellow Race does exist in the looking glass - how old and culturally viable is matter of United Nations to debate. Period.<br/><br/>I am not an ""old cock hanging on its dungs"" (anonymous citation). Most of the white people seldom had contacts with Asiatic races, per se. Here in the Balkan countries of Eastern Europe we have few representatives of the Far East. Unlike former Soviet Union, which is Slavic and Orthodox like us, most East Europeans are not acquainted with Asiatic mentality. We have long traditions with dealing the Muslim population of Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan). They are good Muslims, with Asiatic faces and no Jihadist inclinations, whatsoever. Thank You!"

","For a film that brims with such a strong passion for flying, it's quite ironic that Empire of the Sun doesn't even manage to take off at any given point over the course of its runtime. Quite a chore to sit through, this coming-of-age war drama from Steven Spielberg is completely devoid of his usual flair, remains monotonous in tone from start to finish & is pretty much unsure of what it even wants to be.<br/><br/>Based on the semi-autobiographical novel of the same name, the story of Empire of the Sun is set during the Second World War in China and tells the story of Jamie; an English kid who after getting separated from his parents during the Japanese invasion of Shanghai ends up in an internment camp where he learns to survive despite the poor conditions & establishes a good living but when the war nears its end, so does his innocence.<br/><br/>Directed by Steven Spielberg, the film opens on a fine note by wonderfully introducing all its characters and while there are various indications that the story might pick up anytime now, that moment never really arrives. The whole story feels like a compilation of many episodes sewn together without any clear idea of what Spielberg intends the film to be, plus whatever emotion it was trying to evoke from its audience simply falls flat.<br/><br/>Most of the technical aspects are sound in its execution but that part is a default option in a Spielberg feature. Production Design team does a brilliant job in putting up some authentic- looking models & set pieces, Cinematography nicely captures the surroundings & unfolding events but it also lacks the immersive dimension that invites the viewers into the story. And while John Williams delivers an expressive score, it only works in bits n pieces.<br/><br/>Editing is disappointing for the story is way longer than it needs to be, isn't properly paced either & its 154 minutes of runtime is severely felt. Also, some sequences that made its way into the final cut should've ended up on the editing room's floor instead. The only thing that saves Empire of the Sun from being a complete disaster is the magnificent performance by Christian Bale in what is his on-screen debut & he's finely supported by John Malkovich.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Empire of the Sun is possibly about the loss of innocence but it travels in so many directions that it ends up halfway on everything it was trying to be. Its motive is unclear whether one approaches it as a coming-of-age story or a war drama. The only good thing about the film is that it brought on screen a promising talent who would later go on to become one of Hollywood's most sought actors but apart from that, Empire of the Sun has nothing interesting to offer."

","I had never heard of this movie. But after hearing that Steven Spielberg directed it, I wanted to see it immediately. I made a smart choice. This movie is rich in emotion, storytelling, and history because of the author's background. Another truly marvelous thing in this movie is Christian Bale's performance. He breaks your heart as you watch it. It was another one of those movies where I was emotionally devastated when I saw it; it's right up there with ""Rent,"" and ""E.T."" Now, it surprised me when I learned that it didn't do well in theaters because people weren't use to Spielberg's transition into drama. But man! I don't understand how anyone could be disappointed in this. It's an incredible film and it will remain incredible for as long as the world is here to see it."

","I still rent and watch this movie for really only one scene. And even as I viewed the trailer to this movie moments ago on this website, it made my heart beat faster. The scene where the beautiful, lovely war machine known as the P-51 Mustang in her silver sleek skin flew by the building that had the 12-year old standing atop, yelling at the top of his lungs, ""P-51, Cadillac of the Sky"" repeatedly. In enters the roar, power, and beauty of the American air supremacy that we enjoyed back when the P-51 was in her day. The pilot had his canopy slung back, and his scarf trailing in the air still is impressed in my image. For this boy, the man piloting this beautiful plane was god-like. The scene captured all the emotion of that moment, and I tip my hat to Steven Spielberg for creating such a wonderful image that is probably my favorite scene in any movie overall. Why? The love affair we had with WWII planes and also the new planes that exist today. If you're an American patriot that is proud to wear your national pride and respect for our capability on your sleeve, watch the full movie to see this scene and it will double your heart rate, I guarantee it."

","OK, all you 'pay-check critics' and 'insightful media people'....whether you want to admit it or not....your ----- ummm..""negative comments"" are being thrown back in your face!!! Mr. Ebert, I hope you come to the comment section of this movie one day and realize the mistake you made when talking %&@$ about this flick. Now, about the movie.....<br/><br/>1) I've made EVERYone I know so far watch ""Empire of the Sun"". The movie is SO MUCH a part of me that I feel people will understand me better if they watch this movie.<br/><br/>2) It's extremely addictive. I can't even COUNT how many times I've seen it... but I ALWAYS CRY during the same certain scenes. Like when the British guy (on the roof) shakes Jim and tells him not to think so much. The way Jim reacts. Sniff! I also cry when Basie tries to take the dead woman's shoes. How 'bout when the Japanese dude can't get his plane to start; his culture thereby branding him a loser?    There's certain scenes-and this is what I feel makes the film truly unique- where you look back and think you should have felt sad, but you didn't. This is intentional; like toward the end, when one of Basie's crew shoots Jim's Japanese friend. This is because Jim has transformed into a more bitter, cold, but even stronger person, so the scene should not be so emotional, as much as a bit hopeful, accepting, but still dreamy(when Jim performs the CPR on his dead friend.)<br/><br/>3)What about when Basie wouldn't take Jim w/ him to the airfield camp, the way Jim would do ANYTHING to get in the truck w/him. ""Suzhou?! I know the way! My parents are members of the country club!""<br/><br/>4) The ""song"", which I later heard for an Amex card commercial & sung by Charlotte Church on her Cd- Suo Gan- was best sung in this movie (just curious to know if 'teenage Jim's' salute while singing was actually sung by Christian Bale; I already know the choirboy solo in the beginning wasn't sung by him.)<br/><br/>5) When I first saw this movie about 12 YEARS AGO(I'm gonna break the trend here, guys), I remember my favorite scene being the American pilot waving to Jim...man, how visually memorable. When I went to see it again, the kid in me connected w/ what the kid in Jim was supposed to connect with(I think):.............I'm not sure how to put it in words, okay, but something glorious. People keep saying things like 'that wonderful actor Bale' was 'just as great ' as a younger kid actor'....Umm...If you ask me, the way he impresses filmmakers (or the honeys) is to pop in his ""empire of the Sun"" tape  and they'd think, ""oh, well this prodigy actor has been asleep between then and now, but we'll give him another chance because we love what he did 13 ys ago"". <br/><br/>In short, Bale(though I LOVED Newsies & Swing Kids), will probably NEVER have a better performance than he did in ""Empire.""<br/><br/>This is definitely one of my favorite movies of all time."

"TheMovieDiorama","7","1","2","30 December 2019"," Empire of the Sun glaringly shines insight into the impoverished wealthy amidst war-torn China.
","Spielberg is one of a handful of directors that everyone acknowledges. Whether your interest lies with films or elsewhere, he is known to all for his eclectic filmography that tackles nearly every single genre available. The beauty of his directorial talents, is that he can manipulate any subject matter and transform its contents into an accessible piece of entertainment. From hard-hitting crime capers ('The Sugarland Express') to the depiction of African-Americans succumbing to racial/sexist abuse ('The Color Purple'). He has the ornate ability to disassemble history and shape the remnants into his Hollywood mould. But at what cost?<br/><br/>Does Spielberg's contagious requirement for accessibility downplay the severity of its subject matter? Well, Empire of the Sun may just be the most perfect example to answer the aforementioned question. It illustrates my eternal adoration for the man as an auteur, as well as his damned tendencies that bring down his historical endeavours. A young British boy living with his wealthy family in war-torn Shanghai, becomes separated from his parents where he is soon retained as a prisoner of war in an internment camp.<br/><br/>An epic adaptation of Ballard's semi-autobiographical novel, that heavily relied on a fictitious narrative to convey his own vivid memories of World War Two. A story of three vital themes that power both the characters and the central narrative. Opulence, faith and humanity. Spielberg commences the first act in a worrying light of unnecessary affluence, following a white family with an abundance of possessional wealth traversing the segregated streets of Shanghai embattled by poverty. The bitter aftertaste of supremacy as ""peasants"" desperately fight for survival. Whilst it may harken to real events, they make for unlikeable characters due to their careless perception in the environment they are enshrouded in. The father and mother are non-characters, merely acting as fuel for Jim's coming-of-age journey, and Spielberg paid far less attention to the surrounding chaos which consequently diminished the severity of the war's impact. It can be argued that the entire story, including the first act, is told through Jim's perspective. But the naive ignorance to represent the lives that were truly affected was extremely profound.<br/><br/>Then Jim, in the crowded streets of Shanghai, becomes separated from his parents. Mugged, abandoned and lost. His opulent lifestyle relinquished from his selflessness. Gradually, Spielberg constructs an epic that conveys the loss of innocence. This once fragile young boy, unbeknown to the horrors of the world, now utilising his intuition to survive the brutality of war independently. Spielberg definitely downplayed the brutalism of conflict, and instead opted for an endearing focus on Jim's abrupt development from a timid boy to unsung hero. Unsurprisingly, it worked. Spielberg's screenplay presents Jim with a plethora of challenges that tests the will of humanity in its entirety. From attempting to escape the internment camp to resuscitating the recently deceased. Jim encompasses every notion of humanity during this heightened time, naturally making him relatable. His actions slowly further his development into adulthood in such a short space of time, with much gratification aimed at Spielberg's masterful attention to characterisation.<br/><br/>Initially proclaimed as an atheist, Jim experiences metaphysical moments believed to be acts of faith, likening him to a deity of some kind. ""Giving life"" for a brief moment to the recently passed, which was an ounce of blood pumped to the brain. Witnessing a soul be released into heaven, however counteracted by the infamous Nagasaki atomic bomb. These ""acts"" grant Jim the power of self-belief, fully realising his potential as the ""hero"" of optimism.<br/><br/>There's nothing more optimistic and endearing though than watching a juvenile Christian Bale steal the entire film. Malkovich and Havers ground the enthusiasm of Bale's performance, yet his commanding presence at such a young age cements him as a talent to behold. Tender moments were handled with delicacy, whilst the louder moments fused with his boisterous personality. Quite simply, one of the best young performances I've seen. Williams' signature score, ever accompanying Spielberg's work, elevated the grandeur of the spectacular production design yet somewhat exhumed family-friendly vibes commonly found in his previous work. Admittedly that's a personal conflict of my own, but again did diminish the more powerful scenes. Jim's fascination with aircraft wasn't fully realised and felt like an afterthought to coincide with the Japanese ""friend"" in the final act, although not a substantial detriment to the overall story.<br/><br/>In the blazing heat of war camps, Empire of the Sun shines as an epic that showcases the very reason for my Spielberg idolisation and his cursed ability to lessen the severity of history. Regardless, you'll laugh, gasp and cry during this coming-of-age tale, and that's the true beauty of this auteur's timeless work."

"view_and_review","7","1","2","12 September 2019"," Empire of the Emperor
","Very few child actors can carry a movie. Giving it a quick gander I can think of McCauley Culkin in Home Alone and Haley Joel Osment in A.I. I'm sure there are others that I'm not thinking of right now but those come immediately to mind. Well, now I have to add Christian Bale. Of course, we know what a fine adult actor he turned out to be, but this movie was a sneak peak.<br/><br/>Jim (Christian Bale) was a fascinating character. He was raised as a wealthy white British kid in China. He enjoyed the luxuries of that station up until Japan attacked during WWII. Shortly after the Japanese attacked Jim was separated from his parents and then his exciting, arduous, harrowing, maturing journey began. For a privileged child he was incredibly resourceful.<br/><br/>The movie was light at times and heavy at other times. I don't it could avoid being heavy when it was about war. I can't pretend that I knew everything that was going on at all times (I honestly didn't know which soldiers were which at times). What little confusion there was could be shaken off by just focusing on Jim and his trials.<br/><br/>I went from watching The Last Emperor to watching Empire of the Sun in a few short days. These were two excellent movies about the turbulent relationship between China and Japan with two different focal points.<br/><br/>I think I've cracked the code. Put ""Empire"" or ""Emperor"" in the name of your movie. The Empire Strikes Back, Empire of the Sun, and The Last Emperor. Name your movie ""Empire of the Emperor"" and you have a hit."

"scoey","Null","2","7","9 February 2016"," Empire? Which one?
","Great Britain's ""nickname"" historically was the empire upon which the sun never sets. This was due to their far-reaching imperialist nature. The film even begins with a history lesson / scene setting exposition which illustrates how Shanghai was basically a British colony, indistinguishable from England in terms of its buildings and infrastructure. Hong Kong was still under British rule until the end of the last century.<br/><br/>So, when another reviewer, NeuroticMovieLover, describes this film as one showing the destruction caused by a nation that wanted to control everything, I must ask, which nation would THAT be? Fascism was rampant around the world, highly fashionable with those in power at that time. Business leaders in the United States bristled at the notion that Germany was not a trustworthy ally, even as they began to conquer Europe. It was only because American business interests were threatened by fascist expansion that the U.S. entered the war against the ""Axis of evil"". We were just the other side of the same imperialist coin. Our overlords were better at selling servitude as freedom than the SS, Mussolini's black shirts or the Hirohito cult of personality.<br/><br/>This film was very good at portraying people from every quarter as being as flawed as they were noble. This was not a movie condemning Japan as the bad guys."
"Atreyu_II","7","2","7","1 March 2008"," There's some good and some bad about this movie...
","Humm... this is a difficult to rate one. I'm not sure how should I rate it. It's a movie that creates mixed feelings on me. Although this is not bad for a war movie, I feel it could have been way better. I feel that the movie had potential to be solid, but ended up being only okay. But I don't want anybody to think I'm writing in Chinese, so let me explain my point.<br/><br/>The movie has an expressive story, a great soundtrack (for example, that beautiful ""Suo Gan"" theme), an amazing performance by a young Christian Bale, some of the most incredible scenes with planes ever put in a film (at least on this point it is perfect) and the movie is quite good during the first hour.<br/><br/>However, from the second half on, the movie begins to lose its initial greatness: it focus too much on the killing fields and the story (even the movie itself) loses its interest. There are still some wonderful scenes with planes in this second half of the movie and fabulous special effects (a visually stunning experience), but just that isn't enough to save it.<br/><br/>Christian Bale, like I said, is outstanding in this film. He portrays in perfection Jamie Graham, a very lively and talkative young English boy fascinated by planes (to the point of wishing to pilot one and even calling them ¬´P-51, the Cadillac of the sky¬ª) and fan of the Japanese pilots's bravery.<br/><br/>Jamie is a likable chap. However, Dainty, Frank and Basie are quite annoying. Plus, the fact that Ben Stiller is in the movie already seals the movie's fate a bit (even if his role is minor). Ben Stiller is one of the most ridiculous actors of all times.<br/><br/>This isn't one of the most violent war movies, but still there are some brutal scenes, such as Jamie's Asian friend being unfairly killed.<br/><br/>So, a reasonable movie and decent Spielberg film. But not one of his best and not one of his worst by any means."
"philip_vanderveken","7","2","7","9 August 2005"," It's good, but it's no masterpiece.
","Spielberg is one of the best of today's Hollywood directors and especially his historically inspired movies like ""Schindler's List"", ""Amistad"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"", I appreciated a lot. Knowing that this movie too was from his hand and that it told a story situated in China during the Japanese occupation of the country in WWII, really made me look forward to it, hoping for a movie that would be at least as good as the three others that I mentioned above...<br/><br/>At the start of WWII, when the Japanese start to occupy China, there are a lot of British citizens living in Shangai. A lot of them flee as the Japanese army comes closer, but the aristocratic family of the young James Graham stays, not easily willing to give up the privileged life that they are leading. But when on December 8, 1941, the Japanese take over the city, it's too late for them to get out. James gets separated from his family and finds himself living on the street and fighting for food, until he is eventually captured and taken to a confinement camp for British civilians, next to a captured Chinese airfield. Here he develops an admiration for the American captured pilots that are kept prisoner with the British civilians, as well as for the Japanese fighter pilots who take off from the airfield. And while he tries to survive among all the sick and hungry people, he keeps believing that one day he will see his parents again...<br/><br/>Overall I liked this movie, but I must say that the second part was definitely the best. As soon as he is in that POW camp and gradually calms down, I could feel sorry for James, but as long as he was that spoiled and annoying little kid who liked to boss the staff around, who didn't seem to care for any rules or regulations,... I can't say that he did something to me. And that's something that I can't say about the Japanese boy who was always hanging around on the airstrip and who I liked from the beginning. When he was about to finally realize his dream of flying a real airplane, although that would mean certain death because he was about to embark on a Kamikaze mission, I was happy for him. And it's weird, but when he couldn't take off, I truly felt sorry for him, knowing what this meant to him. So in the end I would say that for me personally it was a lot easier to empathize with him than with that spoiled British kid.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is good. Takatoro Kataoka was excellent as the young Japanese boy and John Malkovich was my favorite as Basie, but the others were OK as well. I'm not going to say that the performance of most of them was exceptional, but it was good and their acting certainly supported the interesting story. The fact that the story was written from the perspective of the young James isn't new though. Already in 1979, there was a war movie that used this concept. ""Die blechtrommel"" from Volker Schl√∂ndorff already showed the rise of the Nazi's in Gdansk, Poland (back then Danzig).<br/><br/>Overall this certainly isn't a bad movie, but it just wasn't as great as what I'm used to see from Spielberg when it comes to this kind of movies. When you've seen for instance ""Schindler's List"", then you know that he is capable of a lot more than what he has shown with this movie. I just couldn't get completely and emotionally involved in it, like I could with ""Schinldler's List"" and that's why I will give this movie a 7/10, which certainly isn't bad, but just not as much as what I would give to the other one."
"metehan711","5","2","8","31 August 2018"," Very nice - to help you fall asleep
","The focus on the daily life in a PoW camp full of Anglo-American prisoners from Shanghai is indeed a distinct aspect of the movie. Another positive part of the movie was of course the acting laid out by young Bale and Malcovich.<br/><br/>Whereas a good narrative would be enough to make this one a must-see World War II classic, after a while I felt like the narrative slowed down and started to focus on so many unnecessary details that I wished the end of the movie to come anytime soon after the first 90 minutes - and I'm pretty sure that I am on top 10% of the most patient people who have seen this piece. Indeed after a point I started to give the movie a second, a third, a fourth and so on chances but it never took any of them.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, a type of movie when you stay up late in front of the TV and run into while swapping channels, see talented actors in the cast and decide to give it a shot, then fall asleep while you watch it and don't care about the rest of it when you wake up."

","There are only a few films perhaps less well remembered in the career of director Steven Spielberg (Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan), this is one of those films, many critics see this film as a trial run for Schindler's List, I just knew it was set during the war, had a good cast and an average rating. Basically set during World War II, at the time of Japan's invasion of China, twelve-year-old British upper middle class schoolboy Jamie ""Jim"" Graham (young Christian Bale) enjoys a privileged and spoiled life in the Shanghai International Settlement. After the Attack on Pearl Harbor the Japanese invade the settlement, and Jim ends up separated from his mother (Emily Richard) and father (Rupert Frazer), through the panicked mob his parents shout that they will come back for him, Jim spends time hiding in his abandoned home and eats the remaining food. When food runs out Jim ventures out into the city, which has been devastated by bombings, he is taken in by American hustling partners Basie (John Malkovich) and Frank Demarest (Joe Pantoliano), but they are taken by the Lunghua Civilian Assembly Center in Shanghai for processing. In 1945, nearing the end of the Pacific War, Jim survives through terror and poor living conditions, establishing a successful trading network, camp leader Sergeant Nagata (Masat√¥ Ibu) gets involved with it, and Dr. Rawlins (Nigel Havers), the camp's British doctor, teaches Jim, he learns how to speak Japanese. Jim visits the American POW barracks, he idolises the Americans and their culture, Basie sends him to set snare traps outside the camp's wire, in fact Basie is using him to test the area for land mines, to plot an escape, Basie rewards Jim by allowing him to move into the American barracks. As time has passed Jim has forgotten what his parents look like, the base is suddenly attacked by a group of American P-51 Mustang fighter aircraft, as a result the Japanese decide to evacuate the camp, Basie, despite promising to take Jim with him, escapes during the confusion, many of the prisoners die of fatigue, starvation and disease during the march into the wilderness. Jim arrives with the crowd at a football stadium near Nantao, filled with confiscated luxuries, Jim wanders off and overhears the news that the Japanese have surrendered and the war is over, after witnessing a Japanese teenager he met before being killed, Basie finds him and offers to find his parents. Jim is highly traumatised by everything he has gone through, and angered by the accidental death of his friend, but he is placed by Americans in an orphanage, here he is finally reunited with his parents in the end. Also starring Miranda Richardson as Mrs. Victor, Leslie Phillips as Maxton, Peter Gale as Mr. Victor, Robert Stephens as Mr. Lockwood, Burt Kwouk as Mr. Chen, Paul McGann as Lieutenant Price and Ben Stiller as Dainty. Bale does give a good performance as the boy separated from his parents and doing whatever he can to survive, the presence of stars such as Malkovich, Richardson and Havers are fine as well, the story is based on a semi- autobiographical novel by JG Ballard, but I agree with critics, being from the point of view of the boy this is perhaps a superficial look at life during war and occupation, there are some good sequences that engage you, but overall it is just an alright Second World War coming-of-age drama. It was nominated the Oscar was Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction- Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, Best Sound, Best Film Editing, Best Music for John Williams, it won the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography, Best Score and Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Costume Design and Best Production Design, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Original Score.

","Empire Of The Sun brings together (among others) three elements: the semi-autobiographical novel by JG Ballard (not the easiest of authors) telling his loss of innocence story as a privileged English child stranded in occupied Shanghai during World War II, Stephen Spielberg making a film which is an emotional artistic epic as effortlessly as he makes movies which are broad popular entertainment, and Christian Bale as a lad whose voice hasn't even broken yet, kick-starting his career with every bit as much intensity as he has shown in his work since.<br/><br/>The film tells a small story on a big canvas. It visits childhood, as Spielberg so often does, but in a way which is less gentle than ever before. It shows the futility of war without preaching. It features a large and talented supporting cast all selflessly contributing part of the texture a film like this needs. It features memorable images - oh boy, does it ever!

The most meaningful of those moments comes, of course, at the very end when Jim is reunited with his parents, but by then the emotion has worn so thin that the impact (or potential impact) of that scene is totally lost.<br/><br/>Beyond that, Jim's frenetic ramblings and meanderings throughout the movie are inexplicable.  They can't be attributed to mental illness or shell-shock wrought by his circumstances, because they begin very early in the movie (such as when he starts nattering about contract bridge after Frank has rescued him).  This makes Jim a very unsympathetic character, and we end up not caring if he lives or dies by the end of the movie, much less whether or not he sees his parents again.<br/><br/>While I have many other beefs with this movie, most of the comments have been made elsehwere so I won't repeat them.  However, I will add that I was particularly irritated by the Basie (John Malkovich) character, which is a direct plagiarization of William Holden's character in ""Stalag 17"" or ""the King"" in ""King Rat"" -- two vastly superior movies, I might add, about similar subject matter that ""Empire of the Sun"" doesn't deserve to be mentioned with (although I just did).<br/><br/>So, what happened here?  My only conclusion is that Spielberg made this movie at the crossroads of his career -- from making outstanding action / adventure / fantasy movies that were oriented towards a younger audience, to making outstanding fact-based movies oriented towards an ""adult"" (if you will) audience.  ""The Color Purple"", two years earlier, was part of this transition (and was a slightly, though not much, better movie); ""The Last Crusade"" (an excellent movie) was another part of it.  In ""Empire of the Sun,"" Spielberg seems to have tried to accomplish both -- an adventure of a child set against the background of the Sino-Japanese conflict in WWII -- and he ends up accomplishing neither."

","'Empire of the Sun', J.B. Ballard's semi-autobiographical story of growing up in a Japanese prisoner of war camp, is one of his most conventional novels. In Steven Spielberg's hands, however, it becomes a movie that suffers from intrusive music and a certain absence of subtlety. Ballard's books are often heavy on symbolism; but this unfortunately translates into a certain heavy-handedness on film. The best thing in it is John Malkovich , who plays the enigmatically villainous Basie, a far more interesting character than Christian Bale's hero whose perpetual naivet√© never quite convinces. If it wasn't quite so long, I might have enjoyed it a little more."

He is a stuck-up brat with a wise guy answer for every question. The Chinese are presented as butt-kissers, beggars, and crooks. The Japanese military are sadists, psycho killers, and heartless butchers. The Americans are shown as an array of criminals, gamblers, backstabbers, cut-throats and heartless thugs. I really couldn't relate much to any of them. Only at the end did I find my emotions ; in the last few minutes. Maybe during times of war people act just like the characters in this film.

","Empire of the Sun is a coming of age war film based on J. G. Ballard's novel of the same title. Steven Spielberg directed the film, which stars Christian Bale, John Malkovich, Miranda Richardson, and Nigel Havers. It tells the story of Jamie ""Jim"" Graham, a young boy who goes from living in a wealthy British family in Shanghai, to becoming a prisoner of war in Lunghua Civilian Assembly Center, a Japanese internment camp, during World War II.<br/><br/>During the Japanese invasion, Jamie ""Jim"" Graham is separated from his parents. With the help of soldier-of-fortune Basie,he learns to survive without a retinue of servants at his beck and call. By the time they are tossed into a Japanese prison camp, Jim has picked up enough street- smarts and developed enough intestinal fortitude to regard his imprisonment as an exciting adventure. The story ends during the 1945 liberation: on the verge of manhood, the 13-year-old Jim will never again be the pampered and privileged brat. <br/><br/>The movie is always interesting from a narrative point of view. Spielberg is a good storyteller with a good tale to tell.

","A very young Christian Bale stars as Jim Graham in ""Empire of the Sun"". Based on the novel by J.G. Ballard, it is the story of an English boy struggling to survive under Japanese occupation in WWII. The cast of ""Empire of the Sun"" deliver extremely strong performances. A pleasant surprise can be found in the foreign languages spoken throughout the film‚Äî although I had no idea what was being said, I got a general impression thanks to the way the lines were said.<br/><br/>Christian Bale's character undergoes a drastic transformation due to his WWII experiences (but his dream of flying a plane remains consistent), and observing this transformation on screen is just amazing. Bale gives one of the best child actor performances in a film to date.<br/><br/>An interesting thing throughout ""Empire of the Sun"" is the portrayal of the Japanese. Their part in the war is rarely touched on in WWII movies‚Äî after all, Nazis and their persecution of Jews provides a more ""interesting story"". Although the Japanese are unmistakably ""the enemy"", at times one feels great empathy for them, particularly the kamikaze pilots Jim admires. One fascinating character is a (Chinese, I think) boy about Jim's age, who, too, dreams of flying. The difference between the two is this: the Chinese boy is free; he eventually joins with the Japanese as a pilot. The boy has practically no speaking interaction with Jim, and yet, the two characters are powerfully contrasted (I will avoid my bad habit of over-elaborating here).<br/><br/>John Williams composes yet another fascinating score. A Welsh lullaby (called ""Suo Gan"", according to Ian Freer in his book ""The Complete Spielberg"") features quite prominently in the music, and its use is perfectly timed. The first time it's used, it's just a hilarious opportunity to watch Christian Bale lip-sync the song (faltering every once in a while, which is practically inevitable). But its subsequent usage becomes extremely powerful, as one remembers just what kind of boy Jim was when he first sang it in the film. The music's haunting melody is something that will probably stay with the audience long after the film is done.<br/><br/>Call me biased if you like, but I really admire Spielberg's direction. ""Empire of the Sun"" is filled with heart-wrenching moments without launching into bathos. Spielberg makes some really clever directing choices. For instance, the first time we meet Basie (John Malkovich), who becomes something of a father figure to Jim, Spielberg doesn't show his face in full. It is always somewhat blocked by the shadows. Even when he goes out into the streets, he wears sunglasses, so we cannot see his eyes. This deliberate mysteriousness pays off, as it serves to spice up the audience's interest in this new character.<br/><br/>I won't really describe the plot (which, to be honest, is amazing), because this is a film not worth spoiling. This is a little treasure. ""Empire of the Sun"" just about flopped at the box office, and has become practically forgotten, but it is nonetheless one of Spielberg's best films‚Äî a great movie that I highly recommend."

","This film marked Steven Spielberg's first foray into 'serious' film-making. Serious meaning no aliens, man-eating sharks, or whip-wielding men in fedoras. It was also released in December which is prime Oscar season, and though young Christian Bale was not nominated for an Oscar, he really should have been. Several times he completely blew me away. He took Jim Graham through so many different places and was brilliant at all of them. From snot-nosed British brat to Japanese POW survivor, he was brilliant all the way. I only saw about the last twenty minutes of the film about ten years ago and was moved to tears by the end. I saw the entire film last night and was practically bawling by the end.<br/><br/>The camera work was a bit of a departure for Spielberg, with a lot of sweeping shots and slow pushes in, but it's all gorgeously done. The most beautiful example of how an amazing performance and great cinematography is a scene near the end when the camera very slowly pushes (almost creeps) in on Bale. It's just great film-making.<br/><br/>Bale is the absolute stand out performer in this film, which is good seeing as how he's the main character. It should be no surprise he made it out of the child star mold and became on of the most respected actors of his generation. The much lauded Malkovich is splendid as is British actor Nigel Havers. A young Ben Stiller makes a startling appearance to anyone who's only known him for his more goofy roles (not that he's entirely serious here). Spielberg also broke his own mold and made a great drama with almost no action. It's just an excellent film all around."

"TxMike","Null","1","4","18 September 2006"," Christian Bale's performance as the English boy in China during the war.
","I viewed this movie mainly for the performance of young (12 or 13) Christian Bale, and I was not disappointed. This is a rather long, involved movie, about the British living in China during the 1940s, and suddenly finding themselves swept up in the Japanese invasion, which coincided with the attack on Pearl Harbor, December 8th, 1941. Bale, as young Jim Graham, separated from his parents, is in virtually every scene, and is required to carry the movie. He does it admirably.<br/><br/>John Malkovich is one of the Americans, Basie, that Jim encounters in his journey. It seems that Basie only cares for his own survival, and only befriends others that may help him in that regard. Other Americans he meets include Joe Pantoliano and a young adult Ben Stiller.<br/><br/>The story is based on the book, written by a real British citizen who as a boy went through the same experience. It is not clear how much of what we see is fact, how much has been dramatized for the movie, however since it is a Spielberg movie, I suspect the whole story is very plausible.<br/><br/>SPOILERS. Expecting some action from the Japanese, Jim's family left their home and went to a hotel in Shanghai for a few nights. While there, the Japanese invasion began. As Jim and his parents were holding hands, trying to make it through the thick crowd, Jim dropped his model 'Zero' plane, and when he let go for just the few seconds, mom and dad were swept away. Jim found himself alone to survive. He ended up in an internment camp, where food was scarce and may died. Over the years there he lost his enchantment for the Japanese. Several years older, when the war ends, he is reunited with his parents, who looked like they had it pretty easy during the war. Through the experience Jim went from a pampered young boy to a young man."

The conversation between a child and a crook is always interesting. The plot develop naturally, and I can feel the evolution of the boy, with every experience that he confront. <br/><br/>When I first saw the movie, I was still in the same age with ""Jim"", and until now every time the movie is in the program, I tune to the channel.

"oliraceking","7","1","4","13 June 2006"," Good attempt at adapting the story, but Spielberg's the wrong director
","I think that had David Lean gone ahead and directed this movie it could have been an all time great film. Instead, Spielberg brought his personal angle to it, which means it falls from greatness.<br/><br/>I think Spielberg wanted to bring an E.T. ""Child-centric"" theme to the film. Great, but the problem is that it means the other characters have to be neglected. Had Lean made this, he would have made the film an hour longer by including those other characters. I mean, Miranda Richardson gets second billing, yet she has about 4 lines of dialogue. I wanted to know more about her and the other supporting characters. Unfortunately they were sacrificed in the edit room, for time I presume.<br/><br/>You feel that Empire of the Sun has an hour of deleted scenes that, if put back in, could make it one of the best films of that decade. I wish he'd had the confidence to give us more characterisation than just Jim (played by a remarkable Christian Bale). Still, it's a strong film with great technical proficiency. It's definitely worth a viewing."
"PrivateIce","10","1","4","6 June 2004"," A stunning movie, based upon a true story.
","Anyone who has read at least a few of the reviews here, will at least know the basis of the story. But it amazes me how few people understand its origins, and how wonderfully it translated in to the movie medium.<br/><br/>The story is based upon the life of J. G. Ballard (James... Jim), and the true story of how he became separated from his parents at the sacking of Shanghai, by the Japanese, which formally opened hostilities between Japan and China. Jim's father was essentially a 'tai-pan' of shanghai, the English political men with the money. As the invasion happened, with all of these wealthy people trying to escape, Jim was separated, and proceeded to live out the war off his own wits, and through the prison camps and eventual liberation by the Americans. J. G. Ballard wrote the book as an auto-biographical story of his life, and even with a little bit of (well done) creative license by Spielberg, the story (and more importantly, message) more or less remains the same.<br/><br/>This was the second world war, remember? It lasted a long long time, and many many people died, a significant portion of which perished in the prison camps administered by the Japanese. There are a also a number of reviewers here that talk of the similarities to King Rat, as if it is some sort of 'rip-off'. King Rat and Tai-Pan were both written by James Clavell, one of the survivors of Changi, another prison camp administered by the Japanese. The similarities exist because both stories occurred in basically the same environment, as told by some of the people that lived through them.<br/><br/>It is Steven Spielbergs best movie. And in his first movie, masterfully directed, and proof that he has always been a great actor, Christian Bale. With John Malkovich as imperious as ever, and so many other fine actors like Nigel Havers, Joe Pantoliano, and Miranda Richardson.<br/><br/>It is a beautifully done movie, about a boy on his own, growing up in the most tragic, and yet awe-inspiring of circumstances. And if people can't see the truth in the acting, then it probably has more to do with not believing real-life, even when it's right in front of them."
"peterneu","Null","1","4","16 March 2004"," great film
","With Empire of the Sun, Steven Spielberg transformed into cinema the dark vision of the world and its future of the novelist,  J. G. Ballard.  Of course credit should also be given to brilliant scriptwriter Tom Stoppard, but in this film, Spielberg presents a story of a traumatized British boy's shifting identity as ""empires"" shred, with power shifting from Britain in China to Japan, then to the nuclear terror ""empire of the sun"" of the newly-harnessed atomic weaponry of the United States.  But by all three of its `authors,' this story of ideological shifting is as much about the world at war as about the boy Jim's separation from and longing for his parents -- to whom does this lost boy belong?  Jim is struggling to know who he is, and how to function in a world where arbitrary and shifting power becomes the only absolute.  Jim needs a nurturing mother and a legitimately authoritative father.  The story of Empire is the story of Jim's struggling search, and our search with him, for a sense of belonging in a world where violent power has become absolute. The two words, ""ideology"" and ""identity"" share much common meaning. Because he is struggling to grow up -- coming of age -- at the same time as he is separated from his parents in war, Jim is struggling to find an identity.  Ordinarily, one knows what is ""the same"" with one's own values by means of a symbol-system, or ideology.  But Jim's values and emerging identity are bombarded by the collapse of such systems, and he must first struggle to survive, physically and spiritually.  Through the eyes and the mind and heart of Jim, the novel's author, J. G. Ballard, presents an autobiographical narrative of his own experiences in Shanghai and Japanese internment camps in China.  Ultimately, at the end of the film, it is questionable whether or not Jim has been able to integrate his experiences with suffering and death when we look into his empty, traumatized eyes. He is found by his parents, and is being embraced by his mother, but we do not know his future. In his young world of fantasy where might is right and beautiful, Jim dreams of airplanes -- symbols, fetishes and talismans, the ultimate incarnations of power.  For Jim they are dreamlike, exalted objects of worship.  Jim is a boy who is deeply enamored with the new technologies of war.  His every day- and night-time dream is filled with visions of the newest warplanes and their dogfights and bombing raids.  So, increasingly, he binds himself to the imagery of death technology in American media.  He grows to love their violence.   Jim's problem with his identity, with his sense of  to whom and to what set of values he belongs, is represented to us with this fascination of his with airplanes.  He tries to compensate his missing and lost family love with his love for planes and flying.  In one scene when Jim and the displaced Europeans are brought into a camp to help build an airport runway, Jim sees a Japanese Zero being worked on in a hanger.  He slowly approaches and lovingly caresses it while choral music builds, and a surreal background of soft lighting, light from welders' torches, smoke and golden sparks from grinders presents us with another seemingly supernatural scene. Three Japanese pilots approach the plane, and when Jim sees them, he slowly comes to reverent military attention, and he and the Japanese exchange salutes. Planes not only substitute for his parents.  In one scene, when American planes bomb and strafe the airfield, Jim shouts hysterically, ""I touched them!  I felt their heat!  I could taste them in my mouth!  Oil and cordite!""  We know that Jim is deprived of parents, and we also know of the importance of food symbols and the motif of  starvation in the film.  But this is the first time that Jim's seeking, and finding, of nurturing from the airplane is made explicit.  His friend and, to some degree, father substitute, Dr. Ransome rushes up onto the roof where Jim is running and shouting crazily and tells him to ""Get down!"" and ""Stop thinking so much!"" Jim weeps, telling the doctor that he can't remember what his parents look like, then goes into a trance-like state, and chants his Latin lessons which he has been working on with Dr. Ransome, but with the words: ""Amatus sum,"" I am loved. In the novel, Jim witnessed American planes shot down, and the pilots unable to eject, and burning alive in their seats.  As with the kamikaze pilots, these pilots are just part of the weaponry machinery.  They cannot separate.  The order of this war-time structure means that even Jim himself also has no individual human worth apart from the military machine.  Ideas of individual coherence or integrity have less and less meaning as the war, and Jim's experience of being lost within it, continue. ""Despite everything, he knew he was worth nothing.""  The deaths of the pilots were ""a premonition of his death, the sight of his soul joining the larger soul of the dying world.""  His cheerful American friends in the camp turn out in the end only to be other servants of death.  When he learns of the new weapon, the atomic bomb, Jim knows that they also are not only destroyers of human bodies, but also of distinct, autonomous selfhood. Basie tells Jim that since he has seen the bomb, he might appear in Life. Up until the point of the dropping of the bomb and his experience of Mrs. Victor's ascent, all Jim's actions lead in the direction of fulfilling his obligations to death in war.   Since only as an object of death can he be fully known and ""loved"", Jim is only perfected in his weakness and submission to the machinery of death.   At the end of the war, after the atomic weapon has been used, has the fighting really ended?  Jim becomes aware, with the killing of his kamikaze friend that he has entered a world where there could be no leaving behind the horror of war, where war has become total. In a scene reminiscent of the hospital attempted revival, an American has stupidly shot dead Jim's young kamikaze friend  just as the Japanese boy had given Jim a mango and they were about to share it, providing Jim with a little of the nurturing he so desperately needs and desires.  Jim is shocked and outraged by the stupid, wanton killing.  The night before this attempted magical revival scene, Jim had just witnessed the explosion of the atomic bomb, immediately after a mother substitute, Mrs. Victor, had died in his arms.  In that scene, Jim at first believed that the strange new light across the sky was Mrs. Victor's soul going to heaven. When Jim hears the report of the bomb on the radio, his identity is once again shattered. Jim now no longer worships the god of death and destruction, the airplane.  He believes that he now possesses the power of the sun, and is an almighty healer.  Believing his hands to possess supernatural powers after having witnessed the power of the sun, having seen the light from the explosion of the atomic bomb, Jim applies the same heart massage to the just-killed Japanese boy, while chanting, ""I can bring them back.  Everyone.""  As he moves forward and down massaging the chest of his shot friend, the light of the sun glares into the camera lens, then clears as Jim moves back up. This glare pattern, alternating with Jim, repeats many times.  We then see a shot of the body Jim is giving the heart massage to, and it has become the younger schoolboy Jim who has been left behind years earlier.  A few moments later, we see that it really is still the Japanese boy Jim is trying to revive, but blood oozes from his mouth with each press on his stopped heart. The young kamikaze pilot, with whom he shared model planes, and who protected him during his near-suicidal pheasant-hunt, in many ways represented Jim's confusing Japanese identity -- his double.  But he is very dead. Although heavy, this is great, meaning potentially classic, film-making."

This is one of the few movies that I have held close to my heart over the years. Even my younger brother loved it and he is seven years younger than I (he was with me when I first saw this movie).

I see he won a couple of Young Artists Awards, but this display of acting is surely competition for the cream of 1987 - incidentally the Best Actor Oscar for '87 was won by Michael Douglas for 'Wall Street'.

","Empire of the Sun is an interesting mix of Spielberg's talents.  The man is one of the most gifted storyteller's in Hollywood, but some topics are extremely difficult for him to portray.  Many of his staple 80s crew is used here from Michael Kahn to John Williams and even Allen Daviau (who creates here the best work of his career), but it is the script that suffers the most from his work.<br/><br/>Empire of the Sun can easily be considered a more mature version of An American Tail, also Spielberg, because they rely on similar hooks and devices to carry the story and involve the audience.  I will admit that his use of the camera has gotten steadily better even though JAWS is a tough mark to beat.  The editing feels totally off and, while I would've like some more depth in some scenes, jumps too far around after trying to get us adjusted to the world we are now in.  The opening exposition, Eurocentric as it is, only paves way for an even longer first act that tries explaining too much of the world in December 1941.<br/><br/>In another fashion, Empire of the Sun represents Spielberg's urge to create a vision that would become Schindler's List.  I am happy there is no flag-waving or jingoism on the part of Christian Bale's character.  He is one of the best child actors I have seen, even when he is responsible for carrying the entire movie on his diminutive shoulders.  John Malkovich is good, but his character's lack of dimension is the fault of the writer, not him.<br/><br/>Overall, an interesting, albeit free-spirited, movie that might please drama buffs.  Others may be turned off by its long runtime.  After all, it's about a boy who loves flying but never gets a chance while the world collapses around him.  2.5 out of 5 stars.

","This stunning masterpiece being overlooked proves the sad truth that most moviegoers have been willing to shut off their brains. This is not A-Z storytelling entertainment, but is pure art in movie making itself. I can think of at least 3 classes in which this movie can be shown for educational purpose. This movie contains rich symbolism and other literary devices, and the fact that it is based on a novel make it a must for an English/literature class. History classes can use it too since the film is about WWII. Drama classes must show it to serious students who want to learn a thing or two about acting from Christian Bale (which is beyond words). Film student definitely need to see this movie most of all.<br/><br/>
The music score by John Williams is outstanding. The acting, especially from Christian Bale, is simply too astounding to explain. There are a lot of memorable scenes, but the ones that stands out most are: Kamikaze salute, atomic bomb, and of course the Cadillac of the sky.<br/><br/>This is not a movie you should miss."
"100favorite","Null","1","4","26 April 2003"," Decidedly on my ""100 Favorite"" list.
","They don't make movies this great anymore, or at least, I haven't seen any such lately. It is an epic, as I think it was meant to be, but the director achieved more, perhaps than he thought.  The credit belongs chiefly to the young actor, Christian Bale, whose career,I confess, I have not followed, but who, among a well selected cast, not the least of whom are John Malkovich and Miranda Richardson (anyone ever seen a BAD movie that John Malkovich was in?)are the pivotal players, and truly make the film.  An incredible support cast does a great effort, and succedes in a flawless line of action. [Did you notice Ben Stiller? He's in there for a small part, but, of course, done well. Remember the old line, ""there are no small parts; only small actors""? This gives one a look at a ""small part"" for a future great actor. From the first time I saw this film, in the '80's, I have been haunted by the music [John Williams] and the performances, especially of the child actor.  I greatly disagree with a previous reviewer that this is in any way a David Lean wannabe film.  In fact, I believe it is truly unique, even for Spielberg, and all connected with the film.  I am a member of this era and everything from the mannerisms to the hairstyles are so very correct.  The only thing I ever noticed was that the silver dollar (used as a golf chip and later found by ""Jamie"" in the pool) seemed to be anachronistic, but I may be wrong.  I have watched many times, and perhaps my eyes are not as good as they once were. This most assuredly stays on my ""100 Favorite"" list, and heartily do I advise those who know not of this history to view it.  I am buying a copy for my grandchildren's library.  It is not only a good film, it is an important film, about which I can say that few make the list.  If you view and are interested by this film, I suggest that you read and view ""The Good Earth"", written by Pearl S. Buck.  Even now, with all the digital properties of movies, the special effects are remarkable, and the acting, characterization is superb.  It gives the viewers a background on China in pre-WWII times, from the view of the Chinese peasants. In any case, I suspect that ""Empire of The Sun"" will grow in it's ability to attract viewers, and in a most engaging manner.  It is difficult to view this film with emotional detachment, especially for one who remembers WWII, or for anyone who was once a child."
"Li-1","Null","1","4","27 November 2002"," Christian Bale is brilliant.
","8 out of 10<br/><br/>Empire of the Sun is a powerful drama that tells the story of young James Ballard (Christian Bale), a British child who was trapped in WWII China as the Japanese quickly took power.  This is probably among Steven Spielberg's least well-known works, probably because of its box office failure and lukewarm critical response, but it's one of his better ones (which says a lot) and definitely his most underrated film to date.<br/><br/>Spielberg's direction is typically first-rate; most of the film's quality actually hinges on Christian Bale's performance, and thank God he doesn't disappoint.  As a matter of fact, his riveting turn is the strongest display of acting I've ever seen from a child performer (yes, even better than the supremely talented Haley Joel Osment).  With Bale at the center, what could have been a lousy WWII drama is instead an emotionally effective and quite uplifting tale that never fails to grip you from beginning to end.  A definite must see for drama fans."

Although it is very close to being tied with The Shawshank Redemption.<br/><br/>It has beautiful cinematography, one of my favorite scores, great acting (especially by Christian Bale), and...I don't know. It's just really good. But it's not for everyone. Some think it's too boring and slow. But I try to show it to everyone and recommend it to them, and some of them really enjoyed it.<br/><br/>It's about Jamie, a British boy taken into a concentration camp, and his change, and so on.<br/><br/>The greatest film of all time!

","Well, I've to say that I didn't expect much when I decided to watch that film. Another too long story that won't give you anything. But man, I was impressed. I've seen many films in my life, but nevertheless, this one ranks among my personal top-favourites. Spielberg has done a tremendous and simply excellent kind of work with producing this movie. The story is brilliant and the setting is great. Besides, Christian Bale shows one of the most impressive and finest portrayals of a character I've ever seen, he's acting as if he knew which feelings and emotions this boy has deep inside. I really wonder why this unique work by Mr. Bale didn't receive an academy award. Since Jimmy Stewart playing George Bailey in ""It's a Wonderful Life"", no character was played so intensive and convincing like young Jim. The scene where the boy is standing and singing together with the Japanese pilots, and the following scene when he stands on that building seeing this plane passing by belong to the most outstanding movie-sequences I've ever seen. I recommend this masterpiece to simply everyone, and I'm really happy of having seen this movie. Greetings from Austria!!"
"JerBear-2","10","1","4","23 October 1998"," See? Spielberg can make a good movie!
","Steven uses a light artistic brush when applying the overwrought music, the special effects and his inimitably scmaltzy style and it works. Probably one of the best movies of the decade by one of the last directors I ever thought I'd expect it from. Most successful sure, but a film of style, insight and gracious humanity? Plus, this is an area of the war that few people have tackled. I'm amazed. This is a film that deserves to be watched again and again. The acting is superb, the characters are superb, and the cinematography is awesome. The fact that two of the most talented actors working today (John Malkovich and Joe Pantalioni) are in this is just icing on an already perfectly baked cake."
"Brooklyn-10","10","1","4","23 September 2000"," MAGNIFICENT
","This is one of the most overlooked screen gems in cinematic history. By all rights, ""Empire"" should have won Best Picture at the Academy Awards, but inexplicably it was criticized for not being usual Spielberg fantasy fare. I believe that it is this movie, not ""Schindler's List"" that is Spielberg's masterpiece to date. He paints a moving, poignant epic upon a canvas of stunningly beautiful cinematography. Christian Bale pours his heart and soul into a performance that could well be the best ever given by a child actor. As young Jim, separated from his parents, he shows us the gritty, crafty resilience that children can have in dire circumstances. His fear and determination touch us and we admire him, wondering if we, as adults, could cope or adapt as well in the same situation.<br/><br/>Too numerous to mention are the scenes which are heart-rending or simply surreal. For me, the essence of this movie is captured in the scene in which Jim scurries to the roof to watch his heroes fly by, and cries in exultation, ""CADILLAC OF THE SKY!..."""

The cinematography is incredible, scenes like the send-off for the young kamikaze pilot, the P-51 strafing run, the drive through Shanghai, the Christmas party (revealing the Japanese in the fortification), the A-bomb flash, all these were carried off incredibly well. Only an insensate fool could fail to be moved by this film, based on a true story"

","I saw Empire of the sun yesterday and I have to say that even though I have seen it before, this was the first time it really dawned on me that it is in fact a masterpiece. Spielbergs control over the medium is fabulous. The way he tell his story trough images, sounds and music is perfect. Example: The sequence when Jim enters his mothers room and its empty, except for the powder on the floor. And trough the prints in the powder Spielberg tell us what Jim think has happened to his mother and when Jim can`t handle this he opens the window and all the prints in the powder is erased. Pure genius. The entire picture is filled with these moments of Pure Film and that is what makes it such a good movie."

However, I remember loving the music, that song that the boys' choir sang at the beginning was just genius.  To have watched it 6 years later, at the age of 11, on the laserdisc, made me certain that it was the best movie ever made.

I thought Bale did a good job, but I downrighted hated his character. I felt no sympathy for him since he is a world-class brat. On the other hand, John Malkovich did a splendid job. I was surprised that I saw Ben Stiller to a film like this.<br/><br/>There were some scenes that went way too long and some I have no idea what happened. I didn't even realize that four years go by in the film.<br/><br/>But the cinematography and score stand out.

"ejb4501","10","1","5","8 July 2006"," Absolutely one of Spielbergs best
","Underrated is right. This film has so been ignored when discussing truly great films and certainly the films of Spielberg. This film came out the same year as Bertolucci's ""The Last Emperor"", and was buried under the buzz of that film. Too bad, because Spielberg achieved what Bertolucci could not: Encase and convey a highly personal story within the context of particularly turbulent historical events. The experiences of Spielbergs ""Jim"" are felt more deeply than those of Bertolucci's Pu Yi. Both films are visually stunning, and on an epic scale. But these qualities tend to overshadow the human story of Last Emperor, and this is a human tragedy of epic scale! It is about China's last monarch, the last of a line dating back thousands of years. It is about the extinction of a species. Pu Yi is the last Mohican, so to speak, the last dinosaur. And yet, the deep, personal sadness of this doesn't come through anywhere near as profoundly as the broad and deep emotions of the boy Jim living through Japanese internment in Spielberg's Empire of the Sun. We get underneath Jims's skin, and ride the emotional roller- coaster that is his life. Conversely, we watch Pu Yi, often with the level of understanding one might have watching an animal in a zoo. We may feel some pity at it's captivity, but then we see it fed and housed and calm, and we figure, ""Well, I guess it's not that bad."" And of course there is this: Empire of the Sun makes me cry every damn time I watch it."

The story of a young boy who finds himself amidst the turmoil of a world under the wages of war and in the end finds the beauty within the evil. I think that the cinematography, score and the actors under Spielberg were awesome, but perhaps most important of all- it's a tremendous story. As a film student it's the kind of film that I love because it's the reason I go to the theater and make pictures. In the end you walk away and hopefully your a better person than when you arrived.

"gottogorunning","10","1","5","13 August 2005"," Materpiece!
","If The Doors was Oliver Stone's baby, then Empire of the Sun is Spielberg's. This is his signature piece, if not his masterpiece: from the airplanes to the rolling dolly shots to the film stock quality, Empire of the Sun reflects all that is great about Spielberg's craftsmanship as a film maker without the bombast and over-sentimentality. The scale of the film is enormous, the production values incomparable. You can feel that no effort was spared to recreate the world recorded in J.G. Ballard's novel--from the crowds of Shanghai to the concentration camps, the Kafkaesque compound of confiscated goods in a vast open field in China, parachutes containing rations dropping from the sky: every scene is perfectly realized. Even Kubrick could not have done better. The atomic bomb blast sequence is hauntingly realistic and ominous. Who can forget that scene when Jim tries to retrieve his glider and sees a line of Japanese aviators on a hill in the distance, taking up the entire movie frame? The lighting of the sky, the ominous mood--pure cinematic genius. This is also one of Spielberg's most subtle films in terms of characterization--Christian Bale is superb as is John Malkevich--both convey how individuals cope with the horrors of war with acceptance and pragmatism. I have to say that this film is superior to both Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List as an organic work of art, as well an archetypal story for all nations. I am not a big fan of Spielberg, but Empire of the Sun gets my vote as his masterpiece."
"mjrenick","10","1","5","3 July 2005"," Riveting!
","I think this movie was so under-rated! Christian Bale should have gotten an academy award for this portrayal of a child and his ability to survive in the harshest of circumstances. I don't think Christian Bale has gotten the recognition he deserves as an artist and I predict in the near future, he will! Every time this movie is on, I watch it. The most moving part of the movie, to me, is the song he sings while saluting the Japanese air force - wow. It gives me chill bumps! And of course, why didn't I realize it was a Steve Spielburg movie! The sky was beautiful! You must see this movie if you have not!

","Bale is excellent(fantastic, amazing, brilliant, shockingly good) in the lead role with strong performances no matter how trivial they are from the rest of the supporting cast. Spielberg works to provide an amazing story here presented in strong emotive colors. The end result is excellence and although the director, yet again, dabbles a bit too far in sentimentality - he can be forgiven as what is produced is a rounded scope on humanity and how that can come through in such hard times. Scenes that resemble paintings of great art include the crowd sequence at the beginning along with the bombing scene and of course the salute. There is also an hilarious cameo from Ben Stiller although I don't think it was meant to be. A great film that is slightly underrated in history and closely resembles a work of art. Go see it."

Of course, as soon as the Batman movie comes out on DVD I shall be first in the queue to buy it.

It is a great movie and I hope it gets a lot of attention now that Bale is getting big-screen block-buster coverage now.

"eagle0468","10","1","5","15 February 2005"," A Timeless Classic
","Two of the most powerful performances of my generation were presented in this cinematic masterpiece. Christian Bale's initial blockbuster role could arguably be his best ever. Playing an eight year old boy who becomes lost during the panic of the Japanese attack on Shang Hai in the early years of World War II; through several years of survival in various internment camps until the end of the war. Bale's portrayal of a somewhat ADD afflicted youth was pinnacle to the success of the film. He was astonishing, and anchored the production very well. John Malkovich played the antagonist to the hyperactive child brilliantly and added another very round character to the film. Although the film centers mainly on Jim and Basie, there are some subplots that were included, but could have been developed better. Dr. Rawlins struggle to save his patients and his obvious resistance to his Japanese guardians was not well developed although it was a key event more to develop Jim's character than to present or fulfill the Dr. Rawlins character.<br/><br/>The cinematography of Empire of the Sun was stunning. The party scene of Jim playing with his glider and finding the downed Zero. Then subsequently ""discovering"" the Japanese soldiers was very well done. The Shang Hai city scenario was stunning in it's panorama and detail. The fade in to Jim obviously older and wiser in the internment camp, with him running around still the hyperactive child at the beginning, meeting everyone exchanging and bartering. The dogfight scenes with the P-51 Mustangs, and Jim yelling, ""the Cadillac of the skies!!"" and him running back and forth on the roof; to the final scenes of the prisoners march north, and Jim seeing Mrs. Victor's soul flying into heaven (the bomb being dropped on Nagasaki). These all contributed to an absolutely riveting film experience.<br/><br/>The only part of the film that I can truly say is overdone is when the Japanes pilot gets shot, and Jim tries to resuscitate him. I really was ready for him to stop yelling after the fifth or sixth repetition of his line. The film was neither anticlimactic nor was it an overly happy ending. Jim finally is reunited with his parents, yet the scars of surviving basically on his own are forever impressed in his eyes. A scene that I will always remember."
"quecobelo2","Null","1","5","25 July 2004"," The greatest movie ever
","The first time I saw Empire of the Sun I was to young to understand the meaning of the film. But that scene when Jim lost his parents kept on in my memory. Many years passed and I watch it again and I couldn't stop the tears from running though my eyes. That's why I think the Empire of the Sun is one of Spielberg's best movie ever made. It is so simple and so strong, filled with sad and tough moments experienced by those people. The change of looks that Cristian Bale's character suffers is amazing, from wealthy boy to a boy who has nothing, to win or to lose. The sound track is so sad and beautiful at the same time. I can't get enough of watching it. It's such a beautiful film and one of my personal favorites."

I have many favourite scenes, including the scene when Jim salutes the Japanese pilots.<br/><br/>FAV 1 -The scene that puts a big lump in my throat is when Jim starts to sing ""Suo Gan"". I love this song and actually discovered that it is a Welsh Lullaby.<br/><br/>FAV 2 -My other favourite scene is when Jim tells the very sick Mrs. Victor to pretend she is dead. Which they both do to avoid having to continue on with the other prisoners. Jim wakes up and tries to wake Mrs. Victor, but she is dead. Then a brilliant light fills the sky and Jim thinks it was Mrs. Victor's soul going to heaven when in actual fact what he saw was the bombing of Hiroshima.<br/><br/>FAV 3 -Now that I am a mother, I found the last scene very emotional. All the mothers and fathers looking at a crowd of children desperately hoping to see their childs face. Jim's parents move through the crowd, until Jims mother sees Jim and holds him tight.<br/><br/>A beautiful story of War through the eyes of a child, who through his experiences matures years beyond his age.<br/><br/>Other Favourite movies; The Last of the Mohicans, Rudy, Schindlers List, Glory."

","*****POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!!*******<br/><br/>I saw this film when I was 8 and it stayed planted in my brain. A passionate little boy in the middle of a terrible war doing what he can to keep his life and soul intact. <br/><br/>People get sick, disillusioned, but not Jim. He is the heart and soul of the English camp, who by his own words, had become ""too lethargic."" There is even a scene where, if he lays some traps, is cool enough to move to the American camp. Of course,this consists of baseball, good times, the latest magazine subscriptions, and saluting. Really cool scenes there and not overly done. Watch for a cameo of Ben Stiller saying one of the coolest lines ever, about a Hersheys bar! <br/><br/>Make no mistake, there is a lot of wit and humour in this film. This is especially due to John Malkovich as Basie ( as a street-smart, f-you,i'll-look-out-for-myself attitude) and Joe Pantoliano as Frank,(his secretary/a**kisser). I would say that Basie's role kind of clich√©s Americans, but he stands alone among them anyways.<br/><br/>Of course, since this is a war film, you will need some tissue, because Steven Spielberg knows how to tell a story. It is so dramatic because of its poignancy. There are scenes that induce tears of sadness, yes. But there are also scenes that induce tears of joy. Like one, involving Jim on the roof, with a B-51 passing by..that's all I'll say. Scenes that come after such a build up of character from Jim, played by Christian Bale, that you know more than information by this scene. By the time this scene rolls around, you *feel everything Jim does. From his love for planes, from his need to be young and free, and to focus on survival instead of tragedy.<br/><br/>I realize a film is supposed to make you feel for the main character, but it is more than that in this film. It's almost as if you are falling in love with this boy. He has the attitude and the cajonas to be the way you'd like to be in a war situation. Spirited, intellectual, healthy. You even hear him recite Latin with Nigel Haver's character in a hospital room with people dying right next to him. <br/><br/>This film brushes a bit with irony, but never makes it too obvious. It is more of a visual beauty, then another clich√© thrown at you. The whole idea of rich(mostly English) people living in Shanghai who for generations, had been building an image of their own country. Then all of the sudden, war breaks out and they are trapped. Suddenly they feel just as hopeless as all the struggling lower-class people in China. <br/><br/>Spielberg has taken a beautiful novel by JG Ballard and has added his stylistic and lasting touches. It is a visual feast, the I feel that his best movie is probably Schindlers List, but this is my favourite Spielberg film."

","I never saw this film on its original release, and have somehow missed it in the intervening years until now. I guess that there is nothing left to say about the eye-openingly mature performance that was given by Christian Bale (but it was!) so I'll (mostly) skip that. So, how was the film? Well, it strikes me that Japanese prisoner of war camps probably really were not that much fun. I appreciate that this was an all-ages film, and that demonstrating that the Japanese were just people too was part of the point, but I still feel that the overall terror and brutality of the situation was not as well conveyed as it should have been. The camp, as seen through Jim's eyes, seemed like a slightly grungy Butlins (well, not really, but you catch my drift). Bizarrely (for a self-professed movie fan) I've not seen Schindler's List either, and I am now even more curious to see how Spielberg handled that World War II story in comparison."

","SPielberg is the best, his films are some of the best, this is no exception. The story covers a different side of WW2, but is just as interesting. The performances, sometimes alittle bit over the top, are mostly good, especially the young Bale, who probably did his best work. There's action, drama, humor, and adventure, no too much of anything, but still is off balance a tad, its long but feels somewhat thrown together. Besides a lack balance, and a sense of confusion, the film is great, and very entertaining. The PG rating doesn't make sense either, no kid is gonna sit through this and understand it, and between the groping and the depictions of dogfights and sickness, i think this merits a PG 13, and more realistic and graphic depictions of these events would make the film much more dramatic, even though it already is, it would be better if we thought the kid had a harder time. Anywho, its Spielberg, its great, you shouldn't expect anything less, 8 out of a 10, a few minor flaws don't change the fact that overall he is the master of film, he has proved that more then anyone else, don't even try to argue, if you do, your wrong."

"tannerlu","2","0","1","2 April 2020"," Pointless, long, unlikable, and confusing
","I would definitely recommend that those interested in watching skip this film.<br/><br/>Spielbergs' film imagines a grim colonial Shanghai, full of selfish and antagonistic individuals whose sinister traits are only exacerbated by the onset of war. I'm a history student and watched this for a paper I was writing over film in the British Empire. This film was long, meandering, and aimless. I have absolutely no idea what it was trying to say. Jim is an extremely annoying and privileged upper-class child of British colonists. I understand in part that this is meant to illustrate that he is extremely sheltered, but he fails to become more endearing as the film progresses, even as he gains more real-world experience.<br/><br/>Which brings me to my next point; no one in this film is likable. Basie is extraordinarily arrogant and rude, his affection for Jim feels entirely conditional, his dialogue feels anachronistic (lots of cheesy 80s cool guy one-liners), and his character ultimately feels pointless. The doctor and other characters who act as paternal figures for Jim are all cowardly or self-serving, or both. This is perhaps to portray how people become self-serving in times of war or disaster (which isn't supported by evidence; in times of disaster people are more pro-social), but it just makes everyone in the film unlikable and gives viewers no one to root for. Jim's parents are pretentious, underdeveloped, and it feels as if they have only the slightest affection for him.<br/><br/>The depiction of Chinese and Japanese people has not aged well, either. The Chinese characters in this film are depicted as ingratiating, subservient, or antagonistic toward the British. The Japanese (with the exception of one teenage boy who perhaps serves as an analogue to Jim) are depicted as bloodthirsty and uncompassionate warriors. While they were fascists who committed a number of war crimes during WW2, I still think their overall cruelty played up within this film.<br/><br/>This film felt like it was 30 or 45 minutes too long. There seemed to be no clear thesis or unifying purpose to the film. It's not even especially valuable historically, it mostly focuses on Jim's individual perceptions and experiences with war, but never seems to drive home a defined point about how war affects children or how they experience it, other than Jim acting downright irrational and bizarre towards the end."

","I saw this film a few weeks ago for a film studies project and I became completely captivated by the performance of young Christian Bale. As someone who has never experienced war but only seen depictions of it in movies, this film completely changed my view on World War Two. I admire how respectfully Spielberg depicts the Japanese soldiers in this film. Although there are scenes of great violence toward the camp members, the Japanese soldiers are portrayed as humans rather than the common villain like version often seen in movies. Jim's relationship with the Japanese pilot helped me empathize with both sides of the war. In reality the majority of soldiers in World War Two were victims to violence that they had little control over.
I recommend this movie for students who are looking for a different view on World War Two. Often Nazi Germany is the main focus of attention in the classroom setting. However, this film shows how far stretching the World War Two actually was and is effective in broadening one's mindset. Empire of the Sun will most likely make you question what it means to be loyal to your home country and ponder the far reaching effects of war."

","This a a story of loss. Loss of empire, both British and Japanese and of innocence, of the character played by a young Christian Bale, who turns in a superbly nuanced performance, uncommon amongst thirteen year old actors. Born of empire but not of England we see the main protagonist, Jim played by Bale admire, what is the Japanese war machine, mostly their airforce. This does make one feel somewhat uncomfortable but due to the complete lack of British or any other allied military power in the region, it is the only military role model he has. Perhaps this underlines, that we are products of our immediate experience and not some codified ideal written in tablets of stone. The film is long at two and a half hours; though directed by Spielberg, I doubt very much that even he, would get away with that today and it would probably benefit from some judicious editing as many of the latter scenes add little value to the message of this film. Seeing this film at the cinema, thirty years ago as a callow youth, I would have been surprised that the young actor Bale, would become an international super star but having seen it for the first time since, tonight; I wonder with such a performance, how could it have been otherwise."

","Steven Spielberg always had the power to sweep an audience into a movie's story and wonderful film-making talent. I had just seen ""Empire of the Sun"" and I have to say that it is one of his most underrated films. Like Schindler's List, Hook, and E.T., I was captivated by the film's look of an unforgettable time period, seen through the eyes of a young boy.<br/><br/>A very young Christian Bale plays a boy, Jamie Graham, who lives with his parents in China during the Second World War. As the Japanese invade, he and his family are forced to leave. However, they get separated and young Jamie is forced to survive on his own. He later befriends a couple of American merchants (John Malkovich and Joe Pantoliano). They later end up in a Japanese internment camp of where Jamie is put to the test to endure the horrors of war and hold onto his imagination and sanity.<br/><br/>The plot itself is remarkable, believable and highly emotional. There are many tear-jerking scenes, delivered wonderfully by John Williams moving score and Christian Bale's performance. How Bale didn't get an Oscar nomination is beyond me. The work of costume design, art direction, and cinematography is outstanding, probably making it hard for the Academy Awards to decide whether this or ""The Last Emperor"" deserved the Oscars.<br/><br/>""The Last Emperor"" was the winner of those Awards and more in 1987 (in fact all its 6 nomination were given to The Last Emperor). I could understand that, since The Last Emperor was a biography drama of Emperor Pu Yi. It was a good movie, but not engaging. In addition, John Williams score was a triumph over Ryuichi Sakamoto's, Cong Su's, and David Bryne's score for The Last Emperor. The marvelous work of Michael Kahn's editing, and sound is also better than The Last Emperor's.<br/><br/>""Empire of the Sun"" is an excellent film that swept me off my feet from its wonderful film-making, story, and performance by Christian Bale, which is all something beyond Bernardo Bertolucci's ""The Last Emperor"" capability. 10/10"
"jaredmobarak","Null","0","2","4 February 2007"," Like God taking a photograph¬ÖEmpire of the Sun
","Empire of the Sun is definitely a Steven Spielberg film. It has the epic scenery and action, the sentimental underlying tale of survival, and tragedy made the best of. Sure, like all Spielberg films, this one has the eventual happy ending, however, it really can be taken many ways. Most of his recent films have gone too far into the area of sap and/or ending happier than one would expect the context of the film to have gone to¬ósee AI, Minority Report, and Catch me if You Can. Thankfully, like he went back to with Munich last year, Empire of the Sun has a conclusion that fits it perfectly, a mix of melancholy and hope for the future that never forgets the arduous path taken to finally get back home.<br/><br/>Looking at the star Hollywood players today, you see Christian Bale as a chameleon that is the best leading man character actor out there. With the kind of history the film industry has, in that child stars never end up doing anything career-wise later on, it is amazing to see how good Bale was even as a kid. There is such a control over his facial expressions and emotions that you can't believe he is only 13 years old here. The internal workings and intelligence is there, as well as that infectious smile which lights up his face, the guy has not changed one bit. A couple times I actually thought he might go Patrick Bateman on someone or retort back, ""don't you know I'm Batman?"" Bale carries this film completely as Jim, not only because it is his story of becoming a man during a time of war, where his aristocratic upbringing literally saves his life a few times, but because he outperforms the pros and entraps you fully into the tale on screen.<br/><br/>During his journey through China, trying to stay alive amongst the Japanese troops and the other POWs of both British and American nationalism, he comes across a wonderful cast of characters. You have the great performances from Nigel Havers as the prison camp doctor and Miranda Richardson as a sickly British upper class woman, as the father and mother figures in Jim's life. Havers had seen to it to help keep up the boy's education and Richardson has given him a home with her husband and someone to care for him when everyone else really just looked after themselves. Another major role came from the great John Malkovich, playing the kind of character he does best¬óBasie, a man who survives and whose intelligence is higher than his social standing yet helps him keep his life of ""crime"" successful. Malkovich definitely is a friend to Jim, but one who will never sacrifice his own wellbeing for the boy. He keeps close to the child when it is needed and has no trouble severing ties when necessary. It is a great showing of character development when Jim realizes who it was that really cared for him, staying with Richardson at the end instead of going to the next camp and finally being able to stand up to Basie. Notice must also be made for Takatoro Kataoka as the young kamikaze pilot. His relationship with Bale across the prison camp's barbwire fence showed a glimpse into humanity and the breaking of barriers that can happen when politics are thrown out. Theirs was a truly bonding friendship amongst the carnage and a nice contrast to it. I also can't finish speaking about the cast without mention of a very young Ben Stiller; talk about an amusing surprise in a bit role at the start of his career.<br/><br/>Empire of the Sun reminded me of what Spielberg is capable of doing with the medium. Along with Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List, and Munich, among others, he can really tell an emotional story that lends itself well to the historical context of what is happening in its environment. Yes, this is a story about the ruthlessness of the Japanese in China during WWII, but it is also a tale of a boy's survival by use of his kind heart, proper manners, and stunning smarts. While knowing what to do in situations by way of living in China his entire life, he is able to help those around him, but never seems unnatural as he delivers his advice like that of a child, almost as a game in many instances. He speaks a mile a minute and continues his life of making friends with everyone and never taking a break. The moment in which we find out why, when the doctor tells Jim to stop thinking for once and we finally get to see the emotion flow from him completely uninhibited, it is truly heartbreaking and at the same time a joy to see because that is exactly how a child in the same situation would have reacted. Phenomenal job all around and I really hope Spielberg has a few more of these left up his sleeve."

","I saw this movie as a child. And almost 20 years later, it's still my favorite. I was drawn to watch the movie because of the beautiful music and the stunning cinematography. But the movie goes even beyond that. It is a story about a young British boy who survives a brutal Japanese concentration camp through his innocence, energy and enthusiasm. For me, it wasn't a story about a war. It was about how an adversity will not destroy a strong human spirit. While everyone else is succumbing to the brutalities of WWII, the young boy never loses his purity and enthusiasm for life and people. He is trusting, loyal, optimistic and brave. And his Japanese counterpart (the young kamikaze) shows this as well. Two young boys become friends, even though they should be enemies because they do not know hate, greed and cynicism that people develop as they get older. The best thing about the movie was Christian Bale's acting - amazing what expressiveness such a young actor can have (he is also amazing in American Psycho and The Machinist). This movie is Spielberg's cinematic masterpiece."

It didn't have the brutality the Japanese most assuredly had for the English while they were in the camp. In fact, there was almost an aversion to showing any brutality from the oppressor. It was a little disappointing.<br/><br/>However, it was incredibly interesting to see how my in-laws could have had it if they hadn't gotten out of there when they did.

","At the most superficial level, this movie is everything Spielberg is typically thought to be: masterful, but a little cold and too perfect and unreal and simplistic -- but still more entertaining than most in spite of all that.<br/><br/>Watch a little closer, pay a little more attention, and you realize that this movie isn't that at all. The story happens to be about an English boy in a Japanese internment camp during World War II. But the real subject is memory and experience. It is a true masterpiece, although, like many great works of art, it can trick you by seeming to be straightforward when it is really somewhat subversive. Wrapped up in the Spielberg packaging, the movie hides itself from you if you take it at face value. <br/><br/>And that face value is, as I said, just fine if that's what you are looking for.

","Hollywood's treatment of the Japanese in World War Two movies is always harsh, maybe deservedly so. According to many published histories, the Japanese treated American and other Allied POWs with cruelty bordering on outright barbarism. Incidents, such as the infamous Bataan Death March, are cited as examples of Japanese cruelty. Yet this movie attempts to portray the Japanese in a more balanced and less stereotypical way. True, in this movie too, there are scenes of Japanese beating POWs and forcing the POWs to live in conditions of abject squalor, but to the young boy in the movie, he perceives the Japanese differently. He sincerely respects the Japanese, for their dedication, tenacity, and discipline and in response the Japanese come to respect him too. The movie shows how the young boy went so far as to learn some Japanese, my point being that this movie succeeds in offering a far more sympathetic portrayal of the Japanese than found in other movies of this genre. I'm sure that some POWs who had to endure months and even years of captivity under the Japanese may object to such a portrayal, with valid grounds for feeling that way. Nevertheless, this movie is worth watching."

","Being fascinated by the WWII Pacific front, as well as by the British century of Asian colonial rule, I enjoyed this romanced historical drama about a boy weaving his way through the nightmare of Japanese occupation of China and its foreign concessions, with military aviation in the backdrop. I find great worth in the childish point of view--actually bordering on puberty--used to tell the story here, as one is thus better seated into the skin of the protagonist. I find the often human depiction of the Japanese refreshing and representative of historical reality: I assume many of them believed in their God-given mission to rid the East of the foreign exploiters and take their place as masters of Asia and the Pacific, long live the Emperor! Never mind Manichean good-guy/bad-guy dichotomy: Wounded Knee, Mi Lai, Abu Ghraib, and Guantanomo Bay should be enough to convince us that war is an ugly, messy, amoral affair, no matter who started, who wins, and who History places in the Right.

The film is the story of an 11 year old boy who is separated from his wealthy parents with whom he is living in Shanghai at the outbreak of WWII... when Japan invades China.<br/><br/>Spielberg's camera is detached... we see what happens to the boy during his three year Odyssey into prison camps, betrayals, deep friendship, deprivations and insanity, but while Spielberg shows us all the physical details, he gives us no emotion: we are left to put ourselves in the characters' situation and interpret for ourselves how these people are feeling - or not feeling. The subtleties of expression are underplayed and add to the underlying tension of the film.<br/><br/>The cinematography is stunning - sweeping landscapes and crisp interiors. It seems that the entire film was show with a very small aperture - every detail is sharp and clean. This adds to the surreal elements of the film - stumbling through a rice paddy in the midst of a seemingly endless plain when, suddenly, brightly colored parachutes fall from the sky in the background.<br/><br/>The interiors of the prison camp - a bombed out train station which the prisoners have transformed (by slave labor) into a Kamakazi airfield, dirty, dusty, aird - the interiors teem with uncountable small items, screens patched with photographs, eating utensils, sunglasses and military gear... the accoutrement of deprivation and despair. By contrast, a stadium overflows with crystal chandeliers, deco statues, French furniture and a white grand piano... spoils of war.<br/><br/>The film is ultimately an haunting depiction of a young boy's courage and suffering in the face of the chaos and splendor of war - a film made by a director at the point of coming fully into his genius.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."

","This movie certainly stands out. Even for those who'd think of it too corny, though I wouldn't bet on finding too many, the music alone pushes this film right onto a wall of fame. I have always thought strongly that is it music even more than camera tricks that make a movie worth watching and entertaining. This movie proves my believe firmly. I am sure I'm not the only one who gets thrown nearly to tears by the time the kid finds his parents at the end, and won't even recognize them for all the time and hardships he went through, while in the background a very pretty song is played, one the boy himself sings in the beginning. That is the true mastery of Steven Spielberg, that is what makes him one of, if not the best filmmaker of our time. Aside from Spielberg's accreditations, the boy chosen for this movie was very on-track and fitting tightly to the role. He had brilliantly succeeded in making himself look as pathetic and helpless as he could get, but never losing the glimpse of hope in his eyes. Every scene, I believe, was portrayed in the boy exactly how it was meant in the movie.<br/><br/>The only thing I slightly regret about this project is not being completely filled in on the history. I still haven't completely understood why the whole story happened, why Japan (I believe) was being invaded. I know how bad I know history, but I know there are thousands more like me who depend on movies like this one to learn. In the end, I recommend this movie to everyone, period. Spielberg has his unique ability of making a movie attractive to all kinds of viewers. It has a little of everything and never fails to entertain, no matter how quiet or corny it gets."

","When I first saw this film I was about the same age as Christian Bale's character. Now seeing it again after 16 years, I have a newly found appreciation for this epic.<br/><br/>Plot: A Chinese born boy of English blood is thrown in to Japanese occupation during WWII. We witness him mature and grow rapidly as he tries to survive and understands the burdens of war. Then John Malkovich happens<br/><br/>Many WWII movies focus on what happened in Europe and it's refreshing to indulge in an entirely different struggle as a backdrop. Christian Bale's performance is amazing, I had no idea til now that this was the same guy who gets cast in evil roles in such films as 'Shaft' and 'American Pyscho'. What really holds weight with this movie is the camera shots, some of the best Spielberg ever directed. Much of the movie relies on unspoken scenes which really gives the audience a break from mouthy actors distracting you from the overall concept. <br/><br/>Bottom Line: This is a good rainy day movie, it is not jam packed with action, though the action scenes are quite moving. All the elements are equally balanced giving you a feeling of completeness when it is over. Coming of age during times of war has to be the heardest thing for a child, let's hope Bush doesn't bring that burden on our future generation."

Since that time ""Empire"" has remained my favorite film.

""Empire"" has everything...action, suspense, beauty, desperation, sadness.  Not since this film have I been taken on such a journey.  Christian Bale is amazing in his first film. Allen Daviau's photography is gorgeous ( I wish he and Spielberg would team up again).  John William's score is at times hauntingly delicate and at other times soaring and grandiose.  The elements really came together for ""Empire.""  This film sputtered at the box office cause everyone got it confused with Oscar winner ""The Last Emperor"" and cause some reviewers failed to connect with it, BUT please take some movie addict advice and see this masterpiece. Hopefully it will stick with you as long as it has with me.  In fact, if it weren't for this film, I may have never married...oh, yes it's her favorite film too.

Christian Bale absolutely shines as Jim, the main character, with his excellent acting, which was surprising from an actor of that age. John Malkovich was great as usual, creating some unusual but rather interesting moments on screen, while the rest of the actors/actresses should be commended for there outstanding performances, which really stood out for me. John Williams has outdone himself with his unbelievabley beautiful music, and the entire cast and crew should have been given an outstanding achievement award for this brilliant movie.

"Geord","Null","0","2","7 September 2003"," Striving to Impress
","Spoilers.<br/><br/>Spielberg first met Kubrick in 1979, when he was looking at sound stages in England where he could build sets for ¬ëRaiders of the Lost Ark.' They were the same sound stages Kubrick was using for his horror film ¬ëThe Shining.' The two men became friends and stayed in contact for the rest of Kubrick's life. <br/><br/>I am personally convinced that ¬ëEmpire of the Sun' was one of Spielberg's attempts to impress his pal, Stanley. I believe this because it is obvious Spielberg had a great deal of admiration and respect for Kubrick, and because this film was one of Spielberg's first serious efforts. It was also shot more brilliantly than any other film he has made. He wanted recognition as an artist and respect as a storyteller of serious subjects. One of the problems with ¬ëEmpire of the Sun' is not that it is an ambitious film, but that it was an ambitious effort. <br/><br/>Visually, this film has as much perfection as any Kubrick film. The craft is superb. The crane shots, camera movement, composition, choice of lenses, editing, Stedicam work, etc, are all extremely well done. If anyone ever needed convincing that Spielberg has talent as a visual film-maker you should forget about his special effects blockbusters, look at ¬ëEmpire of the Sun' instead. <br/><br/>The area where the film most definitely doesn't have perfection is the structure of the story. This film is more episodic than most. The problem is that this only worked for the first half of the film, and the good transitions only had dramatic impact because they relied heavily on music. Jim's loss of childhood innocence is what should have affected us the most. But this theme wasn't explored with the any real depth or intelligence.<br/><br/>Although there were a few problems with structure and character development, I have no doubt that ¬ëEmpire of the Sun' is a film that a lot of people think is very moving. There is one scene in particular that is actually quite touching. It is when Jim is finally reunited with his parents. Even though it is the music that does it, I thought it was an excellent way for the film to end."
"VideoPokerAddict","8","0","2","20 May 2002"," Perhaps the best child acting performance ever.
","I have been in awe of Haley Joel Osment for a few years now. However, I think I have finally seen a child actor outperform him. Christian Bale was nothing short of flawless in ""Empire Of The Sun"". In a different actor's hands, this film wouldn't have been nearly as moving and special. However, Bale displays more talent than most seasoned Hollywood actors.<br/><br/>As you probably know, ""Empire Of The Sun"" is about a young British boy who becomes separated from his parents during WWII and ends up in an internment camp. Being a Spielberg film, the direction and cinematography are, of course, stunning. Great effort was put into making this film appear realistic and it works wonderfully. In fact, this was the first major American film shot in China.<br/><br/>Another strong point of this movie is that it is shown through the eyes of a child. Often, war movies are all too harsh, violent and depressing. ""Empire Of The Sun"" successfully shows us glimpses of the brutalness of war but it also allows us to keep a constant feeling of hope and determination. That is in no small part due to the talent of Bale. He makes the viewer feel what he feels. There is an amazing amount of passion in his performance.<br/><br/>It's a shame that this is one of Spielberg's least respected efforts. I put off seeing ""Empire Of The Sun"" for a long time because of the tepid reviews it received. Instead of mediocrity, however, I found a movie filled with inspiration. Please do yourself a favor and see it as well!  8/10"

","I haven't prepared anything, but had to throw in a word for Christian Bale. Granted, as with any Spielberg film, the ultimate star of the film is Spielberg.  (And all films should have that kind of star!)  But Christian Bale's performance is a bloody miracle.  He is in virtually every shot of the film, and he is consistently fascinating.  I pull out ""Empire"" when I need a good cry.  If I'm in a hurry, I fast-forward to, first, the camp liberation scene (""B-52!! Cadillac of the skies!!!"") -- that gets me started -- and then to the final scene.  The shot of him slowly recognizing his parents is astonishing.  Why this performance has gone relatively unlauded is beyond me.  I defy actors three or four times his age to carry a film with the deftness and artistry Christian Bale does ""Empire of the Sun""."

Precocious yet innocent Jim picks up quickly on lessons from ""the university of life"" and is seduced by the exciting but survivalist ways of the American GI.  Ultimately the glamourous illusion is shattered by betrayal, and Jim learns the meaning of true loyalty and care when Mr. and Mrs. Victor take him back as their own child.  Jim grows out of his naivety when he sees through Basie's final attempt to seduce him (by offering to take him to his parents), yet he retains his charming innocence with a polite ""Yes please, Basie"" when offered a Hershey Bar (for real).

","As  a Christian Bale fan, I went into this movie fully expecting to see the grown up sort-of Bale that I have enjoyed in his more recent films. I instead saw him as an equally amazing child actor, richly deserving of the recognition he got for his performance. A Steven Spielberg film is an amazing stage for a rising actor, and Bale showed that he had talent worthy of such a prestigious movie. And since, Bale has not faded as many child actors, but built a career based on many complex and diverse characters. If you go see the upcoming ""American Psycho"" expect to see a very different Bale as Patrick Bateman. After all, isn't good acting being able to be effective in any role?"
"jcaivano","10","0","2","22 March 2000"," Spielberg's Unsung Masterpiece
","Naive, slow, maudlin, superficial.  These are the criticisms typically leveled at this film.  Coming after ""The Color Purple"", it was regarded as another overly sentimental attempt by the director to take on ""serious"" subject matter.  Critics may be easily enough dismissed, but I read somewhere that no less a figure than the great Japanese director Akira Kurosawa sent Spielberg a letter taking him to task for ""Empire of the Sun"". Perhaps he took offense at the way the Japanese were portrayed in the film. I'd be very curious to know exactly what his criticism were, but I imagine the thrust of it was that Spielberg's Disney-ish world-view was inappropriate in the context of a serious and important subject such as WWII.<br/><br/>Spielberg seemed to have taken these criticisms to heart, because when he came back to WWII again, he approached it in a radically different way. ""Schindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" give us a window into the era that is painfully transparent.  Our collective knowledge of this time comes from newsreel footage and the recollections of those that lived through it. Spielberg drew on these elements and created two films of striking verisimilitude.<br/><br/>Now that Spielberg has his Oscar and no one accuses of him of being incapable with ""serious stuff"", I think is now possible to fully appreciate ""Empire of the Sun"".<br/><br/>This is not just a stepping-stone to his later, ""truly mature"" films, but a great work in its own right - one that in my mind forms an integral and compelling WWII trilogy with ""Schindler"" and ""Ryan"".<br/><br/>Whereas the later films take a profound and unblinking look at the horrors of the death camps and the battlefields, I think in many ways ""Empire"" actually goes a little deeper.  WWII was not just an epic, global human experience, but a transforming moment in history.  1945 wasn't just the year WWII ended - it was the end of an era.  It clearly marked all that followed as a new and modern age (both exciting and dangerous).<br/><br/>There is nostalgia about WWII.  I think this nostalgia runs deep for a very simple reason.  With WWII, the events of Auschwitz and Hiroshima, the world became a place whose end was no longer just hypothetical, but very possible. ""Empire of the Sun"" is a film that expresses this wider sociological impact of the war quite tellingly.<br/><br/>For Americans, however, nostalgia for WWII isn't just a yearning for a simpler, less dangerous time.  Maybe this is why Spielberg's intent with ""Empire"" was largely lost on his American audiences.  WWII brought the nation together in powerful ways and catapulted it onto the center of the world stage.  America was victorious, after all.  If Americans have a perception of those times as Big-Band fun and GI Joe heroics, Hollywood has certainly played a big part in forming it.  If any filmmaker is especially attuned to this fact, it is Spielberg.  His earlier ""1941"" was a reasonably (though not entirely) successful attempt to pay tribute and parody the Hollywood wartime propaganda that we've all grown up with.<br/><br/>""Empire"", through its unique story, allows WWII to be viewed from different and vital perspectives.  The protagonist, Jim (brilliantly played by Christian Bale) is not the typical Spielberg ""gee-whiz"" kid, in spite of any superficial similarities; but a precocious, sheltered, rebelliously minded son of an English ex-patriot living in the Far East.  He likes to read GI Joe comics, but he also is an atheist, and writes books on contract bridge.<br/><br/>The Americans in ""Empire of the Sun"" (splendidly personified by John Malkovich through his character Basie) aren't stereotypes either.  Behind the ""Joe Cool"" sunglasses and ""Hi'ya, pal"" facades are calculating opportunists.  Even the antagonists, the Japanese, are not depicted simply as ""Bonzai"" fanatics; we are allowed to see them as committed and courageous warriors too.<br/><br/>""Empire of the Sun"" is a great story about the loss of innocence, not just that of a spoilt English choir boy, but of the collective innocence of the world.  It may lack the subtlety of ""Summer of '42"" or the wistful charm of ""Hope and Glory"", but ""Empire of Sun"" shows us a WWII that isn't just grim horror and tragedy, isn't John Wayne guts and glory either - but an ironic mixture of both, which characterizes the subject pretty accurately I think.<br/><br/>If any moment in the film best shows the strength of Spielberg's effort here, it must be the moment where the terrified Jim is lost, racing through the war-torn streets of Shanghai.  He's separated from his parents, pursued by a dangerous ruffian - and comes upon a gigantic mural of ""Gone with the Wind"".  It is one of those blatant but compelling cinematic images, like Orson Welles pontificating before an enormous backdrop of Charles Foster Kane.<br/><br/>This is one of many great moments in a stirring and thought-provoking film, moments I won't soon forget:<br/><br/>Jim chasing his glider up a hill only to come upon a company of Japanese troops preparing to invade his world...<br/><br/>Jim signaling a Japanese destroyer with his flashlight and getting an explosive response...<br/><br/>Jim snatching a food dish from the grip of a dead prisoner...<br/><br/>A lost boy in a lost world finding his heroes where he can (saluting Japanese airmen)...<br/><br/>His surrogate mother dies in his arms as the world enters the nuclear age... (Subtle symbolism may be more aesthetically pleasing, but it is not always so effective)<br/><br/>The euphoria of liberation, the hysteria of civilians caught in the deadly crossfire of war... (The Mustang air attack sequence - a splendid example of Spielberg's filmmaking craft as any!)<br/><br/>Jim, a listless refugee, casting away his suitcase, letting go of all that used to define him and give him certainty...<br/><br/>Jim frantically trying to resuscitate his Japanese alter-ego...<br/><br/>Spielberg has always been very conscious of the cinematic legacy he has inherited.  Kurosawa may have hated it, but I can't imagine that David Lean wouldn't have admired this film as much as I do."

","This movie touched me in a way that few movies ever have. Although ""Empire"" contains a great deal of artistry and imagery I feel that I can only fully express that at base this movie is about the innocence of children and the ties that are formed regardless of race or nationality before they are exposed to the hatred that adults force on them. Jim's journey is a long and complicated one but his innocent friendships with people like basie and the other camp victims show that he is unaware of his dangerous surroundings. This theme culminates with his befriending the young Japanese boy. The two form a bond even though there respective countries are at war with each other. Speilberg shows that only if we look at war as children can we ever hope to avoid it."
"Rodone","10","0","2","30 August 1999"," Spielberg's Baby
","If The Doors was Oliver Stone's baby, then Empire of the Sun is Spielberg's. This is his signature piece, if not his masterpiece: from the airplanes to the rolling dolly shots to the film stock quality, Empire of the Sun reflects all that is great about Spielberg's craftsmanship as a film maker without the  bombast and over-sentimentality.  The scale of the film is enormous, the production values incomparable. You can feel that no effort was spared to recreate the world recorded in J.G. Ballard's novel--from the crowds of Shanghai to the concentration camps, the Kafkaesque compound of confiscated goods in a vast open field in China, parachutes containing rations dropping from the sky: every scene is perfectly realized. Even Kubrick could not have done better. The atomic bomb blast sequence is hauntingly realistic and ominous.  Who can forget that scene when Jim tries to retrieve his glider and sees a line of Japanese aviators on a hill in the distance, taking up the entire movie frame? The lighting of the sky, the ominous mood--pure cinematic genius. This is also one of Spielberg's most subtle films in terms of characterization--Christian Bale is superb as is John Malkevich--both convey how individuals cope with the horrors of war with acceptance and pragmatism. I have to say that this film is superior to both Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List as an organic work of art, as well an archetypal story for all nations. I am not a big fan of Spielberg, but Empire of the Sun gets my vote as his masterpiece."

I absolutely love this film and make everyone I know watch it.

"struck","10","0","2","1 May 1999"," a fine wine
","Empire of the Sun is one of those movies that, if you are not paying attention, can be bitter or harsh after sampling.  I compare the movie to a fine wine--it gets better with age.<br/><br/>When I first saw Empire of the Sun after it was released, I had mixed emotions leaving the theater.  To me, the story seemed to flow flawlessly until the release of the prisoners from the prison camp.  Then the story seemed to get muddled and confused, not knowing at the time that this is what Steven Spielberg was wanting to accomplish.  For many years, I had a love-hate relationship with the movie; there were so many things I liked, but so many things I would have liked to have seen differently.<br/><br/>But Empire of the Sun is one of those movies that does get better with age. When I first saw the movie, I still pictured Spielberg's movies in a common theme--action-adventure (Jaws, Close Encounters, E.T., and the Indiana Jones movies).  I kept this love-hate relationship with this movie until Spielberg started producing his more serious work (Schindler's List, Amistad and Saving Private Ryan).  I now realize the genius that was Empire of the Sun, and I bet if the movie critics had a second look at this movie now, they would realize that this movie belongs on the short list of Spielberg's best movies.  I am now proud to call it one of my favorite movies.<br/><br/>It is one of the most beautifully-filmed movies I have ever seen.  Perhaps the reason this is Spielberg's most misunderstood movies is that the master storyteller lets the film and the music tell the story, and not necessarily by use of dialogue.  While John Williams will be remembered for the musical scores of other Spielberg films (Jaws, Close Encounters, Raiders of the Lost Ark, even Schindler's List), this is truly John William's masterpiece that, in my opinion, even he has yet to top.  Its as if Spielberg commissioned the music first, then filmed around the music.  What is not said in the film is just as important as what is said.<br/><br/>Christian Bale gives the performance of a lifetime as Jim, the young boy who is separated from his parents after the Japanese take Shanghai during World War II, and the stories of his struggle for survival in a prison camp until the end of the war.  To this day, I am still shocked that a 13-year-old could give such a commanding performance, acting toe-to-toe with the likes of John Malkovich, Nigel Havers and Miranda Richardson.<br/><br/>The story intentionally gets muddled about two-thirds of the way through the movie.  But as the allied forces slowly inch their way to China, things are naturally going to get confusing, when the only goal of the characters is survival.  This is one of those movies that you learn from each time you see it, until finally you learn enough to understand that this is exactly what Spielberg had in mind when he made this movie.<br/><br/>If you have not seen the film, or if you haven't seen it in a long time, I encourage you to rent the movie and enjoy it all over again.  I could go on talking forever, but in summary, I believe that this years from now that Empire of the Sun will go down as one of Spielberg's best films. Enjoy."

","I first saw ""Empire of the Sun"" in 10th grade as part of our curriculum for World War II.  That was the first film I cried as I watched it. Spielberg's awe inspiring style which continues throughout each of his films is clearly seen here.  From the clean, British home which young Jim grows up in, to the Soo Chow Internment Camp where he comes of age shows the  surreal nature of many scenes in this film.  A film which has many great parts has one stunning facet.  John Williams' great score which is amoung his best(Star Wars, Superman, Saving Private Ryan) shows the whole spectrum, from the Welsh hymns to the Asian inspired music was incredible.  The best scene in the movie features the Hiroshima atomic destruction.  What more can you say than Spielberg's genius."

","I've heard and actually read once that this is one of the most underrated films in history.  I almost wish it would have been released after Schindler's List and Pvt. Ryan because only now does it seem Speilberg is being given the credit he deserves.  I remember seeing this film as a child and relating to it so well, I almost felt as though I was in the film (pardon the melodrama and cliche).  I've rarely seen a film that could portray so honestly the perspective of a child in such harsh times as this film, and Christian Bale's performance is one of the best ever by a child. This film starts off so beautifully, I once read that the first half was the best Speilberg has ever done.  The writer said, however, that the film seems to fall apart at the end.  I think that it is beautiful how the film starts to be erratic at the end which wonderfully emulates what Jim is experiencing.  The only film I watched years ago and today still cry at.<br/><br/>The scene where the P-51 pilot waves to Jim right before he realizes he has forgotten what his parents look like is possibly the greatest scene I have ever seen in a film.  The ending is as touching as cinema can get."

","I had never heard of this film until a few months ago when everyone was talking about Saving Private Ryan.  In one of the behind the scenes shows they showed, they said Spielberg made a lot of wwII movies, and they showed that clip of ""Empire of the Sun"" when Jim is jumping up and down and yelling ""B-51 cadillac of the sky!!!"" and I thought it was awesome.  I decided to rent the movie and I just couldn't understand what made this movie so overlooked.  I mean, it didn't even get nominated for best picture OR director.  Even though lots of critics disliked it, they couldn't have helped but seen the start of Spielberg's emotional wwII movies.  I mean, this movie has all the ingredients of a great emotional Spielberg movie:great script (which by the way was written by one of those involved in Shakespeare in Love...), great acting, ""a little lost kid""(there was a lot of that in Schindler and also Upham in Private Ryan), and of course, the great John Williams score that always adds that extra emotion. I mean seriously, a lot of scenes in that movie were just John Williams moments...like the scene where Jim throw the plane back to the Japanese guy, and of course, the b-51 scene.  If you're looking for an awesome drama, especially after seeing Saving Private Ryan, this is a good calmer wwII movie that still manages to make you feel like crap in a way(and Spielberg is now happy)."
"chaskell","9","0","2","2 April 1999"," It's About Time
","When I first rented and watched Empire of the Sun on video about 10 years ago, I was so moved by the performances and the story that I: first, went out and bought the video so I could watch it again and again; and, second, moved the movie into my top-ten all-time favorite list.   Christian Bale (who will be hardput to exceed his acting accomplishment in Empire in the 60-odd years he has ahead of him as an actor) and Steven Spielberg (one of a kind) combined to give an extraordinarily rich picture of an awful and devastating war through the eyes of a maturing, but still quite young, boy. So it was disappointing, though perhaps not unexpected, that the conventional wisdom of the time dismissed Spielberg's work here as rather shallow;  afterall, the critics had been predisposed to think of Spielberg in that way.  Silly of them. It is only in the light of Schindler and Private Ryan that critics have begun to appreciate Spielberg's insight, vision, and directorial skills.  Now the critics are beginning to look back at works like Empire to find the seeds of these more recent films. Bull to the seeds!  Empire of the Sun stands on its own, not as a film that possesses seeds for other more ""mature"" works, but as a brilliant film in and of itself -- a brilliance that reviewers were too blind and too prejudiced to recognize at the time (and they PAY these people).  Shame on them!  And great for us! Spielberg, we know, has done tremendous work with Schindler's List, Amistad, and Saving Private Ryan.  These are all exceptional films.  But his truly pioneering work, and the film that ought to be his signature work, is Empire of the Sun. It is still a movie I will watch again and again, and it remains safely and securely among my top-ten -- the critics be damned (though their quest for forgiveness and redemption has not gone unnoticed)!"

","I first saw this film back in 1987 when my parents took me to the theatre. I was five at the time, but the movie was something that held me tightly and would not let go. I guess it was Jim living on his own that fascinated me. I've never been on my own, but I always wondered what it was like, I was a child, my life revolved around kindergarten and episodes of Mister Rodgers Neighborhood. When ""Empire"" premiered on HBO a year later, I had my older brother record it for me. I watched it everyday and wore out the VCR. Ten years later I saw the film again, not as a little kid, but as a fifteen year old girl planning to be a movie director when I grew up. I catapulted into the story and relived many childhood memories as Jim ""ran around trying to find his parents,""(that what I always thought it was about for ten years), I read the novel by J. G. Ballard and found all the symbolism Mr. Spielberg had put into it. It has always been my favourite film and has been since '87, as I watch the movie(at least once a week now) I see the five year old little girl that I once was. Steven Spielberg took us into to the life of a young British boy in a Japanese interment camp outside of Shanghai, China. Jim meets Frank and Basie after being ""lost in the crowd"" and becomes a pickpocket for Basie's constant errands. Four years later, as the war winds down, Jim questions a lot of things in his reality and can't remember what his parents look like. He doesn't want to leave the camp, but he wants to find his parents. This movie is my favourite film(I bet you're sick of hearing that!) and it should have won all six Oscars it was nominated for and more(including Best Picture). It's a cinematic achievement, one of Spielberg's best, and will live forever in movie history if people will watch it and admire it story and characters."

","Truly a ""Cadillac"" among films. It is nice to see history finally catching up to the greatness of this film, which rarely takes a false step. The middle is perhaps a bit muddled and long, but it all serves an eventual purpose. And so many have misunderstood the angle Spielberg takes---the view of war through the eyes of the little boy. This gives the director the freedom to see things in fantastical terms without being considered overly ""Hollywood"" or corny. The mainstream press just winced at the slow-motion glory of Christian Bale jumping up and yelling ""B-52, Cadillac of the sky!"" as planes roared overhead. But---the scenes were magnificently filmed, and they captured the boy's preservation of his own child-like nature despite what he had endured. ""Empire of the Sun"" has endured years labeled as a ""minor"" Spielberg film. But I believe this is a film to carry over into the next century, and treasure anew."

","The absolute beauty of this film unrivals anything else I've ever seen. People have often viewed it as one of Spielberg's ho-hum adventures, ranking somewhere between Jaws and Schindler's List but it is far more insightful than that. The agony and terror of young Jim slowly turns him into a young man when in the POW camp. So many aspects of this film are visually stunning and emotionally devastating, such as the Japanese occupation of Shanghai, the P-51 attack on the airfield and the death of Jim's young Japanese would be kamakazi pilot. When I saw Saving Private Ryan, the first thing that struck me when the P-51 ripped the Tiger tank apart was Empire of the Sun.

","Despite being one of his few commercial failures (right up there with Amistad and 1942), ""Empire of the Sun"" is in my opinion, his most fully realized work. Based on the autobiographical story of J.G. Ballard (Crash), Spielberg weaves a fascinating story of the fall of China during WWII and the effect it had on the psyche of the ruling British class.  Although there are a number of memorable scenes during the film, three stand out as truly outstanding: an early scene in which the young boy (played without any cloying sentimentality by Christian Bale) weaves through the hectic, riot filled streets in his father's limousine; the scene which depicts his ingenuity in the detention facility; and most memorably, the scene of the American liberation in which he climbs to the top of the building and waves at a beloved fighter plane as it passes by in slow motion.  I would also recommend the soundtrack by John Williams which is rather understated for him and includes Chinese folksongs being sung by an English boys' choir...breathtaking.  Truly a remarkable film."

He toned down the music and visual effects that he normally uses to elicit unearned emotion from his audience because the plot of this movie earned every emotion it drew from its audience.
