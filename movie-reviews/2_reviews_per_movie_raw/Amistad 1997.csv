","Amistad is a very well crafted, well acted, and well told story. It is also mostly true to the history of events surrounding the Amistad 'mutiny', and the defense of the Africans responsible for it by John Quincy Adams and a young lawyer named Baldwin. I put the word mutiny in quotes because it is absurd to think of people fighting against murder, enslavement and rape as any form of crime. The film is unabashed about showing us the brutality and outrageousness of the covertly institutionalized slave trade that haunted one of America's darkest, most retrograde periods, and pulls no punches about the cultural differences between its victims, its culprits, and those who felt that it was not their problem.<br/><br/>Amistad ranks as one of McConaughey's finest performances, perhaps his best. But nearly the entire cast is blown off the screen by the passionate, sensitive and profound performance of Djimon Hounsou. Hopkins is good as Adams, but what else is new? Though the film does not have a literary feel - it is pure cinema - it is a truly great story featuring bold characters and a deep and simple emotionality which draws its audience in. Alistad has a spirit that can only be described as truthfulness. <br/><br/>Despite his detractors, Spielburg proves again and again that morally decent films with positive messages can be entertaining and artfully crafted.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."
"OttoVonB","10","86","105","22 April 2003"," The most un-Spielberg film of his oeuvre.
","Dismissed on its release as a dry civics lesson or as ""Schindler's List with slaves"", which is a shame, because there is so much intricate stuff going on here that fans of Spielberg and his normally in-your-face approach might not grasp the moral ambiguity and more subtle touches that roam beneath the surface. In a year dominated by Titanic this was publicly dismissed as too serious or arty...<br/><br/>Why is it un-Spielberg? Ponderous pacing replaces storytelling fluidity and speed, his normally active camera is replaced by more painterly compositions.. Instead of having stuff jump at you, you have to search for it or feel it without truly realizing it: touches of genius are very present, but differ from the original style (like the brutal insurrection scenes, cargo dumping scene, etc).<br/><br/>The story itself focuses on a mutiny aboard a transatlantic slave ship, led by Cinque. The ship is intercepted by the American navy and a messy trial ensues to see who has rights regarding the cargo, Spain, America... or are the slaves not ""legal"" slaves after all? Cue abolitionists hiring young property lawyer Baldwin. These events, based on facts, occur before the Civil War.<br/><br/>I can feel people sighing from here. ""Oh, no: not a courtroom drama..."". Labelling it as such would be missing the point by a mile. It is so much about context and moral ambiguity, and ultimately the tragic ridicule of the situation. Amistad is also a technical marvel. Janusz Kaminski's (SPR, Schindler's List, AI, Minority Report...) photography is superb, a dark study in sepia browns. The acting is magnificent, mainly two amazing performances. One by Anthony Hopkins as former president John Quincy Adams (an unusual turn for him, where he really soars), and the other by Djimon Hounsou (later cast as Juba in Gladiator) as Cinque being the true gem.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Amistad's greatest strength is that it avoids offering any easy answers and in that sense, does to subconscious issues about race and slavery what Kubrick's 2001 did to space travel and progress, albeit with more humanity and more accessible drama. It's a shame this film is never talked about."
"BACK-2","10","103","128","10 December 1998"," A film unfairly compared to box office winners that should have received far more recognition.
","I do not attend more than a handful of movies a year at a theatre. I rent far more videos, Amistad being one of them. As I recall, Amistad did not wow the theatrical audiences big-time. But the expression ""big-time"" seems to indicate numbers of dollars and attendees. I am also a big fan of Anthony Hopkins and remember him as a compelling actor long before his Oscar role. I believe that he and the African actor Djimon Hounsou should have been seriously considered for acting awards. I don't recall that any were given or even suggested. The cinematography, set decoration, lighting, and editing were extraordinary. I was reminded that interior spaces in the 1830's were not garishly lit Hollywood sets with dramatic shadows. Perhaps the costuming was a bit overdone. Many of the actors appeared ""dressed"". The most emotionally devastating episodes for me were the barbaric transporting and drowning of the slaves. I literally held my hands over my face as these scenes unfolded. I hope this film lives on to become a classic. My respect for Spielberg's artistry has been taken to another level. Other viewers have commented on static qualities of this film. Well, folks, This was not ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" or ""Judgement at Nuremberg""; it was historic filmmaking in more than one way. It was accurate, literate, and not politically correct or incorrect. Bravo, Dreamworks!"

","Beautifully told, it also made me go back to History books to double check or to confirm. That's what good movies also do, they provoke you into wanting to know more. I loved Djimon Hounsou - a sensational film presence and his soulfulness permeates the whole journey. Anthony Hopkins is a remarkable John Quincy Adams. The great Steven Spielberg doesn't shy away from the horrors and some of it is truly harrowing but even then the preciousness of the image protects you from excesses. I don't know if that is a flaw or just a grand commercial concession. I couldn't help trying to imagine, this story even the same script in the hands of an Arthur Penn for instance. After all of that, let me say I enjoyed it, I was moved and I will see it again."

","I can say that back when I was a lad going to school in the Fifties and Sixties in Brooklyn, New York USA, we never learned of such things as the Amistad revolt. For that matter we learned nothing of Denmark Vesey's or Nat Turner's slave revolt. We learned about the Civil War and what led up to it. But the plight of the slaves themselves, not a word.<br/><br/>So when Steven Spielberg did this film about an incident known to serious historians, but not to the public at large, I say BRAVO to Mr. Spielberg. <br/><br/>What has to be remembered here is that the while slavery was legal, the importation of slaves had been banned for quite some time by 1839. The Africans depicted here are forbidden to be slaves in the first place.<br/><br/>It was hoped that when the Constitution got going in 1789 that slavery might die on its own accord. But unfortunately a guy named Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin which was a device for picking through the pesky seeds in the cotton fibers. That made cotton THE crop of the south and gave slavery a new lease on life. And as you see in Amistad anything that threatened the life of what the south was pleased to call it's ""peculiar institution"" was a call to arms.<br/><br/>Amistad gives us the portrait of two United States presidents. The current one in 1839 is Martin Van Buren who's probably best known for being the real founder of the Democratic party political machine. He succeeded Andrew Jackson on March 4, 1837 and promptly was greeted with a bank panic that led to a depression. His chances for re-election in 1840 were not looking good to start with and he was exceptionally vulnerable to southern pressure. Ironically enough his last bid for public office was in 1848 as the third party presidential candidate of the Free Soil anti-slavery party. Nigel Hawthorne captures Van Buren, a man who always played his cards close to the vest.<br/><br/>A very different sort was John Quincy Adams our sixth president from 1825 to 1829. His presidency was probably the least successful time in his whole public career which starts as teenager during the American Revolution. He undertook a series of diplomatic assignments culminating with being Secretary of State under James Monroe from 1817 to 1825. Of course he was the son of our second president John Adams and like his father refused to do even the normal political things that could have gotten him re-elected. <br/><br/>As an ex-President he was serving in the House of Representatives in 1839 one of only two whoever went back to Congress after their presidential term was up. By this time he was a passionate abolitionist and the pleading of the cause of the Amistad slaves was an opportunity and a challenge. Anthony Hopkins captures the man who was now called Old Man Eloquent down to his clipped New England speech.<br/><br/>What happens briefly is that a cargo of Africans on a Spanish slaver revolted mid sea and killed all but two on board. Those two were preserved because the Africans didn't know anything of seamanship. The two remaining steered the ship Amistad to Long Island where the whole story is discovered. The Africans become a legal and political football all the way to the United States Supreme Court.<br/><br/>Other performances to note are Morgan Freeman as black free man Theodore Joadson, Stellan Skarsgaard as abolitionist Lewis Tappan, Matthew McConaughey as attorney Roger Baldwin and most of all Djimon Hounsou as Cinque the leader of the African's revolt. <br/><br/>Before his story is told the attorneys have to learn the language and Spielberg graphically portrays their struggle for communication. Hounsou's portrayal of a man in an alien world who's only desire is to go back where he came from will sear your very soul.<br/><br/>Amistad is grand entertainment and a needed history lesson about man's need for and willingness to fight to be his own master."
"Barky44","8","38","48","12 February 2006"," Powerful for Images of Slavery, but Only a Fair Portrayal of Legal Battle
","I am a fan of historically-based dramas. I enjoy the genre, and Amistad did not disappoint me. It is well shot, the look and feel is quite right, and it pulls no punches in its cruel depiction of the slave trade.<br/><br/>Amistad shows this terrible business better than any other film I've ever seen. It portrays all the horrors: the capture of Africans at the hands of rival tribes; the abusive loading of slaves onto ships; the deplorable conditions; the murder and violence conducted in the name of economics; the hopelessness of the slaves' position; the crass indifference felt by the traders, auctioneers, owners and passers-by. Spielberg pulled few punches, only darkening the worst scenes to keep it from degenerating into some Rob Zombie horror film (thereby retaining an audience).<br/><br/>The film also does a good job with the portrayal of the heroes, the slaves who fought for their freedom aboard the schooner Amistad. You can really feel their anger, confusion, and frustration as the events unfold. They are a people pushed from one holding cell to another, subjected to trials and procedures incomprehensible to them (both for language barriers and for the inanity of it all).<br/><br/>One part the filmmakers did a fine job with was the communication barrier. Some of the best scenes involve the ignorance of the Connecticut gentry as they stare blankly at the Africans as they speak their tongue; incompetent linguists stating the obvious and disguising it as ""science""; lawyers trying to figure out the slaves' stories; and finally the leader of the escaped Africans declaring ""Give us free!"" That part really stood out for me.<br/><br/>There are a few criticisms I can lay upon this film, however. Firstly, they didn't do that great of a job in portraying courtroom drama. Filmed in '97, this film predates some great television courtroom dramas (Law & Order, The Practice). Much of what happens in court is either boring or confusing or pointless. I think if Spielberg was able to study some of these great courtroom dramas, these parts would have had a lot more ""punch"". Having said that, Anthony Hopkins did some fine delivery as John Quincy Adams...<br/><br/>Another element I disliked was the clumsy interweaving of the ""Big Slavery Picture"" elements. There's a scene at President Van Buren's state dinner where Senator John Calhoun of South Carolina shows up and makes threats of civil war. The scene was really just thrown in there to try to put in some jeopardy, but the film was doing just fine without that. The intrigue between Van Buren and the Spanish girl queen was really nice, however (a very young Anna Paquin!).<br/><br/>The last element that didn't work too well was Morgan Freeman's character, Joadson. He really comes across as little more than an extra. He's such a fine actor, the script doesn't do him justice.<br/><br/>For the most part, this is a fine, and important, film. It just misses a few marks that would have made it a great film.<br/><br/>8 out of 10."
"Sridhar","Null","57","77","11 August 1998"," Powerful, gripping drama from Spielberg
","What is freedom?  How does one determine who is free?  In 1839, those questions were more difficult to answer then they are now.  Yet, the mistakes of our forefathers must be examined in order to rectify current situations.<br/><br/>That is, in essence, what Steven Spielberg's gripping drama ""Amistad"" is about.  Through its various dramas, Spielberg presents a case about a group of Africans, who, after being seized from their home, were forced onto a ship and sent to the United States aboard ""La Amistad"".  On their way there, the slaves, led by Cinque (Djimon Hounsou), rebelled, killing off part of the crew.  However, the ship was still directed towards the United States, where the Africans were brought to trial under murder.  <br/><br/>In the court, various factions claim ownership of the slaves, and therefore try to seize them away.  The United States government, led by President Martin Van Buren (Nigel Hawthorne), and Secretary of State Secretary Forsyth (David Paymer), try to ship the Africans to Spain, where an 11 year old Isabella II (Anna Paquin) wants them back.  The two Spaniards who own ""La Amistad"" want the slaves for themselves.  The American ship that found the slaves also wants them.  In the midst of this are two abolitionists (Stellan Skaarsgard and Morgan Freeman), who want the slaves to be free.  They enlist the help of lawyer Matthew McConaughey, who tries to free them. Through various legal proceedings, the case appears before the Supreme Court, where it is argued by ex-President John Quincy Adams (Anthony Hopkins).<br/><br/>The film itself is a visual wonder.  Spielberg favorite Janusz Kaminski sets the film in a dark, somber mood when appropriate, and a visual setting when appropriate as well.  At times, the film is very slow, and very methodical. Spielberg is not at his finest here, the courtroom scenes have a tendency to lag.  But Spielberg's finest work in the film, the opening scene, a scene of Cinque's family, and the brutal voyage of the slaves to America, is altogether stunning.  It is this emotional force that carries the film.  McConaughey is superb as the lawyer defending the Africans, Hopkins is sensational as the old Adams, Freeman is outstanding when used (Spielberg vastly under uses his supreme talents), and the rest of the cast is stellar. The movie, however, belongs to Hounsou.  His emotional intensity is brilliant.  Spielberg manages to make even the slowest scenes sparkle with focus on Hounsou, and the film's extraordinary power is simply captivating. The film is flawed, for most of the supporting characters are merely cardboard.  But that doesn't matter.  The story is a gripping one, and one of extreme importance.  Kudos to Spielberg for finding it, finding the right men for the job, and letting the audience listen to the words of Cinque.  A good job all around.  ***1/2 out of 4, or an 8 out of 10."
"philip_vanderveken","8","59","80","27 May 2005"," Another historic masterpiece from one of the greatest directors ever
","There is one thing that I've never understood about Hollywood. When it comes to historic and realistic movies, they have used about every possible subject. Think of the American Civil War, the Hollocaust, the Second World War, the Vietnam war,... Each of these historic subjects has been used in a movie at least once. And there is absolutely nothing wrong with that, as long as it is done properly and accurately, because these movies are often the only source of new knowledge for a lot of people once they have left school (and even at school they hate history classes because they don't seem to understand the importance of it). But why aren't there so many movies about the slave trade and the plantations? Are the studios afraid of that subject or are they so racist, that they have never been able to come to terms with the abolishment of slavery? <br/><br/>""Amistad"" tells the story of a group of Africans who start a revolt against the crew of the slave ship La Amistad and get adrift for several weeks after this horrible event. Then they are discovered by some American marine officers, who bring the ship into harbor and hand over the slaves to the local authorities. Soon they have to stand trial for this revolt and the fact that they have murdered the crew. But a couple of honorable men, who want to end the slavery in the New World, will defend them with everything that is within their power ... even if that means that they will offend some other countries or start a civil war.<br/><br/>At the same time it's very easy and very hard to say what I liked about this movie. I liked almost everything about it, but explaining why will take some time. Let me start with the story on itself. The fact that it hasn't been told at least a dozen times makes it original, but doesn't make it easy to compare it to other similar movies of course. Still, the quality was more than OK and had a lot of variation to offer. It's clearly well-written with a good eye for detail and even though I'm normally not a fan of court room drama's, I must say that it didn't even bother me that a court room was the place where the biggest part of this movie was set. What I also liked was the acting. From people like Morgan Freeman and Anthony Hopkins you can't expect anything else but a fine performance, but it was the rest of the cast that offered me a nice surprise. Djimon Hounsou for instance still isn't a house hold name, even though he has played in a few excellent movies like ""Gladiator"" and ""In America"", but once again he proves that he's a talented actor and I sure hope to see him in many more big productions soon. <br/><br/>Even though a large part of this movie was shot in a court room, it also offered plenty of other sets. You'll get to see the fort in Sierra Leone where the slaves were brought together to be shipped to the New World, you'll see a nice representation of the American cities of those days, you'll see the ships of that time... And perhaps it's the slave boat and all the scenes on it that were the most incredible. I don't think the horror of the slave trade was more obvious as it was in those scenes. They certainly aren't suited for people who can't stand the sight of blood or very graphic violence, but excluding them from this movie would not only be a shame, it would harm the sense of reality. And it's that sense of reality that makes this movie so special. Of course Steven Spielberg knows exactly how to make a movie feel as real as possible. Think of ""Schindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"", both movies that will always be in my list of the best movies I've ever seen, but with this movie he has proved that he can do more than telling a story situated in WWII. <br/><br/>In the end I can only say that this is a movie that every American and every European should see. The Americans should see it because the slaves ones were the reason why the plantations in the South prospered and the civil war was fought and the Europeans shouldn't miss it, for we should never forget that the slave trade will always be a dark page in our long history. This movie is for so many reasons worth to be seen (not once, but at least a couple of times), that it doesn't deserve anything less than an 8.5/10."

"Curtis-23","6","21","29","5 September 1999"," Interesting, but much less so than the history it revises.
","Movies about historical subjects often fictionalize.  Amistad has a strong ideological slant and revises history accordingly.  A review essay in the February 1998 issue of Commentary Magazine describes the movie's bias and offers examples.  Here are others.  (An excellent historical account is ""Mutiny on the Amistad"" by Howard Jones.) <br/><br/>	The film consistently overstates the black and understates the white role in the effort to free the Africans: 1. The historical role of Dwight Janes (a white New London abolitionist) of alerting American abolitionists to the arrest of the Africans is transferred to Joadson, a fictitious black abolitionist.<br/><br/>2. The historical role of Baldwin and Tappan (both white abolitionists) in requesting the help of ex-president John Quincy Adams early in the case is transferred primarily to Joadson, whose appeal is portrayed as more intellectually and morally cogent than Tappan's. 3. The historical role of Adams in helping defense counsel to improve their case by peppering them with legal questions is transferred to Cinqué, the African leader.<br/><br/>4. The historical pressure from white public opinion in the North, widely favorable to the Africans, is omitted. 5. The film gives no sign of the impressive intellectual strength in the white abolitionist ranks, e.g., the speed and acumen with which central issues in the case were grasped.  Within a few days of the Africans' arrest, Janes had outlined the argument in their defense that would be adopted by the Supreme Court.  Within two weeks, Seth Staples and Theodore Sedgwick, white abolitionist lawyers, had addressed a memo to President Van Buren, reinforcing the Janes analysis and arguing powerfully against any executive move to take the case away from the courts. <br/><br/>	Fictions are employed to suggest that the story's blacks are sharper and wiser than the whites: 1. Joadson's opinion that the destruction of slavery is necessary to complete the American revolution, rudely put down by Adams at their first meeting, is echoed and vindicated by the close of Adams' argument before the Court.  Here a person who never existed is represented as making an argument in a meeting that never took place, supporting a thesis that Adams never adopted.<br/><br/>2. Cinqué's superb intelligence enables him to figure out what Baldwin means by drawing lines in the sand, to raise a host of possibly relevant legal points and to teach Adams the perspective that crowns his argument.  The divination, the legal advice and the crowning argument were all fanciful.<br/><br/>	The film also misleads by anachronistically positing the danger of civil war if the Africans won in court: a fictitious warning by the Southern Senator John Calhoun that their release would be a long step toward war and a fictitious willingness by Adams to accept that result as completing the American revolution.  This grossly exaggerates the portentousness of the case.  People were not predicting or threatening civil war, despite events far more divisive than a Supreme Court decision based on the illegality of the transatlantic slave trade.  The beauty of this case for the abolitionists was that the men who claimed to own these Africans were not Americans.  Here actual slavery could be vigorously and triumphantly combatted by the substantial body of white opinion that considered slavery and the slave trade morally wrong, but did not wish to press abolition on the South. <br/><br/>	More important, the film creates a false impression re the kind of arguments presented to the Supreme Court in behalf of the Africans, and the basis of their victory.  It suggests that the captives were freed because Adams persuaded the court to stand tall with the Declaration of Independence and the Founding Fathers.  But in fact only a few seconds of Adams' eight-hour argument referred to the Declaration, and the argument that counted with the Court was made by Baldwin.  <br/><br/>	According to the Court's opinion, the question was whether these Africans were owned by the Spanish claimants.  The decision that they were not was based on a law and a fact: the Spanish law banning the Atlantic slave trade, and the fact of fraud in the ship's papers identifying the Africans as ladinos.<br/><br/>	The injustice of slavery is now so central to our moral code that it may be hard for people to understand how any Supreme Court decision could stop short of it, if the justices were responding to the merits.  But the Court was applying the positive law of its time.  It accepted the rationale argued by the abolitionists from the beginning (Janes to the abolitionist leaders, Staples and Sedgwick to Van Buren) and presented by Baldwin as his second argument.  This rationale protected mutinous blacks, provided they had been illegally held as slaves.  <br/><br/>	In his first argument, Baldwin sought a wider protection, a rule under which the status of a black fugitive would be determined not by the federal government but by the state to which he fled.  By this proposal mutinous blacks fleeing places other than the American South could be declared free on their arrival in a free Northern state, regardless of their slave status elsewhere.  But this argument (which the Court's opinion ignored) was as firmly confined to positive law as the argument that triumphed.  In an early sentence, Baldwin invoked ""the great principles of the Revolution,"" the Declaration of Independence and ""the genius of our institutions,"" but he did not profess to derive his legal conclusions from these premises. <br/><br/>
	Adams made JUSTICE in caps a continuing theme of his speech, but he was not thereby referring to any provision of the Declaration or any position on the morality of slavery.  He was arraigning the Van Buren administration in detail and at length for favoring the Spanish claims when justice required impartiality, and for intervening in ways that justice would have barred. An ex President exposing the machinations of the current chief executive, a former Secretary of State examining and scolding every step and misstep of the present Secretary!<br/><br/>	Yes, a helluva story: - the reality much more interesting than the transmogrifications!"

"tieman64","Null","16","23","19 October 2007"," The Black ET
","Spielberg's quest to be taken seriously has taken him many places. What's surprising, though, is that he's never made a film about Vietnam. While documenting the fears, hopes, and joys of Baby Boomers, Spielberg has overlooked one of the shaping experiences of his generation.<br/><br/>This avoidance, I suspect, is due to two reasons. The first, is simply discomfort. Spielberg's a conservative filmmaker. His films reinforce a familiar status quo: American common sense in the form of a decent, white, suburban middle class. When he has dealt with serious issues, Spielberg has ALWAYS looked to the past. Racism in ""Amistad"", racism and sexism in ""The Color Purple"", anti-semitism and genocide in ""Schindler's List"", war in ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Empire of the Sun"" (he's visited WW2 seven times throughout his filmography). He can't even tackle modern terrorism (Munich) without going back 3 decades.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the contemporary world, for Spielberg, seems not to be threatened by such serious social and political issues but by imaginary beasts: aliens, giant sharks, resurrected dinosaurs etc. While he's critical of certain aspects of contemporary life (anonymous scientists and military officials who want to take our aliens away, self-serving civic leaders who want to keep our beaches open, showmen who cut corners on theme-park safety), there's little sense of history or place in these films. The legacies of slavery and the Holocaust are absent. The contemporary world, according to Spielberg, is a flat landscape of suburban tracts, amusement parks, and seaside resorts. In Spielberg's contemporary films, good triumphs, order is restored, families are united, and the malls open on time. Vietnam is too unwieldy to exist within this orderly and traditional world. A world devoid of US militarism, third world poverty or capitalism. Spielbergland is noble. All the human horrors exist in the past.<br/><br/>All artists digest and absorb. Spielberg's second reason for not visiting Vietnam is simply that he has a very narrow view of the world. His world view was shaped by countless hours sitting in his bedroom, absorbing John Wayne films, magazines, toys, comic books, cartoons and TV serials. They're the building blocks of how he sees the word. Most artists mature as they get older. They throw away the old blocks and develop more complex building blocks. But like an autistic man with the mind of a child, a part of Spielberg is stuck in ten year old mode. He's still a kid in the 50's, locked in his tiny suburban bedroom, oblivious to the world around him.<br/><br/>As such, the entry way into most of his project is always from the point of view of a child. ""Saving Private Ryan"" isn't a war movie, it's Spielberg playing with toy soldiers, ""Empire of the"" Sun isn't a war drama, it's horror seen (or remembered) through the eyes of a boy. Same story for ""AI"", and ""Catch Me If You Can"". He even turns Tom Hanks' character in ""The Terminal"", into an awkward, inarticulate, man boy.<br/><br/>This innocence and childlike fear is fine for some projects, but it often ruins his serious ones. In ""Amistad"" the child's view, and Spielberg's entryway into the project, are the eyes of Cinque.<br/><br/>Cinque is a black ET, plucked from his family and thrust into an alien world. He just wants to go home. Spielberg handles Cinque effortlessly well, the problem is how he handles the adults around him. With ET, Spielberg kept the adults at a distance. They were faceless, out of focus, their faces not shown. Throughout his filmography, parents and adults are likewise often divorced, distant or unapproachable. He doesn't understand them, so he throws them away.<br/><br/>But with Amistad, the story rests not solely on the shoulder's of ET (Cinque) but on the shoulders of adults. The result is the usual ""serious"" Spielberg movie. Crigne worthy drama peppered with moments of gleefull Spielberg horror.<br/><br/>6/10- While Spielberg's earlier ""Color Purple"" felt like a cynical attempt to cash in on the success of the (superior) Roots TV series and the rising popularity of black literature, Amistad has far nobler intentions. Still though, it's plagued by bland direction, unimaginative scripting, poor dialogue, jarring cinematography and a talky ending. It's a watered down version of ""Goodbye Uncle Tom"", worth viewing only for 2 brilliant sequences and a well paced first 30 minutes."
"Rigor","3","25","41","9 November 1998"," A Painfully flawed film.
","Steven Spielberg has created a painfully flawed film about the Amistad rebellion. Part of what makes this film a difficult, even at times offensive experience is the way the film is more interested in white male subjectivity (should this surprise us based on the creative teams identities) over any subjective concerns about the African characters. Real hard questions need to be asked about the historical inaccuracies and distortions and how these are used to suggest that there was a much larger white reaction against slavery than really existed at the time of the rebellion. It is difficult to not compare this film to Schindler's List and to see what Spielberg can do with a film about a holocaust. The ""fictionally"" created Black abolishionist character portrayed by Morgan Freeman is so utterly under utilized and under dramatized that he could be removed entirely from the film without in any way disrupting the narrative.

Just as Hollywood became obsessed with penitential films about the US treatment of native Indians --- for a time it was the ""flavour of the week"" --- so too this is a belated cinematic act of contrition about slavery. It has its moments. There are several fine performances and much excellent film work. But when you put it all to-gether, it comes off as overdone and overwrought."

He is SO full of himself, it stains all those about him. Hopkins is, as usual, excellent, but Freeman's role obviously wasn't well thought out. He gives the impression of hanging around with no real purpose in the film other than to be a symbolic educated black man.<br/><br/>The film itself is surprisingly poor, particularly considering the director. It doesn't hang together, as though the seems are visible in a poorly made dress. The court scenes are both dull, over-acted by McConaughey, and seemingly endless. I confess I gave up when I learned they were going to appeal the decision made by the second judge. I couldn't go though it all again. The scenes pertaining to slavery after on one or two occasions powerful, but again on other times badly constructed. Not recommended. Not recommended at all.

","When Steven Spielberg's ""Amistad"" opened at the end of 1997, most critics were respectful but unenthused.  The respect was likely inspired by the subject matter--an obscure historical event in which Africans on their way to slavery in America stage a mutiny, ultimately standing trial for their actions--while the lack of enthusiasm had to do with Spielberg's pedestrian handling of the story.  I suspect the world's most popular filmmaker of performing some politically correct social service activity with this film. It began, after all, as a pet project of dancer/choreographer Debbie Allen. Perhaps eager to get on to his own project, ""Saving Private Ryan,"" Spielberg did not give ""Amistad"" his all, believing the subject matter itself would carry the day.  The PC aspect of the film is evident in the casting of Morgan Freeman, one of our greatest actors, who is given top billing for a role that requires him to do nothing but stand around looking concerned and barely uttering a word.  Forgive me my cynicism, but I suspect Mr. Freeman is present only because he is black, whereas Mr. Spielberg is white and in need of credibility with those who, like Spike Lee, think only blacks are qualified to make films on African-American themes. Lee was critical of ""Amistad,"" and of its emphasis on the white characters, most notably Matthew McConaughey who really has no place in this film.<br/><br/>Of course, the film's big problem is that it is dull, dull, dull, while John Williams' celebratory music score is out of synch with such a downbeat effort.  Sure, the mutineers are found not guilty and permitted to return to their homeland, but slavery continues on in the colonies.<br/><br/>Among the actors, only Anthony Hopkins is given the chance to distinguish himself with a notable performance, but even he falls short of his usual standards.  He lets the makeup and his accent do the work for him. The real mutiny in ""Amistad"" occurs behind the camera.  A lame script and uninspired direction let the drama dissipate before our eyes."

","As a film, as entertainment, as a night at the flicks, as a great way to spend well over two hours wallowing in non-stop feelgoodery Amistad is superb, and Steven Spielberg does quite brilliantly what only he and a few others can achieve. The acting is the finest, his actors are the finest, his script is the finest, his direction in which he balances action with reflection is the finest, and no doubt as for cinematography, sound design, editing and the rest a man of Spielberg's stature in the industry is able to employ the finest professionals working in film-making and he so obviously does so.<br/><br/>So why do I feel that at the end of the day Spielberg's Amistad is simply nothing but 154 minutes of appalling sentimental schlock and, worse, appalling and dishonest sentimental schlock. I have no doubt that after watching Amistad Americans in their thousands have left the cinemas or turned off their DVD player and thought to themselves or even said out aloud: We are the finest nation on Earth and while we exist, the world is truly a better place. Well, perhaps all those who did and do so might care to pause a moment or two and ask themselves why the proportion of black and coloured inmates in U.S. jails compared to whites is still higher than the proportion of blacks and coloureds which make up the population of the U.S. They might care to ask themselves why a higher proportion of blacks and coloureds are unemployed, live in poverty and have a far lower standard of education. They might care to ask themselves why, almost 60 years after the hearing of the Amistad case before the Supreme Court the so-called Jim Crow laws were enacted denying blacks anything but equality with whites.<br/><br/>But it's just a film, you might be saying, come on, don't be so uptight about it. Well, granted that it's not just the Americans but we Brits and the French, the Germans, the Russians, in fact every nation on earth who regularly chose to rewrite its history in films, novels, plays and poetry the calumny is not isolated or even unusual. We Brits like to bang on about what a civilising influence our glorious empire was and ignore completely the misery its establishment engendered and the huge number of deaths that were thought necessary for it to continue civilising 'savages'. And what after all, you might care to argue, is the 'truth'? One man's truth is another man's folly, perhaps, or one man's open mind is another man's gullibility. Well, I'll gracefully take the point but respond by pointing out the facts I cited above of the comparative freedoms and affluence of blacks and coloureds compared to whites in America. And I might ask why, when Hurricane Katrina devastated large parts of New Orleans, was hardly any assistance offered for several days? Why, it might be something to do with the fact that establishment America didn't and doesn't quite rate a black chocolate city like New Orleans has high as rather more top-drawer municipalities (although down-at-heel white communities aren't exactly privileged). And when we talk of 'establishment America', we might add that Hollywood and its filmmakers are one of its essential constituent parts.<br/><br/>By all means enjoy Amistad as a film, a piece of fiction, but please don't run away with the idea that despite portraying historical incidents - although one larded with fictional characters: Morgan Freeman's dandified citizen is especially offensive, particularly since every other black face in the film is, if not an African from the Amistad, a servant or pauper. The incessant and remorseless feelgood soundtrack should serve as a warning: on and on and on it goes, all patriotic flutes, trumpets, syrupy strings. A good case could be made about accompanying some film soundtracks with the notice that 'this soundtrack can adversely influence your judgement'. When a 15-minute scene of a grand American figure such as John Quincy Adams grandly making grandly patriotic observations has a backdrop of such a patriotic melange of flutes, trumpets and strings, you just know something very rum is going on.<br/><br/>Giving Amistad a rating presents a real problem: as filmmaking it is very fine indeed and Spielberg is a filmmaker almost without peer. But unfortunately a film which sets out to do what he has attempted to do needs more, not least true honesty, so this one, Stevie, can only get a five, because five is halfway between zero and ten."

","'Amistad' is not one of Steven Spielberg's best, in the way that 'Schindler's List', 'Jaws', 'ET' and 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' are. He has however done worse, with the likes of 'The Lost World' and '1941'. Instead it's around solid middle when it comes to his films.<br/><br/>Starting with the positives, the best things are the production values, coupled with the handsome and evocative period detail and the rich, searing cinematography there are some really arresting images here, and the sensational debut of Dijimon Hounsou, a performance of blistering passion and grave sensitivity.<br/><br/>Throughout, especially in the first three-quarters, 'Amistad' boasts moments that are harrowing (the brutal voyage of the slaves), powerful (the opening scene) and moving (most of the film). The script is well-intentioned and thoughtful, if sometimes a bit over-sentimental and heavy-handed (especially Adams' big speech, that could have been stirring but didn't seem to know how far to go to make its obvious point, so it felt preachy). Much of Spielberg's direction is impeccable, with enough of what makes his direction so great in his best films.<br/><br/>Hounsou isn't the only great actor here. Anthony Hopkins gives his all in an authoritative and stirring account of Adams and Matthew McConaughey shows more engagement and charisma than he does in some of his later films. Morgan Freeman is underused but is as you expect.<br/><br/>On the other hand, 'Amistad' is a long film (not a bad thing necessarily), but could have been about 20 minutes shorter with less characters and some of the final act being trimmed. Some of the latter part of the film drags, and the score disappointingly is over-emphatic and gives a heavy-handedness. Despite being brilliantly delivered by Hopkins and clearly written with thought and good intent Adams' big speech just went too far making its point.<br/><br/>In conclusion, a brave attempt at bringing a significant, if not as well known, event to film that works very well in a lot of elements but just misses the mark of completely working as an overall film. 7/10 Bethany Cox"

Why force the masters' religion upon the slaves, who undoubtedly have a rich cultural and religious heritage of their own?

","`Amistad' **.  (1997, USA, R, 152 min. Directed by Steven Spielberg with Morgan Freeman, Nigel Hawthorne, Anthony Hopkins, Djimon Hounsou, Matthew McConaughey). `Amistad' is based on the historical account of an 1839 revolt by Africans on the slaveship Amistad and their subsequent trial when the ship ends up in the United States.  There are a number of stories in the movie, some factual, some the product of literary license.  A problem with the movie is that Spielberg never decides which story.  There is the heroic story of Cinqué (Hounsou) the leader of the slaves.  He is the first to break free and he leads the revolt.  He learns to communicate with the lawyers and helps with his and the other's defense.<br/><br/>There is the story of the Grishamesque young lawyer (McConaughey) who is willing to sacrifice all for the cause.  He is able to outwit the court and the prosecutor, talk Ex-president John Quincy Adams (Hopkins) into appearing before the Supreme Court all-the-while he's loosing all his clients and receiving death threats.  This lawyer story line provides the scriptwriter the chance to write in a couple lawyer jokes. <br/><br/>There is the history lesson movie.  The court case is real.  Slaves kidnapped in Africa revolted on their way to the Americas.  Rather than finding their way back to Africa the ship ends up in America and court battle ensues.  The Queen of Spain wants the ship and cargo (that is the slaves back so they can be tried for murder and piracy.  The captain of the ship that found and brought in the Amistad claims ownership of the abandoned cargo.  The leaders of the abolitionist movement claim Cinqué and the other slaves are in fact free men because there are treaties that outlaw the capture and enslavement of Africans.  (Men who were slaves at the time of the treaty or who were born as slaves remain slaves.  It's only against the law to enslave free men.)<br/><br/>There is the dramatization of the slave trade.  African villages are overrun; the villagers captured with nets, chained together and sold in a market.  After the sale, they are chained into boats and shipped to the Americas for resale.  The scenes are quit dramatic, especially the open ocean scene where the Amistad's captain realizes he's under provided and have to lighten his load.  Fifty slaves are selected, chained to weights and pushed over board.<br/><br/>There are too many stories here and I wish Spielberg had picked one. `Amistad' is available on video and there are a lot of things worth seeing but there's too much not to recommend.  A marginal thumbs down from me."

It also didn't really emphasize that the slave trade had been abolished in the US in 1808, though it continued on in Latin American nations and the Spanish empire. It did bring up the fact that the British essentially ended the trans-Atlantic trade by the middle part of the century, which you have to give credit for.<br/><br/>Though the movie is adequate, and the world is a better place for it having been made, Spielberg probably wasn't the guy to direct this.<br/><br/>His world is one of black and white and though everyone can agree slavery was a pretty awful institution, he doesn't delve very far into the various shades and realities."

But, as Liberals never seem to understand, ""two wrongs don't make a right,"" and this case, making a murderer into the ""hero"" is twisted thinking. ""Cinque,"" literally called a hero in this film and last time I checked, murder was not classified as something good.<br/><br/>This is the story of ""Cinque"" and the slave ship ""Amistad"" with our man leading an uprising against the slave owners on the boat, murdering them and taking over, only to be caught and tried in court for their actions.<br/><br/>On the plus side, all the characters are interesting and the acting is excellent. Matthew McCnaughey gets fifth billing but has more lines than anyone else. Anthony Hopkins is riveting, as usual, as John Adams, who gives a wonderful impassioned speech at the end of the trial in defense of ""Cinque."" (Of course, we don't hear the other side's closing statements. So much for fair-and-balanced reporting.) The film is also beautiful to view, wonderful colors and shadows and light.<br/><br/>Storywise, the accuracy is very much in question and that's no surprise, considering filmmakers have rarely stuck to the truth, usually changing many facts for dramatic purposes.

Script is adequate. The best bits are supposed to be uttered by British Tony, but he brings a rather bumbling personification to his character that rather spoils the enunciation and emphasis. I just don't think he cuts it as a Yank. Maybe Chas Heston should have tried his luck. Other technical issues are up to snuff.<br/><br/>We all come away suitably chastened for our past disgraces, but redeemed by our repentance. Slavery is abolished - hurrah!

Even up to the 1960's they were being murdered with impunity.<br/><br/>And here's the culminating irony: those very races and tribes for whom we abolished slavery, still carry on enslaving each other to this day, just as they did long before Whites ever set foot in Africa.

","Having a degree in history and real world life experience, most people with a general education who watches Hollywood movies would believe slave trading and slavery ended because some people had a heart and thought it was wrong. That simply is not true. The United States refused to allow the importation of slaves around 1807. Look at what happened three years prior to this; the Haitian Revolution ended and their independence was declared. The French lost their colony and other colonial nations saw the writing on the wall and realized they were next unless something was done.<br/><br/>Which leads us to the Civil War. The North did not want the slaves freed out of the goodness of their hearts. They looked at the number of slaves compared to freed men there, rising number of slave rebellions and knew if it continued, it was only going to get worse, possibly leading to a loss of states and war. Of course, if you're the South and own plantations, you're going to milk this as long as you can because supporting emancipation will probably lead to your bankruptcy. This was why the Civil War was really fought, to preserve the Union, one way or the other.<br/><br/>So yes, this movie is childish and inaccurate.

","This is a very good film that has been largely overlooked for some reason. ""Amistad"" twists the truth a bit for better drama, but the main reason to see this film is the amazing dialogue, at times very, very funny and very well imagined. The group of Mende tribe members make swift, down-to-earth judgments about their surroundings and the people that try to interact with them, and the inability to communicate results in another very clever touch: Joadson and Baldwin learn to count from 1 to 10 in Mende, and then walk around the docks trying to find former Mende tribe members. The dialogue of ""Amistad"" is very special and interesting indeed, one of the best I've had to good fortune to encounter. Another part that impressed me was the horrifying testimony that Cinque gives in the court room - as reported in the goofs section of this film, this testimony was in reality given after the Judge rendered his verdict and did not change the outcome. Either way, it's a extremely heavy part of the film, sickening and a very well portrayed depiction of the disgusting slave trade business.<br/><br/>The performances are stunning. Especially Hopkins and Hounsou are very convincing - Hounsou's confused anger and Hopkins' final speech are great to watch. Seeing Anna Paquin as Queen Isabella was very funny, but her character was almost too silly - I doubt that the queen of Spain was so childish at 11. Parts of the drama replaces truth, which is hard to forgive in this matter. After all, the real events of this story are dramatic enough for a film, there was no real need to dramatize further. But it is a very good film nonetheless."

","This movie is based upon a fundamentally false premise - that even African tribesmen, unable to speak a word of English, could obtain justice in the American court system. A far more accurate representation of the pre-Civil War ""rights"" of Africans in the American legal system can be found in the 1853 Dred Scott decision, which held that a lawsuit by a kidnapped African challenging his enslavement couldn't be heard because slaves weren't people. Although Spielberg should be congratulated for his stark portrayal of at least some of the ghastly conditions on slave ships with the unblinking realism he brought to Saving Private Ryan, the film ends on an entirely false note, with a sickening ""God Bless America"" speech by John Quincy Adams before the Supreme Court, which had absolutely nothing to do with the legal issues there, and certainly would not have been tolerated even of a former President in real legal proceedings. Ultimately, one cannot help but ask why the most important (or at least most expensive) film about slavery in America was about a handful of Africans who were freed by American justice, when millions were kept enslaved by that very same legal system. Imagine a feel good, big budget German film about the release of 50 Jews from Auschwitz by a Nazi court! Nevertheless, the slave ship scenes, as well as the portrayal of the African tribesmen, make the film worth watching - particularly for the bravura performance of Djimon Hounson, who in any just world would have been an shoo-in for a Best Actor award for his amazingly powerful and yet starkly controlled portrayal of Cinque, the leader of the kidnapped Africans. But this is not a just world for Africans, neither today, nor in 1839, and to the extent one leaves Amistad with a different impression, one has been profoundly misled."

Stephen Spielberg had first made his name as the director of entertaining adventure or science-fiction films, but from the mid-eighties onwards he was increasingly drawn to more serious themes, starting with ""The Color Purple"" in 1985.<br/><br/>Like ""The Color Purple"", ""Amistad"" is a historical film dealing with the theme of race relations in America, but it is set in an earlier period of history. In 1839 a revolt takes place on a Spanish-owned slave ship in the Atlantic. (The film's title is derived from the name of the ship; as ""amistad"" means ""friendship"" in Spanish, its use in this context may have ironical overtones). The slaves seize control of the ship and kill most of the crew, but, unable to sail the ship themselves, they have to rely on the surviving crew members to return them to Africa. In the event, the ship reaches the coast of New England, where the slaves are arrested by the authorities and charged with murder.<br/><br/>A struggling young lawyer, Roger Baldwin, is appointed by an anti-slavery organisation to defend the men. Their defence rests upon a legal technicality. At this date, although slavery was still legal in the US, the enslavement of free-born people was not. The prosecution allege that the men were born slaves in Cuba. Although language difficulties mean that at first he cannot communicate with his clients, Baldwin suspects that this is untrue and that they were illegally kidnapped from Africa, in which case their use of force to free themselves amounts to legitimate self-defence.<br/><br/>The case is complicated by the fact that both the Spanish government and the ship-owners claim legal ownership of the slaves, and by the machinations of the incumbent President, Martin van Buren, who needs to retain the support of Southern slaveholders in the forthcoming election and interferes in the case by appointing a pro-slavery judge. A further complication is that one of the two main anti-slavery activists would actually prefer to lose the case, saying of the defendants ""They may be of more value to our cause in death than in life""- a warning, perhaps, that excessive zeal can make even the most admirable ideologies inhumane.<br/><br/>Two acting performances stand out. One is that of Anthony Hopkins as John Quincy Adams, the former President who joins the abolitionist cause and sways the court with a powerful oration in favour of liberty; I felt that Hopkins was unlucky not to win the ""Best Supporting Actor"" Oscar for which he was nominated. (Another British actor, Nigel Hawthorne, plays the hypocritical van Buren). The other is that of Djimon Hounsou as Cinque, the leader of the captive Africans. One of the best moments come when Cinque calls out to the court in broken English ""Give us free!""- about the only English he knows. Matthew McConaughey is good as Baldwin, who becomes more likable as he realises under Adams's influence that the case is about more than legal technicalities. I also liked Morgan Freeman as the abolitionist Joadson and Peter Firth as a sardonic but humane British naval officer. The fifteen-year-old Anna Paquin, however, was too old for the role of Queen Isabella of Spain (only nine years old at the time of these events).<br/><br/>There are also some very effective scenes, the most memorable being the opening one in which, against a backdrop of lightning and a storm at sea, Cinque prises a nail from the ship's timbers and uses it to unlock his fetters and free his companions before leading the revolt. There are harrowing scenes of the callous treatment of the slaves, especially the one where many are thrown overboard to drown by their captors. There are also some lighter moments, such as the one where the Africans, although unable to read English, manage to work out the basics of Christianity from the pictures in an illustrated Bible, and even some touches of humour. (Baldwin reminds Cinque of his ""village dung-scraper"").<br/><br/>""Amistad"" has similarities with an earlier Spielberg film, his masterpiece ""Schindler's List"". Both deal with the theme of man's inhumanity to man and with the efforts of a few individuals to combat that inhumanity. ""Amistad"" is not in the same class as its great predecessor; it lacks the earlier film's intensity of emotion, being preoccupied for much of its length with wordy courtroom duels. Nevertheless, it is in many ways an admirable film, admirable both in its execution and in its idealistic theme, reminding many Americans of a part of their history they would rather forget. 8/10"

","This is a challenging film on different levels rather than entertaining in the normal sense. It is balanced and very rewarding. The scenes on the two slave ships are horrific and unforgettable.

"johnnyboyz","7","2","5","13 July 2008"," Spielberg needs the events to have previously happened to avoid it being too much of a blockbuster but for what it is, Amistad is still pretty good.
","It's difficult to consider Steven Spielberg and out and out director in the sense he aims to entertain more so than he does inform, educate or combine his own vision(s) with films that revolve around themes and issues. I consider Spielberg an entertainer more so than I do a filmmaker, what else can you do with the man who, in Jaws, invented 'the blockbuster' and, in Star Wars and Indiana Jones, helped pioneer 'the franchise'? In Amistad, there is a film that revolves around several things at once: yes, it's clearly political but part of the problem is that it's so obviously so. Yes, it's an American period piece that needs help from incorporating many other nations from the era to create a story and yes, it does threaten to slip in and out of other genres too often.<br/><br/>But this is Spielberg as a filmmaker. His speciality is to deliver a smash-bang experience and in Amistad he does so while touching on certain subjects of ownership, human rights and political tensions but these come across in individual scenes or moments that impacted on me less-so because of the 'should-be-there' themes and more-so because they were sudden and perhaps out of place. It is easy to stun an audience; Hitchcock's 'Psycho' is a good example with the shower scene in particular: it's a film in 1960; a woman showers; someone comes in and suddenly we are bombarded with a scenario that jolts us. Amistad is like this with scenes of slaves in boat holds being fed and unneeded slaves being thrown over-board, only the film as a whole does not build or 'carry on' from these scenes like Psycho did with the shower scene, but merely uses them as shock tactics to evoke an emotional reaction (which they do) and to get us to feel more empathy for the slaves on trial.<br/><br/>So if Spielberg is more-so an entertainer, it would seem only natural for a Spielberg film to cover a vast array of genres or to cover a lot of ground in an epic tale of this and that. That said Amistad is a period piece; a courtroom drama; an historical tale; a biopic of some sorts; at times, a comedy and also a film that threatens to break out into the war genre when so many nations disagree and argue over what's right and wrong. Amistad is a film that does not do too many different nations too many favours. Most of the Americans in the film are kind and understanding but the slaves are presented as remaining hostile, as seen when during a hostile handshake and the shouting at another character through a courtroom window. But Spielberg doesn't have to take sides because this is based on true events so when the American high court judge is replaced, we see them to be presented as perhaps cheating and somewhat conniving, it shows Spielberg is not afraid of including details of that nature that do not flatter the government of the United States.<br/><br/>But then again the lead defendant is American and the reminder of America's victory over the British is accompanied with plenty of flag waving throughout. Also, the Spanish queen Isabella II, played by Anna Paquin, is shown in a less than flattering light although the feeling of immaturity and juxtaposition of situations between these slaves on trial facing death and young royalty in a far off nation with everything available to her works rather well. Then there is the clever inclusion or mentioning at least of Sierra Leone's capital named 'Freetown' and how the British renamed it so thus stopping incidences like the one that transpires in this film from ever happening.<br/><br/>But there are lots of basic things to be had out of Amistad, be it through the cast of specific actors and acting performances or whatever. For me, it was an interesting journey more than anything, through an historical subject (ie; the slave trade) that I do not know too much about. The film's premise is overshadowed by its actual unfolding of ideas and general plot, with the film playing an ace it establishes it has very early on and that is the power and knowledge of Anthony Hopkins' character named John Quincy Adams. Towards the end, the film is in search for a plot point and whilst the 'getting there' is eerie as well as horrific whenever told through the eyes of Cinque (Hounsou) in flashback mode, Adams' re-emergence and long, courtroom finale feels just as forced as it does uplifting.<br/><br/>If there's anything to get out of the film, it is the brutal establishment of a situation that could've escalated into something really disastrous; a series of scenes that disregard human life in a nasty manner; an intriguing and thought provoking court battle and a finale that wants to be reminiscent of 1991's JFK but doesn't quite make it. Amistad is brutal in some scenes, threatens unnecessarily to be humorous in others but maintains a balanced and interesting air throughout."

","over all the film amistad is well acted, directed, et cetera. it's a good movie on the whole, with no loss of technical mastery of the medium of film. it has anthony hopkins and morgan freeman, two actors who lend considerable weight to any movie (albeit here they are relegated to supporting rolls) and there are a number of other small but fine performances. nothing about the movie really stands out, much like numerous other historical pieces, it achieve quality but not superiority. One of the things about historical films like this is their tendency to cut and paste modern mentalities upon characters that would have had strikingly different world views. While the movie holds true about the moral crusade of the early abolitionists, it tends to gloss over the fact that few abolitionists would have considered africans as equal members of society to themselves. It also underplays the fact that some of the early motivation for the end of slavery was purely economic. These starkly contrast the usual narrative that pits everything into easily understood categories of good and evil. In history as in the world there are numerous shades of grey. A wonderful historical piece would be one that would present us with the questions involved in such complex issues in ways that would not be dumbed down, but instead unmitigated exploration of the conflicting values of an ever changing world. Plus it would feature some gratuitous nudity for the sake of entertainment.<br/><br/>6 out of 10"

","This is a typical example of Spielberg's failed attempt at making a classic.Another good example is ""Saving Private Ryan"".Where this film falls short is when it tries to get deeper and give a wider emotional picture of the racial issue.Too much talking and too many unnecessary scenes spoil this attempt.In the end,it almost feels like watching a documentary,just like ""Saving Private Ryan"".<br/><br/>Both Freeman and Skarsgård are surprisingly wooden here and fail to impress,yes even to deliver palpable performances.That is because their characters are left standing behind much of the time and serve mostly as bystanders who watch and comment,but never make an impact on the happenings.The only pluses are Hopkins and Hounsou,who carry the film along with a little help from McConaughey.This picture got a good reception from many critics,yet I don't see why.It may look and feel like a great movie at first,but soon after it drops down to average and surprisingly boring for such a riveting and engaging story.The only scenes really worth watching are the ones with Anthony Hopkins,specially the final trial scene.The ending doesn't do much but add an epilogue to the story.<br/><br/>This movie could have been much better.In my eyes,Spielberg was the wrong director for this project.Frank Darabont or Ridley Scott would have been better choices.Still,the film gives a good insight in the history of slave trade and America's socio-political situation in that time. Yet still, this film is far from a classic it could have been.6 1/5"

"The-Sarkologist","8","2","6","26 September 2011"," Let us remember what slavery was really about
","I am not really much of a fan of Spielburg movies because most of them seem to be light hearted, warm, fuzzy movies where everything turns out right. The stars get together at the end and there is a lot of action, fantasy, and plain escapism. But recently Spielburg seems to have turned away from his pointless special effects extravaganzas such as Jurassic Park and moved on to some more demanding and theme driven movies. Amistad, his latest, is one of those. The theme of this movie is freedom and how one will do anything to get it. Amistad is based on a true story and is about a group of slaves who were illegally abducted from Africa and taken to America to sell. One of the slaves manages to free himself and then the rest of the slaves and they mutiny and take the ship. Unfortunately they have no idea how to sail the ship and return to Africa so they end up drifting north along the American coast until they are picked up off the coast of Conneticuit and detained. The movie then quickly movies to a courtroom drama where the who question of slavery is raised. These group of slaves who were illegally apprehended (for at this time the British had banned slavery and the slaves were taken from a British Protectorate) become the centre of a huge debate between the North and the South were the tension over slavery is quickly building. It seems that the South does not want these slaves released, and there is also pressure from Queen Isabella of Spain but nobody is listening to her. Most of the pressure comes from one senator John C. Calhoun, a Southerner who does not want these slaves free. The whole movie is about freedom and Anthony Quinn delivers an incredibly American freedom speech at the end of the movie which is just typically American. The interesting thing though is that there seems to be some biblical overtones through the movie. A friend of mine was very impressed that the biblical ideas were there, but I am a little more cynical for I think Spielburg actually undermines a lot of this towards the end of the movie where the Negro puts his faith in his ancestors rather than God and things seem to succeed. I think also there is a lot of faith put into the court systems of America and this court system in the end pays off, even though it does cause a lot of problems for the poor Negroes. Freedom is interesting for the preamble to the American Declaration of Independence says that all men are created free. Free from what and free to do what, and are we really free. Are we free to kill; are we free to ignore our government; are we free to ignore God? We are free to do anything we want but we must face the consequences for what we have done. There is also hope in the movie but a lot of the hope is shattered. The Negroes interpret the bible from pictures and there seems to be a lot of hope built up here and we feel that we have come to a conclusion only to see it dashed to pieces. Even right at the end the hope of the Negroes are destroyed when they return home to find it gone. History may have abolished slavery and free millions of blacks, but it had changed the lives and the culture of millions of people and completely destroyed a civilisation. Slavery is wrong, but we are all slaves. We are slaves to the world, slaves to the governments, slaves to our society, and most of all slaves to our own sinful desires. Spielburg does not address this in Amistad. He just says slavery is wrong and we cannot return to this. We are all Americans and we are free so let us rejoice. There is no Christian ideologies in this movie for the freedom does not come from Christ but rather it comes from the American Declaration of Independence. While we continue to believe we are free we are going to walk further away from Christ and further into our own self destruction."
"oneloveall","5","2","6","21 February 2008"," Preachiness drains the spirit
","Period courtroom drama Hollywoodizing the infamous slave ship rebellion and subsequent history-changing trial starts off promising enough but slowly erodes whatever truthful moments do occur. Spielberg is at his best when action is at the fore, but always frames his moralities around heavy-handed, condescending clichés which just continues to drain the soul out of this film, despite Hounsou's overbearing effort to achieve just the opposite.<br/><br/>Despite it's acceleration into mediocrity, Amistad is one of those movies that should be seen once, if for nothing then production alone. There are definitely a few strong points (the opening scene really set the bar too high, huh?) and the acting, when not charismatically lukewarm, holds a few high points (Hopkins, before he started to become the apathetic, approaching-senility oldie he so keenly plays here)."

","I am the type of person that typically enjoys a great action packed movie filled with explosions, gunshots, and great characters. Going into this movie I predicted that I would not enjoy it, because it is the exact opposite of what I enjoy. There was hardly any action, but there was some, like the multiple scenes on the slave trading boats. Even with this limited action I still really enjoyed these last 3 hours.<br/><br/>The movie had some very gruesome scenes in it, like when the slaves were being whipped, and blood was everywhere. This may not be a movie for all, but if you are willing to overlook these scenes and see the big picture, you will enjoy it. The whole purpose is to show how bad slavery is, and what these slaves had to go through. Black people were considered property at this point in time, even though they were living human beings. <br/><br/>Getting away from the big picture things in thin movie, there were some details that were historically inaccurate. MArtin van Buren was campaigning for the 1840 election, even though presidents didn't campaign at that time. Or that this was about foreign slave trade, and that it had nothing to do with domestic slave trade. Lastly, lots of people were talking about the civil war even though it was about 20 years in advance.<br/><br/>Another detail I didn't like was that all of the slaves spoke in their native language of Mende, and that I either didn't understand it, or I had t read closed captions. It would have been much better if they spoke in English.<br/><br/>If you are willing to look over these couple of details, and look at the big picture of what is going on in this movie, then it is for you.

","When you say Spielberg people always think of Schindler, Save Private Ryan, ET, whatever. They sometime go back to Duel (still his best movie). Nobody comes up with Amistad. Why? It's a riddle. Amistad is definitely better than Jurassic (well, I admit it's good for kids, but that's all), absolutely better than AI (uggh!). Yet... it's a terribly neglected movie.<br/><br/>Maybe it's not a riddle, anyway. The issue it discusses is deeply embedded in US history. And in the US there are still too many who don't like people with dark skin. People who prefer the blatantly patriotic Save Private Ryan (""Hey! WE won W.W.II, we and Tom Hanks!"") to a film which shows divided US, a complex political and legal clash, a complicated trial and (who knows?) too many absolutely black actors (I appreciate Spiel-burg's bold choice to hire African actors, which give the film something more, something special).<br/><br/>Abroad... well, in many countries intellectuals dislike Hollywood kolossals, so they probably didn't see this movie. And people who weren't intellectuals got lost among so many references to US history. Then the film is very long, and you fully grasp all the legal, ethical and political implications of the facts only the 2nd or the 3rd time you watch it.<br/><br/>What a pity! Though I disagree with the final message (""the US may be wrong sometime but then comes uncle Lincoln who solves the problem...""), and find some scenes a bit didactic, I have to say it's a fascinating film with some great moments. And Anthony Hopkins with an American accent as Quincy Adams is something special."

","Being so far removed from the actual time era of slavery, most of us don't think (or choose to think) what our forefathers did or had to endure. Slavery is a thing of the past, and most of choose to think of it that way. This amazing movie shows us the extent of the brutality that occurred with a clarity that other movies seem to lack.  It makes us not only aware of the situation, but totally concerned about the players.  You can see the looks of ""why me?"" upon the faces of the slaves throughout the movie that just bring the whole situation home.  This is definitely a movie that has been long overdue.  I had an extremely hard time watching the very emotional, powerful scenes of the slaves in the ships, but made myself sit because I think that Stephen Spielburg has done a great job teaching us what should not be forgotten.  The actors were great, the plot was fabulous, and the history invaluable.  A must-see."

","""Amistad"" is a good film, presenting an interpretation of a real-life 1839 mutiny aboard a slave ship and the resulting trial in the U.S., with the freedom of the slaves hinging on the outcome.  What I like is the original idea--choosing this little-known but interesting event during the Presidency of Martin Van Buren (who?), having non-English-speaking black slaves defended in court by ""John Adams"" (Quincy--who's that?), and the legal concepts involved.<br/><br/>Both the plight of the slaves and the events in their quest for victory are dramatized well, moving and evocative.  Slave leader Cinque (Djimon Hounsou) is a sympathetic protagonist, and Anthony Hopkins as John Quincy Adams is stolid and staid but very eloquent in court.  Stately Morgan Freeman is citizen intermediary rather than a slave.  As for the critics who insist Steven Spielberg was trying to portray this event as a significant precursor to the Civil War rather than for its own sake, I say, give me a break.  There is nothing in the film that suggests that (gee, the mere mention of the Civil War?).  They need to say something to make themselves feel important, but the only way to get the answer to what Spielberg thinks is to ask him, and reviewers do not do such things."

","Spielberg has been accused of being inconsistent with his movie making; ""Amistad"" is all the proof I need.  The film is disappointing to say the least, and I came out of the theater thinking that Spielberg made it while on cruise control.  It lacks the necessary passion and emotion, both in the performances and in direction; it feels like Spielberg decided the story would carry the movie all by itself, and all he needed to do was sit back in his director's chair and say ""action"" and ""cut"".  When he occassionaly tries to inject some power and feeling into the film, the attempts feel completely contrived and slightly insidious.  The best example is the scene midway through the movie depicting the middle passage; this should have been the high (in a matter of speaking) point for the movie, but instead it felt like Spielberg simply went through the motions in depicting the attrocities. Above all, the way the scene is introduced (as a flashback stemming from a court scene) is entirely wrong and feels orchestrated and planned, as if somebody decided that ""hey, we need to depict some of the horrors of slavery, so why not do it right here"".  In other words, the movie doesn't flow properly from scene to scene.  Finally, the approach to the story was totally wrong.  Most of it is told through the eyes of American lawyers and activists.  Instead, the film should have been from the point of view of the Africans.  Spielberg missed a golden opportunity with ""Amistad""; handled properly, it would not only have been a great movie but a testament and monument to the victims of slavery.

","Golden Globe nominated director/producer Steven Spielberg (Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan) has very rarely made a film or two that not everyone is interested to see or forgets easily, but this is one of those films in his collection. Basically it is 1839 aboard the slave ship Amistad sailing from Cuab to the U.S.A., carrying a cargo of Africans chained up and sold for the slave trade. Things change though during the crossing when African tribal leader Cinque (Blood Diamond's Golden Globe nominated Djimon Hounsou) gets everyone to rebel and take control of the ship. When they reach America they are arrested as escape slaves, and none speaking a word of English it looks like they face death killing many men aboard. Lawyer Baldwin (Matthew McConaughey), with the concern of Joadson (Morgan Freeman) and some help later on from the experienced John Quincy Adams (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Sir Anthony Hopkins) is determined to free them not just as free citizens, but as free from slavery. In fact, they plan to abolish slavery, particularly of black people, completely and forever, and thankfully in this courtroom drama they win the case. Also starring The Madness of King George's Nigel Hawthorne as Martin Van Buren, David Paymer as Secretary Forsyth, Pete Postlethwaite as Holabird, Pirates of the Caribbean's Stellan Skarsgård as Tappan, Anna Paquin as Queen Isabella, Love Actually's Chiwetel Ejiofor as Ensiign Covey, Cape Wrath's Ralph Brown as Lieutenant Gedney, Candyman's Xander Berkeley as Hammond, Enigma's Jeremy Northam as Judge Coglin, The Muppet Movie's Austin Pendleton as Professor Gibbs and Licence to Kill's Pedro Armendáriz Jr. as General Espatero. I did really like the bit where one of the black slaves was showing Cinque the pictures Jesus from the bible, but that's really the only memorable bit. The film is a little lengthy just twenty or so minutes short of three hours, it is trying too much to press the same buttons as Schindler's List did, it just wasn't quite for me, but it's an alright historical drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design and Best Music for John Williams, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama.

are tricked by their captors who sail them to America where slavery was still legal in 1853 rather than Africa their homeland.
They are all put on trial to fight for their freedom and lives while slave traders in Cuba and the young Queen Isabella of Spain in the unusual cast choice of New Zealander Anna Paquin claim that they own this human cargo of misery.
Be warned there is violence and cruelty depicted in this film but it's necessary to portray the hideous treatment that their unscrupulous greedy captors inflicted on them.<br/><br/>There's some fine performances in this movie ,especially Anthony Hopkins as the frail old but razor sharp former American President John Quincy Adams ,who reluctantly eventually takes on the slaves final legal bid for freedom to The Supreme Court of The United States.
Also great acting from Djimon Hounsou as Cinque the slave leader and Chiwetel Ejiofor in his first movie role as Ensign Covey the African entrepreneur,remember his later well deserved Oscar Nominated role in 12 Years A Slave?
I was also impressed with Matthew McConaughey as Roger Sherman Baldwin the young lawyer who proves to be much more than the inexperienced over confident rookie he first appears to be and is so instrumental in the final outcome.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg is a fine Director who has won 3 Academy Awards and nominated Seven times and I think this much overlooked movie is one of his finest films and almost a Prequel to Lincoln filmed in 2012 and much more applauded than the overlooked but equally compelling Amistad ."

","Amistad is on par with the very best of Spielberg's films and we can easily see why he is always so successful. He has long been treated as a Hollywood pariah by the ""serious"" film insiders because he dared to make popular films that were money makers. But a common thread that runs through all of the Spielberg films and even more so of his latest work is the courage of the main character or characters to fight through to win against all odds. This story was moving, touching and indeed a bit shocking as it brings home the inequities of our earliest days as a nation. It is loaded with a fantastic load of talent with Matthew McConaghey, Morgan Freeman, Anthony Hopkins and the rest especially the actor playing Cinque (whose name escapes me at the moment.) It is simply a story that blows you away. Add to that another fabulous film score by Spielberg's pet composer John Williams and what more could you ask for. Another outstanding performance was the late Nigel Hawthorne as the clueless president Martin Van Buren. Does he remind you of any current political leaders? This film is another the equal of ""Schindler's List"" or ""Saving Private Ryan."" In this commenter's humble opinion it deserves a ten out of ten."

","Amistad is about African slaves onboard an 1839 ship called ""La Amistad,"" that lead to a revolt against the Spanish after escaping and end up killing them all. Cinque, the leader of the African slaves, tries to lead the ship back to their homeland, but end up leading it right to American waters, which leads to many events that takes place in the courtroom. This is a good film that surprised me in a lot of ways. The performances were all really good especially by Djimon Honsou, Matthew McConaughey, Morgan Freeman (considering how little screen time he got, his performance still struck me with a smile), Pete Postlewaithe, and Anthony Hopkins, who had the best performance. The dialogue was smart and it seemed like David Franzoni had quite some time to write this screenplay, because it looked like it was pretty difficult to write about. The cinematography, directing, and music were all nicely done in this historic piece. Overall, not one of Spielberg's best, but still an entertaining two and a half hour film with great performances from the cast. I recommend it.<br/><br/>Hedeen's Outlook: 8/10 *** B"

","This is a wonderful, serious movie that everyone should see. I especially recommend it for teenagers (who are at least 16 years of age because of the violent scenes). Being human means holding some prejudices inside. Being human also sometimes means doing the immoral. In this movie we see the terrible result of prejudice, immorality and inhumanity by humans to other human beings. It also shows the dark side of capitalism. Less than 200 years ago our ancestors and fellow countrymen behaved in these ways. Yet, even today such cruelty and even slavery continues in our world. This well-done movie and interesting story will hopefully prod viewers to question their own biases and prejudices.

","I have long been a fan of the movies put out by Steven Spielberg. Lately, he has taken true historical events and turned them into such captivatingly beautiful movies that none can compare. What Spielberg did for the Holocaust in Schindler's List, and WWII in Saving Private Ryan, he did with our terrible past of slavery in Amistad. While this movie was not hailed by critics far and wide, and was actually considered unsuccessful, those who understand what truly makes a movie and a beautiful story will see the power of Amistad. As usual, the directing is emotional and heart-wrenching and the cinematography is beautiful. The acting on all accounts is wonderful and captivates the essence of the time. The actual story of the Amistad, slavery, and the personal view through Cinque is powerfully moving. This is a movie not to be missed that pack an emotional punch for any who watch it. But do not expect much action. It is purely drama, and the story's power lies in the words, expressions, and actions of the actors who make it up. It will really make you think. Truly one of the most beautiful movies I've seen, once again, Spielberg has proved himself to be the master of putting the human spirit on the silver screen."

","Until ""Amistad"" came out, I had never heard of the slave uprising on the ship in 1839; it has been a suppressed chapter of our history. If this movie is our only information source about it, so be it. Most of the movie happens in the court room during the trial, but some of the most gut-wrenching scenes happen on board the ship, namely when they throw some people off.<br/><br/>I would expect a really good movie from Spielberg, and he doesn't disappoint here. During the trial, attorney Roger Baldwin (Matthew McConaughey) makes clear that slavery is simply incompatible with democracy. Morgan Freeman and Anthony Hopkins do a great job as lawyer Joadson and ex-Pres. John Quincy Adams, respectively. Probably the best actor in the whole movie was the then unknown Djimon Hounsou as uprising leader Cinque.<br/><br/>I have often heard the expression ""white man's burden"". All that I can say is, one of the burdens that we white people carry is the slave trade. For almost four hundred years, the Europeans were stealing people from Africa and taking them to the Americas. Granted, it wouldn't have happened had black Africans not abetted it, but it was the Europeans' idea. We may never be able to get over it, but knowing about it is the first step towards trying to."

"sir_seftheroff","8","1","3","31 May 2005"," critical review of Amistad
","What is freedom? Is it the absence of slavery? Is freedom rational self-determination, as the Stoics believe? I would define ""freedom"" as a state of being in which actions lack consequences or the lack of accountability for actions; it is neither an achievable nor a desirable abstraction in the real world. Absolute freedom is absolute slavery. Living in a ""free"" country does not make one free. Every day each of us is bound by what we do  nothing we do lacks a consequence. Even the ideals of ""Freedom of Speech and Presses"" et al are only attempts at creating a society that is ""free."" The Portuguese crew of the Amistad came from ""free"" countries, yet they were not free; they mistreated the slaves, as all slavers did during the 18th and 19th century, not realizing that the slaves might revolt. The movie accurately portrays the setting of this historical event, but devalues freedom to be simply the rational choices made without external coercion. The ""Amistad,"" directed by Steven Spielberg, dramatically recounts the slave revolt on a Portuguese slave ship and the ensuing debate over their freedom. The slaves overpower the crew of La Amistad, killing all but the navigators. By day, they force the navigators to sail towards Africa, but at night, the navigators sail towards the United States. The ship is captured by an American Naval boat and taken to America where the slaves must go to court to determine their slave hood or freedom. The incident occurs in 1839, as America is grappling with the issue of freedom: what freedom actually is and the extent to which it is granted. At a time of national division over the whole idea of slavery, the Supreme Court has to determine whether the slaves on the Amistad are free or not. If they are, they would be allowed to do what they wish, go back to Africa or stay in this new foreign land where they do not speak the language. In this court decision lies not only the ""freedom"" of slaves, but also a greater freedom for the whole nation. Slavery enslaves the slaver more than the slave. Steven Spielberg has a realistic interpretation of the events on La Amistad. The movie triumphs in its portrayal of the conflict, the pervading attitude of the times towards the issue of slavery, and the effect of the court decision on this group of Africans. Though lacking somewhat in the overarching effects in a society of slavery, Steven Spielberg uses the symbolic nature of this court decision to illuminate the greater implications of ""freedom."" When portraying the slave conditions in slaver ships and the desperateness of the Africans to be free, Steven Spielberg is completely accurate. The gory battle scene, especially where the African leader, straining to express hatred towards his enslavement, bitterly impales the captain, provides a true look at the other side of slavery. While portraying the attitude of the Americans, Steven Spielberg overlooks the greater evil of slavery: those who enslave others degrade themselves and all of humanity. As John Donne said, ""No man is an island, entire in himself; every man is a piece of the continent""  ""any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in Mankind; and, therefore, never send to know for whom the bell tolls; It tolls for thee."" I would substitute slavery for death, for the difference is little; a slave dies to his free will and his ability to reason. Therefore, in a sense, a slave is free, for he is not accountable for his actions. Finally, with this group of Africans, Steven Spielberg provides a symbol: a symbol of the triumph of truth. In the end truth rings loudest in the hearts of the judges, resounding in the hearts of the American people. This is the greatest strength of the movie. I found this movie to be quite educational, for enjoyable is not quite the applicable word. To see visually what books do not do justice to is moving. Moving - that I feel the pain those Africans went through. Moving - that I feel a consciousness to the depth of freedom. Moving - that I feel bell tolling for me."
"levans1-1","8","1","3","5 May 2005"," A great historical movie that is also entertaining!
","Amistad is one of those movies that rarely come along. It is a good historical movie that is also really entertaining. It follows a group of blacks who are kidnapped from their homes in Africa and sold into the slave trade; while on the slave ship they revolt against the crew.However, they caught by the U.S. Navy and are prosecuted for the murders on the boat. The U.S. government, including President Van Buren, keep insisting on having the trial retried eventually reaching the Supreme Court. The defense wants to prove that the blacks are from Africa and therefore not actually slaves. This would allow them to be sent back to Africa to their families instead of becoming slaves in Cuba. The trial also serves to propel the abolitionists forward in their fight to finally end slavery in the U.S.<br/><br/>In the early 1800's a slave trade existed between Africa and the Caribbean. Africans would be kidnapped by slave traders and put aboard a boat set for the Americas. On the boats conditions were horrible and many of the slaves died. Once they reached the Americas these blacks would be given different names and sold into slavery illegally. The only legal slaves were those who were born on a plantation to slave parents due to a treaty banning the importation of slaves in 1820.<br/><br/>The movie has a few minor inaccuracies but for the most part follows the history really well. A minor mistake is on the Portuguese boat the people speak Castilian Spanish. I think that the historical context of the movie is pretty self explanatory. One thing that Spielberg left out is that the Africans were taught English while locked up and that Cinque became a well-known orator before returning to Africa as a missionary. I think it would have made the movie more interesting if the movie had shown more of what happened after the blacks were returned to Africa.<br/><br/>Amistad is a good historical movie to watch and gain more knowledge on the slave trade and the pre-Civil War United States. The movie contains lots of graphic scenes on the boat but the scenes all fit into the historical context of the movie. The plot is easy fairly easy to follow. The acting is amazing with big name actors such as Morgan Freeman, Anthony Hopkins, and Matthew McConaughey. Also starring in the movie is Djimon Hounsou as the leader of the Africans, Cinque. Hounsou is very believable as Cinque and really helps the viewer to become attached to the fate of the Africans. The cinematography is really good. While the scenes on the boat were a little disturbing they are also the best scenes of the movie and really make the movie. They connect you to the Africans and strengthen the viewer-character bond. I believe that Amistad is worth watching for entertainment and I also believe that it is a good movie to show for educational purposes.<br/><br/>Amistad is set during the early 1800's and revolves around the history of the slave trade. The movie does a great job of being accurate in the history while also being entertaining. The acting really helps the viewer to become attached to the characters and the cinematography is amazing. The scenes on the boat really help you to see what the slaves had to go through and how evil people can be. On a scale of one to ten I would give Amistad an eight."

The Schindler's List for the African slave movement, Amistad is more than a movie. To many, it is a labor of love and a family history. It is a story of man in the story of humanity. Morgan Freeman, Nigel Hawthorne, Anthony Hopkins, Djimon Hounsou and Matthew McConaughey are perfect in their roles. Hopkins does an honor to John Quincy Adams with the perfection of his performance.

","Some people actually dismissed this film as racist, and others like to minimize the history of whites enslaving blacks by pointing out that Africans sold one another into slavery... as this film shows. <br/><br/>Sadly, these people just don't get it. For one thing, it really doesn't matter who enslaved these people: it was immoral for anyone to take part in dehumanizing others. As far as being a racist movie, that is completely absurd. Though this film has some inaccuracies, it is necessary and important because it tells the bigger story of ""you enrich me; I enrich you.""<br/><br/>One of the most symbolic moments of cultural enriching in the movie is when Baldwin has to tell Cinque that they have to try the case again. Cinque is enraged by this because he does not understand the American system of appellate courts, and he believes Baldwin has lied to him. Through a translator, Baldwin tries to say ""I should have said..."" but the translator tells him he cannot translate this because there is no word in the Mende language for ""should."" ""You either do something or you don't do it."" While this comment is meant to be funny, it serves as a reminder that no culture has all the answers. Previous films on slavery have too often depicted whites as ""I'm here to save these poor, unfortunate people. They need me to fight for them."" It is refreshing that this film does not display that condescending, subtly racist attitude. While it is possible that such an attitude may have been present in the real story, it is healing to see something different here.<br/><br/>""Amistad"" shows a moment in the 244 years of African slavery where blacks fought back and won, with the help of white and black abolitionists. In the end, people of different cultures and languages work together for righteous good. Please see this movie."

","While not a great lover of some of Speilberg's work it is to no doubt that he has created timeless historic classics that pay great attention to detail.  'Saving Private Ryan' is a great example of his genius but 'Amistad' has been greatly overlooked and is a fine example of how Speilberg can create a compelling story that the audience gain so much from.  A cast full of many famous American and British actors are all outclassed by the performance of Djimon Hounsou who plays the main african slave named Cinque. The contrast of his extreme power and strength is parralled by the intelligence and wisdom he portrays throughout and enables the story to flow throughout.  Though it seems long on paper the performances and power of the realism in the story enable the audience to be ingrossed throughout.  The viewpoint from both the African slaves and the Abolitionists also adds texture to the film as does the inclusion of Anthony Hopkins as James Quincy Adams, especially his ending speech.  Matthew McConaughey and Morgan Freeman are again well cast as the low level lawyer and abolitionist respectfully, though in my opinion Morgan Freeman can make poor movies credible by his acting ability.  Overall a credit to Steven Spielberg and a story that though is simple, is well textured."

Their acts of bloody mutiny soon land them all in court where a property attorney (Matthew McConaughey) stands in their defense. Anthony Hopkins, portraying former U.S. President turned courtroom offical John Quincy Adams gives a very credible performance and is the only bright spot in an overlong film which sometimes isn't even accurate.

As usual, there's a scene with a bunch of white guys in court, and they actually concatenated a long series of legal maneuvers in real life into the single dramatic courtroom sequence, a truly trod to death device. I also thought the story on film missed one of the major points one might take from the historical incident -- that while the US system in the 19th century held the seeds of the civil war within, it also simultaneously held a concept of justice that transcended the primitive concepts of race and human equality of the time.<br/><br/>The bottom line is that in real life the captives of the Amistad took their own destiny into their own hands, and that shines through in the flick, so well worth watching both as entertainment and edification on a sorely-neglected incident in US history."

The early 1800's, true to their racist culture, crude justice, and the barbaric institution of human slavery, are starkly seen portrayed with dramatic honesty.  The brutal drowning of African slaves, dumped chained and naked into the Atlantic to save weight like so much cargo, is an unforgettable image.  Then, juxtaposed to the despicable, we see the highest ideals of the abolitionists, personified by the brilliant John Quincy Adams,extraordinary son of the former President, the son a symbol of the best of the American advocate, the father a courageous defender of British soldiers of the Boston Massacre a generation earlier, which almost ruined his life. The times and sights are rendered notably realistic, rare by American film standards compared, say, to typically sumptuous British cinematic evocation of history.

Besides in ""Amistad"" I only liked his acting in ""Howards End"", not even in the famous ""The Remains of the Day"" nor ""The Silence of the Lambs"", as I think that in both films he overacted too much.  It is true that Hannibal Lecter could only be characterized by overacting, but this doesn´t change my appreciation.<br/><br/>In ""Amistad"" he transmits very soberly and properly the excentric personality of the former President.  Remarkable is his simple answer to Cinque (Djimon Hounsou has here also a very good acting performance)when this one asks ""Which words did you use to convince them?""  He simply says ""Yours"" as only John Quincy Adams in the whole world could have said it.<br/><br/>Naturally, the search of justice, the fight against slavery and other human values are very important and they contribute - as well as the historical interest of this international affair - to my suggestion that the film is surely worth seeing."

It's really a shame because this film is definitely worth a watch.  Despite the serious subject, there's even place for some humour and some 'real' emotions. Technically it's all brilliant.  Look out for the magnificent cross-cut between 2 prisoners exploring the Bible through pictures and the judge, who has their lives in his hands, while he's praying.  Another unforgettable scene is Cinque's flashback of the slaveship, reminiscent of the ordeals the Jews have to go through in SCHINDLER'S LIST.  Add John Williams incredibly 'catchy' (sorry for the word but it's really catchy) theme music and you have a beautifully crafted film.<br/><br/>The actors are perfect, even Matthew McConaughey is only mildly irritating in this one. Stand-out performances from Djimon Hounsou and especially Anthony Hopkins.  The speech Hopkins gives  at the end is some of the best acting I've ever seen on film.  You really should watch it twice: one time to listen to his incredible intonation and to watch his gestures, another time to actually listen to what he's saying.

","It's didn't make the money I thought it would, and the hype wasn't as big as I expected. More importantly, the movie wasn't as good as I had hoped. The first problem is that it wasn't very moving. This movie is bound to be compared to Schindler's List and that might not be a fair thing to do, but the best thing about Schindler's List was that there was a lot of emotion. You felt for each and every person in that film. Here, I felt for some of the people, some of the time. The main character, a slave named Cinque (played remarkably by Djimon Hounsou) was very powerful. He only spoke about 6 words of English, but the mark of a good actor is the ability to convey your feelings without having to use words, and although you can't understand what he's saying, you know what he's feeling. In my opinion, Hounsou gave one of the best acting performance of the year. <br/><br/>The rest of the cast, Anthony Hopkins as John Quincy Adams and Matthew McConaughey as attorney Roger Baldwin, was strong, as expected from a Spielberg helmed film. The scenes on the slave ship were amazing, and horrifying. Those scenes alone make the movie a must see. It's sad to realize that this really happened. It's not just Hollywood making a movie, it's Hollywood making a movie based on a true story, and what happened to these people is tragic. But don't go into the film thinking it's about the trial of slaves accused of killing the ship owners. The trial is really about whether or not they can be considered slaves. And don't think the ultimate Supreme Court decision actually carries a lot of weight. I know a lot of people seeing the movie think that this one case changed the way people thought of slaves, and this one case was a major factor in the Civil War. But if you listen closely to the decision, the case only affects the people on board the Amistad. They didn't make any new law in the case, just used old law to help the slaves. <br/><br/>Overall it was a good movie, and something that needed to be made.

However, the biggest challenge facing the Africans is a biased America which fears that a decision to free them would result in a civil war over the slavery issue.<br/><br/>As we now know, the civil war did break out, but it is not entirely clear how much the Amistad incident influenced it. No matter, that's not the value of the movie.<br/><br/>What you see in colonial America are people with some of the same attitudes their ancestors fled to originally settle America. A satisfying conclusion to the Amistad incident depends upon a realization by the courts, and ultimately the Supreme Court, that a man's freedom is his inalienable right, as stated in the Declaration of Independence, and that this applies to black Africans as well as it does to white settlers.<br/><br/>To me there is no doubt that Sir Anthony Hopkins' performance as former president John Quincy Adams is the most remarkable of all. He has a lenghty monologue, near the end of the film, delivered to the Supreme Court justices, and not one second of that scene is dull or boring. Every time I hear it, and bear in mind its meaning to all of us, it chokes me up. I was also pleasantly surprised at how good young actor Matthew McConaughey was as the young lawyer who represented the catives.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most touching scene was between two of the captives, in their prison quarters. One of them had been given a bible by townsfolk, and of course he could not read it. However, he had been looking at the pictures, probably for weeks, and in their own language he basically explained, through the pictures, what he had figured out of the New Testament. In his explanation, he showed his imprisoned friend how thier plight, being imprisoned for false reasons, and now facing death, so closely paralled what had happened to Christ. To me that was a key scene to show that these Africans even surpassed most of the ""Americans"" in reasoning and depth of feeling, while they were being mistreated because they were thought to be an inferior species. That may have just been good script-writing, but to me it was a powerful revelation in the film.<br/><br/>I always prefer a well-made film based on real life, and Amistad will go down as one of my favorites, and that 2-hour film can teach most of us more about American history than any amount of reading can do."

It's 1839 and the US is slowly sliding into Civil War.  The trial of the slave mutineers galvinizes the politicians, Abolitionists, and of course the lawyers.<br/><br/>Spielberg collects a great cast of actors, most notably Anthony Hopkins as an aging John Quincy Adams, and Mathew McConaughy as the African's lawyer. The painstaking attention to historical detail transports the viewer back to this time, when America had one last chance to escape the nightmare of the Civil War, and was blowing it.<br/><br/>Then why does the movie lack punch, and why was I so aware of the long length of the movie?  I can't really say actually.  The mutiny scene that opens the movie jolts and pulls you head first into the story.  But then the movie hits the breaks, and slows through recreations of the three trials to which the Africans were subjected.  The plodding pace loosens the films grip established so well in the beginning, and in only a few scenes, one of them being Hopkins summation to the Supreme Court at the end of the film, does it regain its dramatic punch.<br/><br/>Still a very good movie, but one expects more from Mr. Spielberg."

","The Spielberg production of Amistad, although interesting and rooted in an actual incident in American history, is overly long and takes too long to get to the point.  Matthew McConnahey is anything but believable as the advocate for the disenfranchised Africans.  Anthony Hopkins, who always turns in an incredible performance, wavers between being from Massachusetts and having an unreal Irish brogue.  Overall, the visual extravaganza is stunning, particularly the opening scenes onboard the Amistad. Unfortunately, Spielberg resorts to overly dramatic if not downright contrived melodrama to hold the audience's attention and to drum up sympathy for the primary characters.  A case in point is the scene where the slaves are chained together and unceremoniously dumped into the sea being dragged to the bottom by a load of rocks.  Really?  Would these slave traders go to all this trouble or would they just dump the poor wretches into the water and move on?  Or is Mr. Spielberg sensationalizing the incident to make his case for sympathy for the downtrodden?  If you watch this one, keep your tongue firmly lodged in your cheek."

","When he directed THE COLOR PURPLE in 1985, Spielberg was accused, rightly I thought, for simplifying the subject matter, and many raised the suitability for him directing movies about the African-American experience.  This film should put those doubts to rest.  It's a worthy and powerful film, although it should be said there are flaws.  Morgan Freeman is wasted as an abolitionist, and there are some scenes which don't come off (the ""give us free"" scene, for example).  Also, this is an enormously complex tale, and sometimes it seems too complex for Spielberg.<br/><br/>Still, those flaws, for the most part, pale beside the power of the film. Particularly the opening sequence when the slaves are captured, which ranks with the storming of the ghetto in SCHINDLER'S LIST and the D-Day sequence in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN as Spielberg's most powerful sequences on film. Although most of the film is a courtroom drama, it never feels slowed down or like a TV movie of the week, because Spielberg doesn't always go for the easy answer.  Many were not fans of Matthew McConaughey's performance, but not only did I like him here, I also liked how his character was portrayed, as you don't think to find a character as pragmatic as his is in a tale like this.  Of course, the real stars here are Hounsou and Hopkins, and they both deliver the goods.  While I'm glad Hopkins was nominated for an Oscar, I wish Hounsou had been as well; he's magnetic and a very good actor.  All in all, a good film which deserved better, and it doesn't come off as a history lesson."

Led by Cinque, they arm themselves, take control of the ship and reclaim their freedom. They have one goal: to return to Africa. Without the navigational skills to guide them home, the Africans are forced to rely on the two surviving members of the crew. But they are tricked. After two months on a ragged course up the Eastern seaboard, the Amistad is captured by an American naval ship off the coast of Connecticut and the Africans were charged for murder and piracy. In the beginning, the Africans are championed by abolitionists Theodore Joadson and Lewis Tappan, and a young real estate attorney named Roger Baldwin. However, as the case becomes the symbol of a nation divided, two great Americans lock horns in the debate. Pro-slavery President Martin Van Buren, seeking re-election, is willing to sacrifice the Africans to appease the South, as well as Queen Isabella of Spain.

"griffolyon12","10","1","4","13 March 2010"," A Definitie Must See!
","Steven Spielberg's Amistad is one of those forgotten films. A film that actually details a fairly important event in American history that is typically glossed over in the history books.<br/><br/>The film relays the tale of the ship, La Amistad way back in the 1830s. While on its journey towards the Americas, the ship, which was carrying countless illegal slaves (because the slave trade had already been disbanded), was the site of a bloody slave revolt. Of course, the United States could not let this insurrection pass and they hold a full on trial to decide the fate of the slaves, and all that is there to defend the slaves is one abolitionist's determination and a young real estate lawyer who team together to try and free the slaves.<br/><br/>The film is a solid entry into Spielberg's filmography; while it lacks the gut punch of some of his more popular works, it still is a beautifully told story with marvelous performances. Anthony Hopkins shines as John Quincy Adams, Morgan Freeman is his usual charming self as the abolitonist fighting for the slaves, but Matthew McConaughey surprisingly delivers as the real estate lawyer defending the slaves, and Djimon Honsou is spectacular as Cinque, the inadvertent leader of the slave insurrection. These four performances form the foundation for this film, and without any one of these actors, I don't think the film would have been the same.<br/><br/>Now, Amistad is a far more political film than say Schindler's List, though it is less graphic, so it makes up where it lacks. Amistad is more interested in the legal proceedings of the slaves rather than showing more about how the slaves were rounded up and shackled upon ships. The few scenes we get though of their tragic journey across the Atlantic is heartwrenching to watch, but ultimately adds that extra layer that is needed in order for you to actually feel anything when injustice is slapped against these innocent slaves who just want to return to their homes in Africa. The courtroom scenes are all handled with fine precision, and it is here that the core of the film lies.<br/><br/>Spielberg has not really made a film about slavery, but more about the justice system in the United States at this period. Now, take from that what you will, but I was satisfied as to how the legal proceedings played out and I think it makes it different than just about any other film on the subject of slavery. What is evident here in Amistad though is Spielberg's usual energy and charm, and that is what takes it that final step. No one can manipulate the emotions or tug on the heartstrings quite like Spielberg, he is a pupeteer, and a master at that. He does not overplay the emotional scenes. He creates an ethereal beauty that ensnares you within and when Cinque learns how to say, ""Set us free,"" in English, it is the stand-out moment of the film that would not have been the same had it been done by any other director.<br/><br/>I give Amistad a 10 out of 10!"

","In the movie Amistad, which is directed by Steven Spielberg and written by David Franzoni, is about a group of Africans, who, after being seized from their home, forced onto a ship and sent away to the United States aboard the boat ""La Amistad"". On the way, the slaves, led by Cinque finds a way to open the chains around him and rebels, causing the death of almost the whole crew. However, the ship was still directed towards the United States, where the Africans were captured and brought to trial under murder. In the court, several of factions claim the ownership of the slaves, and try to seize them away. The 11 year old Isabella II of Spain, two Spaniards who own ""La Amistad"" and the American ship who found the slaves are these people who want the slaves for themselves. In the middle of this struggle we find to abolitionists who want the salves to be free. They receive help of the lawyer Baldwin who puts his career at stake in order to free the slaves.<br/><br/>The film itself is a visual wonder. Spielberg sets the film in a special dark mood which brings out the intensity of each character individual. With use of great camera angel and perfect choice of weather the film becomes real to us. At times, the film can be very slow and very systematic. Spielberg shows several times in the movie that he's one of the best directors out there. In for example the opening scene, a scene of Cinque's family, and the brutal voyage of the slaves to America is altogether stunningly made. It is this emotional force that carries us throughout the film. Matthew McConaughey (Baldwin) is superb acting as the lawyer defending the slaves, Anthony Hopkins (John Quincy Adams) is sensational playing as the old Adams and Morgan Freeman (Joadson) is just outstanding in his scenes. The rest of the cast is also quite good, but the movie, however, belongs to Djimon Hounsou (Cinque). His emotional performing is just brilliant. Spielberg manages to make the slowest scenes to glow with focus on Hounsou. One thing that the director impressed me with was how Cinque and his people were presented. The first scene leaves us an impression that the Africans are simply brutal. As the story in the film moves on we get to know them better despite language difficulties. Also when truth unravels we quickly change which side were cheering for.<br/><br/>The main theme in this film must be about freedom. What is it and how does one determine who is free? In 1839, those questions were more difficult to answer then they are now. I found the film quite interesting with this theme, because the film itself brings up something that are so important to the Africans back in 1839, but we don't think of freedom as much as people used to back in the older days. Through the film we get to see how important freedom actually is and that it never shall be forgotten as we have learned from the mistakes of our forefathers."

Captured by a United States naval ship, they are taken to an American port and treated like property until politicians and courts figure out their backstory.<br/><br/>It is 1839 and the days of slavery are numbered - as we see many ""free-men"" (blacks in positions of relative respect). So with none of the Africans able to speak a word in their defense, the legal fine print demanded the courts try to discern whether they were descendants of slaves (which would make them guilty of murder onboard Amistad) or kidnapped from Africa (which would justify their attempted escape). Yet they were held in prison - even though they technically stood outside the American legal system.<br/><br/>It takes ex-president John Qunicy Adams to turn the provincial perceptions of American white folks to understanding that no matter their technical definition, in another land, these black folks were a free sovereign people; their detainment was not only moot, it was reprehensible.<br/><br/>Djimon Housou is lead slave, Cinque, in the mandingo performance that shot him to international recognition. Matthew McConaughey is Baldwin, a young lawyer who initially treats Cinque's people as property (which is the right thing to do to win their case, in a blinkered court that cannot see them any other way), but he must relinquish the case to bigger guns. We would think this might be Morgan Freeman as Joadson (an African-American, heh, ""free-man""), but Freeman, usually a font of conscience, gravitas and bravura (or at the least, gritty voice-over) seems to do nothing in this movie except wander around in his big Batman coat. He cedes all his usual duties to Anthony Hopkins, as John Quincy Adams, who steals every scene (he is, after all, Anthony Hopkins!) and gives the final rousing, epic speech that Morgan Freeman just WISHED he could've done as a gritty voice-over.<br/><br/>When Adams delves into the minds of the Africans, in particular, Cinque's conquering of a lion terrorizing his village, the audience and cast alike start to realize the fabric and depth of the people they have been holding; simultaneously driving home how dishonorable white law actually is. Cinque cannot disguise his ferocity towards the duplicity of white man legalities; he screams in his Mende language, spittle flying, fiery backdrop glazing his naked ebony: ""What kind of a place is this where you almost mean what you say? Where laws almost work? How can you live like that?!"" (Philosophy for the men, naked ebony for the laydayz...) Before they are ""human"" we are shown how these kidnapped people were treated onboard La Amistad - shackled in the hold of the ship, naked, fed gruel, adults trying to hold babies above the crush of bodies; when food runs low, twenty men and women shackled together are simply thrown overboard. It is horrifying.<br/><br/>The visuals in AMISTAD are disturbing, the psychology even more so. The orchestra-swell happy ending does not signify only this winning case, it heralds a sea-change in the perception of those people who actually sat on the bench and owned slaves. The morality of denying a fellow human their rights was being realized. Anthony Hopkins makes the conscience bleed (while Morgan Freeman stews).<br/><br/>And the triumph of AMISTAD is not that it portrays the horrors of slavery - a million movies do that - it liberates the modern audience from viewing slaves as one-dimensional peons. It does for our minds what Cinque shouts for his people in court: his shred of repeated English, an anguished, feral cry that shivers our souls: <br/><br/>""Give us, us free!"""

Those who criticize this film for its historicity need to realize that the scholars have also put their own imprints on the events. Movies make a point. Rather than dis things because your scholarship found something wrong with it (in some cases for the sake of your own racism), take into account that the events that took place on the cinematic Amistad were typical of what did happen and the actions of the slave traders were typical of what often happened. The scene where the chained slaves were allowed to drown without a by your leave should be enough.

It shows how, even though the case was won at the federal district court level, it was appealed by President Martin Van Buren to the Supreme Court, and how former President John Quincy Adams took part in the proceedings.<br/><br/>The movie opens showing Cinque and the other Africans in a violent takeover of the Amistad. Captured, they are imprisoned in New England where former slave Theodore Joadson, viewing the rebels as ""freedom fighters,"" approaches property lawyer Baldwin, who attempts to prove the Africans were ""stolen goods"" because they were kidnapped. Running for re-election, President Martin Van Buren overturns the lower court's decision in favor of the Africans. Former President John Quincy Adams is reluctant to become involved, but when the case moves on to the Supreme Court, Adams stirs emotions with a powerful defense. The story line occasionally cuts away to Spain where the young Queen Isabella plays with dolls; she later debated the Amistad case with seven U.S. presidents.<br/><br/>Amistad is worth seeing just for people to know about this important story, this moment in history.This is the most straightforward, understated, and powerful big-screen representation of the slavery in recent movie history.

How condescending, and how contrite, do they think the rest of the world is stupid and does not know history ?<br/><br/>Just for an analogy, it is like me, going across the river to a neighbour, killing most of the family, let one or 2 live, kicking those left out to live in the woods while I burn their house down and build a new one on the land, crossing over another river abducting another family to work on the grounds, then many generations later, my great great great grandson inviting the descendants of the original family to come back and live in the shed, then letting a few of the second family to return home free, then making a story up to tell any friends we think we have, about how great we were by letting them go free !!! How ridiculous.<br/><br/>If they want fairness, they should send all the African Americans back to Africa, with all the value they have and give them back their property and livelihoods in Africa, all the whites go back to Europe and give all the land in North America back to the Indian tribes to let them repopulate it. Of course this will never happen, the whites have already ruined the continent and it will never go back to how it should, but the good thing is we don't have to take items such as this to understand what is right and wrong. I am White British, my country is just as guilty in the same respects, as are several countries, I can't change the past, but I can be impartial and retrospective and tell it how it is/was.<br/><br/>Back off the soapbox now, and back to the film, I gave it 8 stars because of how well it was made, and how well it was acted. If I judged it on political motives, it would get a minus 100"

","In 1839, a mutiny occurred on board the Cuban schooner La Amistad, wherein the slaves revolted against their Spanish captors, killed the captain and the cook and, for six weeks, attempted to sail back the home of their Mende tribe in the region of Sierra Leone in Africa. Instead, they landed off the coast of Long Island, were apprehended, and transported to New Haven where they were clapped in prison. With a screenplay written by David Franzoni, the Steven Spielberg directed film chronicles the trials of the 44 members of the Mende tribe that took place on American soil.<br/><br/>Under President Martin van Buren and his Secretary of State John Forsyth, the government sought to uphold a treaty with young Isabella II of Spain and return the slaves to their owners. A group of American abolitionists raised funds for the defense of the Mende which argued that they were not human property, due to the ending of the slave trade. <br/><br/>In a memorable moment in the film, former president John Quincy Adams (Anthony Hopkins) is approached by Mr. Judson (Morgan Freeman), who casually says that he has been ""reading in the papers about the Amistad."" Adams wryly asks, ""Real papers?"" Indeed, before the Supreme Court, Adams introduces into evidence an issue from the organ of the Van Buren administration, ""The Executive Review,"" that would be the rough equivalent of tweets in the twenty-first century. In the propaganda published by Van Buren's cronies, the newspaper was promoting the view that the natural state of humankind is slavery, to which Adams replies that there is an embarrassing, annoying document called the Declaration of Independence that stipulates that ""all men are created equal.""<br/><br/>Even with one of Van Buren's appointees serving as judge, the lower court in New Haven ruled in favor of the Mende. When Van Buren pressed for an appeal before the Supreme Court, the bench was stacked with seven of the nine justices as slave-holding Southerners. But with only a single dissenting vote, the court upheld the lower court's verdict that the treaty with Spain is invalid. The foreign policy of Van Buren meant nothing to the court, which ruled that the Mende were not slaves, but free individuals with certain moral rights. The blowing up of the notorious Portuguese Lomboko Slave Fortress in Sierra Leone was an exclamation point to the court's verdict.<br/><br/>The film indicates that Isabella of Spain continued to argue the Amistad matter in entreaties with seven more American presidents, most of whom were Southerners. Treaties and foreign policy were impotent before the two court findings. Her hopes finally collapsed with the defeat of the Confederate army in 1864. <br/><br/>The hero of the film, Joseph CInque (Djimon Hounsou), returned to Sierra Leone to discover his people in the throes of civil war. His family members were gone, possibly sold into slavery. <br/><br/>This powerful, moving, and well-photographed film is a testament to the indomitable spirit of human freedom."

","This film, based on real events, tells the dramatic story of the slaves of the ship ""La Amistad"", who are imprisoned in the United States after taking control of the ship and subjugate its Spanish crew. Directed by Steven Spielberg, with a screenplay by David Franzoni, the film has the participation of Djimon Hounsou, Matthew McConaughey, Anthony Hopkins and Morgan Freeman. It was nominated for four Oscars (Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Supporting Actor, Best Original Score).<br/><br/>The film is an excellent way to convey knowledge to people, especially if they don't like to read or study. In this context, historical films gain special importance. History is the guardian of the collective memory of people (as a nation or as a human race). Most people have difficulty to understand it. And I say this because this film addresses a troublesome page of our universal history: slavery and the slave trade, which at the time was considered normal, but we now recognize that it was cruel and wrong.<br/><br/>The film's screenplay is excellent, no mistakes or holes. The public is able to perfectly understand the feelings and motivations of the characters, and how the problem of those slaves is handled by each of them, until turn into a diplomatic problem and a national controversy. The only thing I was not able to realize is the reason of a Portuguese slave ship in the plot, if Portugal had been one of the first countries in the world to legally abolish slave trade. If they acted illegally to English, they were also breaking Portuguese law of the time. The work of actors was also impeccable. Djimon Hounsou shone in the role of Cinque, surprising the audience with the depth of his character. Hopkins, in a relatively low profile, could be up to the challenge, as Morgan Freeman; but it was Matthew McConaughey who most impressed the film with a huge performance, full of quality.<br/><br/>The sets and costumes fully correspond to what one would see and wear in the historical period depicted. The technical team did everything they could to get the necessary historical accuracy. Although not an action film, the film contains strong fight scenes and some visual and sound effects very well done."

","Amistad is a film about the 1839 mutiny that a bunch of slaves held whilst on board a ship that was heading from Havana to the northeast coast of America. The slaves hold a mutiny, but are subsequently captured and the slaves are sentenced to death for their crimes. The Spanish make the claim that the slaves belong to them and that they are legally their property, but the likes of lawyer Roger Baldwin (Matthew McConaughey), feels that there may be some holes in their argument and is determined that the slaves get the fair trial that they deserve.<br/><br/>I always take films based on historical events with a pinch of salt as it's very rare that you'll come across one that is 100% truthful (I understand that 'artistic licence' comes into play quite a lot). If I am unfamiliar with the history involved with a film then I tend to ask myself one question; what effect did it have on me overall? Clearly with a score of 7 out of 10 I was fairly impressed...<br/><br/>Spielberg doesn't hold back here and goes out of his way to make sure that we witness and feel the pain endured by the slaves; there are several moments in this film that are brutal and tough to watch. Many of the courtroom scenes are excellent as well, but this is mainly due to the many talented actors that were brought together here. Although the subject matter is treated seriously here, screenwriter Franzoni does inject some humorous moments into the film from time to time which I always feel is a nice touch. McConaughey is a Lawyer in this film, but he also has to turn detective here to try to learn more about those that he's representing and again this aspect of the story is engaging and quite amusing and complements the courtroom side of things well.<br/><br/>Impressive production values and a good screenplay are nothing without the actors and what a cast we have here; Hopkins, Freeman, McConaughey and Hounsou were all superb here and really brought the story to life. If I was to single anyone out for praise it would be Hopkins who I think is one of the best actors around. Hounsou comes in a very close second and I personally think that he's one of the most underrated actors in the business - his performance here and in Blood Diamond is powerful and convincing.<br/><br/>Casting a critical eye over this then there were a few things that bothered me; firstly I felt that the scene in the middle of the film where we essentially witness how the slaves were captured could have been used to start the film and then we could have just moved on to the mutiny after they leave Havana. It seemed odd to me that we had a long introduction at the start to set-up the Mutiny only to then have elements of it re-hashed later in the film. Combining the two elements at the start with some editing would have improved the overall structure of the film and would undoubtedly have reduced the rather generous running time. Secondly, when Baldwin needed some who could speak the language of the slaves,it seemed a little contrived that he happened to find an ex-slave who could speak their languages as well as being able to speak fluent English in the first place that he looked? It also doesn't show much from the perspective of The Spanish which is even more odd when you realise the impact that the verdict of the trial had on the Spanish several years after the trial.<br/><br/>So yes there are some flaws here but it's a powerful film with an interesting story that was certainly worth telling. Those who enjoy historical dramas or Courtroom dramas would be well-advised to check this one out."

It is not difficult to see where this is headed. Anthony Hopkins portrays a former United States President whose role is fairly standard until he highlights with a long speech about slavery. Morgan Freeman brings conviction as a former slave assisting in the investigation. He is more or less there to allow everyone to relate but Freeman rises above the conventions. Matthew McConaughey plays a lawyer representing the slaves. He has played this sort of role before with the same results but this is a far cry from A Time to Kill.

","The Amistad is a slow-paced film for reasons of mature and ominous suspense in court-law. In 1839 Martin Van Buren was president and he is known as a figurehead of the upstart of the Democratic Party. Anthony Hopkins plays the former president John Quincy Adams having came down from office during 1837 as his final seating as American president. Hopkins is given an 11 minute defense during courtroom debate for the slaves who are well as the heroes of the historical triumph the movie commemorates. March 4, 1837 was the date when he was succeeded by Van Buren. By 1840, depression conglomerated with southern financial and political pressures pelted the president. But Buren was ready for re-election as the third party presidential candidate by his stern alliance for the Free Soil anti-slavery party. The movie centers on a slave ship, the Amistad. It is intercepted by the American Marine Naval, belonging controversially to Spain, America, or noting that all these events transpires before the Civil War, perhaps the quasi- legal slaves will have a legal bounty to gain ownership over La Amistad? The film does not alarm a subconscious racially perverted conceit in me, but instead one must suspend modernity to interpellate with white antiquated mentality. The neutral American bias for rightful ownership of the ship obviously wins my heart's favor for the captors of the ship, the slaves, because they hold more moral sway as the ones who own the ship just by being likened to cargo, which is closer to being originally accidental in the Amistad having moved them from their homeland Africa. <br/><br/>Cinque, who is played by Djimon Hounsou, was the leader of this African revolt; desires and expresses his desire to go back to Africa. He leads the transatlantic slave ship. Critics will utmost agree that he shines outstandingly out of all the film's characters, and he is truly impacting emotion in good acting of indignation: never is he seen as brutal in the mature audience. The slave manages to seem believable in a survivor's right after a gruesome scene wherein the rest of the slaves on board were planked and died careening overboard, known historically poignant as Spielberg's ""cargo dumping historical realism"". The testimony of the two slaves that overtake the Amistad as to their desire to return to Africa sets the whole tone of their role as the protagonists. Morgan Freeman plays the free black man Theodore Joadson to give us an idea of cultural shift during the time of the abolitionists' gaining legal presence. He works in the news printing office in Boston. The film extras are made out to be, through alliteration and synecdoche of their disposable placid lack for talent, pointing towards the audience to focus on the main characters, especially the stand-out, Cinque. Stellan Skarsgaard acts as another vying cause for abolitionism as Lewis Tappan. Matthew McConaughey as attorney Roger Baldwin is hired by abolitionists specifically for his slave- friendly property lawyer status. Janusz Kaminski is the photographer who does Sepia ambiances for the film to heavy the mood in the same way a photographer of realist-journalist competence would choose for the morose-colored eyeglasses. The movie's meaning is that Civil War could have ensued from the slave's legal right becoming pronounced as a real threat to the southern slave beliefs."

Throughout the movie, we receive glimpses of what it was like to go through what slaves went through when in the slave trade system. These depictions in the movie shows the struggle and hardships slaves truly did endure, and how they continued to stay unified and work together. In the time period, as well all know, racism and slavery consumed the united states. After multiple court trials, the Africans were deemed free, But after an appeal, the supreme court now had to get involved to finally determine if the slaves will truly be freed.

","In 1839, a group of slaves aboard the Amistad, a Spanish ship sailing to the United States from Cuba revolted against their captors. Amistad, the movie, is based upon the true story of the group's journey from this point on. Within the opening minutes of the film, viewers are shown the awful conditions experienced on a slave ship. Immediately following is a gruesome, violent revolt warranted possibly by the treatment endured. <br/><br/>Amongst the rebel slaves from Western Africa is a man named Cinque who emerges as the leader of the group before the film begins. It is him whose background is exposed around midway through the film in a successful attempt to further the idea that slavery is a terrible endeavor. Scenes of his kidnapping and experiences on slave ships expose the true cruelty that was shown toward slaves or slaves-to-be. One scene that was particularly unnerving was that of the systematic drowning of fifty people who were seen as no more than access cargo. The beating, starving, and killing of slaves who were deemed useless was not uncommon as depicted by the film.<br/><br/>All is not grim for the Africans, however. They are supported by a number of important characters including president John Quincy Adams. In spite of the risks at hand because of the vehement feelings on either opposing sides of slavery, it is he who ultimately gives them freedom after it had been stripped of them on numerous occasions. Without the support of him, as well as others such as their lawyer Roger Sherman Baldwin, it would have been impossible for the Cinque and his group to return home. The conflict between those fighting for the Africans and those fighting to return them into slavery is symbolic of conflict that existed between abolitionists and slavery supporters. <br/><br/>To conclude, Amistad is a film that rather accurately describes the case surrounding the ¨cargo¨ aboard the actual Amistad as well as the situation regarding slavery in the United States during this time."

","After watching the film Amistad, I realized how horrific the treatment of slaves really was. The brutal murder and mistreatment of the Mende people really left me deeply saddened and disappointed in the way American people treated the blacks. <br/><br/>This film really captured the definition of freedom, and what it meant to the slaves. The excitement and hope that you receive at the end of the movie due to the court case decision to let the Mende people be free truly gives you a sense of humanity that didn't seem to exist throughout most of the movie. <br/><br/>Cinqué, the leader of the rebellion, takes a part in a scene that is a very beneficial to the rest of the movie. He slowly walks towards the man holding the gun who had just killed several black men taking part of the rebellion, he soon fights with him and overpowers the white man and stabs him. The whole rebellion though it is very gory, but yet very intriguing scene gives us a sense of hope for the people to return to their homeland and be reunited with their tribes. Throughout the rest of the movie, Cinqué plays a huge part in the freedom of the people as he chants ""us free"" and gains the help of several abolitionists including Robert Baldwin, his lawyer (Matthew McConaughey). He fights for the freedom of the Mende people, that seems nearly impossible to win for the people since they had rebelled on the Amistad against the captors and killed all of them... The case seems as if there is no hope for them and they are for sure destined to die. But Baldwin finds hidden documents that prove that the Mende people were free citizens of another country and actually never were slaves at any point. William Hollabird argues that Cinqué's case is all a lie and doesn't make any sense asking him why the captors would kill their cargo off so brutally especially. <br/><br/>The slaves despite all of the struggles they've experienced are granted their freedom after much argument and heated debate amongst the American people and in the court room. This movie really captures the definition of freedom and how important it is to the slaves. Steven Spielberg did a fantastic job creating such a real experience for each of the viewers to see how horrific the slaves were treated and how important freedom is to each person."

"ericando","8","0","2","1 January 2016"," Well produced movie depicting the horrors of slavery and the slave trading system
","Despite historical inaccuracies and some sloppiness in the acting Amistad remains a great film.<br/><br/>The depiction of this group of slaves, dehumanized by the processes involved with slavery, may not be totally historically correct, but it gave a good visualization of the horrors of slavery that most probably hadn't seen. At the time of this uprising, slavery divided our entire country, and was easily the most pressing issue to deal with. During one scene, President Van Buren faces the harsh reality that his re-election could be based on the decision he makes on this case. Incidents like what happened on La Amistad are what lead our country to civil war, because neither side wanted to budge on what they believed was right.<br/><br/>When the film begins, you see a slave struggling, desperate to get a nail out of the floorboard so he can unshackle himself. He breaks free, and releases a group of other men and they take knives and murder several crew members on the boat and take two hostage. The scene cuts after you watch a struggle between a slave and a crew member, and the slave repeatedly plunges his sword into the mans stomach while shouting as loud as he can. At this point you see these slaves as savages and murderers, who can't speak any language but their primitive slave language. <br/><br/>However it isn't until well into the trial when Cinque tells his story that we see what he went through to get to that point. He was captured with a net, beaten with a club, he had to watch public whippings, people being thrown into the sea to drown, he was crowded into a tight room with at least a hundred other slaves, most completely naked, and forced to fight for food, with people defecating everywhere. None of this was uncommon during the days of slavery. Kids had to watch as their parents were beaten, killed, raped, etc. This gives the average Joe Shmoe a visual on how horrible slavery truly was, as apposed to reading it in a textbook. Spielberg depicts this scene at the bottom of the ship, crowded with men, women, and children struggling for dear life, being treated like animals, amazingly. For me that was one of the most moving scenes in the movie, and reminded me what slavery really was.<br/><br/>Another great scene was early in the trial, the prosecuting lawyer stands up before the court, and says how inhumane the slaves were to slaughter the crew. This is completely and totally ironic because of the dehumanization of slaves and the cruel and unusual treatment they have to suffer. This shows the attitude people had towards slavery at the time. <br/><br/>Overall I thought that Spielberg did an amazing job with this story, and it would have been a 9 or 10 out of 10 had it not been for some historical inaccuracies and inconsistencies"

It felt like I was actually watching a part in history before there were cameras or anything like that. <br/><br/>My favorite scene in the film had to be when Cinque was having a flashback to what happened and how he came to America. From what I've learned in school, the treatment of slaves was accurately displayed however I was quite surprised when they threw the slaves overboard. Spielberg showed what happened if slaves got sick, if there were too many slaves on board, and the process and suffering the slaves went through. <br/><br/>Throughout the film, before the translator came in, I found the African Americans extremely comical. The lawyers desperately tried to communicate with the Africans to save their lives and the Africans are just standing there thinking they're idiots. Their lines were comical and the whites had no clue what was going on. <br/><br/>Overall, I thought the film was fantastic and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in history, slavery, or just want to watch a good movie."

","Not only is this movie intriguing, it is a movie that should be recognized as one of the most powerful anti-slavery movies ever produced. Amistad puts slaves as well as whites in their own perspective; how difficult it was for slaves to live during this time, and the degree of racism presented by whites. Even though this movie has agitated images, they were realistic and credible. The pain and suffering slaves went through is tremendous, and this movie depicted every aspect of slavery, from getting captured to the last stand, and even death. These slaves fought, literally, for their lives. Some people think that slavery was light, and over-dramatized, but in reality, slavery is overlooked and understated. Not everyone can really see how much agony slaves went through, and this movie snaps people into the realization that whites had treated African Americans as a minority, as Hitler did with the Jews. People like to sugarcoat the issue of slavery, but this movie clearly depicts how they were treated. <br/><br/>Amistad also showed the whites side of the argument. Some whites were abolitionists, but some were all for slavery. The movie contrasts these two political parties to add more drama, as well as accuracy to each plot. It is true, that one person can make a difference, and show the rest of the world that slavery is wrong, and should be destroyed. However there are always two sides to a story, and the protagonist stands strong with will-power to hold up his side of the argument. The stubbornness and ignorance of some of the characters added the realistic factor in the movie, and added fire to the flame on the issue of slavery by doing everything in their will to slip around the issue to prevent civil war, even though it was already on its way. <br/><br/>This movie is not only brilliant, but is sculpted in a way that combines the idea of our 30 basic human rights. From equality,discrimination, all the way to the right of having a trial, all these rights are carefully contributed into the movie. This is one of the only historical movies I have seen that actually kept my interest, while still retaining historic facts and events.

","I want to start this review by asking a question why does this film get overlooked by many people why I do not have a clue I may have a vague idea because the subject matter does not concern it's audience or it has been forgotten or nobody remembers the events of the film I think this film is so important and this was my first viewing of the film and I am lost for Words yet again I hear Steven Spielberg really wanted to direct this film a lot and it shows how committed to the story and the characters The performances are outstanding Sir Anthony Hopkins is John Quincy Adams simple as that Djimon Hounsou as Cinqué is a major discovery and I admire his performance greatly Morgan Freeman is outstanding as Theodore Joadson Nigel Hawthorne is extraordinarily heartbreaking Just great performances all around Matthew McConaughey as Roger Sherman Baldwin is the best performance in the whole film he is our leader our guide throughout the whole film and delivers in every scene Thanks Matthew you made this film come alive and I will never forget your performance thank you so so much this is your film and Djimon Hounsou as Cinque thank you as well this is a remarkable achievement I love the scenery and the cinematography by Janusz Kamiński and the Editing by Michael Kahn is outstanding and never drags on despite the fact it is almost 2 and a half hours it is a outstanding story and a unforgettable movie experience almost like the Color Purple and Empire of the Sun but Steven Spielberg tells the story differently it almost feels like a fight for survival and it is but the courtroom scenes are directed differently and the tone changes as the film stops to reflect and to think why and to question the reasons of the case why it was needed to happen and to uphold the American Constitution John Williams's outstanding emotive score is very understated and patriotic but the themes are wonderful for each part of the story Cinque's theme is wonderful one of the best pieces of music John Williams's has ever composed it is perfect the flute is incredible and the orchestra rises to play the theme as well and the trumpet intersperses the main theme with it too the hymn piece Dry your tears Afrika just to finish here I want people to think about equality and basic human values what does one act cost freedom or death that is the theme of the film One act can change the world and the way we treat everyone around with compassion or with hatred that is what Steven Spielberg asks us as he does in the Color Purple and Schindler's list and now with Amistad how do we feel about hatred do we think it is the right path to a normal happy life or is it a unjust decision to treat people that have done no harm to anyone with such intolerance and suffering for no logical reason it is just the way things worked or so we think that is the right cause of action As John Quincy Adams says it is not about what they are it is about who they are what's their story what will we remember them for the sacrifice their determination to win over such forces of evil and as John Quincy Adams says at the end any human being whether he or she be black or white will try again and again to get home where they belong where we all belong What the film teaches us is how do we accept race or religion at the end of the film John Quincy Adams says if he were another nationality we would treat him with respect and compassion songs would be written books would be filled with his stories let all people lead the life they want to lead and do not forget them who they are what is their goal what is their story and their reasons for existing in the world what do they contribute to society how do they support actions democracy or leadership what is their dreams and hopes? Just think about that for a moment Thank you Steven Spielberg thank you John Williams yet again this is an unforgettable film and it is highly underrated seek this film out now I urge everyone who has not seen this film to do so now!"
"CinemaClown","Null","0","1","31 May 2015"," One Of Steven Spielberg's Least Appreciated Works
","Powered by sincere performances, told with unflinching determination & strongly resonating the voice of freedom, Amistad finds director Steven Spielberg trying to expand his creative horizons for this historical drama brings on screen one of American history's most shameful acts & while the few artistic license taken here is up for dispute, the film is engaging for the most part.<br/><br/>Set in 1839, Amistad refers to a slave ship carrying a cargo of Africans who were sold into slavery & are on their way to American coastline. On the way, a mutiny takes place on the ship as the slaves free themselves & take over the ship. Yet, deceived by a couple of white survivors, they arrive in America where they are brought to trial & find an unlikely ally in an abolitionist lawyer.<br/><br/>Directed by Steven Spielberg, Amistad opens with the mutiny sequence that might be too disturbing to watch for a few and throughout its first act, the film maintains its tight grip on the viewers' emotions. Camera-work is skilfully carried out, Editing lets the film run a tad too long, set pieces are in tune with the timeline this story is set in & the background score by John Williams is evocative.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Amistad packs in quite a star-studded ensemble in Matthew McConaughey, Djimon Hounsou, Morgan Freeman, Anthony Hopkins, Pete Postlethwaite, Stellan Skarsgård, Chiwetel Ejiofor & Nigel Hawthorne, and the best work comes from both McConaughey & Hounsou. Freeman rarely does anything, Hopkins makes his mark only in the final moments & Ejiofor does a good job in his debut role.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Amistad remains one of Spielberg's least appreciated works that can use a wider audience for its plea for freedom, equality & humanity alone makes it a worthy example of its genre yet the overlong plot, snail-paced narration & sentimentality approach robs it of its true value. Starting on a promising note, leaking fuel for the rest of its runtime & almost running out of it near the end, Amistad is a mixed bag in the illustrious career of Steven Spielberg."

","Amistad tells an important story while keeping the viewers interested. I thought it was great because it reflects the tragedy and heartbreak that the people felt. The movie is also accurate in its portrayal of the politics in the 1830s to the 1840s. It tells the viewers that during that time period, politics were very complicated. I have only two complaints regarding the film. The first being that it became very slow moving at times, the second regarding the role of Morgan Freeman in the movie, Freeman played a black abolitionist but I feel like he didn't have a big enough role and was often forgotten. The courtroom arguments of the movie were very riveting and at times, comical. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in films about civil rights for Africans during the 1800s or anybody who is interested in the American Civil War."
"mprewasnicak","8","0","2","2 January 2015"," Amistad is a story about slavery and a slave ship called La Amistad. When the slaves aboard this ship take over, they eventually land in America.
","While the slaves are in America they encounter court cases based on their ownership. They have some difficulties because of the language difference between them and the Americans. I think that this movie was written and acted very well. Through the story of Cinque(Dijmon Hounsou) , it really allows you to see into the life of a slave and what they may have gone through. The scenes in his story where there was death and shows the horrible things done to slaves really shows how horrible slavery is. I also think that the role of John Quincy Adams (Nigel Hawthorne) was well played in the scene in the Supreme Court. Amistad shows a lot about how slavery and decisions, like in the Amistad case, could change the Civil War and the leaders in America. It emphasizes the issue of slavery and how inhumane it is. This movie makes you think a lot about the treatment of people and how humanity has changed since then."

","Steven Spielberg without question is the world's greatest director thanks to masterpieces like Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, Jaws, E.T. The Extra Terrestrial, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Lincoln, Munich, and of course this film. The movie tells the true story of an 1839 mutiny of a slave ship named La Amistad that is traveling towards America's northeastern coast. The movie stars Djimon Honsou as one of the slaves on the ship whose name is Cinque. The movie also stars Matthew McConaughey, Morgan Freeman, Anthony Hopkins, Nigel Hawthorne, and Anna Paquin as Queen Isabella II of Spain. What Spielberg tries to teach us with his film is that how badly treated the slaves were while on that ship of torture and abuse and how they fought for their freedom in real life. Director Steven Spielberg really knows where to put the facts in his historical epics. This movie in my critical opinion is the best movie of 1997 is because of it's inspirational details of why racism was wrong in the first place."

After the first 20 or so minutes the movie takes off and i'll bet you won't even take your eyes off the monitor for a split second, because you your soul will be engaged with the proceedings and you would be imagining yourself there with THEM and trying to help out THEM. Certain sequences are shot in typical Spielberg style and you have to watch it for yourself and perceive what is FREEDOM - a pulsating Dialogue from the best sequence in the movie (in my honest opinion!) The language barrier between the two parties and how they try to overcome it, how ultimately justice prevails above any other personal gains etc are other examples of not only how brilliant a story teller Spielberg is, but also Spielberg's keen eye for detail and the accomplished technician in him, the camera angles just elevates the mood to an altogether another level!

","Amistad is a surprisingly great movie that is a welcome addition into the filmography of Steven Spielberg. It has some courtroom clichés and some typical Spielberg drama fluff, but it overcomes those minor obstacles to be a powerful, sometimes-disturbing film about a group of people who yearn for their freedom. The editing is also choppy and sometimes it is hard to pick up what's going on, but this story moved me so much, I didn't care if the editing was sub-par.<br/><br/>Amistad, based on a true story, is about a group of African slaves who attempt to escape from their captors, but they are recaptured and sent to America for trial. Now these blacks will have to endure unfairness and racial hatred to find out their fates.<br/><br/>The acting is powerful. This is the movie where Djimon Hounsou becomes a star and this movie shows why. His performance as the so-called ""alpha male"" nearly moved me to tears. Anthony Hopkins, who played John Quincy Adams, delivers one of the best speeches you'll ever hear in the movies. Matthew McConaughey, in one of his early non-romantic roles does a wonderful job. I really love Morgan Freeman, but I'm disappointed he didn't do much in the film.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a powerhouse film that shows expert Spielberg direction and wonderful acting. The editing is questionable, but I'll let it slide for a film like this. I honestly didn't expect this to be good as it was so I'm quite happy. I rate this film 9/10."

","I haven't watched this movie till very recently and wow, what a movie it has been! This is a sheer work of a genius who is by all means Mr. Steven Spielberg. He does not do anything wrong again and again, and thus in this movie he did a great job, too. The very topic of slavery is so painful and disturbing that it would be wrong to make a sweetly home-video drama with no blood or brutality. Nay, sirs, Amistad did exactly the right job - the movie showed slavery as it is - brutal, bloody, bad, gory, evil, malicious, greedy, horrific and unpardonable. The casting is perfect and there are no bad actors in this movie at all. Even the small part of Anna Paquin as Isabella of Spain is a real gem, what say can we of bigger and even better parts by impeccable Morgan Freeman and Anthony Hopkins? The film is very heavy, full of really unpleasant violence scenes but this all is not for the violence's sake. Nay, again, this all served the ultimate goal - to depict the inhuman nature of human trade, and this excellent movie did that well"

","Combine an award-winning director, a talented cast, a poignant musical score and breathtaking cinematography with one of the darkest hours of world history, and you get Amistad, widely regarded as the definitive film about the trans-Atlantic slave trade. While the plot is focused on the Amistad case, the film itself reverberates with the broader issue of slavery, including anti-slavery figures such as John Quincy Adams. My favorite scene was when the African men enter a church and thumb through an illustrated Bible, able to identify with the sufferings of Christ, after which Spielberg ingeniously shows the masts of three ships, resembling the three crosses. Brilliant and heartbreaking, Amistad captures the struggle of these men and a very determined lawyer to win their freedom. With masterful directing, Spielberg draws upon the lessons of history to forge an acclaimed film that celebrates hope and freedom even in the darkest of times.<br/><br/>http://bitesizemoviereview.blogspot.com/"
"Bob Pr.","8","0","2","21 July 2012"," Extremely worthwhile for the historical perspective, IMO
","This tells the story of potential African slaves, the cargo on ""Amistad,"" a Spanish sailing ship, who revolted (1839) and ended up in American jails and courts. -- Will they be hung for killing their captors? -- Or 'property' that will be returned to their purchasers? The film traces their journey from Africa through various US courts and their outcomes that often intermixed with the looming domestic political issue, a sleeping gorilla: that of 1840s pre-Civil War slavery in the U.S. south.<br/><br/>The scenes in Africa and shipboard of the treatment of captured slaves have some unsettling (""R"" rated) cruelty. But ""Amistad"" is largely a drama of historical courtroom events (IMO, grossly accurate with exceptions that will be minor to many, major to a few).<br/><br/>Hopkins (as a lawyer, the former president, John Quincy Adams) got a deserved Oscar nomination for his supporting role. Freeman plays quite well a wholly invented, minor role (as a former slave & successful businessman in the 1840s North--who you trying to kid, Spielberg?!?!). McConaughey does a great job as the initial lawyer representing the Africans. Hounsu, as the captive African chief, is also very good.<br/><br/>This film provides a fascinating U.S. history lesson brought very much alive. Wikipedia has several articles pertinent to this: see both ""Amistad"" (for the film, related places, writings, actual events, etc.) and also ""Tecora"" (the Portuguese slave ship which took the Africans to Cuba); these help those who are interested to distinguish much of who, where & when this film captures or distorts historical truths. See also the ""Did You Know?"" section on IMDb's ""Amistad"" main page; this covers some points not in the Wikipedia articles.<br/><br/>I was extremely glad I saw this film for the knowledge gained despite its sometimes dramatized departures from utter truths."

","As someone said it in the movie, the slaves had nothing to fear from their masters because as they work for them, they wouldn't be killed. So for me the only difference between slavery and holocaust is the lack of genocide. Besides this, it's the same oppression, the same racism: just see the way of how slaves were treated during the crossing and they are similar to the future extermination camps. But it's true that somewhere condemnation of slavery isn't as known as holocaust. Maybe the unfortunate explanation is that the masters are not beaten ones like Germany but as the movie shows the entire enlightened nations. As Tocqueville wrote, slavery was a shameful thorn in America democracy and Spielberg as a humanist American filmmaker couldn't avoid the subject. And he did in his own way, the same than in ""Schindler's"", that is to say showing that courage and hope are more powerful that the darkest time, the worst atrocities. Foretelling his later ""Minority reports"" or ""Munich"", he throws a very critic look at authorities and for the first apparition of POTUS in his work (a real plague in a lot of American movies) and whispers critics that could have pleased his colleague Stone. But his optimism is also visually contagious: compare the first terrifying look of Cinque and his latter appearances and you can see an happy hand. The only flaw of the movie is finally his title because it's doesn't tell very much what's about: ""Amistad vs the people of America"" would have been better...<br/><br/>Pairing: ""Schindler's list"": before it, the allies were also evil forces..."
"sddavis63","7","0","2","28 August 2011"," An Excellent Historical Recreation
","The story of the Amistad slaveship revolt and the subsequent court case over the fate of the Africans who revolted isn't particularly well known but gets a well deserved high profile treatment from Steven Spielberg in this movie that fairly faithfully recounts the events all the way from the journey of the Amistad across the Atlantic to the final decision of the U.S. Supreme Court.<br/><br/>As a historical re-creation this is excellent and captures a number of different angles and competing interests in the case. Most importantly, of course, are the Africans themselves, led by a passionate but articulate man known as Cinque, who was played brilliantly by Djimon Hounsou. The court case revolved around the issue of whether these particular blacks were born in Africa (and thus not able to be imported into the United States as slaves) or whether they were born in Cuba, and were therefore mere property. The case is taken on by lawyer Roger Baldwin (Matthew McConnaughey) and then, in front of the Supreme Court, by former United States President John Quincy Adams (Anthony Hopkins.) Hopkins offered a very moving monologue before the Supreme Court near the end of the movie. Morgan Freeman also plays a significant role as a former slave turned businessman who apparently partially funds the case. We feel for the plight of the Africans. From the opening scenes of the movie - even though the revolt is bloody and violent - we feel sympathy for them and their plight. Their story is fascinating, emotional and ultimately heartwarming.<br/><br/>Many other issues are looked at in the movie. There's the political dilemma of Martin Van Buren (the incumbent U.S. President, played by Nigel Hawthorne) who is facing inevitable defeat in the upcoming election and for whom the Amistad case is a nightmare, as he risks losing the support of the south over it. There's the diplomatic manoeuvring between Spain (represented by its 11 year old Queen) and the U.S. There's the complicated issue of North vs. South, which by 1840 was becoming a monumental problem in the U.S. There's the issue of judicial independence. With so much going on, it's really quite a fascinating movie to watch.<br/><br/>It is at times perhaps a little bit too detailed in all honesty. Some of the legal proceedings might be a great interest to legal scholars, but some of it also went over my head to be honest. I mean, I got the basic issue - if they were born in Africa, they were free; if they were born in Cuba they were slaves. I just felt that some of the legal proceedings went on a bit too long, and at time slowed the movie down unnecessarily. All the performances in it are good, though, and one has to be impressed that in spite of the fact that 7 of the 9 Supreme Court justices were from the South, the Supreme Court nevertheless ruled in favour of the Africans, freed them and allowed them to return to Africa. It's a well- done movie worth watching for those with an interest in the broad subject of U.S. slavery. (7/10)"
"Lejink","6","0","3","21 March 2011"," Ship of shame...
","One of Spielberg's ""big subject"" features (c.f. ""Schindler's List""), dramatising the epic story of the slave-revolt on a Spanish ship circa 1840, which winds up in the waters and therefore the territory of a young United States, causing a legal battle ostensibly on the rights of slaves and of course prefiguring the Civil WAr that followed within a generation.<br/><br/>One thing Spielberg can relied to deliver is an arresting start to a film, witness ""Savings Private Adams"" for one, and here he may even surpassed the celebrated drama of the latter with the initial violent and bloody uprising of the African slaves, shot in a howling storm at dead of night, brilliantly lit and utterly convincing in its depiction of their do or die struggle. Later on, in the film-within-a-film flashback showing the Mende people's capture and incarceration in the slave fortress and then the Transatlantic slave ship, he similarly doesn't stint on the unimaginable horror of their experience, with scenes which will make the viewer wince with pain or shame at so-called civilised man's butchery of fellow humans they believed were beneath them. <br/><br/>So far so effective. Naturally the film has to deal at length with the protracted legal arguments over the slaves human rights, which proves trickier to deliver, especially as their initial victory was appealed, apparently to appease the slave-owning south, to the Supreme Court by the office of the President - the problem arising as to how to effectively deliver a second courtroom drama. I suspect some dramatic licence was taken here, although I can't be sure without reading more on the historic account of the case.<br/><br/>Therefore I did have some issues with aspects of the direction. These include the rather obvious way that Anthony Hopkins' former President John Quincy Adams is introduced so early into the piece (even without knowing the facts, you just know he's eventually going to take the case and deliver the big speech which will win the day). Plus Spielberg just can't resist the easy lure of sentimentality as he gives us a close-up on the beautiful, innocent face of an infant on board the Slave-boat. Finally, there's the distraction of the almost ever-present background music of John Williams, fawning over every scene like an unwelcome attendant.<br/><br/>I also have issues with some of the casting, Matthew McConaughey really lacking gravitas as the slaves' lawyer and apart from giving us a lot of facial reactions and one clumsy flashback to his own slavery days on board the slave-ship, I've little idea why Morgan Freeman is on board, if you'll pardon the pun. Hopkins delivers his big speech assuredly but you never feel you're watching a major historical character at a defining time in his life. The actors playing the slaves are however convincing, it helping that they were less familiar than some if the big names in key roles elsewhere.<br/><br/>There's undoubtedly a major story here and cinematographically the film is marvellous. I was less convinced however by some of the turns of the narrative and some of the acting. A film with good intentions and high aspirations let down by some of the familiar indulgences of its director."

"jzappa","8","0","2","24 May 2010"," A Beautifully Made Film, a Somewhat Superficial Victory
","Slavery in and of itself could, I imagine, be viewed essentially as an issue of legalese and territorial ownership, at least to those taking advantage of it. One of the confounding truths offered in Steven Spielberg's Amistad is that seven of the nine U.S. Supreme Court justices in 1839 were slave-owning Southerners. His skillfully made Dreamworks opener zeroes in on the statutory condition of Africans who rebel against their abductors on the high seas and are brought to trial in a New England court. Slavery itself is not the core of contention. Rather, the court must choose whether the defendants were born of slaves, in which case they are guilty of murder, or were illegally brought from Africa and therefore had a right to rise up against kidnapping. But the law's clarification is not distinguished as much as it could have been for a movie with that as its core issue. The international slave trade had been abolished by treaties by this time, although those who were already slaves continued to be owned by their masters, as did their children. The ethical cutting of corners of that clarification is extremely cold-blooded, but on it relies the defense of Cinque, the leader of the Africans, and his comrades defiant.<br/><br/>Amistad, like Spielberg's Schindler's List, is not just indignant opposition to moral deprivation. We do not need movies to persuade us of the evil of slavery and the Holocaust. Both films are about the ways good men attempt to collaborate pragmatically within a morally deprived government to clear merely some of its prey. Schindler's techniques are brilliant, create tension, and result in a more arresting and impactful film than the bureaucratic stratagems in Amistad, where lawyers in powdered wigs attempt to decide the homeland of men whose language they do not speak. Having nothing to do with the ethical quandaries concerned, Schindler's List works better as a story as it is about a tightrope con game, while Amistad is about the hunt for a determination that, if found, will be of minor importance to the millions of other slaves. On the whole, the movie doesn't have the sensory explosiveness of Spielberg's seminal historical films, Schindler, Saving Private Ryan, The Color Purple and Empire of the Sun, which all moved me to tears.<br/><br/>The instances of the most feeling in Amistad transcend the central story. I speak of a mortifying scene where, with food running low on the ship, the less durable slaves are chained together and thrown over the side to drown so that more food will be left for the rest. And another sequence in which the bilious innards of the slave trade are gazed upon, as Africans kidnap people of rival groups and sell them to slave traders. A scene where Cinque sees African violets in John Quincy Adams' greenhouse and is crippled by nostalgia. And Cinque's recollection of his wife left in Africa.<br/><br/>What is most vital about Amistad is how it gives faces and names to its African characters. The slave named Cinque emboldens as a memorable human being, a once-free farmer who has lost his wife and family. We see his wife, and his village, and something of his life; we grasp how heartlessly he was torn from his life and dreams. He speaks no English, though takes in a little while in prison, and a translator is found who helps him communicate his human disgust at a legal system that may free him but will not acknowledge the all-too-obvious essence of the crime against him. He learns enough of Western civilization to discern its dissonances, as in a scene where another slave expresses with an illustrated Bible how he can relate to Jesus. And there is that inevitable moment between lawyer and client in which McConaughey's character finally talks to Cinque as a man and not as a rook on a chessboard. ""Give us free!"" Cinque cries in an immense scene in the courtroom, causing all to confront how little a ""not guilty"" verdict would matter to the absolute reality of his case.<br/><br/>Djimon Hounsou's performance relies considerably on his screen presence, which is a powerhouse. Some of the other performances are somewhat let-downs. I was taken aback by how little substance or screen time was given to the Morgan Freeman character, a former slave turned abolitionist who in his few scenes tells of the mines of humanity that stay buried. Maybe that's the point: It's not about being black at the time; it's about the laws of the time. Matthew McConaughey is obligated by the film to have his head in the clouds as the defense attorney; he plods along from cold-hearted legal objectivity to a touching realization of sympathy that we were all expecting, and while we are satisfied for him we are not by any means much moved. Nigel Hawthrone plays Martin Van Buren, who is portrayed as a waffling case of backbone deficiency who just wants to keep the South off his back. Another fun highlight is how he is accosted with demands by the Queen of Spain, played by a pubescent Anna Paquin, who is upset that she can't have the new toys she was excited to get.<br/><br/>The axis of this film, basically, is in Anthony Hopkins' haunting performance as old John Quincy Adams, who speaks for 11 minutes in defense of the defendants, and holds the courtroom, and us, movingly absorbed. It is one of the great movie courtroom speeches. However in applauding it, I broach the film's main concern: It is too much about the law and not enough about the victims. That John Quincy Adams triumphs in his noble cause is a wonderful accomplishment for him and a huge weight off Cinque's shoulders and his follower slaves, yet in the tragic entrails of American slavery, it is a somewhat superficial victory."

Worse still, this was made by Spielberg(competent director though he may be, the way the man views the world, you'd think those glasses were made of sugar), and there is, indeed, some sap and sentimentality, but it is actually fairly limited. Also, this has brutality and disturbing content. It of course(given who put this on the silver screen) in the end boils down to a banal and easy to memorize moral, then again, too many people still, to this day, don't get it, so it does need to be said. This is engaging and evokes genuine emotion from the viewer. The plot is well-told, and develops in a satisfying way. Pacing is spot-on, this is never boring, and it doesn't move overly fast, either. The writing is quite magnificent. All of the characters are credible. Every single acting performance is excellent. There are quotable and marvelous lines of dialog in this. This is effective and well-done. Production value is beyond reproach. There is a little nudity, and a moderate amount of violence, neither being gratuitous. The DVD holds a theatrical trailer, and a 25-minute behind-the-scenes featurette. I recommend this to anyone interested in watching it. 7/10"

","Forgive me for what is now a cliché, but many people say ""Amistad"" is to ""Schindler's List"" as ""The Lost World"" is to ""Jurassic Park."" That's an apt comparison, although ""Amistad"" is closer to a misfire than ""The Lost World"" is.<br/><br/>A ship carrying slaves from Africa (via Cuba) suffers an uprising from its captives, and the slaves force the surviving crew members to return them to Africa. But they are betrayed, and sent to America, where they are captured. Two abolitionists, Ted Joadson (Morgan Freeman) and Tappin (Stellan Skarsgard), hire a property lawyer, William Baldwin (Matthew McConaughey) to set them free, as (based on a technicality), they were illegally acquired ""property."" But tensions between the North and the South on the slavery issue are brewing, and President Martin Van Buren (Nigel Hawthorne) is pressured into intervening on behalf of the Southern states. What was once a simple case quickly becomes a fight for freedom.<br/><br/>Ask anyone who the greatest filmmaker who ever lived was, and many will have Steven Spielberg on their lists at some point. However, while it is true that Spielberg is one of the masters, he is not flawless. He takes a few major missteps with the film, and what could have been a worthy successor to ""Schindler's List"" is now just another credit on his resume.<br/><br/>To begin with, the first hour of ""Amistad"" is messy. There are a lot of things going on during this time, and Spielberg can't keep it all straight. It is navigable for the viewer, but many will be left slightly frustrated as I was. The film gets better after this, but the problems don't stop there. While many films of this ilk use manipulation (i.e. powerful music and dramatic shots) to convey the right emotion in the viewer, the best films are very subtle about it. During some spots in ""Amistad,"" Spielberg's manipulation is obvious. Sometimes he even adds elements to the film that don't really have a place there. Finally, there are some technical issues (like how it is so easy for the crew members of La Amistad to understand the prisoners while it takes a long time for the Americans to become able to do so).<br/><br/>Spielberg's films are typically known for their strong performances (there are exceptions, however), and ""Amistad"" is no different. Matthew McConaughey has a very narrow range, but like many actors, he can be effective in the right type of role. As Baldwin, McConaughey is effective, but not standout. He does what is required of him, and not much more. At times, Spielberg seems to want to make Baldwin like Oskar Schindler (both men view their quarry (slaves/Jews) as a means to an end, but they gradually begin to care about them and their fate). However, McConaughey does not have the talent that Liam Neeson has, nor is the character developed enough. Freeman and Skaarsgard are important during the first half (both give solid performances), but are largely forgotten (Skaarsgard disappears from the screen before halfway without much explanation.<br/><br/>However, ""Amistad"" boasts two standout performances: Anthony Hopkins as John Quincy Adams, and Djimon Hounsou as Cinque. Adams is a far-cry from Hopkins' most infamous performance (Hannibal Lector), but Hopkins devours the role (in fact, it's almost impossible to believe that the two characters are portrayed by the same man); his Oscar nomination was well-deserved. Adams is a frail man, but he has great energy, and is an outstanding orator. His 11-minute speech before the Supreme Court is completely arresting.<br/><br/>Djimon Hounsou has tremendous screen presence. He can command a viewer's attention like no one else I have ever seen; his scenes where he lets loose his fury about his situation are almost frightening. Yet Hounsou is also effective at playing a subdued character, which he does from time to time. Cinque is the beating heart of the story; everything else just revolves around him. Hounsou makes his mark on the film, and his performance is unforgettable (an Oscar nod for his performance was well warranted).<br/><br/>When ""Amistad"" came out on video, I was about ten. I remember running from the room screaming and crying, and was unable to finish watching the film. Like ""Saving Private Ryan,"" ""Amistad"" contains some very heavy and disturbing material. Although not as pervasive as Spielberg's second WWII epic, there are at least two scenes that will likely provoke a similar response.<br/><br/>""Amistad"" is an okay film, as long as you don't compare it to ""Schindler's List."" Or ""Jurassic Park,"" for that matter."

","I was going through my mom's movies and found Amistad, I noticed how it had some really great actors: Anthony Hopkins, Morgan Freeman, and Djimon Hounsou, so I decided to check it out. I finished it today and I was absolutely moved by this film, I agree that it's not as memorizing as Schindler's List, but I do feel like this is a terrific film and is just incredibly heart breaking. Spielberg did a great job in telling the horrific stories of illegal slave trading, just what it must be like to not be treated as a human, but nothing more than property and like an animal. Djimon Hounsou, I can't believe this guy was not nominated for an Oscar, he was just incredible in this film and delivered his lines so beautifully. This was a very sad but important story to tell and I felt that no one else could have told it better than Steven Spielberg.<br/><br/>On an illegal slave trade, all the African slaves escape and slaughter the sails men brutally, the slaves are captured though and brought back to America to be put on trial for murder. Baldwin, their lawyer is fighting their innocence while their leader, Cinque, tells their horrific story of their trade and how the men that kidnapped them brutally beat and killed some of them. In a country where almost half the population are slave owners and white, this seems like the trial of the century and hopefully with the help of an ex president, John Quincy Adams by their side, they will be free to go home again.<br/><br/>I highly recommend Amistad if you get the chance to see it, I honestly don't see how others cannot appreciate this story. The actors did a great job, even somehow out of surprise, Matthew McConaughey delivers a decent performance, so why has he taken such a down turn? But Anthony and Djimon truly take the show, especially in their first scene together where Cinque is explaining how he will have his ancestors with him by his side at the trial. The speech that Hopkins delivers at the end is very inspirational and reminds you to forget the hatred, the differences, that deep down inside, we are all human and have feelings. Amistad is a great film and I think it does deserve a better rating and a more fair chance than it's been given.<br/><br/>9/10"

","More people should see this. Nay, everyone should see this. You cannot imagine a more perfect script, more perfect acting, a more perfect film. I saw this with my mom and my brother, the three of us making up three of the five people that showed up that particular day, which is a pity since this is the second greatest historical picture ever (Lawrence of Arabia, of course, being first). <br/><br/>Loved the epic nuances and the beautiful telling of the Christ by Dimon in the middle of the slave ship.<br/><br/>Every actor in this film gives the performance of a lifetime. In a time when the majority of movies are, and I say this with no hesitation whatsoever, total crap, it's refreshing to find that a few films rise above to become modern masterpieces.<br/><br/>Among recent films that can carry this title are Queen Elizabeth, Shakespeare in Love, Luther,, the Good Shepard, Children of Men, and the Queen. But Amazing Grace dwarfs them all to become the greatest film in the last at least the last three years, but probably more. I have yet to see a film that moved me to tears of joy or sadness, but this came close. The theater in which I saw it had no other remotely interesting movies showing but this (and 300, which I want to see simply because it looks cool). Alas, in a world where more people want to rush to the most atrocious thing that the film world has to offer, there isn't much of a place for Amistad.

","A truly provocative film about slavery and prejudice. Steven Spielberg works his dramatic magic once again to give us the horrific tale of the La Amistad slaves and how they fought for their freedom. The scenery was very realistic and the acting was superb. Such actors like Matthew McConaughey, Morgan Freeman, and Sir Anthony Hopkins were excellent, but the one that stands out from the rest is Djimon Hounsou. He was excellent as Cinque. As with ""Schindler's List,"" I was emotionally devastated when it was all over. I won't tell you if they get their freedom or not, but I will say that it's a story that should be taught to everyone and not just a select few."
"bobsgrock","7","0","1","21 May 2008"," Solid Spielberg.
","Here we have another historical epic made in the same vein as Schindler's List, only more discreet and soft. While Spielberg really took it to the audience in giving them as authentic an experience as possible for his Holocaust picture, here he sits back and lets us take the experience for ourselves. The stories are similar here, as we watch two groups of people be completely controlled by outside forces simply for the benefit of the force controlling them. Of course we sympathize with them, but Spielberg takes it farther and gives us a rather unforgiving portrait of the slaves' journey to America. Starting in Africa, they are captured by Portuguese slave traders and then sold to the Spanish ship La Amistad. The journey from Africa to Cuba is the most horrific as we watch the inhumane sleeping quarters and food rations these people are given. The film then settles into a courtroom drama mode as we watch Morgan Freeman and Matthew McConaughey fight for their freedom against the government led by newly reelected president Martin Van Buren. Not always history savvy, the film still manages to portray these iconic American figures as someone we can listen and relate to. This brings me to the technology aspects of the film which more often than not are a success. The acting is great with Freeman doing his usual stellar performance and Djimon Hounsou being completely convincing of his slave leader character. However, I was most impressed with Anthony Hopkins as former president John Quincy Adams and McConaughey as the young lawyer that lead the case. McConaughey in particular needs to do more films like this to become the true movie star he has the potential for. All these chick flicks with Kate Hudson and Jennifer Lopez are an insult to the magnificent work he does here. The direction is steady by Spielberg and the writing keeps us interested for the most part. While a little long at times and maybe not completely accurate, this is still a film well worth seeing and a great piece of American history frozen forever in the reels of cinema."

","i think this movie needs to be watched by EVERY grade schooler in America. i woke up early and flipped through channels and caught this movie about 7 minutes into it. i watched it because of the actors i have always respected never knowing where the movie would go. partway through i got on line and googled amistad and was amazed at what it brought up. during the commercials i read the actual account of the case that is documented in our US history. i watched to see how it played out. i cried and cried and prayed for the ignorance of humanity. i also prayed and cried for the Lord to set those in Afica free who are still struggling especially in DAR4. i am disgusted with the judicial system that couldn't take the first win on behalf of these Africans as final. why would we a nation, who claims to uphold freedom, continue this case all the way to the supreme court? it disgusts me that in history the only reason it went that far was due to the south wanting to argue their so-called ""right"" to keep slaves. since when does any human being have the right to own another? have we not grown enough to see how special and beautiful we all are in God's eyes? i thank God that it ended the way it did, with their freedom. But it saddens me that they could not find their families upon their return home. i wished for a better ending. i thank all involved for educating us in this matter and i wonder why no Oscars were given for the performances which were excellent!!!!! i hope humanity could watch and learn. i hope the ones responsible back in the day have already faced the most awesome judgement possible, that of the Lord's, and i hope they received their just rewards!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"JoeytheBrit","Null","0","1","9 April 2008"," An interesting story weakened by over-earnestness
","Amistad is strangely old-fashioned in its simplification of the true story of a group of natives from Sierra Leone who murder their captors aboard the eponymous vessel as they are illegally transported to the States to become slaves. It's more like a Hollywood film from the forties or fifties than the nineties and so, rightly or wrongly, I felt a sense of mistrust about the accuracy of Spielberg's retelling of the events as I watched. This mistrust was deepened by Spielberg's use of an overbearing soundtrack which he seems to use to manipulate his audience rather than to enhance the viewing experience.<br/><br/>The scenes aboard the ship are the best, but they account for only a small portion of the running time, and so the excitement and horror of the situation at sea is soon quelled by lengthy sequences of talking heads as they argue about the fate of the Africans. Spielberg captures the flavour of the times well, though, and the members of the large cast are all better than average  especially Djimon Hounsou as the leader of the captives who manages to convey a range of emotions, largely without the luxury of dialogue. Anthony Hopkins also stands out as John Quincy Adams, the crusty former president who eventually comes to the aid of the young lawyer (Matthew McConnaughy) representing the would-be slaves. It's just a shame that Adams' courtroom speech, which apparently persuades a judge selected by the prosecution to find in favour of the defence, is so flat and uninspiring.<br/><br/>Upon their victory, we see shots of the slave camp in Sierra Leone being bombed and other captive natives being led to freedom as the over-emotional music swells. Those who have used slaves for centuries (both Brits and Americans), are depicted as valiant heroes here, which is as much of a con as Hounsou and his brethren, who after all murdered almost all the crew of the Amistad, being depicted as noble, thoughtful men whose comparative simplicity compared to their captors somehow elevates them to a higher moral plain.<br/><br/>Spielberg's to be applauded for bringing a little-known event in American history to the popular consciousness, but it's just a shame he couldn't have delivered it to us with a little less old-time sentimentality."
"gabigabi1994","Null","0","2","12 January 2008"," movie opinion
","Amistad is a film about slave trade on the middle passage, it's about these slaves which are caught on the Ivory Coast in Africa and are taken to America on a boat. These slaves are being taken to America in very bad conditions, they are beaten if they are ill or misbehave. The slaves make a rebellion on the ship, and take over the ship, leaving two Spanish ship mates which they will take them back to Africa. At last they end up in America where a judgment takes place, deciding whether the slaves are freed or not. This movie will be out on your cinema on the 4th of December of 1997.The movie was written by Alexs Pate and directed by Steven Spielberg.<br/><br/>The behavior of the actors is quite realistic, but in some parts they don't show so much realism because they act as if they know things they're not supposed to know, for example, when Cinque 'wants free' when he's in parliament. <br/><br/>Spielberg seems to avoid exaggeration; because the movie is quite attractive, we can see no reason why things couldn't have gone this way, but if Spielberg would have exaggerated, this film wouldn't make so much effect on you because you would notice that he's exaggerating and that it's all a fake Hollywood.<br/><br/>The setting, and costumes were very realistic, the scenery had nothing that could make someone think it was filmed in the 1990s because it's all so realistic. <br/><br/>Hollywood has made a very good film, Amistad, but the problem is that it only tells the story from the point of view from one person; this only gives us one point of view. The film would've been better if there were more points of view so that we don't only get the point of view from one person, but we get the point of view from more people, so that we know not only what one person thinks but what the majority think. <br/><br/>I think Hollywood didn't exaggerate the violence, I think slaves were actually treated the way they were on the middle passage, but the reason why is because Hollywood didn't exaggerate hardly anything, if there were too much violence and deaths, I wouldn't believe it. <br/><br/>Spielberg obviously couldn't make a movie three or four months long, so he has to cut scenes out so people don't get bored. But Spielberg could have put more detail into the film because he wastes a too much time on parliament scenes instead; he could have put more detail on the middle passage. It seems as if he Spielberg has invented a few parts to make the movie longer, but it is nearly impossible that Spielberg tells the entire truth, not because he doesn't want, but because he can't tell exactly what was going on because there is no source (as far as I'm concerned) that explained with full details, describing what happened with the slaves on the Amistad.<br/><br/>There is no reason why not to invent some new characters in the film, because it doesn't affect the story line to introduce invented characters unless they don't fit in, but the characters fit in.<br/><br/>Spielberg is American, so we can't really say that he tells the whole truth because if he exaggerates he would leave America in a bad way because people would think America was taking a big role in the slave trade.<br/><br/>Spielberg has obviously researched a lot to get so much information about the Amistad. I think he got the information (if it was him who got it) of the internet or historians which I think give more information than anything or books, which show sources of information which you could otherwise maybe not get. I think that he set the scenery quite well, because the houses and the clothes looked very realistic. <br/><br/>The locations where the film takes place are very well chosen because; they are very adequate to the film. The civil war at the end shows why the war took place, and how much banning the slave trade affected America.<br/><br/>The court was very realistic, and the way everything worked and how they set it up was good. But when Cinque shouts out 'we want free!' things start to get a little fake because he is African and what does he know about English? <br/><br/>On the middle passage, the slaves were treated extremely badly, they only gave food to the slaves who were healthy, and they whip them, and throw them over board and treat them as if they were bugs. The way they treat them could be a bit of an exaggeration, but we don't know what happened so there is no way we can know if how they treated them on the boat is true or an exaggeration.<br/><br/>The movie shows sadness in a very hard way because if you think about how hard it needs to be, to be kidnapped from your village to be sold and having to work without being paid, especially if you're a child, a mother or a father, leaving your family behind or being born into slave trade, like the baby on the boat. And what if they kidnap the whole of your family but when you get to America, you are all split. <br/><br/>The happiness of the African people when they are finally freed, makes you happy in the way that you feel well because the people which have been suffering so much, are finally in what they had always been, freedom, even though it's only a film.<br/><br/>The reaction of the white people when the slaves were freed was happiness, because slaves with human rights had been freed and finally taken back to their homes."

","The Armistad case was one of the points along the road to Civil War that has been consistently overlooked. This film focuses primarily on the trial to determine the right to own certain persons said to be chattels. Taken in the British protectorate of Sierra Leone, the Armistad prisoners mutinied. Eventually brought to shore by the US Navy, the trial was in theory a contest between a US Naval officer who asserted the right of salvage and the Spanish title owners. Brought to trial in New Haven, mutineers were determined to have been free persons justifiably rebelling against their captors.<br/><br/>When the Spaniards appealed to the US Supreme Court dominated by Southernors sympathetic to slavery, John Quincy Adams played by Anthony Hopkins delivered an eloquent Fath of Our fathers speech which swayed the court to grant release.<br/><br/>The film addresses an important facet of American History too readily ignored even by careful students of American history. One of the commentators claimed never to have read anything of the armstad incident in years of reading American History; I confess to having first come across the story in the french language."

","1839 sees a cargo of slaves rise up and take over the ship Amistad from their masters. They point the ship back in the direction of their homeland but only succeed in ending up in America. There they are taken into custody and charged with the murder of the crew. Those in favour of abolishing slavery pick up their cause but there are several other claims of ownership on this ""cargo"". As the abolitionists' lawyer Baldwin joins them he tries at first to make it a simple matter of legal possession, highlighting the fact that the slaves came from Africa and were not born into slavery  thus making them illegally acquired. However as the case becomes more complex and political, Baldwin turns to one of the slave, Cinque, to help build his case.<br/><br/>Opening with the well-directed and fragmented overthrow of the Amistad, this film immediately steps back into a slightly more talkative state that continues for the majority of the film. Later in the film we flashback to the slave ships for a vivid and devastating look at the treatment and murder of the slaves during their journey but mostly the film is an interesting courtroom drama with this very intriguing case in history at its heart. As specific parts of the film, this is all well and good because there isn't really a weak part of the film but yet it tends not to hang together as well as it should. The courtroom stuff is interesting but you find yourself drawn into the detail of the case and forget the wider picture of the cruelty and tragedy of slavery. The film occasionally jumps back to that to remind us but it doesn't manage to weave this across the whole story. So I can understand the criticism of the film (or rather subdued praise) because it does at times lose itself into a polished drama rather than an emotional look at a period in history.<br/><br/>Spielberg's direction is best when given moments of style or horror to work with but otherwise he delivers a nice sense of place and period while wrapping the whole lot in a rather sentimental score. It is a rather disappointingly delivery though because it is quite, well, ""ordinary"" at times. The cast are impressive on paper and mostly good on the screen. Although he is way down the fame ladder at this point, Hounsou is impressive as Cinque. He brings a lot out with his face and body and he creates a character long before he has been given subtitles or a translator to aid him. McConaughey is reasonably good alongside him and supports the factual courtroom side of the film. Hopkins is a little bit hammy and overdoes the doddery nature of his character. Ejiofor is as good as he nearly always is, even with a comparatively small role. Freeman, Hawthorne, Paymer, Postlethwaite, Skarsgård and Paquin all add famous names and solid turns but the material doesn't really need all of them, although I suppose the worthy nature of the story made them easy to get.<br/><br/>At the least though, this is an interesting film that is delivered in a professional and polished way. It has a few moments of searing emotion but mostly it is just interesting and is wrapped in a rather obvious score. Worth seeing for what it does well, but perhaps a little disappointing (considering the calibre of people involved) for what it does not."

","The case of ""La Amistad"" marked an important development in the separation of the U.S. executive and judiciary; and almost incidentally was also a key development in the onset of civil war and the eventual abolition of slavery. The case considered whether a group of slaves captured in Africa, who had revolted while on board a ship in U.S. waters, should be given freedom, at a time when the U.S. law stated that only those born as slaves could be treated as tradeable commodities. The legal case was clear, but giving preference to a group of Africans over white Europeans and Americans was politically dangerous, although in the end, the prisoners were freed.<br/><br/>The genius of Stephen Spielberg's film of the case is the way that in the beginning, he presents the Africans to us as they would have appeared to the Americans of that time: animal and threatening, and forces us to see how ""civilised"" men might have regarded them as of another species altogether (although of course, even accepting this does not lead to a real argument for the cruelty of their treatment). But as the two sides learn to communicate, so the humanity of the slaves is revealed, both within and without the film. The weak points are a score that over-emphasises the film's message, and the strange role played by the character of John Quincey Adams, a former president who became involved in the case. For the first three quarters of the film, the story is that of a young lawyer, at first cynical, later increasingly committed to the cause, who builds the correct legal case for freedom. But when the case goes before the Supremene Court, Adams steps in, and makes a windy and completely unlegalistic appeal for the men's freedom on the simple grounds that slavery is wrong. I know nothing of the true history, but if this really happened, I (if I were the writer) would have taken it out, because it breaks the nuanced pattern of the story to date; but one fears it has been included for precisely that reason, to allow the movie to wear its heart on its sleeve. It's a shame that Spielberg felt the need to tell us so explicitly that slavery is wrong.<br/><br/>The events depicted happened when the United States was only recently divorced from Britain, and a number of British actors play certain key figures without disguising their accents, including Anthony Hopkins as Adams and the late Nigel Hawthorne (good value as always) as his successor van Buren."

","I finally own the DVD and saw it again last night.It is the riveting story of the plight of a handful of Africians and their ordeal at the hands of slave traders and their subsequent trial for a massacre aboard the slave ship. Now some people have criticized the introduction of the bible element into the story and at first I was right up there with them. Oh please! But then after seeing it again I could see something different.<br/><br/>The new judge (with no jury) was obviously inexperienced and handpicked to ensure that the verdict against the blacks went only one way. So the night before the final verdict, while Cinque and his friend look at the bible pictures, much the same way a child would in Sunday School, the judge kneels in a church praying for some kind of divine hand to show him what to do because obviously he is only there because he has a conscience. The similarity to Christ suffering in the Garden was rather obvious although perhaps we all suffer in our own self made Gardens at some time in our lives...perhaps the judge because he accepted not only the case but perhaps some hint of later advances to his career. Who knows. Of course there is no divine intervention (as there was none for the Jews in Schlindler's List), there is only that thin fabric of humanity where one man looks at another (black or white, Christian or Jew) and knows that they are equal and then acts on that gut feeling. Here the judge decided to let the Africians go... but at what cost. The look on his face after pronouncing the verdict and the reaction of several people in the court tells it all. I thought this movie was very thought provoking especially the moments that made us ask,""Now what would I do in that situation?"""

","Another reviewer on this board made a good point; history classes in the 1950's and 60's were quite devoid of true life cases that helped shape American politics and policies prior to the Civil War. In my case, it was as if not much occurred between the presidencies of Andrew Jackson and Abraham Lincoln, with names like Van Buren, Harrison, Tyler, Polk and Fillmore relegated to the dustbin of history. As we learn in the ""Amistad"" story occurring in 1839, the country was already bracing for a conflict over the slavery question. Senator John C. Calhoun (Arliss Howard) was flexing his oratory muscles for debate on the issue, and the scene where he challenges President Van Buren (Nigel Hawthorne) at the dinner table is particularly compelling.<br/><br/>The performances as well as the film itself appear award worthy, and the movie seems to have been overlooked somewhat in that regard. In a year when ""Titanic"" was destined to overwhelm in terms of sheer spectacle, I find it hard to imagine that a title like ""The Full Monty"" was deemed more worthy than this. I suppose that shouldn't really surprise followers of the Academy Awards, as recognition doesn't always follow quality.<br/><br/>Speaking of performances, this is one film where the actors dissolve into their characters better than most across the board. Matthew McConaughey acquits himself well as lawyer Baldwin, and Djimon Hounsou is riveting as the slave Cinque. I would have liked to see Morgan Freeman delivering more power to the story, but within the parameters he was given, he's solid as ever. The tour de force portrayal of course is given by Anthony Hopkins as former president John Quincy Adams, his speech before the Supreme Court is mesmerizing to help turn the tide for the slaves on trial. Brilliantly done.<br/><br/>It was also interesting to note how newspapers of the era were as editorially slanted as those of the present day. When we see the first pass of the New Haven newspaper regarding the slaves of the Amistad, the caption reads 'Massacre At Sea'. Quite different from the way sympathetic readers would eventually get to see it - 'Freedom Fight At Sea'. In all aspects, the film brilliantly conveys the innate resonance and power of language."

","I almost changed channels in the beginning 15 minutes or so of this movie, because it wasn't in English, and very few captions telling me what the actors were saying, but I hung in there, and the wait was worth it! This was the most gripping movie I've seen in years, and left me with the prayer ""Oh God, help us all!"" I was particularly shocked to find out that slavery was justified in the 1800's by someone's interpretation of bible sentences, namely that Eve was created from Adam's rib, therefore, Eve is slave to Adam. From that began the concept of slavery, but how it jumped from Eve to African Americans I don't understand! We all know that women are still held to a slavery mind-set, even over 100 years after the Civil War! What did the Civil War have to do with this thought? The winning of the trial in this movie sparked the Civil War.<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins was perfect for the part of President John Quincy Adams, and even though Morgan Freeman's role was less stellar, his mere presence on the set was absolutely binding for all the other actors. People captured as slaves back then were deemed less than equal, which this movie explicitly showed, especially when the ship tossed 50 people overboard, tied with a chain, because they didn't have enough food on board to feed them all during their passage to the United States.<br/><br/>I particularly liked Anthony Hopkins statement ""We are who we are only because of who we've been""."

His movies are always very well made. Some are made for pure entertainment, and some are made with entertainment and a message. Unfortunately, this movie is just a message. Now I'm not saying this movie is bad. Far from it. This movie is as well written and directed as all of Spielberg's films. It has a very noble message that's worth listening to, and it's very historically accurate. It's just that this movie isn't very entertaining. When I say that I mean that this isn't a movie that you say to yourself, ""I feel like watching Amistad"", and you invite some friends over and cook up some popcorn. You can't even watch this by yourself. It's a great docudrama for history class, and it's good to watch once just to see it.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is very good.

","I wish to comment about this movie mainly as someone who lived in Sierra Leone for three years. This movie contributed greatly to knowledge of even the existence of this country around the world and to the correct pronunciation of its name. Sadly the brutal civil war fought there and the reality of ""blood diamonds"" have also made Sierra Leone much better known today than when I lived there. Then the people of Sierra Leone were friendly, kind and welcoming. They were aware of the history of slavery mainly because of the small Krio population living in Freetown. The Krio were the returned slaves, the first group known as Nova Scotians because they were brought there by way of Nova Scotia. Though really a very small group, the Krio have a disproportionate influence in the country. The Krio language, what we often call pidgin English, is probably the most commonly spoken today. The movie tells of the tribal wars which were part of the history of the country and the slavery which existed throughout much of Africa. I did hear the few Mende words I remember during the movie. The handshake at the end of the movie is, in fact, the handshake used in Sierra Leone when I lived there."
"monimm18","6","0","3","5 August 2006"," Great story turned into melodrama
","I like Steven Spielberg's films, but I wish he would stick with action-adventure or sci-fi blockbusters. All his films with a serious subject or social connotation end up looking (some more than others) overdone, melodramatic, even redundant. <br/><br/>Take ""Amistad"": what a compelling story, yes? Simply telling it verbally would fill one with horror, revolt and compassion, then joy for its happy ending. While I respect Mr. Spielberg's choice and intentions, I found the film's execution a bit disappointing. I thought the acting was excellent (OK, Mr. McConaughey seemed a bit out of place to me), but the film overshot quite a bit. Too much added visual dramatism or heavy music, overpowering the film, accentuating its mood and telling the audience what to feel and think. The film attempts to tell a true to life story in an overly polished and enhanced way. Every dramatic scene is pushed to the max, with its details so obviously controlled and perfected that they turn into flaws.<br/><br/>There was one scene that almost annoyed me: Cinque and his people dressed in theatrically immaculate white clothes (lest anyone is still not clear who the innocent victims are in this story...) as they all stand proudly on the ship taking them home, watching the horizon with the dramatic dignity of a king and his royal entourage, while a large choir sings gloriously in the background. It looked more like an act from an opera than a scene from a film trying to depict a story realistically. <br/><br/>Really, Mr. Spielberg, no need to lay it that thick for the viewers. Most of them are smarter than you appear to believe, and would appreciate the chance to respond to the story without being beaten over the head and pointed the way with such vehemence. I am sure that would also make the film's experience more rewarding, intellectually. Sometimes less really is more.<br/><br/>Maybe big-budget is the kiss of death for serious dramas?"
"Guydude1","8","0","2","1 August 2006"," Good movie, but lost its focus
","I thought the movie was great, and had a lot of good qualities in regards to dialog, directing, acting, etc. But, to me, the movie seemed to have the fundamental flaw that almost all films about Africans, African-Americans, have. That is, the movie shifts its focus to the ""hero"" white man, who is one of the ""good ones"" that is out to help the black people. So much attention is given to that character in many of these movies, that I sometimes forget the movie is actually about a black man.<br/><br/>I think it is an unconscious decision many film makers make, because they feel guilty about slavery, and the oppression of black people; that they want to redeem themselves in someway by writing in a character who was just, and compassionate. I don't deny that white people like this did exist in that time, but that is not what the movies are originally about. If you want to make a movie about a good white guy, who did not listen to the racism of his era, then that is good. But if your movie is about a black man who was wrongfully oppressed in some way, then keep the movie about HIM.<br/><br/>Peace."

","What a lovely sentiment ""it is our right at birth"".....""sometimes it has to be taken"" is often the case. How tragic the countries in Africa are still slaughtering, enslaving their own citizens....breaking females' legs so they cannot escape during rape. Comparing ""Amistad"" with those current facts sends the message it's never changed, just how it's done and why. This film let us see the workings of our country when it was young.<br/><br/>I didn't read so many of the other comments, because I knew this movie is not widely-known. How sad that some thought it was a drag; it takes time to develop such a tragic plot. Although the beginning of it was gruesome, it had no explosions to color the screen. What colored the screen was the agony humans inflict on one another - it also wasn't important to me what other viewers thought of the film, because I've studied it enough to know my opinion will never change - it deserves a ""30"". I WAS surprised that Morgan Freeman got top billing over Hopkins; I'm a big fan of Freeman, but that's stretching it some. McConaughey was brilliant, as all were who played in the movie - cardboard characters, or not - The ""entertainers"" were just as important to the story as was Hopkins, whose soliloquy . I understood every word - the scenes between McConaughey and Hounsou were spell-binding. The ""Bible"" scene was particularly touching. ""Cinque"" may not have spoken English, but he certainly could discern the animosity in the early court-scenes:<br/><br/>""....give us free"".....broke my heart, because it is STILL a plea heard in today's world. The empathy between the lowly lawyer and the freed black man in The Supreme Court spoke volumes....the slaughter of the slaves by drowning came immediately to my mind. But, the most poignant of that topic was the young mother who silently slipped, with her baby, into the ocean.<br/><br/>After the fireworks of the destruction of the slave-fortress, and the ultimate happiness of the Mendes sailing home - only to learn their people have been sold into slavery - trumpets the criminal selling of females in The Mid-East into prostitution.<br/><br/>Spielberg has created a timeless, raceless masterpiece. Yes, every individual needs to see this movie, to understand that slavery of some kind is prevalent in every society. ""Amistad"" is a must-see for all."

","The first third of the movie is pretty exciting, loaded with dramatic special effects -- a storm at sea, stroboscopic lightning, butcher with a cutlass. The second act is interesting too and competently done. The 40-some captured Mende are introduced to New England culture, such as it was in 1839, and Spielberg does a nice job with language problems, misunderstandings, and the clash between the outraged and murderous big black guys on the one hand, and the psalm-singing shrunken white moralists on the other. The third act kind of loses steam and ultimately peters out in a series of trials -- three actually -- in which the blacks ultimately gain the freedom they'd lost in Sierra Leone.<br/><br/>I'll give one example each of the movie's strong points and weaknesses.<br/><br/>Djimon Hounsou is terrific as the lead would-be slave. He's an impressive physical presence, tall, muscular, brooding. When he's angry he booms and shouts and his eyes bulge slightly. He is every intimidated white person's nightmare come true. But that's his character. As an actor he's far more sly, and this is no one-note performance. He rarely smiles but when he is obviously pleased he looks out of the corners of his eyes, shyly, almost furtively, and it's touching. His Mende-ness, his ""other""-ness, is suggested just enough. He stands a little too close to the people he's dealing with, the way Mediterranean people do. And if it makes US a little uncomfortable just watching it, we can only imagine how the descendants of the Mayflower felt about this whole business. Close enough to smell each other! The Africans are treated as ordinary folks, which is pretty much what they are, allowing for cultural differences, and we get to see enough of the inhuman way they were treated by slavers to know the suffering they've been through. And that's about where the movie drops the ball. Spielberg and his writers don't really trust the audience enough to allow them understanding to this extent. The Africans, if not exactly ennobled by their horrors, are given dramatic scenes which are too many in quantity and too bald in their intent.<br/><br/>Hounsou -- in the middle of a trial in which his fate is being decided, carried on in a language he does not understand -- has to stand up in the docks raise his manacled fists and repeatedly shout, ""Give us FREE. Give us FREE!"" And in the denouement, when they are freed for the last time to return to Africa, Hounsou goes from white savior to white savior, eyes brimming with tears, while soupy music swells in the background, and clasps hands with each of them -- at length. (That last handclasp almost turns shockingly into a high-five.) It's not only unnecessary, it goes on way too long.<br/><br/>Well, I'll throw in another observation. Anthony Hopkins is John Quincy Adama, former President, by this time in his life course a curmudgeonly old geezer with a lot still on the ball. He only has two scenes -- an early introduction in which we see him perfunctorily giving orders to people trying to help him walk. (""Gimme a hand."" ""Leggo my arm."") And a later summary given to the court that once and for all ends the legal baloney. The speech isn't really well written. It doesn't say much, and what it says is not particularly gripping. But Hopkins' performance could not be improved upon. He's got the role down pat, even to the suggestion of a Boston accent. Not MUCH of a Boston accent, but no more than is necessary because, after all, in 1839 Bostonians may have sounded as much like their Brit ancestors as like Barney Frank.<br/><br/>The photography is great. The location shooting is good -- those dreary New England winters. Well worth seeing, despite the overdone moralizing."

","Amistad was a thought-provoking, intellectual film. Anthony Hopkins was at his finest with his fantastic speech, and Djimon Honsou was breathtaking...but I was rather disappointed with Matthew McConaughey's performance...I was under the impression that he fell rather flat and another, perhaps more dynamic actor would have better suited the hefty role he had to play.<br/><br/>My other problem was the fact that I felt Morgan Freeman was utterly wasted in this movie, with little screen time and fewer lines. True, his character didn't have much of a place to speak, him being a freed slave in Racist 19th Century America, so it is partially justified, but his overall impact as a character, which is usually so profound in his movies, simply wasn't there.<br/><br/>Overall though, I found the movie to be excellent.

Their struggle then continues in the court system of early America. Djimon Hounsou breaks out with what i thought to be an Oscar worthy performance. He plays the ring leader of the group of slaves. The cast also includes Matthew McConaughey, Morgan Freeman, and Anthony Hopkins. What lacks in acting by MCConaughey and Freeman is made up for with the performance of Anthony Hopkins. This graphic, and spirited epic is a must see. It's inner moral is to look at the inside of a person, not the outside. The trial of these Africans starts as a question of what they are. But is transformed into a tale of finding out WHO they are."

","As 'entertainment,' if you can call a movie dealing with the subject matter Amistad concerns itself with 'entertainment,' the film is very powerful. The problem I have in endorsing it as much I might want to is I'm not sure how much of the content is historically accurate and how much has been improvised for dramatic purposes. Anyhow the mutiny aboard the Amistad in 1839 (not that long ago when you think about it) and the subsequent trial of the insurrectionists made for compelling viewing. All of the principal actors were directed perfectly by master director Spielberg. For me, Anthony Hopkins' (such a superb actor) Adams is deserving of special praise. Down through the ages, all peoples have been subjected to the torment of bondage. Amistad powerfully tells the story of a group of Africans' struggle against their oppression."

It's not often that films like this get recognized, but they need to be. It was heartwrenching to see the horrible conditions of the ships and just the sheer cruelty of the slave traders. The intense violence was similar to Passion of the Christ, but not as gruesome. The point still got across though. It was great to see this true story being told. It hurts to see, but it's apart of U.S. history like this stupid movie that's coming out soon called the ALAMO is. I've got issues with that, but that's another commentary. This movie is beautiful cinematically and the actors are to be highly praised. This topic is not easy to portray. These people had to reach deep down inside themselves and their issues with society to tap into the deep resevoir of emotions this film needed. Djimon handled his character's sense of frustration, confusion, and impotence to the situation very well. I felt his emotions and that was necessary to watch the film. You can't help but become angry and happy that justice was attained. We need more movies like this if we're going to show historical movies. There's been a whitewashing of history and it needs to stop. Everyone's side should be told and not what the audience or Hollywood is comfortable seeing. We need the past to assess the future and this film shows that in abundance. It's sad that it wasn't more recognized (gee, what a surprise) and I truly think it was some of Stielberg's best work."

","Despite the stern warnings from ABC TV (even though it was an edited version), I did not see that the total amount of violence in this movie was anything to get alarmed about.  True, the violence was graphic and unsettling at two times during the movie, once at the very beginning and once about halfway through.  The second set of violent scenes certainly exceeded the first for brutality.  How anyone could treat other human beings as slave traders treated these Africans is beyond me.  Still, I can't say that this movie did for slavery what ""Schindler's List"" did for the Holocaust.  This is, in fact, primarily a movie about a murder trial and about the debate over the nature of slavery and how it relates to the specifics of this case.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the movie, Africans being held captive manage to revolt and take over a slave ship.  Six weeks later, they are captured and taken to the United States to be tried for murder. A free black man named Joadson, who the Africans consider to be 'a white man' because he dresses and acts like whites, goes to Washington to get Congressman John Quincy Adams to help with the cause.  Adams declines, not once but several times.  Eventually a<br/><br/>lawyer named Baldwin agrees to represent the Africans, believing that they cannot be tried for murder because they are merely property.  The murder trial begins with several requests to decide not guilt or innocence, but what should be done with the Africans.  The teenage queen Isabella II of Spain has a claim, as do owners of a Cuban plantation.  Meanwhile, the outcome of the case worries President Martin Van Buren, who is told he can have an influence and thereby help himself to be re-elected, and possibly even prevent civil war.<br/><br/>One problem for the Africans:  none of them speak English, and at first, no one can be found who speaks their language.  A free black man who happens to belong to their tribe is found and serves as a translator.  During the testimony at the trial, we see flashbacks of the capture of Cinque and others, and of the brutal treatment they receive.<br/><br/>Whether or not it was historically accurate, this movie was well made. For the first fifteen minutes, no one speaks English, and subtitles are used only when absolutely necessary.  We are challenged, but it makes the movie more realistic.  Plenty of actors give fine performances, especially Djimon Hounsou as Cinque, who comes across as dignified and serious when being mistreated, positively terrifying when he feels he must strike back, and reserved but pleasant when he knows people are helping him.  Cinque probably shows what Africans are really like and how we should have been treating them as humans worthy of respect.  Anthony Hopkins gives one of his best performances as well, quite eloquent as the former president of the United States who has a chance to make a difference.  Matthew McConaughey and Morgan Freeman also do quite well.<br/><br/>Believe it or not, there is comedy in this movie (and how could there not be, with Spielberg in charge?).  The Africans do not trust the white people who are on their side, and not being able to speak the language, they cannot tell what is going on.  So several of them accuse the people on their side of being no better than 'dung scrapers'.  Adams, on the other hand, falls asleep frequently in Congress, and he is accused of doing so in the movie. Adams, in fact, provides most of the funny lines.<br/><br/>Some of the best scenes are the ones where Cinque and his translator finally make a connection and make clear the intentions of Baldwin and the others. The debates over the morality of slavery and about what should be done with the Africans appear to have been well-researched and well-written, though I don't know enough to say they are historically accurate.  The violent scenes on the slave ships appeared realistic and carefully done, in order to give us the right impression.  One thing I found curious:  African blacks are dark-skinned.  Most, if not all, of those pushed overboard were light-skinned, which would indicate some white ancestry.<br/><br/>This is definitely a movie worth seeing for educational reasons, but it is not for the squeamish.  A person could, however, see a tape and fast-forward through the difficult parts and still be left with a worthwhile experience.<br/><br/>******************SPOILERS*****************<br/><br/>Adams did, in fact, finally agree to represent the Africans after the government appealed a verdict in the Africans' favor.  It was a real pleasure to watch the Africans celebrate their freedom, though later Cinque found it quite confusing how the American system of justice could work so strangely.  The conversations between Adams and Cinque, and later the eloquent speech by Adams before the Supreme Court, were among the movie's best moments."

","Spoiler, perhaps?  After ripping movie-goers off with The Lost World, Steven Spielberg tosses out a less-then-fulfilling flick, this time in the guise of Amistad. True story: in the summer of 1839, Cinque (Djimon Hounsou) and fifty-some Africans aboard the Spanish slave ship La Amistad break free of their shackles, kill the crew, take control of the ship and reclaim their freedom, hoping to return to Africa.  However, without any navigational skills, the Africans bank on two surviving members of the original crew.  Too bad, because after two months, an American naval ship captures the Amistad and the Africans are charged for murder and piracy. OK, now you've got fifty Africans who don't speak English or Spanish, an abolitionist named Theodore Joadson (Morgan Freeman) who just stands around, a young real-estate lawyer named Roger Baldwin (Matthew McConaughey) and pro-slavery President Martin Van Buren (Nigel Hawthorne), who only wants to appease the South.  Mix them together and you've got a typical `good versus evil' Speilberg film.  And let me tell you something, ole Stevie sure has a hard-on for these dastardly, `I'm-an-immoral-symbol-of-everything-that's-wrong-with-America-and-the-system' villains: Amistad maintains that white people are generally evil, just as ET and Jurassic Park painted humans capitalistic and exploitive and Schindler's List made everyone who wasn't Jewish in the 40s `bad.'  Hell, even The Color Purple made an argument that most black men were ignorant and irresponsible.  In other words, enough is enough!!  Speilberg, one of the world's most talented film-makers, has succumbed to making carbon-copy connect-the-dots movies, and gloats in the disappointing results. Schindler's List was both suspenseful and amazing, but why re-make it (as another giant turning point in American history).  Next, Speilberg can make a version for the Native-Americans, then one for the Irish, then one for Croatians and maybe when he's done, he'll get back to making movies again. If creating a film of this magnitude, why not focus on Dredd Scott or Nat Turner stories. The movie isn't un-watchable by any means, and Spielberg pulls some strong and shocking scenes out of his bag of tricks, but we've seen this stuff before.  Highlights include Anthony Hopkins (as former President John Quincy Adams  the film's hero) and his great eleven-minute court-room speech, as well as the performances from Djimon Hounsou and  Matthew McConaughey (in his best role).

"atlasfalcon","7","0","1","17 May 2003"," Yes, it's worth seeing. But a masterpiece?
","There are many reasons to watch Amistad.  It's visually perfect and tackles interesting historical questions.  But the film is also seriously flawed. Like too many other films which are about the Black Experience in America, the film stars almost exclusively white actors in the key roles.  Take another look at how you might describe the cast of the film:  ""Amistad is a film about black history, starring Matthew McConaughey, Anthony Hopkins, Nigel Hawthorne, Pete Postlethwaite, Stellan Starsgard, oh, and Morgan Freeman and Djimon Hounsou and a bunch of other slaves whose names are not important.""<br/><br/>As far as the plot goes, the flashback scene depicting the wretched nature of slave ships is the most compelling in the film, if not one of the most compelling scenes in film history.  Unfortunately, this scene is in the dead center of the film.  You first have to watch preparation for trial, which is nowhere near as interesting as what follows.  There should have been much more from the Africans' point of view, right from the beginning.  Also, having one token slave character (Hounsou) almost trivializes the whole point.<br/><br/>Of the acting, Hopkins is likeable but very silly as former president J.Q. Adams, approaching senility (rapidly).  McConaughey is just unlikeable.  The role (the token role in which someone has to learn and become a changed man) is a bit beyond him.  Hounsou is likeable, but his character is all wrong. Being the only ""Important Slave,"" he has to carry any and all issues that the slaves confront in the first and final thirds of the film.  The would-be cathartic scene in which he repeatedly shouts ""Gives us free!"" [sic] in pidgin English is manipulative and almost insulting (or funny).  But he did the best with what he had to work with.<br/><br/>It should not be taken from this review that Spielberg intentionally made a ""racist"" film.  There are problems that go beyond him -- most notably in the script.  It doesn't need to be said that he is a masterful director.  But, as such, he should have caught some oversights that prevent the film from being as powerful and intelligent as it could have been.  In essence, this is not the equal of ""Schindler's List"" or even ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" Rather, it's an example of a good film by a brilliant director... that could have been so much more."
"mike paines","Null","0","1","9 May 2003"," A mixed bag
","Opening with a deceptively fast-paced and violent scene of African slaves escaping their chains aboard ship and brutally murdering nearly all the crew during a thunderstorm, Amistad has plenty of moments.  The scenes of sweaty escape and merciless slaughter are lit only by flashes of blue lightning, with lashing rain and minimal incidental music (spare us John Williams!), which lend a horror movie sensibility.  I get the impression that Spielberg was attempting to ally our sympathies with the Spanish crew rather than the slaves at the start, but anyone with any knowledge of the real life case or of 19th century slavery will not be fooled. And in fact Spielberg pulls no punches, not just with the opening sequence, but also with the flashback depiction of slavery life.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the majority of the film focuses on the legal work and courtroom scenes, and could have benefited from more time spent with the slaves awaiting their trial - but I guess this would have slowed the film's pace further.<br/><br/>And the pace is a little out of the ordinary, as we are lead to believe that the abolitionists have won, only to have another 30 minutes of appeal hearings and a rather tedious speech by Anthony Hopkins' character about the importance of our ancestors on our current lives - a little obscure, and a bit meandering considering the direction the material was previously taken.<br/><br/>However, there are many things to admire - not just the incredible cast (Hopkins, Matthew McConaughey, Morgan Freeman, Nigel Hawthorne and Pete Postlethwaite among many), but the acting, in particular Djimon Hounsou."
"johnrobie","Null","0","1","30 March 2003"," Perhaps Spielberg's most underrated film.
","As a lifelong scholar and fan of Steven Spielberg's work, I'm always stunned that his 1997 film Amistad is never given the kudos it so richly deserves. Perhaps the films was 'lost', as it was made and released in-between the twin giants of the popcorn friendly Lost World and the more socially conscious Saving Private Ryan - a film Amistad resembles closely in terms of tone and style.  Amistad does not represent the popular Spielberg of ET, Jurassic Park or Jaws, rather the work of a mature film-maker, whose boyish preoccupations have given way to a thoughtful, politically astute adult who - in spite of what many of his critics say - isn't afraid of tackling darker themes.<br/><br/>Following the real-life plight of a group of African slaves who, in 1839 committed violent mutiny aboard the eponymous Spanish slave ship, Amistad is unlike anything Spielberg has done before.  Only the similarly adult and underrated Empire of the Sun and The Color Purple (which also deals with issues of race and freedom) share such social and political concerns.  The freedom of the slaves, represented by their hugely powerful leader Cinque (an almost wordless yet towering Djimon Hounsou) is bitterly contested by their Spanish ""owners"" and the Americans who salvaged the ship. With the help of two anti-slavery campaigners, Theodore Joadson (the always brilliant Morgan Freeman), Lewis Tappan (Stellan Skarsgard) and idealistic property lawyer Roger Baldwin (an excellent Matthew McConaughey) the slaves case eventually engages the the services of former President John Quincy Adams (a masterful Anthony Hopkins), who argues brilliantly on their behalf in the Supreme Court.<br/><br/>During the trial of the slaves, Spielberg shows us their capture in Africa and subsequent horrific journey to Africa aboard La Amistad in unflinching detail.  The  brutality and sense of injustice one feels as we watch slaves being drowned by their captors is as powerful as anything in Schindler's List.  The cinematography, by Janusz Kaminski, is stunning throughout, leaving permanent images in the mind - the slaves drowning in the water, Cinque literally trying to swim back to Africa rather than face capture and the stunning opening mutiny set-piece.  There are none of the huge, sweeping camera moves that we usually associate with Spielberg in Amistad; instead, he employs an almost static camera throughout (albeit with beautiful lighting) - the better to focus on the human drama.<br/><br/>Every performance in the film is exemplary, the screenplay (by David Franzoni) literary, intelligent and compassionate.  Overall, Amistad adds up to one of the best films Spielberg has ever directed.  The fact that it is not more widely known is criminal - hopefully it will be rediscovered, reassessed and given the acclaim it deserves.  If you are even remotely interested in American history, slavery, African-American issues, Steven Spielberg or just great cinema, you really must see Amistad.  One of the greatest - and most underrated - films about freedom ever made."

I have no idea why this saga was completely left out in my high school or even college textbooks.  That's a lesson in and of itself.<br/><br/>Especially considering that this was the first time most people had even heard of the event, I think Amistad is a solid and thought-provoking film.

","""The movie was much better than i expected.  Morgan Freeman was hardly used but believable even though I don't think any black man at that time could put his 2 cents worth in without white people's permission (with exception of people like George Washington Carver and the likes.. but they were rural and contributed to literature and agriculture..never legal issues).  I liked how he showed american blacks avoiding contact with the africans. I liked how he didn't use much narration and chose visual language instead to show the slave ship, probably the most powerful part of the movie. The one thing i really didn't care for and it was totally totally false historically speaking was in making the English look like they were anti-slavery, anti-emperialists, blah blah blah. False false false. Why the hell did he have to do that? The shot of the ship's masts symbolizing crosses...that was annoying. Plus the Bible sub plot.. did we really need to see that...does Speilberg think the viewer will see more humanity in the Africans because they read the Bible? Overall I'm impressed more with the story, that this actually happened and that we haven't heard this story in school. Did John Qunicy Adams really give a speech in front of the supreme court defending a boat full of Africans? Did the supreme court, 9 of which are slave owners really accept his arguments? I can't believe it and the fact that this fact is unknown is amazing. Today, 1 out of 4 africans are dying from aids and we still pump money to Israel and everywhere else. The world on a whole hardly gives a damn about Africans today. Yet in 1836 they bothered to set sail a ship to send 40 Africans back home. I still think Speilberg should stick to comedy adventures."" ----------- My reply to her was, ""I don't know, I kind of liked it."" 8 out of 10."

"h_proudfoot","10","0","1","5 August 2000"," It touches me, plain and simple
","I'm no expert on moviemaking or what separates a good movie from a brilliant one; this particular film just gets to me every time I watch it. On so many levels I feel that tug on my heart, and that feeling of pure awe that comes over me when I am swept away by a tale of such magnitude as that of the Amistad Africans. This movie is a reminder of not only the true atrocities of our human nature, but of the ultimate perseverance of our humanity, of what makes us who we are, of a spirit that is unheard, yet undiminished. It is a saddening, yet powerful experience for me.<br/><br/>That Djimon Hounsou didn't get nominated for every award on the planet, including the most recognized Academy Award baffles me. His performance in this film is the most dynamic portrayal of any role I have ever seen. Breathtakingly powerful. I don't know of any other performance in my lifetime that even comes close. His dedication to the role is enough to garner my unwavering admiration. He learned Mende, Cinque's spoken tongue, for the film, and when listening to him speak, he does it with such a superb natural timing that it is hard to imagine it isn't the language he grew up withe. That is talent, plain and simple. The supporting cast, as well, is superb. Anthony Hopkins completely transforms into his character until there is nothing of him left, except for his abilities. Morgan Freeman may just be the most talented actor on the planet. He never fails to give a less than stellar performance, and his role in Amistad is flawless. Although, I believe his character should have been more vital to the story and less of a supporting player. He was criminally underutilized. That fact is my only grievance with the movie. The rest I find impeccable. The rest of the cast, Stellan Skarsgard, Nigel Hawthorne, Jeremy Northam, Razaaq Adoti, Anna Paquin, Pete Postlethwaite, and even Matthew McConaughey, all play out there roles with a defining authenticity that I find lacking in many recent historical dramas. Bringing a true story to life means disaster for some films, but this one does a remarkable job of remaining a good film behind the historical facts it is based on.<br/><br/>There are two particular scenes in the film that bring me to tears every time I see them: the first is one where Cinque is telling John Quincy Adams of his ancestors. The second is probably the most beautifully scripted speech in recent history, and Hopkin's delivery is graceful and eloquent, near perfection. This movie may not have all the right elements to make it a critical success, but it has what it takes to affect my way of thinking, my outlook on life, and my hope that the human spirit will always remain unconquerable, will always triumph over those who would deny it freedom."

Hey, get real, complaining about that is pretty petty considering it was probably a little more annoying for the real men who had to be tried for their freedom twice then for you sitting on your ass.<br/><br/>A more reasonable complaints would be that Morgan Freeman is wasted in a role that's a static copy of the roles he always plays.  Another problem is the once African taken into the British Navy who translates for them.  His style is way too nineties-cool-black-dude, the actor who plays him is not very good and clips of him whispering the captives victory chants and sailing back to Africa with them are unecessary and inaccurate respectively.<br/><br/>That said, the good stuff totally out weighs the bad thanks in large part to Djimon Hounsou who is just really damn good.  You will be blown away, enough said.  Another guy worth watching is the British Naval Officer who is a dead-cool-hard-ass.

","The confusion that can arise when two separate parties cannot communicate is studied superbly in Steven Spielberg's ""Amistad"". Though Spielberg superbly presents us with a wholely-coherent 15-minute opening sequence devoid of English language, the rest of the movie is about the importance of communication. There is a wonderful scene between Matthew McConnoughey as the lawyer Baldwin and Djimoun Hounsou as the slave Cinque where each speaks their own language, but without knowing it they enact a conversation (""How can I find out where you come from?"" McConnoughey asks, to which Hounsou responds in his native Mende, ""You want to know where I come from..."")<br/><br/>There are also many moments in the movie when we are made aware of how a single word can change the meaning of a statement. Baldwin asks a jury ""Do you know the difference between a bear and a brick? a pole-cat and a president?"" in an attempt to raise awareness of the fact that the origin of the slaves is so important to how they are to be treated. Even the word slave is questioned - the Mende translator points out that in Mende, the word for slave is closer to meaning ""worker"". The pay-off from this is that the slaves' prosecutor (Pete Postlethwaite)responds ""what is the difference?"" <br/><br/>The key point being made in Amistad is that history has been ruled by too many people who were not prepared to understand -- in this movie we see President Martin Van Buren tuning his harp while a slave fortress is destroyed, and we see Queen Isabella jumping on her bed whilst Civil War breaks out. Figures of authority have the finger pointed at them in this movie, and it is right this should be so. This is a movie about truth.<br/><br/>
The ending is very hollow. Do not allow the upbeat music to fool you - instead, watch for Anthony Hopkins as John Quincy Adams as he grimaces at the empty court. Though the slaves are freed at the end of the movie, there is a real sense that it should never have taken place. As we watch Cinque and his fellow Mende return home, it is difficult to feel anything at all except hatred of the negative nature of man."

","I agree with an earlier comment entered for ""Amistad"".  Many moviegoers, it seems, simply want to be ""entertained"" rather than inspired or undergo some provoking of thought. The time setting of ""Amistad"" is 1839,not the 1940's, which is the time of ""Schindler's List"", but the subject matter should be no less important to us.  The wrenching scenes in Amistad, of slaves being thrown overboard, and the inspiring scenes, of idealistic New England abolitionists carrying their torches are admirably portrayed.  The somewhat gloomy settings are very appropriate, but none of this is ""entertaining"", it is ""inspiring.""   ""Schindler's List"", also powerful, is ""provoking"" not ""entertaining"", and might we not also say the same thing for ""Finding Private Ryan.""

","Well-done legal story, using strong performances to tell a compelling story. Not as emotionally gripping or moving as ""Schindler's List,"" but Spielberg does a better job this time of telling the story of the victims - here the slaves - than he did in his Oscar-winning Holocaust epic, which so obscured the identity of the Jews that I couldn't tell them apart (except for the Ben Kingsley character, and maybe the maid).<br/><br/>   Here, Spielberg explores the slaves with a ten-minute opening sequence that depicts the bloody 1839 uprising aboard the ironically named Spanish slave ship La Amistad (it means friendship). In addition, the depiction of the ""middle crossing"" is a great piece of filmmaking: the 15 some-odd minutes, right in the middle of the film, are seen in flashback, and they are pure, gripping cinema. Cinque (played by Djimon Hounsou), the slave who led the uprising, tells the brutal story of his abduction and sale into slavery, and when he speaks passionately of the inhuman conditions onboard the ship that brought him to the New World, he invests the story with a human quality that the more restrained ""List"" didn't.<br/><br/>   Unfortunately, Spielberg's efforts to construct the legal case fail resoundingly. Much of the problem lies in the nature of the raw material. The Amistad rebels want only to return to Africa, but are betrayed by their Spanish navigators and wind up in the U.S. There they're put on trial for murder and thrust into the middle of a thorny political and philosophical debate with far-reaching implications for the already-fragile union between slave-owning and non-slave-owning states.<br/><br/>   Somehow, the trial court judge and jury are dismissed by President Van Buren (Nigel Hawthorne) - how this is done is never addressed, and that is a major failing in a film that purports to tell the story of the Amistad as essentially a story of jurisprudence: a textbook illustration of the way the American legal system can, even under inauspicious circumstances, sometimes do exactly what it's meant to do. So just how does the head of the executive branch dismiss a member of an independent judiciary?<br/><br/>   Moreover, the case begins - quite rightly - as a property case, but somehow turns into a human rights issue. What happened to the winning property rights arguments along the way is never quite explained."

To say, however, that this film is flawed for either one of these reasons is totally missing the point. <br/><br/>Why is it that we can tolerate and even praise the over 3 hours of Schindler's List with it's equally depressing and just as vivid depiction of it's subject matter, but are more than willing to find fault with this one? I have noticed that most of the film critics with any notariety tend to be middle-aged white men. I don't want to make generalist statements, but could we somehow be embarrassed by events of that time period just as a German citizens might be embarrassed by the events in ""Schindler's List""?<br/><br/>Whatever the cause of the Civil War (state's rights, economic factors,etc.)slavery will always remain the main cause in the minds of most Americans. Largely because today the differences between the different types of people in this country remains still the bone of contention. Who is meant in the Declaration of Independence as the men who are created equal? <br/><br/>Artistically, it is a beautifully shot film. The detail in this film is incredible. It is a wonderfully acted and directed film. Anthony Hopkins especially turns in a wonderful performance. There is a famous photograph of John Quincy Adams at the end of his life and Hopkins brings this photo to life as if Adams had stepped out of it.

This is very poorly made drama that lacks any depth or emotional punch.  <br/><br/>Generally I don't like Spielberg movies as they're quite childish and are aimed at a broad audience, but then along came Schindlers List', which in my opinion was handled brilliantly.   I then heard about Amistad and expected more of the same, but I was very disappointed.<br/><br/>All the characters were cardboard stereotypes of what people should be like. The performance by Mathew McConaughey was a repeat of his performance in a A Right to Kill' and seemed very unbelievable.  The only performance with any credit was the excellent Hopkins who brought some drama and believability to his character.  The token black, Morgan Freeman, seemed to just pop up every so often and didn't really add anything.<br/><br/>Because of the bad direction and acting even the horror scene's lacked any emotion and just appeared as a sequence of melodramatic typical slave scenes.<br/><br/>A strange film with no real point, badly made, unbelievable and surprisingly unmoving."
"MarioB","7","0","2","15 August 1999"," The third best spielberg movie
","Sometimes, this movie is very loud! As loud as the horrible music score.  Sometimes, there is too much of anything in it. I hate the scene where young Spanish Queen bouncing on her bed!  At that time, royal kids had a sense of their royal behaviors and social roles for their country!  But for me, this is the third best Spielberg movie of all time, after Schindler's list and Color Purple. Why? Because it don't steal anything from old Hollywood movie (like in this Private Ryan thing). The subject of the movie had not been seen around.  So that's why I like it. It had a certain sense of sincerity."

","An excellent, moving, very graphic and inspiring film. Highly underrated when it was released. Should have won the majority of awards that Titanic unjustly won. The whole cast does a great job - Hopkins, McConnaughey, Hounsou, Freeman & co. The music is excellent, I rushed out and bought a copy immediately. The scenes shown on board the ship are realistic and shocking. Spielberg is so good whatever area he tries to tackle. This is  definitely a must-see and should be hailed as one of the classics of its time."

","This movie was absolutely beautiful.  The acting and the moods were perfect. Once again, Anthony Hopkins makes a stage-stealing performance.  This movie was so touching, and moving.  It makes you wonder how we could have treated people like that for so long.  I think that this movie finally puts slavery in its place.  Not to mention...this film has a wonderful soundtrack!<br/><br/>Definitely one of the best films of its kind."

","AMISTAD Amistad is one of the last films directed by Steven Spielberg. This film wasn't very successful even if it was very expensive. The actors gave a great performance, especially Matthew McConaughey (Baldwin), and Djimon Hounson (Cinqué) that played their role very well. Amistad is a very good film because it has many surprising coups de théatre and significant performances. Alessandro Cassanelli, Manuele Covili, Simone Venturi"

","In this movie, the director tries to capture the emotions of the movie watcher. The costumes are a bit overdone, but the directing, the script and the acting of this movie are all spectacular. Morgan Freeman, Djmon Hansou and Anthony Hopkins all put up very strong performances towards this great tale of slavery and survival during the mid 19th century.The picture and the cinematography are so well done in fact, I actually felt I was present in the movie. It is a masterpiece with a touch of class."
"Picard-20","Null","0","2","26 March 1999"," a bad movie full of historical errors
","The movie 'Amistad' is really disappointing. It is completely full of historical errors and things that make the whole plot unbelievable. Let me just take some examples: the ship Amistad shows a strange flag which is not the Spanish one but some 'variation' on it (four alternative gold-red horizontal bands) while the present Spanish flag (three red-gold-red horizontal bands, with the central golden band twice the width of the red ones) had been in use aboard ships since the end of the XVIII century. Later, we see that child queen of Spain (Isabel II) giving orders to some military prime minister (let's assume that it was General Espartero, which is not accurate either) when she was in her minor age until several years after the Amistad incident. In those times the regency was held by the Queen mother, Maria Cristina, and later by Espartero himself. Well, I could go on, for example with the whole treatment of the process before the US Supreme Court and the role of Quincey Adams. Too much american-style sentimentalism and too little historical accuracy. Mr. Spielberg does not know how to do a historical movie without inducing tears in the public. It would be very good if he could devote his time to produce adventure movies like the series of Indiana Jones, in which he and his script writers do not expose their sloppiness and/or ignorance."
"U2fl","Null","0","3","5 August 1998"," Peanutbutter and The End Of Slavery
","In Holland we used to have a commercial for peanut butter. A little boy was shown riding his bicycle against the wind and, while taking a break, eating a sandwich with peanut butter. Here comes this man driving by, telling him to keep up the good nourishment so that one day he will grow up strong enough to win the Tour de France. Punchline of the commercial: 'Twenty years later Joop Zoetemelk won the Tour de France' plus the brand name and logo of the peanut butter company.<br/><br/>After watching Amistad I had the same feeling that something wasn't right. That the filmmakers were suggesting a link between two separate moments in history that wasn't there. After all: the Amistad-incident took place well over twenty years before the Civil War started. This means that virtually everyone we see in the film will have died before the first rifleshot in the War  that ended slavery in North-America was even fired. Suggesting a direct causality between the two events seems ridiculous."

"Pelrad","9","0","1","23 March 1999"," strikingly beautiful sets and costumes
","""Amistad's"" strength is in its portrayal of the horrible treatment of the Sierra Leone Africans who are illegally captured for slaves in the 19th century.  The film is gilded by the strikingly beautiful sets and costumes where even ""Doctor Zhivago"" pales in comparison. The photography was more than stunning. However, the film is slightly marred by the somewhat empty performances by the Americans in the film who lack emotion and engaging dialogue, and the film doesn't unfold as smoothly as one would expect from a Spielberg creation. These negative elements have caused many critics to give ""Amistad"" only a ""good"" review. I feel that the film, as a whole, however, is not pulled back from excellent status to that extent. I give Amistad 9/10 (Very Good)."
"sloughflux","10","0","1","22 March 1999"," Better than Saving Private Ryan
","I'm amazed at how little mention this film gets. I'm amazed that Spielberg himself puts this film down. This film is very clear; its themes are reachable. It has images in it as captivating as any Spielberg has done. Anthony Hopkins is amazing, and his speech at the end will send shivers down your spine. There is the beautiful scene of Hounsou and McConaughey character's communicating perfectly in languages the other doesn't know. It's about the essence of justice, injustice, passion, differences, samenesses, ignorance, greed...One of my favorite movies."
"ILM","Null","0","1","17 February 1999"," A true remembrance film by Steven Spielberg
","First of all, let's get one thing straight. This movie, and the event itself, was not about freedom of slaves in America over an American issue, but instead about whether slaves on a Spanish vessel were illegally captured or if they were what lawyers in the film called ""livestock"" in the Spanish Empire when they killed all but a few of the boat-masters. The film portrays this and then the morality of slavery in an unobtrusive way. As Steven Spielberg often does. And that is what makes this movie such a great one. That and John William's masterpicial score, which I believe should have gotten at least a nomination, if not an Oscar itself. There are several things that are underrated, such as Djimound Honsu's unforgettable performance as the leader of the slaves. The drama and ghastliness of the shipboard treatment of the slaves. There is only one disappointment and that is Matthew McConaheys performance, while not bad but not as good as it could have been. However, if that was the way that it really was, then so be it. In all, the movie can compare to any of Spielberg's greats."

I was glad that my husband didn't watch it with me because I was able to cry freely. I loved the movie, but,  I hated the way the people were treated on the ship and off. I was raised to like everyone and hate no one and I do live that way. Everyone that was involved in this movie did a geat job and I thank and applaud them."
"Ike-18","10","0","1","13 February 1999"," Spielberg's Amistad is beautiful in every way!
","I have long been a fan of the movies put out by Steven Spielberg.  Lately, he has taken true historical events and turned them into such captivatingly beautiful movies that none can compare.  What Spielberg did for the Holocaust in Schindler's List, and WWII in Saving Private Ryan, he did with our terrible past of slavery in Amistad.  While this movie was not hailed by critics far and wide, and was actually considered unsuccessful, those who understand what truly makes a movie and a beautiful story will see the power of Amistad.  As usual, the directing is emotional and heart-wrenching and the cinematography is beautiful.  The acting on all accounts is wonderful and captivates the essence of the time.  The actual story of the Amistad, slavery, and the personal view through Cinque is powerfully moving.  This is a movie not to be missed that pack an emotional punch for any who watch it. But do not expect much action.  It is purely drama, and the story's power lies in the words, expressions, and actions of the actors who make it up. It will really make you think.  Truly one of the most beautiful movies I've seen, once again, Spielberg has proven himself to be the master of putting the human spirit on the silver screen."
"Paddy-14","Null","0","1","31 January 1999"," worthy, but not what it could have been
","Right, first things first, this is not meant to be ""Schindler's List"". There is no way that Spielberg could give the same emotional power and dedication. It is a shame, as ""Schindler"" was a great film, Amistad is not. Although it is another issue movie, it doesn't have the same power, the same emotion.<br/><br/>One of things that i asked myself was why should this film have been made by a largely white production set up and cast. Surely this would merely create the myth that africans needed white support in order to have what was rightly theirs. I would agree that the primary african lead was superb, but it all seemed overly contrived. Maybe this film should have been made by a different set up, after all Schindler was very much Spielberg's story, but amistad?<br/><br/>I have to say that it was entertaining, but Hopkins was slightly hammy, then again, he always is. McChonnahay was good again, and Morgan Freeman was understated. The trouble was, I don't think that it was meant to be entertaining, at least not at the outset of the film. I feel that is was an issue movie gone wrong. Films such as ""Silkwood"" and Schindler"" were powerful, and long lasting. I saw those films and felt sick, they were so gut wrenchingly powerful. I left Amistad laughing at the ironic portrayal of a Royal Naval Captain.  ""Ensign, take a note....""<br/><br/>It's a shame the Spielberg's film did not have the accuracy of the Royal Navy's gunnery officer, otherwise, he might have made another schindler's list, as it was, he was quite a long way off target."
"Al-128","10","0","1","14 January 1999"," Must prejudice and politics rule the Academy?
","Either the members of the Academy just failed to see this movie, or they had an axe to grind.  Djimon Hounsou did as great a job of acting in ""Amistad"" as Dustin Hoffman did in ""Rain Man"" or as Jack Nicholson did in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"".  And how could they nominate ""The Full Monty"" and not nominate ""Amistad""?<br/><br/>The marketing people missed a great poster shot in the movie with Djimon Hounsou at the wheel of the ship in a night-time shot against the stars.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie, buy it, rent it, steal it, do what ever you have to, but see it.  You will never forget it."

"Rumples","7","0","2","6 December 1998"," Classy 'historical' movie
","I was impressed with this movie for a number of reasons, the cast, the story, and the underlying themes to name a few. I must say I was not aware that it was a Spielberg show until the end credits and was a bit surprised, however the themes are true Spielberg and, as has been mentioned before, parallels are bound to be drawn with other films like ""Schindler's List"". History - much has been said about historical inaccuracies. While I understand this disappointment, in the end this is a movie - entertainment - and some licence is bound to be taken. But if we are considering what the movie is not, I wonder if the reaction would have been the same if the 'baddies' had not been foreign males. How about a slave uprising on a plantation with white, genteel, American planters and women? The common cry of freedom echoes strongly for blacks/African Americans, Jews, and other minorities in a country tht was supposedly based on tolerance and liberty, but has a long and 'proud' history of intolerance and oppression. In the end, this is a stylish movie with a moving theme, and well packaged and delivered. Worth watching, 7/10"

","A great film. Phenomenal cinematography - incredible story.  I never learned about this one in history class and should have.  The film stirred feelings of pride in an American politician which is difficult for me these days. Was slightly disappointed in Anthony Hopkins as John Quincy Adams.  Personal preference - I love his more powerful roles and was expecting more. However, where did the Djimon Hounsou come from and more important where is he going?  He was unforgettable as the leader of the kidnapped Africans. He should have gotten the Oscar! NO CONTEST."
