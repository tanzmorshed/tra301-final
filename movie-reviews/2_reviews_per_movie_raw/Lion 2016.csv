","It's the story of my life. I was born in Bangalore in 1983 and I was adopted by an Italian family when I was almost two years old. My father told me that the nuns found me on the street, and they took me to an orphanage in Solur. My father made a very difficult journey to come and get me and we stayed a month in India before returning to Italy. unfortunately I do not remember anything of that world and for me it will be very difficult to understand where I was born but one day I will come back. I have to go back
This film change my life.."
"moviewizguy","9","399","449","19 October 2016"," Not just another Oscar bait movie
","Do you know the feeling you get when you go into a film with no expectations at all or thinking it might be decent, and the film turns out to not only be good, but blows you away by how amazing it ends up being? That's LION, and if you've been watching films for several years like me thinking you've seen everything committed to cinema, it's a fantastic feeling to be proved wrong.<br/><br/>Let me explain to you exactly what I experienced while watching LION: Almost half of the film is in Hindi, which lends incredible authenticity to the story, not that BS where they have actors in which English is their second language speak English for the sake of sparing the American audience from reading subtitles (I'm looking at you, MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA, and every other Hollywood movie ever made). In fact, the entire first act takes place in India, where about 40 minutes of the film rides on the shoulders of a first time child actor – played by the wonderful Sunny Pawar – and it's one of the best first acts I've seen in years. Think of it like the silent first act of Wall-E; it feels like it can be its own film, yet the filmmakers do a great job connecting the story once Dev Patel comes on screen.<br/><br/>On top of that, the filmmaking is impressive. The script is fantastic, the cinematography is lush, the soundtrack complements the film really nicely, and the pacing is on point where it rarely feels like it's dragging, despite the story taking place over the course of 25 years. Every actor in here is also terrific in their roles. As stated earlier, Sunny Pawar makes a compelling lead for the first third of the film. If Oscars were given to kid actors, he would have a damn good chance at winning one. For the last two thirds, Dev Patel more than carries the rest of the film, giving an emotionally naked performance worthy enough to top his role in SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE. Finally, Rooney Mara, Nicole Kidman, and David Wenham are ace, despite all of them having limited screen time.<br/><br/>In a time where diversity is being talked about more in the film industry, LION makes a compelling case for having diversity in storytelling. It's not about a guy meeting his girlfriend's parents for the first time. It's not about a group of friends going in a cabin in the woods. It's not even about a guy/girl struggling with the death of his/her father/mother/son/daughter/dog. No, LION is a personal story unique to South Asians growing up in India, and it's refreshing and easily one of the best films the year has to offer. Don't dismiss this as yet another Oscar bait movie put out by the Weinstein Company – it probably is one. But the film is much more than that. With a distinct vision from director Garth Davis, LION offers an enthralling story that deserves to be seen by everyone."

","Lion is based on a true story that is both incredibly uplifting and heartbreaking. Don't watch any trailers - go in blind. This film is a must-see."
"FelixFelicis","8","229","269","15 September 2016"," Powerful story, will move you to tears. Be sure to bring plenty of Kleenex.
","Just saw this at TIFF . I saw the trailer a few days before the screening and I have to admit the trailer alone made me a little emotional. I mean just the thought of a 5 year old separated from his family for 25 years is bad enough, add in the fact that he was lost in India, a country of over a billion people and was the child of an uneducated poor single mother and you are looking at a very stressful situation.<br/><br/>This happens there everyday..and most children never find their way back. They either end up dead or in the hands of heartless people who use children for various illegal / unethical operations. The fact that one boy survived this situation and went on to tell his story is very inspiring and this fantastic film did justice to showing it on screen.<br/><br/>There wasn't a single scene in the movie which doesn't suck you in. Hats off to Dev Patel. He managed to make you feel the character's pain just by the way he looked at a jalebi (indian sweet that his brother and him fantasized about back in India). Special shoutout to the young actor who played little Saroo. His performance blew me away. It would be difficult to watch any child go through what he did and the fact that he was absolutely adorable looking made it even harder. <br/><br/>The movie explores some great themes: What happens to lost children in developing countries? How do poor, illiterate citizens of a country go about finding their lost children...who helps them? What are the dangers faced by these lost children? Why do certain people choose to adopt? How do adopted children adapt to their surroundings? Especially when they're transplanted so many miles away from home where they do not even speak the language. Do children every fully recover from traumatic childhood experiences? Does one forget their original family if they never see them again after the age of 5? As an adopted child do you ever completely feel like you fit into your new life? What is the bond with your adoptive parents like? The film touches upon all these themes while primarily being about the physical and emotional journey of a young man finding his way back home with very few clues to work with.<br/><br/>I kid you not, I could hear the whole theatre crying during several parts of the movie and most people had tissues in their hands. So be prepared. If you're in the mood for a heart wrenching drama with an uplifting ending, go watch this one once its out! The lead cast as well as supporting members have all done a wonderful job. You will not be disappointed!"
"jvcksonsmth","10","349","416","14 September 2016"," Truly Exceptional
","May I start this off by saying that I'm astonished at the extremely unfair negative, even 'mixed' reviews the film has gotten so far... The film is not even remotely close to being average, it's far, far, beyond magnificent. <br/><br/>By now you probably know the synopsis, so I'll add for those who haven't seen the film that it's visually stunning, the acting is superb (special mention to phenomenal newcomer Sunny Pawar, who plays 5 year old Saroo) and the story is so gripping and moving, that there wasn't a dry eye in the house when the film reached it's emotional climax. <br/><br/>I've been thinking about this film since I saw it, there's drama, mystery, romance, a whirlwind of emotions throughout the 2 hours - in the best way possible."
"ian-70926","9","187","232","4 October 2016"," Couldn't stop crying
","This is such a beautiful film, with a simple story line, without any frills.<br/><br/>A young Indian boy leaves their village with his older brother to do some ""jobs"", in one of these jobs he gets lost and cannot find his way back home. Pass some years and he's adopted by a family from Australia, and when that boy becomes an adult, he starts wondering where he's actually from.<br/><br/>It deals with aspects of origin and identity, and that we cannot escape from who we really are.<br/><br/>Superb, superb acting from everyone, from the little Indian boys, specially Sunny Pawar that plays the young Sarro, to Dev Patel who has clearly matured into a top class act and is endearing and touching playing the older Saroo.<br/><br/>I'm certainly watching it again."
"joshbarton15","10","147","183","14 December 2016"," Such a powerful film!
","Missing child cases are ones that really do send a shiver down the spine, the uncertainty of the child's whereabouts or whether in fact they are actually still alive being the major worries. You can't possibly understand the effect it must have on a family. In Garth Davis' Lion, we see the effects of such a case on the child rather than the family left behind. <br/><br/>Saroo (Sunny Pawar) is a five-year-old child living in a remote Indian village with his mother, brother and sister. Spending his days helping his brother steal coal from trains, Saroo joins his brother for a job one night but finds himself lost and on a train to Calcutta, nearly two-thousand kilometres from his home village.<br/><br/>Surviving many challenges and meeting various faces, Saroo is eventually adopted by an Australian couple, John and Sue Brierley (David Wenham and Nicole Kidman). Twenty-five years later, Saroo (Dev Patel) decides to track his lost family down.<br/><br/>I must start by saying that I absolutely loved Lion, a film that deals with such a traumatising true story in such a delicate manner. Garth Davis splits the film into two halves, the first focusing on Saroo as a five-year-old lost in such a densely populated city and the second looking at Saroo as a grown man, so far away from the life he left years before. It is quite tough to watch at times, particularly some scenes of a young Saroo trying to survive on the streets of Calcutta however, Davis' film builds to a truly beautiful conclusion that left me emotionally destroyed.<br/><br/>I think the fact that this is a true story played a massive part in the conclusion having such an impact on me. Davis plays it out brilliantly and the inclusion of real life footage in the end credits, along with startling facts about how many children go missing in India, just added more power to the already powerful film.<br/><br/>Lion doesn't just get its power from the story but from the tremendous performances also. I have always liked Dev Patel as an actor but this is the first time I've watched him give such a powerhouse of a performance as a grown up Saroo struggling to cope with tracking down his lost family. From here, Patel could really go places, starting with awards recognition in the early new year.<br/><br/>Sunny Pawar deserves a special mention for his performance as a young Saroo, lost and alone in such a unfamiliar place. It's always a risk to have such a large portion of the film led by such a young actor but it's ultimately one that pays off greatly in Lion. There's also fine support on offer from Rooney Mara, Nicole Kidman and David Wenham, ensuring the quality runs right throughout the film.<br/><br/>Lion is a film that I urge you to go and see because a film like this needs the coverage and its subject matter is something people need to be made more aware of."
"apioneer","10","191","244","11 November 2016"," This Film has Oscars written all over it
","I had not read anything about this film and I went to see 'Lion' yesterday. I was moved, I was shocked. I had tears in my eyes and the hair on my skin stood up. I could listen to my own heart beats while watching this film. It has never happened to me before when I saw a film and I was touched immensely. The film took me back to my roots and streets where I grew up. I am from Pakistan and I have been living in San Francisco for the last 15 years. I come from that part of the world where this story takes place. I grew up in streets like the streets of the movie 'Lion'. I have met many children who collect garbage to make a living and are lost in the streets of this universe. They sleep alone on card board boxes at night and when you look at them , there is a question in their eyes. The world has forgotten about these children and there are thousands of these children on the streets of India and Pakistan. Do you really know what it feels like when you are only 5 years old and lost in some crowded street in a big city and do not know how to get home? To the boy who played Saroo (Sunny Pawar), I want to give you an Academy Award. The film grabs you from the beginning as it starts out with showing a beautiful relationship between two brothers who are running on a train track. The actress who played mother (Priyanka Bose)touched my heart. Her performance is breathtaking. The way she looks at her sons, shows you how a mother pours her heart with love when she looks at her children. There are no words to express that feeling and actress gave her full self and emotions to play this role from young to old. It is commendable and her acting moved me and reminded me of my own mother. There are so many things which I think my mother does not know about me but the way she looks at me, I know she knows. <br/><br/>Lost Saroo looks around for Guddu at the dark train station and then looks for Guddu everywhere, in his thoughts for the rest of his life. What a beautiful role of Guddu played by Abhishek Bharate and what a promising actor! There were some real gripping performances in this film by actors which had only small roles in the film but they left their mark and touched me. I want to give a big hug to Garth Davis for choosing these powerful actors and giving them a chance to express their emotions. I must mention Tannishtha Chattergee, who knew her character and made a mark with just two scenes. Now that's called Actor.<br/><br/>I have always seen Nicole Kidman in great grandeur roles. But I was shocked to see her in 'Lion'. A small role with few scenes. She gave herself all. Her performance in Lion is heartfelt. The cinematographer was able to capture her emotions and her heart on the big screen. David Wenham, plays the part of father to Saroo with amazing acting skills and warmth. Dev Patel, you did a good job.I want to give a big salute to all the filmmakers and actors who were involved in making this film. You have done an exceptional job and gave me something which will be in my mind and heart for a very long time.

"CineMuseFilms","9","121","159","22 December 2016"," An immensely satisfying cinematic experience: visually stunning, narratively powerful, and an emotional whirlwind. Best Aussie film of the year.
","If film-art is the pursuit of visual pleasure, powerful storytelling and high emotional impact, then Lion (2016) is the year's high-water mark for Australian productions. Based on the novel A Long Way Home (2014), this film adaptation is a richly textured essay on the primal human need for belonging that will resonate with anyone who has ever wondered who they are.<br/><br/>This true story is told in two parts and filmed across two continents. Five year-old Saroo is a ragamuffin sidekick to his older brother Guddo, two poor boys who support their family by stealing coal and scavenging trains in their West Bengal village. They become separated one night and Saroo finds himself alone on a train heading to the other side of India. He he joins hordes of homeless children who must fend off predators while begging to survive. Eventually he is placed in a crowded orphanage, then adopted by two big-hearted and childless Tasmanians, Sue (Nicole Kidman) and John (David Wenham). Twenty years on, Saroo (Dev Patel) begins to have memory flashbacks of his native land. As they increase in intensity, he becomes obsessed with finding his family. With some luck and Google maps, the story comes full circle.<br/><br/>There is so much that makes this film stand out. The storytelling is more than engaging: it is so captivating that the two-hour run-time feels like an hour. Acting performances are outstanding: Nicole Kidman is at her best while the five year-old Saroo (Sunny Pawar) is the heart of the film and Dev Patel its soul. The cinematography is brilliant, especially the filming in India. The camera-work is both expansive and intimate, shifting often from sweeping aerial panoramas of mountainous Indian countryside and tranquil Tasmanian waterways to narrow winding alleys, village markets, and the inner-world of Saroo's turmoil. Some of the most powerful scenes are shot from the eye-level of a terrified lost boy jostled by masses of humanity and the close-ups of Saroo's painful face desperate to know home. The colour palette is exotic, sound track emotionally intense, and the directing finds a rhythm that is almost orchestral.<br/><br/>This film offers an immensely satisfying cinematic experience: visually stunning, narratively powerful, and an emotional whirlwind. It comes at the end of a very mixed year for Australian film, with some of the world's finest produced but many that are less than inspiring. Lion is one of those films that will appeal to everyone and it has a very long after-taste. It easily tops my film year."
"fvlecmatic","10","131","174","13 December 2016"," Incredible true story of a tiny needle in a very large haystack
","I've seen 104 movies so far in cinemas this year and I was wondering all year long if I will ever see a movie which will truly deserve a 10-star rating. There were movies like Room, Hacksaw Ridge, Me Before You, Sully or Arrival which are all great and therefore received 8 or 9-stars from me. But today I can safely say that I found my 10-star TOP OF THE YEAR movie.<br/><br/>Lion. An incredible true story of a tiny needle in a very large haystack. So powerful. Deeply moving. It's sad yet uplifting. Not going to tell you the plot but you should definitely find a way to watch this one. There are many strong moments in the movie but for me it was the part when you realize what happened to main characters brother and what impact it must have had in real life on their mothers life. As already said: This is a movie based on real events.<br/><br/>This will definitely be an awards contender. I also have to mention the young Sunny Pawar. You will love him. His acting is phenomenal."
"ElMaruecan82","8","16","18","26 February 2017"," Waiting for Guddu...
","Whenever I wander in the streets of the Moroccan Medina, I feel at home. There's that strange mixture of various fragrances floating in the air: spices, kebab, frying delicacies (not much different from these appetizing jelabis), sea spray from the fish market, tanned leather from the shoe shop and this whole conglomerate smell outsiders or tourists might feel stinky, but as far as ""my"" senses are concerned, ""there's no place like home"". I didn't pick it, it picked me.<br/><br/>And maybe there's something innately circular about life, we're born home, we move close or far from it, and there's the need to get back. I even have a personal theory: that even your children can find a deep ""connection"" with the place you were born in, your home will also feel like home for them. And it is indeed ""A Long Way Home"", the poignant and inspiring story of Saroo Brierley, born in India, lost at the age of five, adopted by an Australian couple and reuniting with his mother and his family twenty-five years later. What else can be said? It's a simple story but it's often in the most plain-looking grounds that you can find the most precious gems.<br/><br/>Garth Davis' ""Lion"" is indeed simple in its storytelling; it's linear and straightforward in its clarity. Basically the whole first hour shows poor Saroo looking for his brother Guddu in hostile and overcrowded streets of Calcutta and finding a few moments of relief interrupted by adults, and in the huge lottery of karma, some can look extremely friendly and have sinister motives. But good fate sides with little Saroo and one lucky encounter leading to another, a couple of Australian tourist discovers the 'wanted notice' published in a newspaper and they instantly fall in love with the kid and adopt him. Saroo is then taught English and good manners.<br/><br/>Then, something interesting happens: while I expected some resistance, he actually tries to fit in his new family as if he's aware that there's something really providential in that couple of good-hearted people from Tasmania, played by Nicole Kidman and David Brienham. The one twist that spoils the family harmony is the adoption of a mentally troubled and self-harming Indian boy named Mantosh one year later. ""Lion"" manages to say a lot without words, from the reaction of Sunny Pawar, who does a fine, subtle, acting job, I could feel that he didn't welcome this arrival with much enthusiasm but wouldn't display jealousy out of love for his new mom.<br/><br/>And the way he grew up was in line with the character. Dev Patel finally makes his entrance as a brilliant young man in his mid-twenties, ready to embrace studies in hotel management, he's also a nice guy like you seldom see in movies, no tortured soul, no rebel, no wimp either and respectful toward his parents. Seeing Patel again made me regret how harshly I judged ""Slumdog Millionnaire"" but I never commented his acting but a script that took a rather simplistic turn near the end. So, I was glad to see Patel again, playing another guy trying to find a loved one through a ""modern device"" but I hoped Davis wouldn't derail the film from its beautiful simplicity.<br/><br/>And I had a good scare when his soon-to-be girlfriend, played by Rooney Mara, started improvising a little dance on the streets as it almost felt like there would be some Bollywood number, but it was just her twisted way to seduce him, and it worked well, to some degree. Personally, she struck me as a too cold and sophisticated girl, I didn't buy that a guy so warm and ""sunny"" like Saroo would fall in love with a younger version of Kristin Scott Thomas. Even the love scenes made me wonder if Mara wasn't still under the influence of her previous romance in ""Carol"". Never mind, the center of the movie were Patel and Kidman and as soon as Patel has this delicate 'Proust Madeleine' moment, the story takes off and with the miracle of ""Google Earth"", Saroo tries to find the way back home.<br/><br/>The film tries to inject some 'suspense' in that powerful journey but that wasn't necessary, I think they could have just compressed the 'research' within the last weeks before Saroo's departure and avoided these little 'pending' moments, only to focus on the relationship with his adoptive mother and some emotional insights about the heights of generosity some hearts can reach. There were many heartfelt statements about adoption that could have enriched the story but the girlfriend allowed Saroo to explain his existential crisis to the audience without never really existing on her own, I didn't care for her anyway. The tormented brother could have made a more interesting foil for Saroo and would have provided a fine back-story paralleling Saroo's experience.<br/><br/>While ""Lion"" isn't flawless, it's a movie whose emotional power relied on the ending, and when Saroo was getting closer to his home, I could find my own heart beating, that's for the empathy and that was the price to pay, to earn that teary explosion of happiness and a few emotionally rewarding revelations, concluding one of the few 2016 movies of universal appeal. Indeed, If there ever was one statement to sum up the general appeal of movies, or stories regardless of their narrative medium, I would quote the late Roger Ebert who said ""The more specific a film is, the more universal, because the more it understands individual characters, the more it applies to everyone"".<br/><br/>Truer words have never been spoken indeed. Garth Davis' ""Lion"" might have an Australian-Indian protagonist but anyone can relate to him, from India, Iceland, Jamaica, Morocco or any part of the world."
"bibo-93638","9","119","161","15 December 2016"," A movie with a soul of its own
","To put it in simple words, ""Lion"" is a journey that grabs you entirely ; whether you want it or not, you are a part of each and every scene. Exactly like the hero, you find yourself having visions of a past that you think you have forgotten, you long for something more and you dig for something deeper. This is a journey back home, filled with emotions, hard decisions, and an infinite willingness to reach somewhere safe.. Simple story, dream like sequences and real characters that are aware that ""there are no white pages"" but that in a way, there is always a black ink somewhere that you can use to finish the endless books that you have in your head. A gem and must see. Highly recommended for the cast's performances, the musical score and the emotional layer that refuses to let you go even after the movie had ended."

Also true praise for the composer the soundtrack was exceptional - so beautifully written and in perfect harmony with the film. A truly exceptional film, this story will stay with me forever.

","I first saw Lion on a whim 3 weeks ago and didn't know what to expect as I hadn't even seen the trailer but I was so incredibly moved by Saroo's story that I decided to watch it again 10 days later. It's the kind of film that stays with you hours or even days after you leave the cinema. It's not just an amazing true story but the acting is superb, the musical score haunting and the cinematography stunning. My decision to see it for a second time was partly due to how much I'd enjoyed the film but also in case I'd missed something of importance through all the tears. Well that didn't work out well as I cried even more the second time round as I knew the significance of certain scenes. <br/><br/>All the adult performances were first class especially Dev Patel and Nicole Kidman who shared some very moving scenes together as adult son and adoptive mother but little Sunny Pawar's performance as young Saroo was totally captivating. There isn't much dialogue in the first 45 minutes but his face and especially his eyes perfectly portray his anguish, desperation and loneliness. Unlike some reviewers I enjoyed both distinct halves of the film equally and never lost interest for a moment. <br/><br/>I can't believe for one minute you'll make it through this film emotionally unscathed but if you do then I'm sure the end credits will get you. I don't have anything negative to say about this wonderful film and can't wait for the DVD to be released. I'll finish by using the 2 most used words when reviewing Lion. Take tissues!"

"bbewnylorac","7","27","39","11 February 2017"," Good, but could have been great
","The gorgeous cinematography in India, and the astonishingly natural performance of little Sunny Pawar as the lost child Saroo, are worth the price of admission to Lion. As others have said here, the second half of the film, set in Australia, is a let-down. It's almost like another film. In India, Priyanka Bose is fantastic playing Saroo's desperately poor yet very loving and dignified mother, Kamla. And special mention to Abhishek Barate, as Saroo's much loved big brother Guddu, who does his best to work, with Saroo, to scrounge coal from trains to buy food for their family. Guddu might be a thief and a hustler, but he's so loving and affectionate. Barate brings a lot of heart to his scenes and has great chemistry with the child. The scenes where Saroo gets lost, alone, on a cross country train and later in the streets of Calcutta, are beautifully shot, and not excessive in scripting or soundtrack. The child Saroo is not overly cute or streetwise; but he has just enough luck and instinct to survive - I love the scene where he sneaks in to an outdoor shrine at night and steals some food offerings (after making the prayer sign) while everyone is sleeping. When he arrives in Tasmania and meets his new adoptive parents, the Brierleys, (Nicole Kidman and David Wenham) I got the feeling they had no idea what Saroo had gone through, which they couldn't have. And the Brierleys' second adopted son, also an Indian orphan, is even more traumatised, although we never find out what his story is. But once we switch to the adult Saroo, the movie almost comes to a halt in its pacing. Dev Patel is quite good as adult Saroo, (although to me he doesn't resemble the boy Saroo), and his Australian accent is great. The trouble, I think, is the script, which is overly angsty, at the expense of advancing the plot. For Saroo to find an obscure village in India, using just his childhood memories and Google Earth, is a thrilling idea, but it's not well portrayed in the movie. For too many scenes, Saroo simply surfs the online maps, or moves pins around a paper map, but mostly he gets angry and frustrated and morose in his flat. And then one day, as though guided by a supernatural force, his computer mouse is directed to an obscure region of India, and in a few seconds, he's found his family home. I find this unbelievable. Maybe in real life he discovered things bit by bit, and that was impossible to portray on film? The search could have been portrayed in a more diverse way. Didn't he ask around at the orphanage he was brought to as a child? Weren't there some language and cultural clues he could have asked people about? Even the food. Couldn't he have brainstormed with his Indian student friends in Melbourne? Instead, Saroo is portrayed as working alone, and as mostly looking for the water tower that as a child he saw next to a railway station. But as a friend points out, there are many water towers in India near railway stations. Possibly thousands? The character of Saroo's love interest, Lucy (Rooney Mara), comes across as unnecessary and her scenes with Saroo are far too uninteresting. Lion is not a love story - it's the story of a lost child. Ditto Nicole Kidman's scenes. She's not bad, but she's not the focus of the film and she gets too much screen time. So to me, it's a respectable film, but falls short of excellent."
"martinaors","7","31","46","3 January 2017"," An incredibly emotional, yet unbalanced, journey
","I'll start by saying that I'm an incredibly emotional person myself, which means I'm capable of feeling great empathy for most of the characters on screen, but this time I could clearly hear the whole crowd in the projection room crying their hearts out, or at least feeling sad for that little, genuine and brilliant kid played by Sunny Pawar, whose first performance on screen was pure gold.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie would deserve a solid 9, with a rhythmical and powerful editing, mostly long shots (which will most likely make you want to visit India right away) and the tough, indifferent and unscrupulous reality Saroo finds himself fighting against. A strong journey of survival and nostalgia, filled with moments of pure disgust and decay as well as moments of relief and hope.<br/><br/>The second half, tho, is barely comparable to the first one. The script gets slightly weaker, even tho Dev Patel - whose accomplished maturity is unbelievable - is incredibly real and fragile in a wonderful performance, as long as the classy and subtle Nicole Kidman. Rooney Mara is a short, but very pleasant, add to a great cast. Saroo's search for his biological family is way slower and way less powerful than the tough struggle for survival in the first part. But in the complex, Garth Davis' debut on the big screen is more than successful, and the suggestive cinematography, with a wonderful soundtrack and a genuinely good story, make this movie more than recommended.<br/><br/>7/10 is a democratic average between first and second half of the movie."

","""Lion"" (2016 release from Australia; 118 min.) is ""based on a true story"", we are reminded at the beginning of the film, and brings the incredible story of Saroo. As the movie opens, we are in ""Khandwa, India, 1986"", and we see 5 yr. old Saroo and his older brother doing whatever they need to do to get by, hustling and bustling. During one of their outings, they get separated and Saroo mistakenly ends up on a train bound for Calcutta, 1000 mi. away. He desperately looks for his mom and his brother, to no avail (for one thing, the boy speaks Hindi and not Bengali), and eventually ends up being adopted by a couple in Tasmania, Australia... To tell you more of the story would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: this movie is the big screen adaptation of Saroo's memoir ""A Long Way Home"", and is directed by Australian newcomer Garth Davis. The movie can be roughly divided into two parts: in the initial 50 or so minutes, we follow the young Saroo as he gets separated from his family and eventually ends up in Calcutta. The second half of the movie brings us the grown-up Saroo, now fully integrated in Hobart, Tasmania in his adopted family. I personally LOVED the first half of the movie, which is truly heartbreaking as we follow young Saroo. There is little dialogue to speak of (remember, Saroo doesn't speak or understand Bengali), and in a way this is the truest survivor story you will ever see. The young actor portraying 5 yr. old Saroo is nothing short of sensational. The photography is gorgeous throughout. Things are not nearly as interesting in the movie's second half. Dev Patel (Slumdog Millionaire; Best Exotic Marigold Hotel) portrays the grown-up Saroo, and does so with pained passion. The same cannot be said of Rooney Mara's performance. I love most of the stuff she does, but here she looks strangely aloof in the proceedings, like she wasn't interested at all in this role (other than it being filmed on location in Tasmania). Nicole Kidman plays the adoptive mother. And am I the only one who was bothered with the way the movie becomes one long advert for Google Earth? On the plus side, there is an outstanding orchestral score, courtesy of Hauschka (!) and Dustin O'Halloran which I intend on seeking out (the movie also features a brand new Sia song ""Never Gives Up"" which plays over the end credits). A few weeks ago I heard an interview on NPR with the real life Saroo, discussing the film (and unfortunately giving away the entire story including how it all ends). Despite that, I was eager to see the movie.<br/><br/>""Lion"" opened at the Toronto International Film Festival to good critical acclaim, and it finally opened in theaters in late December. The New Year's weekend matinée screening where I saw this at was attended quite nicely. I thought that the first half of the movie was nothing short of riveting, if heartbreaking, but the second half of the movie is too obvious and predictive too keep my attention all the way through. Still, this is an incredible story that is worth seeking out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray."

","India's vibrant and teeming tapestry of life is a natural gift for film- makers, without a word needing to be spoken, and director Garth Davis - in an impressive feature film debut - utilizes that backdrop to the max.<br/><br/>In a true life story, five-year-old Saroo (Sunny Pawar, in an astonishingly adept child performance) is accidentally separated from his family in the Madhya Pradesh region of Western India and goes on a journey by train of hundreds of miles to Calcutta: a city full of people who don't even speak his language.<br/><br/>Lost, alone and facing the perils of a street child in a dangerous city, Saroo is eventually adopted by a kindly Australian couple (played by Nicole Kidman (""Before I Go To Sleep"") and David Wenham (Faramir in ""The Lord of the Rings"")).<br/><br/>Growing up in a comfortable, loving, but not - ultimately - idyllic home environment, Saroo (now Dev Patel, ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"") grows up and in his late teens goes to Melbourne University to study Hotel Management (Dev Patel? Hotel Management? What were the odds?!). While there, memories of the past resurface and an obsessive need to trace his Indian origins takes hold, disrupting both his career plans and his relationship with the love of his life Lucy (Rooney Mara, ""Carol""). But with a remembered home-town name that doesn't exist, only hazy memories of the train station he departed from, and thousands and thousands of train stations across India, how could he ever succeed?<br/><br/>India is enormously photogenic and cinematographer Greig Fraser (""Rogue One"", ""Foxcatcher"") takes the maximum advantage of that with some memorable and dramatic landscapes: work that has been Oscar nominated. Also Oscar nominated and contributing strongly to the look and feel of the film is a well-judged and effectively used piano score by Volker Bertelmann and Dustin O'Halloran.<br/><br/>In the acting stakes, Dev Patel gives his best ever performance and his Oscar nomination - curiously for Best Supporting actor since, I presume, Sunny Pawar has the most screen time - is very well deserved. A moving performance, particularly at the tearful end of the movie, for which a box of tissues is recommended.<br/><br/>Nicole Kidman, not an actress I have ever hugely warmed to, is excellent here as the fragile adoptive mother, despite having to sport a crazy red curly wig. Another Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>Also worthy of note is young Abhishek Bharate as Saroo's brother Guddu: the touching chemistry between the thieving young rascals at the start of the movie grounds the whole family relationship that's sets up the emotional heart of the subsequent quest. <br/><br/>Luke Davies' adapted screenplay is also Oscar nominated, although perhaps not as deserving to win as some of the other nominees. I would (naively perhaps) assume that adapting a screenplay from a true-life story must be an easier task, since the facts have to speak for themselves. But besides that, while the first half of the film, with the scenes in India, is exceptionally good, the Australian section became a more patchy with the motivations of Saroo's actions and the impact they have on his adoptive family not feeling completely fleshed out.<br/><br/>While I'm sure being a street urchin in Calcutta in the mid-80's was a horribly difficult and perilous existence, the screenplay paints the sense that that almost EVERY male in the city is either a paedophile or hopelessly corrupt: something that if I was a Calcutta resident I would likely take offence to. <br/><br/>However, this is a hugely involving and enjoyable movie, and a ""Best Film"" rounds off the impressive haul of six Oscar nominations. You might be cynical and view the subject matter as being comfortable Oscar-bait... but you can hardly argue about the absolute quality of the film-making on show here. <br/><br/>By the way, if you are curious as to where the title of the film comes from, you need to wait until the end titles: a masterly touch that I really liked! <br/><br/>The end titles also lay out the fact that the perils of street kids in India is still real and present, and the film is supporting charitable work to help. If you were moved by the film (as I was) you can make a donation at http://lionmovie.com (as I did)! <br/><br/>Highly recommended.<br/><br/>(For the graphical version of this review please visit bob-the-movie- man.com or search for One Mann's Movies on Facebook.

","In 1986, in Khandwa, India, the 5 year-old boy Saroo (Sunny Pawar) lives a very poor but happy life with his mother Kamla (Priyanka Bose), his older brother Guddu (Abhishek Bharate) and his younger sister Shekila (Khushi Solanki). Kamla works carrying stones during the night shift and Guddu also works in the night in the Central Station. One night, Saroo insists on going with Guddu to his work and does not resist and sleeps. Guddu leaves Saroo sleeping on a bank I the station and asks him to stay there until he returns. However the boy wakes up in the middle of the night and decides to seek out his brother in a train. He sleeps again and he wakes up in Calcutta, West Bengal, and 1,600 km east of Khandwa. Saroo does not speak Bengali, only Hindi, and lives on the street of the big city. One day, a young man brings Saroo to the police station and he is sent of an institution for children. In 1987, Saroo is adopted by an Australian family and moves to Hobart, Tasmania. He is raised with love by his foster parents and one day, he goes to an Indian party promoted by his Indian mates from the university with his girlfriend Lucy (Rooney Mara). He tells the story of his childhood and triggers the feeling of missing his family. Now Saroo becomes obsessed to find his mother Kamla and his siblings. Will he succeed in his search?<br/><br/>""Lion"" is a great film based on a true story. The first part is a masterpiece and the boy Sunny Pawar steals the show. The plot is heartbreaking with the 5 year-old boy lost alone in the big city and without speaking the local language. There is an ellipsis when he grows up and the film turns into a melodrama inferior to the story of Saroo's childhood on the streets of Calcutta. The conclusion is emotional, with the reunion of Saroo and his biological mother. Along the credits, the footage of the real characters in India will make many eyes brimming with tears. My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Lion: Uma Jornada Para Casa"" (""Lion: A Journey Home"")"

","It has been mentioned on this page that one of the writers is ""Saroo Brierly (novel)"". His book is not a novel. It is a biography. I am from Khandwa where the boy in the story (Saroo Brierly) hails. My residence is just about two kilometres from his mother's residence. A few years ago I met him 'accidentally' and spoke to him briefly. I was totally excited to meet him. He does not know his mother tongue Hindi. He talks with an Australian accent. His book 'A Long Way Home' is worth reading. In the movie his adult role is played by a 'white' man. It should have been a 'brown' man to reflect real appearance. The child actor who plays the role of child Saroo is in fact a child who was washing teacups for a living in a roadside snack shop on the Khandwa-Indore road. His acting and voice are true to what would have been that of a local boy. Saroo's life has touched the hearts of many. In fact his story was topic of a sermon in our little Church in Hyderabad"
"mallaverack","6","55","106","15 February 2017"," Let's be frank about this...
","This is not a great movie - its faults are there for all to see.<br/><br/>So why so many gushing reviews and 10 star ratings? Primarily, I think many reviewers are confusing the great heart-warming story being depicted and the actual qualities of the film. Yes, it is a wonderful story and even more dramatic when considering the fate of young Saroo's brother. But this was a film with two distinct parts and apart from the climax of Saroo's reunion with his mother, the second part was very low-key film-making. <br/><br/>Nicole Kidman played her part well (apart from the most annoying monologue which was delivered in barely a whisper) but hardly 15-20 minutes on screen must surely disqualify her from any Oscar consideration. Her on-screen husband played by David Wenham appeared on screen for seemingly less than 10 minutes with no hope of any true characterization being offered. The adopted brother of Saroo was emotionally and mentally handicapped, yet we know nothing of his plight once again, through lack of exploring character. The inclusion of Roony Mara as Saroo's love interest in the second half of the film appeared almost pointless. Her presence did almost zilch for plot development and it makes you wonder why the producers went to such expense in casting her in the first place.<br/><br/>This second 'Australian' section of the film displayed some lovely bush and seaside settings but really paled in comparison to the exceptional performance of Sunny Pawar as young Saroo in the first half of the movie. To be honest, apart from the pertinent facial expressions, Dev Patel had little to do and less to say. The reputation of this film gains its notoriety almost wholly from the search and final reunion of mother and son in India but the lack of character development, a very average script and the inclusion of too much filler material has resulted in an overall disappointing film"
"velutha1","5","81","176","31 December 2016"," Great Story, not a Great Film
","Lion is an a amazing story of an exceptionally lucky child grown up to be a man. Lion is not a great film however. It becomes overbearingly melodramatic and overwrought in the second half. I felt like screaming at the main character, go to India and see your family already! This would have been a good documentary. Spare us the Aussie attempt at angst, it just doesn't work. Here we have a lucky young man with a loving family, all grown up in the ""lucky country"". What's the problem? He can figure out where to go in India to see his birth village, but we have to endure an hour of film with him being moody around his supportive girlfriend and family. Talk about manufactured drama. The scene with Nicole Kidman and Patel seemed pointless - just a contractual opportunity for her to show off her acting chops and make this sellable overseas. Don't be fooled. This is a great story, but poor filmmaking in my opinion."

","'Lion' showed a lot of promise. There was potential for a very powerful story, had heard a lot of good things about it (as seen from many positive reviews and a high rating here) and there is a lot of talent involved. A lot of my friends had said how much it touched them, as have many reviewers here, and it seemed like my kind of film. <br/><br/>Fortunately, 'Lion' was a film that had great potential and mostly lived up to it. Cannot say that for many recent viewings, with a few too many wastes of good concepts and potential (along with wastes of talent, that is a bugbear of mine because it feels like somewhat of a slap of the face) so that there was a film that did not waste it was refreshing and restored a bit of faith. It is a very good film, albeit it was very nearly a great film. That it wasn't the great film all the way through than when it started is something of a shame, but there are so many great qualities all the same. <br/><br/>It is an uneven film sure, starting with the negatives. The second half is not as strong as the first half, it is not as compellingly paced and the clarity of storytelling is less good, some of it feeling vague. That is not to say it is unwatchable, it is still touching in spots in a film that is quite the emotional experience. <br/><br/>Rooney Mara also came over to me as the cast's weak link. She didn't look very interested and her character felt like a misplaced and underwritten plot device.<br/><br/>However, 'Lion's' first half is wonderful. Hugely compelling and very emotional, and what is meant by why the film very nearly was great. The whole film though was poignant, and count me in as another film who has become tougher generally over the year but got through several tissues by the film's end.<br/><br/>Throughout, 'Lion' is beautifully filmed and complements the beautiful sceneries very well. Scoring and sound never come over as obvious or intrusive. The script provokes thought, charms and moves. The story is never dull and the emotional impact never feels forced or manipulative.<br/><br/>Garth Davis does a very good job directing. Aside from Mara, the cast are very good. Dev Patel's performance here is perhaps the best seen from him personally and David Wenham and Nicole Kidman are similarly excellent. The star here though is Sunny Pawar who is just outstanding, have not seen a child performance this good in a long time, it is perhaps among the best ever. <br/><br/>In conclusion, very good and very nearly great. 8/10 Bethany Cox"

","This is an incredible story, well told. I disagree completely with any reviewer who states the film is at all maudlin - that's unfair. The predicament of the main character, Saroo, is so immense, you really should consult a doctor if you lack empathy for him. It is true that, as depicted here, his life as a young adult lacks the immediacy of the near hour-long episode of the crisis that nearly engulfs him as a child. (And there is something funny that the actor who stars in The Exotic Marigold Hotel series is now studying hotel management in Melbourne.) There is an inevitability to the story that makes the second half seem a bit perfunctory - but given the harrowing nature of the first half, that comes as some relief. (I literally lost my breath and gasped out loud during one scene in which I feared for the safety of the young Saroo.) Whatever techniques the director Garth Davis employed to coax/capture the performance from Sunny Pawar as the young Saroo, there is no denying that it is the heart and soul of this film, which should be seen for that reason alone. Pawar is fully committed and engaged in these often distressing circumstances; that the power of his performance slightly fails to transfer to the older Saroo, played with reliability by Dev Patel, has more to do with the writing than any fault of Mr. Patel. The charismatic child becomes a cipher as a young man in the second half, which can't decide if it's solely concerned with Saroo's plight, his methods or the crumbling away of Ms. Kidman's adopted family - or even Saroo's relationship with a young woman played by Rooney Mara. But the film finds its footing once again when Saroo inevitably discovers the location of his true home and the film reveals what he finds there. What is of most importance is that you will be astounded by Saroo's real life odyssey. I was profoundly moved by the notion that in life we all get a little lost sometimes and Saroo's story tells us that if we dig deep enough and are compelled to do so, the possibility exists that we can all go home again. Unlike so many other films, Garth Davis' Lion truly earns the tears and outpouring of emotion that it provokes from the audience - because it deals with the primal nature of our existence and our sense of identity in the world which is depicted as both big and, because of technology, much smaller than we think. Highly recommended."

","""Lion"" is the kind of inspirational movie I normally shy away from but first-time director Garth Davis treats the material with a harder edge than I expected. The potential for sentimentality is, of course, high in this true story of a five year old Indian boy separated from his family by 1600 kilometers when the train he is sleeping in 'accidentally' takes him to Calcutta forcing him to live on the streets until a kindly Australian couple, (Nicole Kidman and David Wenham), adopt him and raise him to adulthood in Tasmania.<br/><br/>As a child he is played by the remarkable Sunny Pawar and as an adult by the equally remarkable Dev Patel in a film full of fine performances. The tragedy of the early scenes are that they will immediately remind you of Dickensian London, (complete with a Fagin and a Nancy), though mercifully these children encounter as much goodness as they do evil. This is, after all, a film about hope.<br/><br/>Of course, one of the risks involved when Western filmmakers make movies in such 'exotic' locations as India is the temptation to prettify them out of all recognition. This is fine in a movie like ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" but a movie like this needs to look at least more 'realistic' and Greig Fraser's excellent cinematography does go some way to rectifying the problem; there is a darkness here, literally and metaphorically. Ultimately this is a moving and intelligent picture that could easily have been so much less; a film in which even the obligatory romantic entanglements, (here involving a fine Rooney Mara), work. Hardly Best Picture material but worth seeing nevertheless."

","This is classic schmaltz and I mean that in a positive way. Being based on a true story gives the film so much more latitude to turn up the emotional essence of the film, perhaps too much. The problem is, to do this you need to build a foundation for a film beyond its exceptional premise and here the film fails to deliver.<br/><br/>Lion is the true story of Saroo Brierly, who orphaned in Calcutta, is adopted by a family in Tasmania, Australia. Upon reaching adulthood he is haunted by the idea of who he is and where his biological family are. Using new technology such as Google Earth, he tracks them down even though he is a continent away.<br/><br/>It is very much a film of two halves. The first half is brilliant. In many respects it would have been interesting had the story stayed in India. The child actors especially both Sunny Pawar as young Saroo and Abhishek Bharate as Guddu, his brother, are amazing and both bring an energy and verisimilitude often missing in child actors. The film then jumps twenty years as we meet adult Saroo (Dev Patel) who is living a very privileged lifestyle with his adopted parents played by Nicole Kidman and David Wenham. As Saroo slowly questions his identity the film switches focus and here the film has a major problem.<br/><br/>The whole second act from this pivot is overblown and way too long.<br/><br/>A half hour could have easily been cut from this and it would have been a leaner and better film. The premise is just too slight for the running time and the viewer knowing they are being manipulated just wants the emotional payoff.<br/><br/>The acting in the adult cast is very good across the board. Patel really owns the role and it seems to reflect his growth from geeky man-boy into full maturity. Kidman does a lot of the emotional heavy lifting and is extremely good in a role you don't often associate with Kidman's icy demeanour.<br/><br/>Garth Davis is a debut director, though he is a known gun having directed a few episodes of the great ""Top of the Lake"" mini series. Davis shines in the scenes about atmosphere and almost like a documentarian in capturing the natural frame. However, when the film becomes about internalised emotions and is limited to screens and small rooms, there is a struggle to give the film the proper pacing needed.<br/><br/>I found it all a bit too manipulative but it a great story and most viewers will enjoy the ebb and flow of emotions. Plus, it is that rare film which is not animated but could be enjoyed by every generation of a family."

I admit I was pretty surprised in the first part. I didn't expect that the troubled events of the little Saroo would have had so much space. By the way, a good surprise. Sunny Pawar is absolutely perfect, and for all the first hour we are captured in his story full of suspense and fear, a realistic picture of the most chaotic India. But then we wake up, we put the head out of the sea and the little 5 years old Saroo now is 25 and has the beard. that's where I started to be confused. we get involved to his new life, he has a girlfriend, a bad relationship with his 'brother', a deep mother-child relation with his mum, and on the contrary a very undefined one with his father. But from here the rhythm of the story become more and more swell and slow, without going deeply in the middle of all grown up Saroo relations. the result is a very long second hour, quite boring and full of unnecessary parts. In this moments of confusion we find a little bit of hope while returning to India and we are given a very touching last five minutes.

","A heartening and incredible true story about an Indian man Saroo, in 1986, at the age of 5 (Pawar), he inadvertently hopped on an empty train in the night which later streaked for 3 days to Calcutta, thousands miles away from where he comes from. Failed to express the right name of his hometown, Saroo strays on the street, and had narrow escapes from human traffickers and unscrupulous people with an insidious agenda. Eventually he is put into a cramped orphanage and the next year, he would adopted by an Australian couple Sue (Kidman) and John (Wenham) living in the ethereal Tasmania island. This is the first half of LION, a feature debut from Australian filmmaker Garth Davis, which has charmed with six Oscar nominations including BEST PICTURE.<br/><br/>The second half, jumps bluntly to 20 years later, Saroo (played by a unkempt and burly Patel), battles the flitting fragments of his vague past, decides to dredge up his memory lane and look for his family in India, thanks to Google Earth (a miracle actually actualized by the advancement of digital era), he fortuitously retread his voyage back to the starting point, and a final reunion comes 25 years after, some are still there waiting for him and some has been long gone. That is a tearjerker in full swing, yet, this reviewer is dry-eyed. How come?<br/><br/>Sunny Pawar, a boy wonder in his first film role, carries on the first half with astounding mettle and age-defying gravitas, glints with street-smart when he sniffs something iffy, and runs like (literally) his life depends on it, Saroo's urchin days are so perilous, but what emits from his expressive eyes is the undimmed conviction of going back home. Although, accountably, it seems that in order to adhere to Saroo's memoir, the film stays firmly from Saroo's 5-year-older angle, which leaves certain lacunae in the process, a glaring one is why Saroo has the potluck to be chosen out of others in the same plight, which could have been tapped into since that is the more pressing issue viewers are interested in. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film takes a downward spiral when Saroo's journey abruptly relayed to adulthood, don't get me wrong, Dev Patel has done an amazing job to keep Saroo's emotional outpourings simmering and unfolding, but the vigor and rhythm percolating the first half start to fizzle out (even the camera lumbers against a drabber palette), when danger and hunger is superseded by civilization and comfort. So as if to create a narrative momentum of conflict, Lucy (Mara), Saroo's girlfriend appears timely to be the devil's advocate in a pretty lame way, not just because there is absolutely nothing contentious for a man setting up his mind to look for his lost family if he can find some clue, what else can his girlfriend to do apart from supporting his decision? But also, their romantic involvement is so tenuously orchestrated, chemistry is awkwardly wanting, might just as well being wholly jettisoned. The inaction of the second part drags too long because there are name stars in it, Nicole Kidman de-glamorizes herself in an affecting transmutation into a caring mother with a philanthropic devotion, notwithstanding, padding it out is a default manoeuvre, but there are missed opportunities, for instance, Mantosh (Ladwa), Saroo's damaged adopted brother, whose own unrevealed tale of woe would have been better mined to give the second half a thrust. <br/><br/>As a populist crowd-pleaser, LION - its title refers to Saroo's mispronounced real name Sheru, which means lion in Hindi, is a bespoke Oscar-player in its build-in configuration, but a lesser succès d'estime to be fairly entitled as ""one of the year's best"", even by the Hollywood yardstick."

The film is pretty much a perfectly executed feel good movie.

The first scenes of the film establish the strong relationship he has with his family, and what surprised me about this movie is that the entire first half is focused on Saroo being lost as a child. The child actor performs incredibly well, and the film simply wouldn't be nearly as emotionally involving without his performance. Since the film is from his point of view, all of the big, scary things that happen to him while he is lost that he doesn't quite understand are not directly explained. One night, while Saroo is sleeping with other children in a train station, he is forced to move because men suddenly appear and begin to physically drag the children away, against their will. Saroo, of course, just runs, and their is never a mention or explanation for it, because Saroo himself doesn't understand it. As a result, the audience member is along for the same ride that Saroo is, and that allows us to feel more emotionally connected to him throughout the story.<br/><br/>While Saroo eventually gets two loving Australian parents, he still has troubles in the form of his emotionally challenged adopted brother, and when the film cuts to 20 years later, his brother seems to have nearly disappeared from his life. Now that Saroo is 25, he is going to college, and he soon gets a girlfriend, but after being reminded of his real family and telling his story to his friends, he can't seem to shake the feeling that he needs to find his family, and that becomes his main goal. In fact, he begins to become obsessed with that goal. He has frequent and sudden flashes of memory of his town and his childhood, and this is almost all he can go from, besides the train station he ended up at after getting lost. His obsession pretty much puts all of his relationships on hiatus for years, and although he seems determined to find his real family, he completely forgets about his adopted family, and because of his reclusive behavior his mother feels as if she is losing her children. Nicole Kidman delivers a great performance as Saroo's mother and an emotional monologue describing this. Why Saroo decides not to tell his mother that he quit his job to look for his family remains a mystery to me, but perhaps it is because he didn't want to make her feel unwanted, or build up expectations and then never actually find them.<br/><br/>What eventually happens is that those flashes of memory that Saroo has of his hometown that also gave us a deeper emotional connection for him and his family also end up leading him to his home because of recognition of a certain spot on google maps that he then traces to his house. His actual visit to his hometown after over 25 years is one of the most emotionally involving scenes of the year, considering we as the audience have been through this rough journey with him. When Saroo walks through certain spots that both the audience and Saroo recognize from his memories, we share the anticipation of the main character. That means we also share his frustration, then relief, then sadness, and ultimately his overwhelming sense of joy. The music in these scenes also adds to their emotional impact."

","Whether Harvey Weinstein's purpose in producing Lion was to add to his collection of Oscars or just to tell a sweet, heartfelt story about a lost boy searching for his home, the result is that he has probably accomplished both. Directed by Garth Davis (""Top of the Lake,"" TV Series) the film tells the moving story of Saroo Brierley, a boy seeking to find his way back to India after having lived in Australia for 25 years, a country 5,000 miles away. Written by Luke Davies (""Life"") and based on Brierley's memoir, A Long Way Home, young Saroo (Sunny Pawar) is an impoverished 5-year-old boy from the village of Ganesh Talai in the Khandwr Province of India. Insisting that he go to work at night with his older brother Guddu (Abhishek Bharate), he falls asleep at the train station and becomes separated from Guddu.<br/><br/>Frightened, he boards an empty train and ends up in Calcutta, almost 1000 miles away from Guddu, his sister Shekila (Khushi Solanki), and his mother Kamla (Priyanka Bose, ""Half Ticket""). Saroo is a strong little boy, yet the fact that he cannot remember his mother's name or the name of his village and cannot speak Bengali makes him prey for predators. Confused and afraid, he seeks the help of strangers, looks for places to sleep, and has to escape from a threatening situation. When he ends up at the police station, he is sent to a crowded and oppressive orphanage where, with the help of a compassionate social worker, he is fortunate enough to be adopted by Sue and John Brierley (Nicole Kidman, ""Secret in Their Eyes"" and David Wenham, ""Goldstone""), a loving family in Hobart, Tasmania. <br/><br/>Here he must forget about his old family and adjust to a new home and a new country. A year later, the Brierley's adopt another Indian boy, Mantosh (Keshav Jadhav), but this time they are not as fortunate as Mantosh has both physical and mental problems. Jumping ahead twenty five years, Saroo (now played by Dev Patel, ""The Man Who Knew Infinity"") has gone to Melbourne to study Hotel Management but his memories are reactivated when the Indian food served at a party thrown by his girlfriend Lucy (Rooney Mara, ""Carol"") bring back thoughts of his family in India. It is now 2008 and the introduction of new Internet technology such as Google Earth allows him to believe that he might, after all these years, be able to find his way back home.<br/><br/>Grateful to his new mom and dad who raised him, he has not told them of his background for fear of hurting them. Now that he can see a path back to his roots, his conflicting emotions make it doubly hard for him to communicate. When Sue finds out about his past, however, she is happy for him and wants his real mother to know how well he has turned out. In one of the most poignant moments of the film, Sue tells Saroo about a vision she had when she was younger that led her to adopt children rather than have her own. It is a moment of pure transcendence.<br/><br/>The story that eventually takes us back to Ganesh Talai might seem far-fetched and manipulative if it were not for the fact that it actually happened. Though Lion has its flaws and is hindered by a failure to probe deeply into the inner life of its characters, the performances, especially those of Pawar and Patel, are so convincing that the narrative comes across as completely believable. While the film has emotional highs and lows that may induce copious tears, a fact that some of our more cynical critics will not hesitate to point out, Davis trusts his audience enough to keep the manipulative aspects of the film to a minimum and respect the humanity of its characters."

He plays Saroo Brierley, a young Indian man who was separated from his family when he was a little boy, funneled into the Indian orphan system, and adopted by a loving Australian couple. He longs to return to India to see his birth family again, but is torn between wanting to reconnect with his roots and remaining loyal to the people who raised him.<br/><br/>The first half of ""Lion"" is the film at its best, thanks to the winningly adorable Sunny Pawar, who plays Saroo as a little boy. But once Saroo ages into Patel, the film turns into a saggy, interminable series of scenes in which Patel mopes, lashes out at everyone who's nice to him, and spends every night staring at Google Earth while taking no action whatsoever. What his actual dilemma is is never made clear by the screenplay or Patel's performance. I stated above that he's torn between two cultures, but I'm only conjecturing about that, since that's not shown in the movie. Instead we watch a privileged man surrounded by supportive people whining about how he wants to return to India while we watch him and want to scream at him, ""Then get off your ass and just visit India already!!"" <br/><br/>Patel was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award, but he didn't deserve to be. Nicole Kidman, who plays his adoptive mother, was much more deserving of her Best Supporting Actress nomination. The film also nabbed nominations for Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, and Best Original Score, but won nothing.<br/><br/>Grade: B-"

Guddu leaves Saroo sleeping at the train station for night work. Saroo wakes up and stumbles into an empty train. He find himself trapped as the train travels 1600 miles to Calcutta. He is alone in the city and unable to speak the local dialect. He escapes the scary streets and gets taken to a Dickensian orphanage. He is adopted by Sue (Nicole Kidman) and John Brierley (David Wenham) from Tasmania. Twenty years later, he moves to Melbourne to study hotel management and starts a relationship with Lucy (Rooney Mara). Friends suggest using Google Earth to pinpoint his lost home town.<br/><br/>The first half with young Saroo is a harrowing journey. The nightmarish streets are closer to the horror genre. It's a very compelling story. The kid is undeniable. Once he leaves for Australia, the story slows down. There are some compelling aspects but it falters when compared to the first half. That imbalance leaves the movie wanting. Maybe it's possible to add more flashbacks into the second half."

","I loved this movie uncritically. It's only upon ""thinking"" about it as a work of art that my reaction to it (10) is revised to 9. Some bits are too long (what else is new), and the real-life personages that we see in a video at the end look more interesting than their actor counterparts. The child actors who dominate the first part of the movie are wonderfully effective.<br/><br/>Although I've never been lost in the sense of not knowing where to find my family, I identified acutely with the adult Saroo who must wrack his brain and become heavily involved with Google in order to try to find out where he fits into the world. Nearly all of the most important people in my elderly life are persons I met when I was young but ""lost"" for a very long time thereafter. I can't expect everyone to share my experience of the movie in that way: others will see it through the experience of being a parent or a son, but I believe most will be moved.<br/><br/>India isn't overdone. It's dirty, it's crowded, it's poor -- but we all knew that -- there is no effort to shock us by exaggerating these things, and I appreciate that. Also appreciate their sticking with the languages that would actually have been spoken in the various locales of the story, and using subtitles, instead of doing the whole thing in English and making us figure out when that's a story-telling convenience."
"Argemaluco","7","4","6","19 February 2017"," Lion
","Lion is the best Google commercial I have seen. Leaving that aside, director Garth Davis drives the first hour of the film in quite an efficient way, making us share the fear and confusion of the kid Saroo, far from his home and overwhelmed by the chaotic environment of the big city, in which every kind of dangers are lurking at every corner... even from individuals trying to help him. That was the part of Lion I liked the most, because it evokes powerful emotions without the typical ""creative manipulation"" employed by many films to accentuate the drama. Lion doesn't need those tricks... for its first hour only. Then, we jump 20 years to the future, and the film loses the honesty which had previously captured me. That doesn't mean that the second half is bad; but I personally found it manipulative and occasionally forced and cloying. Nevertheless, the performances from Dev Patel, Nicole Kidman, Rooney Mara and David Wenham (who all show up during that part) are very good. However, that second half can never recover the energy and raw realism of the first hour, both obtained due to Davis' direction and the brilliant performance from Sunny Pawar, and that avoided the experience from being totally satisfactory in my case, even though I can give it a moderate recommendation."

A Tasmanian couple who altruistically decide there are enough people on the face of the Earth, so instead of having their own decide to adopt children already in existence. Beautiful cinematography. A soundtrack that accompanies the action impeccably. Excellent acting skills. We had no idea of all these when we decided to go and watch ""Lion"". We only wanted to watch a film and it seemed the best option at the moment. We enjoyed it tremendously, mainly due to the fact that it is depicting a real life story-otherwise it would be melodramatic. Plus all the reasons stated above. We got home- it is January 24- and were stunned to realize this film had just been nominated to six Oscars! Apart from having our choice so majestically justified by the Academy, the film offered us truthful images of rural India, bustling Calcutta and a glimpse of Tasmanian shores. In spite of its length of almost two hours, ""The Lion"" has you stuck in your seat because it is a story well told , flowing coherently, although the flashbacks are numerous. The tension of the quest is constantly mounting towards the denouement-no spoiler here, since the story is well-known already from the book.The final footage of the real moments of re- connecting was unfortunately lost to many from the public, who were already on their way out of the cinema hall.

I am almost inclined to recommend to watch this movie to anyone who overwhelms me with questions about my adoption.

","Going into an 'Oscar baity' film during the Oscars winter season is always an experiment: is this going to be one that will allow you to fully immerse yourself into the fibre of the story or will you be severely frustrated by all the teary closeups followed by the string score? Lion, for better of for worse, does both. The first half of the film is absolutely splendid. Raw, poignant, emotional. It has it all. A fabulous lead actor in the young Sunny Pawar and a heart-wrenching story to go with him. Things go a bit wonky once the film shifts time and place to Australia. <br/><br/>While Dev Patel is splendid here, after Sunny's performance, it is difficult for him to live up to what has been presented. Rooney Mara is excellent, albeit rather tangential (potentially, actually unnecessary as a character). And that is where the problems lie. That strained relationship they have is just not meshing well. It does not progress the story anywhere. There are glimmers of hope in that Australian section, though. The dinner scene when Patel's character has a fit and Nicole Kidman, playing his adoptive mother, has one of the most expressive 30 second performances seen in a long time. Her ""big scene"" is also quite good but was too much of a tear-jerker moment for my taste. <br/><br/>From the technical side - the cinematography is excellent (again, especially in the first part of the film), and the original score is mesmerising and gives a wholly new dimension to the film. The bottom line is that this film is all well-intentioned, and that is the problem probably with it. It veers on the edge of being fully committed to the story and characters, but then kind of drifts away to be ""a film"". Basically, it is overly obvious and cliché at times. And I bet that the real-life story was not a cliché at all. The film just does not fully realise itself as an excellent one. A good film, definitely. A very good film, surely. But not an excellent one."

","This is a beautiful film. The first half of the movie shines with its masterful absence of dialogue and the bustling Indian urban landscape. Sunny Pawar carries the soul of the film with his wide, vibrant eyes radiating dignity and screen presence purely through facial expressions. He is a natural. The second half of the film set in Tasmania thrives mostly in its contrast to India. Here, Dev Patel does very well as a confused young man in search of his roots and his home. Nicole Kidman steals the show with the few scenes in which she embodies motherly love and devotion. This is a must watch.

","The first part of Lion I would give a 9, unfortunately the second part is in the minus numbers, dragging this whole affair into a frustrating thing where you see greatness just out of reach because it appears the studio wanted a shorter movie. That could be wrong about the studio being the cause, but the problem is there anyways. The second part of the movie where we meet up with the big award hype around Dev Patel and Nicole Kidman's parts in the movie is equal parts confusing and overly melodramatic. The melodrama is caused by the audience not being given enough to understand why they are acting the way they do, and the confusion is caused by the same. It jumps all over the place without allowing enough to fill in their stories. How can you follow a story when big chunks of the motivation are were left on the cutting room floor? I imagine there is going to be a directors cut that will flesh out the second part of the movie and make that part watchable, because as it stands it is not. The first part is really well done in every way, but maybe it also could have been a bit longer in certain parts because there was just so much great drama there. So it is hard to understand the acting accolades for Dev Patel when most of his scenes have him acting in ways that left me feeling like I was only hearing one side of a phone conversation because his emotional tone was all over the place, his concerns were all over the place, the drama was all over the place - and we are not given much to know the details on why? That was less so for Nicole Kidman, but her part also left a lot to be desired."

But as the film goes on, and on, and on, and on, we lose all sense of empathy with our main protagonist, and the lovely ending is almost lost in the rush to leave the cinema because of the sheer tedium and ennui of the middle section."

","This is a really good story, but its structure, pacing and editing threw me off constantly throughout. I couldn't completely engage with the film as a result.<br/><br/>Nearly an hour of the film is spent on little Saroo, yet ultimately this has no bearing on the film as a whole. The film is about Saroo reconnecting with his biological mom, his culture and his heritage. Yet none of these scenes further that. They're from a different movie about the entire life of Saroo and the tribulations of all Indian orphans which this film clearly is not.<br/><br/>I really think this film benefits from a less chronological structure - if his past as a young boy were something he was remembering in pieces in the present. Because ultimately how much of that time does he really remember? It seems unlikely it was all of it since he was so young, so these scenes are really for the benefit of the audience so we spend too much of the film waiting for him to find home because we aren't actively connecting with his past like he is. We already know what happened and the incoming inevitable conclusion.<br/><br/>Still, it's a beautiful story and the conclusion is convincingly emotional and touching. Dev Patel and little Sunny Pawar are both pretty great."

","I found this movie to be average. Starting off with two boys on a coal train, stealing coal, it seemed like the film was going to be similar to Slumdog Millionaire, but while the film takes some familiar themes- child poverty, parenting in third-world countries, and living in a country with an enormous population like India- it is an entirely different film. The first half of the film is very good, set in India as young Pawar puts in a fantastic performance as he wanders around looking for his brother and mother, but the second half is just awful. Set in Tasmania, Australia, the film gets boring very, very quickly as we are introduced to a character 20 years later who is going to Melbourne to study and seems to be happy, then abruptly his life starts unraveling, he suddenly has this yearning desire to find out what happened to the family he left behind in India some 20 years ago. There is a scene with his foster mother in Australia that made me physically cringe as Nicole Kidman goes off on a tangent about how she had a ""vision"" that could have been interpreted as a ""mental breakdown"" and saw two brown boys and knew that this was her calling in life...Dev Patel also has a foster brother that he is wildly inconsistent with in his relationship. One minute he hates him, he's ruined his mother's life, the next he loves him. The whole half in Australia just ruined the film for me. We all know he will and needs to go back to India, but instead he spends his time getting upset at his girlfriend, quitting his job and avoiding his parents. There is a general feeling of: why doesn't he just go back to India and look for them for goodness sake? So he can finally find the clarity he's looking for? His sudden desire to find his family in India is so bizarre as he seems content then boom at mid- twenties, he needs to go back, its perplexing. Perhaps the first half and the ending when he finally returns to India makes the film worth watching, but the second half was intolerable and ruined what was a extremely promising first half."

Not as easy as it sounds: After leaving home at 5 unwittingly on a train for days, he is eventually adopted to Australia with loving foster parents and the need to find his real mother and family.<br/><br/>As far as daydreaming, Lion is based on a true story, so take that you naysayers. For those in love with technology, see Google Maps work its magic.<br/><br/>This lyrically-played, beautifully shot, at times depressing melodrama is a study in love: Saroo's love shared with his adoptive mother, Sue (Nicole Kidman), is affecting, so authentic is Kidman's performance. I've never seen her act as finely as this. Too bad she is underused here. Her joy in the little boy and her deep connection to the adult is one of filmdom's finest relationships. An Oscar nod is sure to come.<br/><br/>However, so distraught is Saroo's adult life with his dreams of youth and finding home that he leaves his hospitality job, almost destroys his love with a classmate (Rooney Mara), and distances himself from his adoptive family. Nobody ever said searching for your mother would be easy, and this film makes sure you know that. Its metaphors about two worlds reaching for each other give dramatic and interpretive heft.<br/><br/>In an effective juxtaposition, the addled, ruinous adopted brother, Mantosh (Divian Ladwa), contrasts the mature and overly-sensitive Saroo. His anger against Mantosh saps the film of its established melancholic pace, almost as if we needed to be jolted out of sharing the obsessive homecoming dream.<br/><br/>Saroo must eventually decide which identity to take—Aussie or Indian. Meanwhile, as we wipe the sympathetic tears from our eyes, we can faintly hear the lion roar."

","Personally, I never liked Slumdog Millionaire and this movie does a great job at recreating and frustratingly stretching the same idea. Want an Oscar? Stretch upon the filth of India. And this movie is depressing. IMDb ratings have never failed me, this is the first time it did. The story has nothing but 3 stages- getting lost, getting adopted and finding home. It is also a badly researched movie with technical loopholes. One, it shows Calcutta during winters. Durga Puja is not during that time of the year. When the lost kid arrived in a train, he came from one of the northern states which are much colder, but no sweater or jacket! Dev Patel drew a radius of 1200km from Calcutta. If he (Or the director) applied any brains, he could have narrowed his search by eliminating the Sourthern states where the native language is not Hindi. Saving him the pain that was so harped on in the story. I am sure if I sit down to watch the movie again, I will find numerous more. But not interested!"

The performances are convincing but it gets to the point of when will we see the top supporting cast? Once they appear, there is plenty of dialogue. Every character is sad and depressed. <br/><br/>If you make it through to the end, you are rewarded with shots of the real people. The snap shots have a far more emotional range then the movie footage.

"namashi_1","6","6","14","31 January 2017"," Remarkable Performances Lead A Decent Film!
","Based on the non-fiction book A Long Way Home by Saroo Brierley with Larry Buttrose, 'Lion' tells a true-story so heartbreaking (though beautiful eventually), you'd be heartless not to be moved by it. And despite that fact, cinematically, 'Lion' is a decent film, that never becomes a triumph due to its uneven Writing. But, the Remarkable Performances lead the show!<br/><br/>'Lion' Synopsis: A five-year-old Indian boy gets lost on the streets of Calcutta, thousands of kilometers from home. He survives many challenges before being adopted by a couple in Australia; 25 years later, he sets out to find his lost family.<br/><br/>'Lion' has a heartbreaking first-hour, that arrests you & emotionally drains you. Sunny Pawar as the young Saroo, the protagonist, delivers such a realistic performance, you actually believe the kid is lost in the big bad world. Pawar adds such depth to 'Lion', its hard to keep your eyes off him, as he struggles with being lost, homeless or later smartly dodging a pimp who sells children. The first-hour works without any stops! <br/><br/>Its the second-hour, however, when 'Lion' results into monotony. Dev Patel is remarkably complex in his role of the older Saroo, but his journey to get back home after living 25 years with his adoptive parents in Australia, is repetitive. And by the time Saroo actually gets home, the emotions are done by. The first-hour has a addictive feel to it, but the second-hour is monotonous & drags itself for a bit too long!<br/><br/>Luke Davies's Adapted Screenplay is excellent in the first-hour, but slows down right after. One truly wishes if the Writing remained superior, as this is a true-story that's nothing less than a triumph. Garth Davis's Direction is well-done. Cinematography is sharp. Editing is fair. Art & Costume Design are perfect. <br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Sunny & Dev are obviously the winners here, but that doesn't mean the supporting players don't leave a mark. Nicole Kidman, to begin with, is masterclass as the Saroo's adoptive mother, who portrays true feeling without every over-doing it. David Wenham as Saroo's adoptive dad & Kidman's husband, is another topper. He's first-rate! Rooney Mara as Saroo's girlfriend, is precisely natural & owns the part with dignity & restraint. Priyanka Bose as Saroo's biological mother, also, is quite good. Deepti Naval is in top-form! Tannishtha Chatterjee is remarkable. And Nawazuddin Siddiqui is terrific in that one scene he appears in. <br/><br/>On the whole, 'Lion' is an uneven film, about a triumphant true-story."
"Turfseer","6","6","14","11 December 2016"," Incredibly moving tale of family reunion marred by less than gripping second act machinations
","Lion is based on Saroo Brierly's book ""A Long Way Home,"" which chronicles his search for his biological mother from whom he was separated under strange and devastating circumstances when he was five years old. The first third of the film (the best part), details how Saroo (brilliantly played by youngster Sunny Pawa) was living in a poor village in India with his mother. Despite protests from his older brother Guddu who insisted he was too young to accompany him to steal coal for resale at the local market, Saroo accompanies him anyway. While Guddu wanders off after telling Saroo to wait for him at a nearby train station, the younger boy falls asleep and when he wakes up, Guddu is nowhere to be found.<br/><br/>Thus begins the tragic saga of Saroo, who, looking for his brother, found himself trapped on a decommissioned train headed for the eastern part of India, thousands of miles away. He ends up in Calcutta where they only speak Bengali and is forced to fend for himself in a teeming strange city where he doesn't know his surname and is unable to pronounce the name of his hometown correctly.<br/><br/>It's a gripping, brilliant first third of a film, chronicling how Saroo almost ends up in the hands of a child sex smuggler, braves horrendous conditions at a state orphanage and is finally adopted by loving Australian parents, who bring him back to Tasmania and raise him as their own.<br/><br/>Flash forward to 2007 when Saroo is now a grown man and is determined to find his lost family. Unfortunately, Act 2 of this compelling story is nowhere as good as the first. The film's scenarists have trouble fleshing out the character of the adult Saroo, now played by the noted Indian actor, Dev Patel. The problem is that his one-note obsession transforms him into a one-dimensional depressive. Saroo's downbeat demeanor prevents us from embracing him as we did when he appeared as that endearing five year old.<br/><br/>The elder Saroo's angst causes him significant alienation from his girlfriend, his brooding mother (Nicole Kidman)--who feels she's being rejected for the biological mother--and his adopted brother, who has learning disabilities and emotional problems that he is unable to overcome.<br/><br/>Ironically it's not the melodramatic troubled family machinations that lead us back to a positive spin in Act Three, but modern day technology. Saroo solves the mystery of his lost hometown by obsessively poring over Google Maps until he hits pay dirt— there he glimpses the water tower that loomed in front of him as he sat on a bench at the train station so many years before.<br/><br/>Act Three turns out to be quite moving as Saroo has a joyous reunion with his mother. The homecoming however proves bittersweet upon his discovery that his older brother passed away shortly after he was lost. Lion also features some additional moving closing credit clips of Saroo's adoptive parents journeying to India to meet his biological mother.<br/><br/>Lion's mother/son reunification coupled with a brilliant first act is worth the price of admission despite some not so solid second act machinations involving that family angst."
"mannacio","6","5","11","18 December 2016"," How Fully Committed
","As some critics have noted, during the first half of this move we can identify with Sharu who manages to survive after being lost far from home. The second half is more problematic and not just because it is hard to portray, in a movie, the difficulties involved in finding ""home"". But also because the character himself doesn't seem fully convinced of his effort. On the one hand he disparages the first world lifestyle and privilege but he fails to relearn the Hindi language at all. If and when he finds the town in which he grew up one would think he would want to be able to communicate with his relatives and friends without a translator. Of course, this is not just a movie but is based on a true story so that this failing would seem to apply to the real life character. To the extent it does, we identify less with the adult Sharu. The film also has some awkward cuts."
"ctowyi","8","5","11","27 November 2016"," This Lion Gives a Resounding Roar!
","Lion is superbly inspirational and it has Oscar baits all over it. The story sounds so out of this world that part of my mind thought it is a case of God playing a cruel trick just to witness the emotional devastation it would cause. Then the ultimate act of redemption is so moving that God will lift His finger off the button of mass destruction of the world. <br/><br/>The first half of the film is simply the best Hindi film I have seen this year that didn't hail from Bollywood. IMHO this has been a disappointing year for Bollywood and thank goodness for Lion for showing the way. The effortless acting by the two child-newcomers, Sunny Pawar and Abhishek Bharate, is so great that I didn't even for one minute think they were acting. I love how Garth Davis captured the Indian cities, and it is even more remarkable that Lion is his first feature film. The city is portrayed like a lurking monster with different terrifying elements out to devour the innocent children. There is also an air of mysticism about it. The direction is assured and never heavy handed. However this is a film of two halves. <br/><br/>The first half is so amazing that it is almost a futile task to be able sustain the wondrous energy in the second half. However, Dev Patel as the adult Saroo, demonstrates superb range; he has really blossomed as an actor since Slumdog Millionaire (2008). The problem with it is that it is too pre-defined and you would already know how it would go. Even though the narrative goes through the usual tropes and hits the typical emotional beats with a shoehorned romantic angle, Davis makes a creative choice to skim through and tip- toe round all the usual traumatic scenes, giving the film a refreshing feel. You know exactly what you will see at the end, but kudos to the filmmaker who still succeeds in never cheapening the journey and for making you an emotional wreck of a blubber. <br/><br/>When the shameless weeping stopped, I felt my soul displace and move to a different place. This Lion roars resoundingly! The search for identity and home is absorbing and never boring. Don't forget to bring tissue and hankies, and remember there is no shame in crying for it is what makes us human beings."

And boy, had I been missing out!<br/><br/>As if the story wasn't heart-wrenching enough, the production elements contributed equally to provide an incredible two hours of colour and sound that underlined and enhanced every moment of the film.<br/><br/>The bar for child actors has been well and truly raised by Sunny Pawar as he runs into the first part of the film with a gaze that you can't tear yourself way from. There's so much going on in his eyes that you could probably get people to watch an hour of him staring at a camera. <br/><br/>Dev Patel is excellent as usual, though perhaps not as commanding as Sunny in his screen presence. He works alongside the other well- known faces as they come together to support the first forty minutes of excellence in an admirable fashion.<br/><br/>If you are prone to tearing up at films, I suggest you have a box of tissues close at hand. <br/><br/>Do not let the negative reviews put you off from watching this.

","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. It is a well-made movie of an essentially true story, it shows the connections humans can make with each other.<br/><br/>The story originates in a small village in India, young Saroo's mother is so poor she carries rocks to earn some money to feed the small family. Saroo's brother is going to a nearby town to work at night, after much begging brings Saroo, 5, along with him. But the boy is too young, he cannot stay awake, when he does wake up can't find his brother and ends up on a train being taken out of service and headed 1000 miles away to Calcutta. Once there Saroo finds that he cannot even speak their language, cannot explain where he is from, and ends up in an orphanage in 1986.<br/><br/>Nicole Kidman is Australian Sue Brierley, married but without children. When she was but 12, we eventually learn, she had a vision of a small brown boy coming up to her, she interpreted that as a message. As an adult she and her husband decided there were already enough children in the world, they would adopt orphans from India instead of having their own.<br/><br/>Dev Patel plays the grownup Saroo Brierley, some 20+ years later in Tasmania. He loves his adopted mom and dad but never quit having the visions of his home and family all those years ago. Eventually, using Google Earth on his computer, with a lot of persistence, he tracks down his place of origin.<br/><br/>In a nice touch the end of the film includes clips of the real Saroo and his adopted Australian mom in his original village in India, meeting up with those he had left behind all those years earlier.<br/><br/>A very worthwhile movie."
"patsworld","9","2","3","18 February 2017"," An Emotional Journey
","What a fabulous film! The first half has sub-titles which could turn some off, but shouldn't. It's set in India, they are speaking Indian and it's all when this lad is very young, becomes lost from his brother, his family. Some of it is difficult to watch as, in truth, this sort of thing does happen to so many youngsters there. But it will grab your heart and hold on tight. There should be an Oscar for those 12 or 14 years old and younger. I thought that when Sixth Sense came out and I think it even more with this picture. Sunny Pawar is amazing. He, and his voice, will stay with you – well, if like me – probably forever. The movie loses the sub-titles and switches to English when this little lost child is adopted by a family in Australia where Nicole Kidman as his new mother is wonderful. This is an emotional movie from beginning to end. Dev Patel is one of my favorites anyway and he literally shines in this picture. Perfection. I felt wrung out, but not unhappy when I left the theater. And this is not a spoiler but you won't discover why the movie is titled Lion until the very end. This one has Oscar winners written all over it."
"szadhik","7","2","3","7 February 2017"," sex scenes necessary?
","The film was awesome especially only few sentimental films are built around the time. It appears that Dev Patel really matured in his role. He was quite loud in his late two movies-slumdog millionaire and a hotel movie. The highlight of the movie was the last scene when the son meets his natural mother. The movie was also able to keep secret of wheabout his real brother, until the last scene we never know the fate of his brother.<br/><br/>The movie could have been justified for theater admission for all ages has those sex scenes not included in the movie. The movie could have corrected as it could have potential to reach to the wider audience. <br/><br/>Nicole Kidman was looking gorgeous on the first part of movie. It was wrongly generalized that kids from third world countries are not privileged. The children from middle and higher class of developing countries are privileged in a sense that parents are not poor on time. Children don't have to go to day care centers. They are always with parents and they do not have to work for $ at KFC, Mackers.<br/><br/>The film was able to send a powerful message that materialistic life is ephemeral. The movie could score all well in Oscars."

","Make sure you bring a box of Kleenex to this one! You will shed heartfelt tears or spend an inordinate amount of energy trying to hold them off. But, while I truly enjoyed the movie, I don't think the movie was structured as well as it could have been. Basically, the first half of the film follows a young Indian boy lost in a strange city and then transitions to Australia 20 years later where the boy was raised by an adopted family. Instead, I would have preferred starting with Dev Patel (the lead character as an adult), seeing him struggle with his identity and gradually show us through multiple flashbacks his experiences as a lost child in India. His growing awakening and recollections about his past would have been a journey both character and audience were making together and would have given the film more heft. Still, this was an uplifting and, at times, bittersweet movie held together by charming leads."

"ikieneng","Null","1","1","21 August 2019"," My favorite movie of all time
","Lion is my favorite movie of all time. No movie ever impacted me so much emotionally. No movie comes even close.<br/><br/>I saw Lion in theaters in March of 2017. I never heard of it before that day. I only read about it in the program sheet of the theater, which described it as something along the lines of ""A boy from India is trying to find his family"", a description that doesn't come anywhere close to doing this masterpiece justice.<br/><br/>Lion is based on the book ""A Long Way Home"", the true autobiography of Saroo Brierley. As a five-year-old Saroo lived in a poor village with his mother, his older brother, and his baby sister. One day his brother is going away to do work at night for a short time, and despite his initial refusal, Saroo convinces him to let him come along and help him. At the train station of destination young Saroo is way too tired to work, so his brother tells him to stay at the station until he comes back. In the middle of the night Saroo wakes up, he's all alone, he desperately looks for his brother in a train at the platform, and falls asleep again, taking him further and further away from home. One day he's adopted to Australia, and as an adult he's looking for his biological family.<br/><br/>I hardly ever cry at movies, but when I said in this theater I was sobbing. Lion is an extremely impactful story that feels the most genuine I've ever seen in a based-on-a-true-story film. Whether as a five-year-old or an adult, you feel for Saroo at every turn. Especially the ending, which I'm not going to spoil, had me cry my eyeballs out. Saroo's search for his biological family and his secrecy about it made a huge impact on the people around him, which was extremely well-realized by the writers. The side characters are also amazing, especially Sue Brierley, Saroo's adoptive mother. There's an immensely powerful scene where she explains why she and her husband chose to adopt Saroo and his adoptive brother Mantosh. The acting is also amazing. Sunny Pawar as young Saroo had one of the best acting debuts I've ever seen. Dev Patel is amazing as adult Saroo, and Nicole Kidman as Sue Brierley is one of the stand-outs as well. The film is extremely well-shot and lit as well, which is only amplified by the lack of any effects. After a couple of minutes you'll forget that you're watching a movie. I also loved that half the movie is in Hindi and Bengali, which provides a whole lot of authenticity. Whenever the characters' real counterparts would've talked in English, Hindi or Bengali, they do so in the movie. Literally my only flaw with the movie was that the character of Mantosh was underdeveloped, I would've liked to get to know him a little more.<br/><br/>You won't find out why this movie is called Lion until the very end, but it's a perfect title. Also, if you're living in a country where movies are dubbed into your language, please do NOT watch the dubbed versions, especially not the fully-dubbed ones. The Hindi-Bengali language barrier is an important plotpoint, and it would probably be erased in a dubbed version.<br/><br/>I recommend Lion to you 100%. It's the #1 best movie I've seen in my entire life. It's near damn perfect, it's genuine, it shaped many of my views about adoption and parenting, and I hope it will have the same impact on you!"

","Of this year's Best Picture Nominees, Lion (2016) is certainly one of the more . . . artistic ones. Heck, the title of the film wasn't clear until directly before the credits. In part due to the subject matter and the culture in which it takes place, this film can be hard to watch at times. The audience has to come to grips with the poverty and difficult living conditions present in India not only 25 years ago, but today as well. Perhaps it's my need to watch movies that help me to escape from these realities, but it was challenging to be shown such a stark view of another country's reality.<br/><br/>While I understand that the larger, overarching message of the film is to bring to light the social issue of lost children in India, the more inspiring subplot had to do with adoption. Many couples have a lot of different reasons for wanting to adopt, but I have to say that the couple portrayed by Nicole Kidman and David Wenham certainly had the noblest reason imaginable. Even with this admirable goal in mind, an adopted child will likely want to uncover their past, especially if there are still questions to be answered.<br/><br/>On the flip side of stark images of poverty, this film merely reinforced that we live in the future. The amazing capabilities that technology affords us is really what made this film possible. The ever-increasing proliferation of free and accessible information allows us to take our fates into our own hands. Whether it's for education to help break a cycle of ignorance or to track down long-lost family members, the information provided by the internet has an endless amount of uses, just as long as you're willing to put the effort in and use the tool that it is.<br/><br/>A film about a boy with boundless determination and courage, I give Lion 3.5 stars out of 5."

She was just in a few doesn't make sense scene and a time jumps. Those time jumps were not good. In the middle of the movie I lost track cause of it. Saroo is played by Dev Patel, aka slumdog millionaire. He did a good job. Would I expect more from him? Probably not, cause Saroo character wasn't made for him. He also doesn't look like to the real Saroo. In his movies, when he acts you started to think like this is his real life, he is that good. Well it didn't happened to me in this movie.

","Based on an extraordinary true story, 'Lion' was always going to be an emotional and compelling film. It succeeds in doing what you expect it to, but is missing that special something that separates the best biographical films from the good ones. True story films like this one always have the ability to be emotionally overwhelming and powerful, but 'Lion' just never reaches the level to make you sit up and take notice.<br/><br/>The film is technically great, with a strong script and some great cinematography, which contributes immensely to the feel and atmosphere of the film. It also features an exceptional acting performance from Dev Patel. In my opinion it's his career best, which is saying something given how good he was in 'Slumdog Millionaire'. Overall, 'Lion' is a solid and emotional drama, but it just didn't connect with me like the very best biographical films do. It's missing that special something."

","Even though looking forward to seeing it - I was sceptical about 'Lion' and remain so with regards to a couple of story elements (screenplay to blame?) Otherwise, there was little to disappoint as it carried the viewer deeper into its harrowing situations. It's a difficult film to review as it's not in any way your standard story. Lion is a gut tearing true story about the fear of separation and extreme loss of the safety of family. <br/><br/>The horror of seeing vulnerable children placed in shocking institutions - controlled by vile people - who should never be placed in positions of access, brings home the desperation of third world poverty. The screenplay by Luke Davis represents an adaption of the autobiographical novel by Saroo Brierley (Sheru Khan) and does well to capture the 'sweep' of the dramatic situations. Although, much credit has to go to Australian director Garth Davis, with this, his first feature movie. Both the dramatic production and sound designs are enhanced superbly with score music by two pianists, German, Hauschka and American, Dustin J. O'Halloran. This combination adds a strong atmospheric soundscape throughout this thoughtful film. <br/><br/>The cinematography (on both sides of the world) is quite stunning with just a few minor scenes suffering shaky hand-held shots. Some say the movies pace changes for the last half – I would think it should, as the first half is a desperate search - leaving a definite need to allow for some serious introspection on the 'lost' lad's newly adopted life - in this strange land. This journey is never 'slow' as the searching for his soul family is ever ongoing. Performances by all concerned are heartfelt (despite what some may say) making Lion an exceptional experience that should not be missed by admirers of quality fact- based storytelling."

The pace slowed down, the main character kept agonizing so much that it became old and tired, and the subplot of his relationship with the girl felt forced and rather unnecessary. It also felt like a Googlemaps paid for a placement as it was referenced and used so many time; this was a distraction. <br/><br/>The ending was nonetheless heart touching and left me with a few tears in my eyes. It's just that the 2nd half could've been directed so much better to make this a truly great film."

Don't miss seeing it!<br/><br/>Now, that said, and trying to be careful not to give anything away, we neither see Saroo's mom searching for him, nor do we see the relationship between Saroo's adoptive parents and himself develop. Please, don't tell me about it, show me! Don't tell me, ""There are many more trophies in the garage,"" show me dad at his practices encouraging him when he stumbles. Show me his mother at his games. Show Saroo victorious, holding up his trophy while looking at them both.

"Kingslaay","Null","1","1","11 May 2017"," Tear jerker and good for Hollywood
","Lion was a good story and definitely contained some emotional moments. <br/><br/>The western audience's fascination with poverty in other countries, especially India is an easy gravy train for Hollywood. Often films are made to highlight and heighten every poor part of India that can be found which resonates with an unfamiliar Western audience who feel better about themselves and their lives. This shock value is where the directors grasp their audience and where the money lies. The purpose is not to educate audiences and give a complete account of life in India but manufacture certain reactions and surprises to boost the ratings of the film. So off course this film was well received. <br/><br/>India is a beautiful country with raw beauty. It definitely has serious problems but it also has real strengths, charm and a rich culture. I was born in India and have lived in a developed city along with millions of fellow Indians. This city as many other parts of India was quite developed in most parts. Yet sadly this is not documented in any movie, no stories are sought from here and believe me there are tons of moving stories. I shouldn't be surprised because there is no shock value and Hollywood is only interested in showing India in a negative and poor light. It exploits and uses the stories of poor Indians because that would be better for the bottom line. So off course Westerners think the entire country looks like this and that these are the lives of all Indian people.<br/><br/>Lion was a good film but adopted the standard formula Hollywood uses when making Indian related films, showcase a huge amount of poverty. Close to one hour, around 45 minutes, is dedicated to poverty. The same emotional value could have been delivered but the film wanted to emphasise poverty for almost half the film. It also dragged on in parts. The last moments were the best part of the film. I have to admit that when Sheru reunites with his mother it was one of the most emotional moments in cinema. The same story could have delivered with a lot more finesse. No doubt Lion is a beautiful story but Hollywood could not resist the opportunity to use this poor son and his story for commercial purposes. The filmmakers couldn't help themselves from showing excessive poverty. <br/><br/>I do not detest this film's story as it is a moving story but I detest Hollywood for exploiting such a story for its commercial value. You can always expect such stories to be made into films. India is full of rich and successful stories that show this great country in a good light. If Western audiences want to get a 'complete' picture of life they should not lap whatever Hollywood throws at them."
"alindsay-al","7","1","1","7 February 2017"," A good emotional true life story
","This film has been nominated for best picture at the 2017 Oscars so I thought I would give it a watch and I did enjoy this film. The premise of this film sees a young boy's journey after he goes missing in India and ends up in Australia 25 years later. Dev Patel plays the older version of the kid in this film and he is really good in this film, he gives a very emotional performance that makes you really buy his characters situation and makes you care about it. Nicole Kidman and David Wenham play his adopted Australian parents in this film and they both give good performances. Kidman especially gives a strong performance and her chemistry with Patel is really good and you buy her characters development throughout the film. Rooney Mara plays his love interest in the film and i thought she did a good job in the film adding a bit of life to patel's life and i thought at first their relationship worked. Also the kid actors did a pretty decent job in the film for what they are needed to do. The story of this film has some great emotional tones to it as you see this person's story as he tries to be accepted with his life despite his past. However, I did find the first 40 minutes focusing on his childhood to be pretty boring and slow paced and I feel like they could have been used more effectively as flashbacks for Patel's character as the film progresses. The script also has some really good dramatic dialogue that helps make some of the situations more intense and heartfelt then they would have been. However, the film tries to use comedy at some points, especially at the start of Mara and patel's romance and it didn't work at all and hurt the film a little bit. The style of the film has some excellent emotion and if you don't get close to tears at a point in this film I do question your emotions. But as mentioned before I feel like the first half of the film was poorly paced and could have been done better in my opinion. Overall this is a good film with allot of emotion involved in it that may be worth a watch if you like true stories with emotion in it."

","Lion is a drama movie about this kid who goes missing, filmed in his perspective. <br/><br/>His upcoming life after that point is filled with wonderful people who don't want anything else than to love and be something that matches the values of ""good"". Turns out that this kind of values do not create realistic characteristics. <br/><br/>The dialogue is so bad it is comedic. They are basically reading out loud some of the cheesiest feeling related one-liners. Similar you can find from the social media profile of any emo girl who is mad because their father doesn't love them.<br/><br/>The drama is the worst kind, melodrama. We have so much crying scenes, feeling scenes and bullshit psychoanalysis ""this is not who you are"" scenes that it makes me wonder if that, indeed, is not who they are. Maybe these people are just actors in a movie which aims to make all of its casual viewers cry? Oh, wait.<br/><br/>The audiovisual execution can be summed up with the following sentence: ""Let's insert emotional piano music here and hope someone will cry."" While piano music does miracles in some cases -such as in Hatchiko (or Hachi: A Dog's Tale as you non-weeb-speakers might call it) - in Lion's case viewer's focus is somewhere else completely. <br/><br/>You will not pay so much attention to the selected scene and the piano track itself as you pay attention to the purpose of the song. ""Oh, so this is supposed to be sad and you expect me to cry."" It is very amateurish and only way for me to explain myself why anyone would cry is that the viewer has been on the edge recently and about anything would make them cry at this point. Not to mention the ridiculous overuse of songs of this sort. In fact, it is a bgm heavy movie with no other types of tracks.<br/><br/>I did not have problems with the longest music scene where there was no dialog at all, though. But even its value is inferior from what it could have been due to the overuse of this sort of scenes and also due to the former pathetic tries on getting emotions out of the viewer.<br/><br/>Even after all its problems, Lion is still worth of watching, but it is a very average movie which most likely won't offer you anything special."

","Dev Patel saves this film which would otherwise be a bit of a muddle. There are many winning qualities - the beautiful cinematography, the apparently accurate but still sympathetic portrayal of the Indian condition, the sweeping feel of the narrative itself, and most especially the winning portrayal of young Saroo as a 5-year-old. But without Patel these qualities would not be enough. Realizing that this is an Australian film (Australian story-telling techniques often utilize different formats than American), the loose ends are still distracting. Characters and details are presented and then dropped without regard to continuity. Continuing characters go through changes that are not even hinted before they are portrayed. The screenplay is based on a memoir by Patel's character; the book itself is often described as a novel. So we are left to question just how much was truly remembered and how much was supplemented. (Patel's alter ego did not write screenplay.) No matter. Patel hurtles through all of this and makes it work. Now he needs to start finding some non-ethnic roles; he certainly has the chops."

"Samuel-Shovel","6","3","6","6 January 2018"," Lion Lacks Roar
","While I really wanted to like this movie, the second half was a but of a letdown. The first 45 minutes of this was absolutely stunning. The scenery, the acting, the atmosphere, everything. It all worked when our protagonist is the adorable little kid braving the elements of India. The minimalistic amount of dialogue just adds to the atmospheric isolation and loneliness of Saroo. Sunny Pawar was incredible in his role. <br/><br/>As soon as we jump forward to adulthood however, the movie begins to drag. Dev Patel does a great job as always, it's not his fault, it's just that the pacing is all over the place. We spend the majority of the second half of this movie messing around on Google Earth and watching Saroo isolate himself from friends and family. These scenes need to happen but they take far too long for my liking. You could cut 20 minutes out of this movie and it'd be a lot better. (Also, how he finds his home feels like BS to me. Randomly scrolling around and seeing some dirt crevices from space? How many of those must exist in India?)<br/><br/>The reunion scene with his mother was very touching. I don't care if you think this is Oscar bait or not, that should tug at your heartstrings. It was really the only part of that last hour I enjoyed. <br/><br/>How Nicole Kidman got an Oscar nomination for this is beyond me. She's fine in her role but she doesn't do anything! I feel like the Academy felt this thing needed more nominations and threw one her way for that reason and that reason alone. <br/><br/>While this is a great and triumphant story, it's not an Oscar-caliber movie. It's an enjoyable watch and the first half is brilliant but the entire thing collapses down the backstretch."

","As soon as I heard about LION I instantly got it in to my head that I might be watching a reincarnation of SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE . Let's face it , India , street urchins ,rail journeys lasting days , Dev Patel trying to find a special woman in a sub-continent of over a billion people . Seen it all before in an Oscar winning movie from Danny Boyle . If nothing else the challenge of Saroo Brierley trying to find his mother after a gap of 20 years and thousands of miles mirrors that of director Garth Davis trying to make a film that won't have the audience shout out ""Final answer"" . And yet Davis succeeds in a film that might just surprise the Oscars this year <br/><br/>You might have to meet the film on its own terms in order for it to work fully . By this I mean straight from the opening scene I was expecting a caption to crop up at any moment proclaiming ""Australia 20 years later"" as the pivotal moments in India are shown through flashback . This isn't a film that uses a fractured narrative to tell its story . Instead it's very linear and the first half plays out entirely as a foreign language film . Perhaps I'm misleading you because there is very little dialogue in the first half , instead the audience are asked to feel for the plight of young Saroo and nothing needs to be said . The second half then concentrates on Saroo as a young man in Australia only half complete as a human being as he tries to find his long lost mother and brother <br/><br/>One genuine criticism I have at this years Oscar nominations is that many of the contenders feel rather poetic , slow and aloof compared to the in your face stylised LA LA LAND . Not to discredit it LION too has a strangely poetic feel but unlike MOONLIGHT which becomes cold and uninvolving after a while LION continues to keep its slightly hypnotic quality . Some people might claim this might be down to a slightly manipulative soundtrack by Bertelman and O'Halloran but I found the score haunting . Indeed the entire film is a haunting experience and is the film I hope will cause a couple of shocks at the Oscars this year ."

After this long, boring part, the middle comes with a 20 year mark, which drags at an even slower speed, with dialog that seems to be made up on the fly! There is no chemistry between any of the actors. They all seem to playing their parts to pay their rent! The final part is very compressed.

Also, there is an adopted brother who is developmentally delayed with behavioral issues that distract from the film's content.

"Horst_In_Translation","6","3","7","28 February 2017"," Back to the roots
","""Lion"" is a co-production between Australia, the UK and the United States from 2016. It is predominantly in the English language, but due to a big part of the film taking place in India, there are also Bengali and Hindi parts. When it does not take place in India, the action moves to Australia. This is also why I am a bit surprised that this movie garnered so much awards attention this year. It was certainly one of the big players and the biggest successes were probably BAFTA wins for Dev Patel and Luke Davies as well as an Oscar nomination for Best Picture (along with several others). This 2-hour movie is the story of Saroo, a little Indian boy who loses (on a tragic day for his family) contact to his brother and ends up getting adopted in the probably best possible outcome for him by an Australian family. 2 decades later, he sets out to find his real family back in India. Human connection (his girlfriend played by Rooney Mara) and advanced technology, i.e. Google Earth, help him with this challenging endeavor.<br/><br/>This is the movie that turns Dev Patel probably into a Hollywood star. Sure he has been the lead in Best Picture winner ""Slumdog Millionaire"" before and he has appeared in high-profile projects like ""The Newsroom"", but with this performance we see here, he really breaks free. I personally would say that it is not an Oscar-worthy performance, but he is deserving of the nomination. Of course, he is lead and not supporting. He is the central character of the film and it is entirely irrelevant hat he did not appear in it during the first 45 minutes. His physical appearance is so different from his previous work and it is also very much in tone with the film's title here. His wild mane somehow justifies it and alone by the name revelation at the very end, I may not have approved. Anyway, I do believe there is an occasional weakness here and there. For example, the long part early on with the child actor had some lengths and I believe they could have kept this at 30 minutes max without really losing any crucial substance. Or the talk of Kidman's character about the young dark-skinned boy she (thought she) saw as a child is a bit melodramatic and pretentious.<br/><br/>Then again I can't really blame the screenplay writer here as these parts probably were also part of the autobiographical book by Saroo Brierley and the fact that it is all based on actual events (maybe slightly dramatized) is the film's biggest strength for sure. It all (or most of it) happened this way, which makes it really easier to feel with the characters. There weren't too many moments in which the film did not feel authentic and you could forget these pretty quickly, for example how he randomly found his family's village in the gigantic country of India, even if he had the radius as a help, was pretty unrealistic. Anyway, I think the moment Patel enters the film, it all gets a lot better. Everything before that is basically like a poor man's version of the childhood parts from ""Slumdog Millionaire"". Patel has a commanding presence and he carried the film nicely on his shoulders with the help of Nicole Kidman (liked her more here than I usually do) and Rooney Mara, who also deserved awards recognition. Maybe not an Oscar nomination, but more than she got. David Wenham was sadly a bit underwritten and could have gotten more screen time too. I guess it was intentional to make Kidman stand out more.<br/><br/>As a whole, I believe this was a good film that got better and better the longer it went, which is quite a success for this runtime. I still would not count it among the very best of the year on my personal list. Somehow I felt that eventually the longing for home and the emotional moments did not turn out as effective as they could have and this is a bit of the pity. Still on a more positive note, the movie definitely had more moments and sequences that I liked than the ones I disliked or found entirely forgettable and that's always a success and an achievement. For example, I also really liked the parts about his new brother as they added a completely new interesting conflict to the entire film and showed us that it is not all about harmony and sanity in the family and that they all (the Indian kids) have their wounds from what happened to them when they were very young. Life for an Indian kid in the slums, especially if they are homeless, is a living hell to this day. Another thumbs-up for the message at the very end as these people really do need help. I recommend ""Lion"". It's a quality film and the director, Emmy nominee Garth Davis, certainly shows that he is not only a force to reckon with when it comes to small screen projects."

","'Lion' tells the story of one of the 80,000 children who go missing in India each year. One evening, a 6YO boy called Saroo accompanies his older brother who is searching for work in a nearby town. Left alone at a deserted railway station, he wanders into a stationary train to sleep, and awakens to find himself locked inside an empty moving carriage. One thousand miles later, he disembarks in Calcutta, and quickly becomes lost among its teeming masses. For a while Saroo exists on the streets of this vast megalopolis, ignorant of his own full name and that of his home town. He survives human predators of various kinds, before he's taken in by a sinister orphanage. Eventually he's sent for adoption to Australia, and many years later begins the search for his original family.<br/><br/>Producers are well aware what kind of 'real' stories appeal to mass audiences, and like so many other based-on-true-story projects, 'Lion' is hemmed in by facts. The film is rescued to some extent by excellent acting, but nobody should expect any big surprises - the ending is obvious from the trailer.

","Greetings again from the darkness. Sometimes the real life story is enough. The story of Saroo Brierley is proof. A 5 year old boy from rural India gets stranded at a train station and inadvertently takes a train trip that strands him in Calcutta, thousands of miles from home. He is adopted by a Tasmanian couple and later uses Google Earth to systematically track down his village, family, and ultimately his self.<br/><br/>Saroo's story would be interesting enough had a writer fabricated it; but in fact, Luke Davis adapted the screenplay directly from Mr. Brierley's book ""A Long Way Home"". Director Garth Davis and an exceptional cast bring this incredible and inspirational and touching story to the big screen in a wonderfully entertaining manner.<br/><br/>The first part of the film introduces us to 5 year old Saroo (a bright-eyed and energetic Sunny Pawar) and his beloved and protective older brother Guddu (Abhishek Bharate). The two boys are nearly inseparable and seem oblivious to the hard life provided by the small village they live in - where their mother literally carries rocks all day. A fluke of circumstance causes the train station separation for the brothers, and young Saroo finds himself on a train ride that will forever change his life.<br/><br/>Very little dialogue is found in this first part, but we immediately connect with the young boy, and we feel his frantic desire to return home as a tightness in our chest as he falls into the quagmire of homeless kids in Calcutta. When Saroo first meets Sue and John Brierley (Nicole Kidman, David Wenham), he isn't sure how to react. His assimilation into this unrecognizable new world might just as well have been on another planet as a home in Tasmania.<br/><br/>Once the film jumps ahead, Dev Patel takes over as Saroo and the film turns into a journey for the universal need to understand our identity  where we come from, and who we really are. Rooney Mara has a small but important role as Saroo's girlfriend Lucy (a composite character), as does Divian Ladwa as Mantosh, another boy adopted by the Brierleys. It's here where Google Earth enjoys its biggest plug as the tool Saroo utilizes to solve the mystery of his origin. <br/><br/>The film is beautifully shot by cinematographer Greig Fraser, and he perfectly captures the harshness of young Saroo's home village, the frenzied pace of Calcutta and the beauty of Tasmania  all without losing the emotions of any given moment. To cap it off and to prove the filmmakers never stooped to any 'trickery', the film ends with actual footage of Saroo reuniting with his mother, and then the magical moment when his two mothers embrace. Good luck maintaining composure during this part!"

(I'm sure you could see stories like it every day in Calcutta, but those stories don't usually come to the screen.) <br/><br/>Sunny Pawar plays the protagonist, Saroo, as a child. By bad luck, Saroo is locked inside a railway car at a station near his home. When he gets out of the train he's in Calcutta. He's trapped in a totally different world--urban rather than rural--and a different culture--people speak Bengali and not Hindi. By utilizing ingenuity and intelligence, Saroo manages to survive. Ultimately he's placed in an orphanage, and adopted by an Australian couple, John and Sue Brierley (David Wenham and Nicole Kidman). Wenham and Kidman both do a fine job, in roles that don't really use their talents fully.<br/><br/>Saroo is portrayed by Dev Patel as a young adult. He has done very well in the home of the Brierley family, but he can't forget that he had a home and a family in India. The remainder of the plot follows from there.<br/><br/>To a certain extent, Lion has been billed as a love story between Patel and Rooney Mara, who portrays his girlfriend, Lucy. Rooney Mara is adorable, but she's not the co-star. I think the love story between the two of them is a fairly awkward plot device. Mara has two expressions--loving and happy, and loving and sad. <br/><br/>The real stars of the film are Sunny Pawar and Dev Patel. You really believe in both of their characters, and you can see how the young Saroo could have become the young adult Saroo. Both of them portray their roles brilliantly, and the movie would be worth seeing just to watch them act. (It's a bright, colorful, noisy movie, but it's not costumes, or cinematography, or hundreds of extras that make this film work. It's the acting of Pawar and Patel.)<br/><br/>This movie will be better watched in a theater than on the small screen, because of the vast expanses of scenery in all of the locations. We saw this movie at the excellent Little Theatre in Rochester, NY. On Christmas/Chanukah day, 2016, the Little Theatre showed Lion, Fences, Manchester by the Sea, and Jackie. What other theater in New York Skate could match that combination?"

","Whilst as an Australian, I am pleased to see Lion was such a domestic and international commercial success, honesty behooves me in suggesting that it is one of the most over rated films I've seen in quite awhile.<br/><br/>The first half (and with its chronologically linear structure, this is indeed a film of two distinct halves) featuring the remarkable talents of Sunny Pawar as young Saroo Brierley is brilliantly structured by debuting director Garth Davis . It's full of pathos, suspense and drama, set against a richly involving Northern Indian backdrop of both realistic rural and urban locations. The little dialogue spoken through this portion of the film is Hindi, which is entirely appropriate, as we witness the fateful occurrences which lead Saroo to be separated from his family and in due course find the boy adopted by an Australian couple from the island state of Tasmania.<br/><br/>Greig Fraser's cinematography, as it did in the Indian first half, portrays the natural beauty of both the Tasmanian countryside and its charming capital city, Hobart, both rarely seen in contemporary Australian films. However through no fault of the actors, whose performances are never less than highly competent, it is here where the story begins to slow and then grind to its inevitable conclusion. The problem is the drama as we begin to see is relatively light weight. Boy separated from his natural family, a world away, wants, at the very least, a few answers. Arguably, in times such as they are, characterised by a high degree of international trans-migration, this is likely to be a common source of teenage angst. The suspense and unpredictable nature of the film's first half becomes lost amidst an atmosphere of one man's increasingly high anxiety.<br/><br/>Davis and screen writer Luke Davies attempt to compensate by dialing up the human drama surrounding the adult Saroo, played very impressively by Dev Patel, whose Australian accent is surprisingly authentic. Saroo has a loose cannon adopted brother. Saroo has a supportive girl friend, with whom he breaks up and later with whom he reacquaints (Rooney Mara, who really isn't given much scope to show her acting chops here). Saroo has loving adoptive parents (David Wenham and Nicole Kidman) who also only wish the best for him. (One feels in particular, that Kidman's role as his mother Sue is clearly padded out, as arguably befitting her international star status.) All well and good, but on a dramatic level not unlike an episode of The Young and the Restless.<br/><br/>Rarely have I seen a film of two such contrasting halves in terms of dramatic content and cinematic quality. Lion received six Oscar nominations at the 89th Academy Awards, but did not win in any of the categories. Poetic justice in my opinion. Ultimately, it didn't deserve any."

","Behind every great movie in the history is the script, the story. And what story can be more moving than the one based on real life characters and a huge problem that devours the single largest population on Earth, one that lives in India. Child abandonment is one of the most tragic subjects the movie can tackle, so only the best ones will be recognized as the immortal ones. Australian Lion"" is one of those immortal flicks that will carve its way into your brain and soul so deeply that you will end up weeping while you're watching little Saroo's journey to hell and back. With impeccable scenario, it was time for the masters of trade to step in and routinely deliver the final product. If you can say that always reliable Nicole Kidman is the Jack of all trades"", Dev Patel will definitely steal the show in his first serious role on the big screen as a grown up. But, that's not all, since the real stars of this emotional earthquake of a movie will be two rookies, director Garth Davis and young Sunny Pawar. Add some great music and cinematography along the way and you you will get something truly outstanding for today's standards. Lion"" is, without any doubt, THE BEST movie of 2016 and should harvest the oscars"" in every major category it was nominated."

","Our Hollywood critics, Les Roberts and Ann Elder, decided that Lion feels jarringly like a two part film. They absolutely adored the performances of the young Saroo and his brother. However, they felt that the grown Saroo (played by Dev Patel) should have moved them to tears. This true story, based on Saroo's search for his family was definitely sentimental, but it simply missed the mark. The flashbacks were sweet, but they were interjected somewhat jarringly at times.<br/><br/>Lion feels like two separate films; we liked the first but not the second! Overall, Ann and Les gave it a ""yellow"" light, meaning this movie is definitely worth watching, but approach it with caution. The direction is amiss, as are some of the performances. However, the cinematography and performance of the young Saroo are breathtaking. <br/><br/>Ann and Les discuss more aspects of the film in podcast form here: https://www.thefrontporchpeople.com/greenlightreviews/lion"

","Every once in a while a film comes along which stands out from the pack. A film where all of the elements come together to create a visual storytelling work of art. It doesn't happen often, perhaps once a year if we are lucky. And it nearly always happens with true stories like this one.<br/><br/>The cinematography is beautiful, and whilst the locations perhaps made this easy. Add a musical score that is one of the best I have heard in years, and you are still only halfway to making a masterpiece. The cast and direction complete the recipe. With brilliant performances from all involved.<br/><br/>If there is one film you see this year it should be this one. It is an emotional journey with moments of sadness and anger, mixed in with joy and relief. A good movie makes you feel something, this one makes you feel everything."

","This film presents the dilemma of the adopted child. Did my parents not want me? Did they search for me? Will I upset my adoptive parents if I seek my birth parents? But it also presents more. The grinding poverty in India and the plight of lost children. Why they are lost does not matter - they fall prey to abusers and the system itself creaks and strains to cope.<br/><br/>Of course, these issues will pull on the emotions, but the film never presents situations simply to give an emotion rush. The situations it portrays are real and with is today. They deserve to evoke an emotional response.<br/><br/>The acting is top notch - the writing of the characters and the performances are engaging."
"artmania90","10","2","4","16 January 2017"," One of the best of the year. A true tearjerker
","The holiday movie season continues to dazzle with LION, one of the most emotionally rendering movies I can remember. A story based on a real event that follows a lost boy reuniting with his mother, this is a film that exists purely on merit and a powerful combination of imagery and sound. It's like a Hollywood movie that's so unbelievable you can't believe could happen. It's magic.<br/><br/>There are two distinct parts to the film, a front-half that follows our hero through the slums of western India. There is very little dialogue and the language we do hear is local dialect. Saroo (Dev Patel playing as the adult and the wonderful Sunny Pawar playing the child) lives in a small shack with his mother, brother, and younger sister. They work as laborers, lifting rocks and earning little to survive. At night Saroo volunteers to help his brother Guddu in earning more money. With little sleep and a crowded train station to navigate, Saroo is soon lost. The boy is stuck on a train for days, trapped with no idea where he is going or where his brother is. Once he manages to escape, he wanders the streets of Calcutta calling for his mom in a language that locals can't even comprehend. His story moves slowly, tragically, and we follow this small child disappear amongst a mass of crowds and commuters.<br/><br/>It's a wonder he manages to escape, but fortune would find Saroo in an orphanage in the heart of the city. His story makes the local news, but with the memory of an 8 year old and little recollection of his town's name (he doesn't even know his mother's real name), he is doomed to exist as a lost boy nearly 1,000 miles separated from his home. Fortune would find him adopted by two Australians (David Wenham and Nicole Kidman) who fly Saroo to Tasmania and raise him with love. They adopt another boy from the same orphanage a year later, and immediately we see the mental disturbances that could be inflicted on these innocent children. How Saroo managed to grow up so normal is a wonder in itself.<br/><br/>The last half of the movie follows adult Saroo (Dev Patel in a showy role that is at times a bit too flat but never fails to impress) as he slowly realizes these memories of his childhood. He meets a girl (Rooney Mara) while attending college who encourages him to try and trace down his mother using Google Earth and the few visual cues he recalls. Simple math puts his search area within 1,500 kilometers of Calcutta. Painstakingly, he searches the grainly online images of train station after train station.<br/><br/>Here is where the movie develops into a more complex story, where Sue (Nicole Kidman in a heartbreaking role) admits her wishes to adopt, and how she has no regrets about never having children of her own. There is a scene spoken almost entirely in whispers where Sue tells Saroo all that she believes and hopes for her son. Saroo, in turn, finds new insight into this woman and the beautiful sacrifices his parents made for him. Saroo keeps his search hidden from his parents, fearful of what they may think and worried that it will all amount to nothing. As unbelievable a story as this is, we can identify with these worries and what it means to have guardians in our lives.<br/><br/>I will admit that this movie packs a punch, and the last 45 minutes are filled with incredibly-written scenes one after the other. Saroo on the verge of giving up hope stumbles onto a familiar sight: a water tower near the train station he first disappeared. We know it's the same tower too, with winding stairs and a distinctive roof. He can retrace his steps down the rails, through the trees, and back to his village... Zooming in on a pixelated brown spot, at last he has found it: his home. This scene alone is so powerful with only the fuzzy Google images, a tight closeup on Patel's eyes, and the music. The film score by Volker Bertelmann and Dustin O'Halloran deserves much praise through melancholy sounds created on the piano, unique themes and a perfect marriage to the story at hand.<br/><br/>It shouldn't be a spoiler to learn that Saroo an his mother reunite in one of the most beautiful scenes one can imagine, an embrace that is earned so fully that I doubt there was a single dry-eye in the packed theater I saw it. Stuck with no tissue I was caught with tears streaming down my face in a scene of pure electricity. I tremble with the memories of this moment, amazed by the story and more so by the accomplishments of these filmmakers to achieve something so wonderful and heartwarming. I wept at the end titles, which revealed more facts about this story including insight from Saroo's birth mother who never moved from her town and never gave up hope of finding her son. We learn the meaning of the film's title ""Lion,"" which had me puzzled until the screen went black and then gave the film an entirely new meaning.<br/><br/>On merits alone this movie is a masterpiece. There isn't a dense plot with side stories and miscellaneous characters. This is a story of one boy who never gave up his search to find his mother. In a country of over 1 billion people, the odds were insurmountable. For this story to be told with so much craft should instantly put this on the top of your must-see movie list."

","(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5)<br/><br/>THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. <br/><br/>IN BRIEF: An uplifting and riveting story, given even more credibility due to a strong performance by Dev Petal in the central role.<br/><br/>GRADE: B<br/><br/>SYNOPSIS: An adopted child searches for his biological mother.<br/><br/>JIM'S REVIEW: Garth Davis makes an impressive directorial debut in Lion, the true story of a little boy lost. Through a series of unfortunate incidents, five year-old Saroo (Sunny Pawar, giving a lovely performance) is forced to use his wiles and survival instincts as he is abandoned in the street jungle known as Calcutta, India. He perseveres and grows up to become the child of loving adoptive parents in Australia, all the while yearning to find his way home and the family he left behind.<br/><br/>The story elicits an empathetic reaction from any moviegoer and Mr. Davis mostly resists the melodramatic hyperbola and concentrates on the more personal view of a man trying to come to terms with his past. The director tends to overuse cross-cuts of the past and present images to advance the narrative, but emotionally, it's always embraces his audience as we journey along with this child's plight.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Luke Davies is based on Saroo's own autobiography, A Long Way Home, and seems to stick to the facts rather well, although some of the minor supporting characters are in need of more depth. Except for Dev Patel as the older Saroo and Nicole Kidman as his adoptive mother, who are both superb, others play a more peripheral role. Especially underdeveloped is Saroo's relationship with (Roma Downey). Also, some of the build-up of Saroo's traumatic upbringing seems spotty, as if some scenes were missing or excised during the filmmaking which could have explained more clearly his sudden behavioral changes and mood swings. <br/><br/>Yet the underlying story is still quite powerful and moving. Lion is a well made and thoroughly engrossing film that has enough impact to satisfy the most jaded of viewers."

","A wonderful movie. I don't know about others new movies, but this should win an Oscar🏆. Sometimes a movie is wonderful when it teaches you something important about life, like this movie did to me. Half of the movie is in Indian and this give a lot of credibility to the movie. The children and his brother act very well. These two thinks help me to understand something that with my life comforts were not easy for me to understand, we hear that we are lucky for living in America, French, German, Italy, Spain and other rich countries like these. We hear that there are people who are adopted and don't know their true parents, we hear that there is a lot of poverty in the rest of the world, that there are people without a roof, children that work, adults who stole children, and many other bad news about this wonderful and ugly world that we have created. However, these reality seems far away for many of us. Thanks to this movie it easier easier to understand how life is hard and how the destiny could be cruel, but even all of this there is hope and love in this world. To conclude, I strongly suggest to watch this wonderful movie, because it can teach you something about life that many people think to know, but they don't really understand. Have a sit and Good vision."

","Born in rural destitution, the 5-year-old Saroo followed his older brother to the local railway station one night. He fell asleep in a train car, and woke up 900 miles away edging towards the bustling city of Calcutta. After weeks of scavenging for scraps near the rails, Saroo was brought to a center for abandoned children and quickly adopted by a an Australian couple who raised and took care of him for 25 years.<br/><br/>Lion's Dickensian tale of a displaced child who is adopted, brought to a faraway land and decides to trek back in search of his real family, is all the more harrowing when you consider the whole thing is a true story. While Saroo's ""A Long Way Home"" never really caught fire in the west until, well until just now, the story was all the rage back in India and Australia. In addition to being a challenging but ultimately heartwarming story of loss, reunion and renewal, the tale also works as a rallying cry, by drawing attention to India's indignant, indifferent and sometimes predatory policies towards impoverished children.<br/><br/>Yet despite the story's obvious appeal and the anchored authority of it being true, there's still something about Lion that rings a hollow note. Part of might have something to do with director Garth Davis's approach to the material. As a fairly green feature length director, Davis injects the screen with liberal amounts of stylistic bravado, as if to show the audience what he as a storyteller can do. He uses a host of not just visual motifs but story devices to achieve his ends including prolonged fever dreams of the older Saroo (Patel), struggling with the penumbras of his young brother Guddu (Bharate) desperately searching for him. This of course is all set to a score that plucks on the heart strings like the licks of a wistful sitar.<br/><br/>It's dapper film work to be sure, but it does surprisingly little as world building technique. That problem that is compounded when the young Saroo (Pawar) travels to Australia to meet his new parents (Kidman and Wenham). The camera likes to doddle on Saroo gingerly touching a TV for the first time and seeing a full fridge for the first time and ignores the multitude of micro-expressions that the cast is trying convey. At many points Lion felt less like a movie about people than about moving parts.<br/><br/>The best parts of the film are the parts that feel the most honest. The scenes involving the budding courtship of college-aged Saroo and Lucy (Mara), all have a certain giddiness to them. On the opposite side of the emotional spectrum, Nawazuddin Siddiqui's minor role is so effectively creepy that you almost forget he's one of the most recognizable pacesetters in modern Bollywood. There is also a quiet scene in a classmates kitchen where for the first time as an adult, Saroo realizes there is something dolefully missing from his bourgeois life. It is at that moment Patel truly shows he's got a range that few movies would allow him to exercise.<br/><br/>Yet every time Dev Patel, Nicole Kidman and Rooney Mara transcend to do some of their most compelling work, we're once again distracted by the shorthand version of truly effective film making. Sadly at these moments, you become aware that you're not watching the best version of this story but merely an inauthentic distillation. A white dude's version, of a white dude's script adapted for white people looking for the same high they got watching Slumdog Millionaire (2008).<br/><br/>Unfortunately Lion leaves a little too much to be desired as a cinematic experience. It dances frustratingly close to the edge of being not just good but great, but ultimately leans on cliché and hackneyed movie-of-the-week dramatics to pull its story through. Those inclined to see Lion, should definitely wait through the credits. Surprisingly you get more of an emotional payoff watching the Brierley family home videos than you do watching everything else."

Photography, pace, and atmosphere are all pitch perfect in the opening sequence in India, but what really draws you in is the charismatic performance by young newcomer Sunny Pawar. Dev Patel does a good job, but it is the flashbacks to the five-year-old boy, rather than concern for the man, that keeps you emotionally invested. Nicole Kidman is quietly powerful as a woman who surprises you by her choices and incredible strength. The film avoids sentimentality and completely earned the copious tears I gave up.

","The drama filled true story brings ups and downs that make people have a strong feeling of happiness and sadness all in one film. The film was different but in a very remarkable way. In the film, five year old little boy named Saroo gets lost on a train which takes him thousands of miles across India, away from home and family. Saroo must learn to survive alone in Kolkata, before ultimately being adopted by an Australian couple. Twenty-five years later, armed with only a handful of memories, his unwavering determination, and a revolutionary technology known as Google Earth, he sets out to find his lost family and finally return to his first home. In the movie the acting felt like it was the real people who actually went through this tragic event. They played their parts with strong emotions. While filming the movie they traveled to Kolkata, India as well to Australia. The cinematography was unique. The camera zoomed in on details like, Saroo tired and all dirty from traveling. The camera also showed important flashbacks from Saroo's past, it showed scenery that was like a foreshadowing for Saroo getting lost. The plot of the movie is quite interesting since it's a true story. The film used current events going on during the years of Saroo trying to find home. The movie introduced using Google Earth to try to find Saroo's home. The whole plot revolves around Saroo trying to find home, but twenty years later which makes everything a little bit difficult especially since Saroo does not remember a ton from the past. The setting and costumes and make-up was fantastic for the movie. Since they filmed in India and Australia it made it seem more realistic. Addition to how they made the costumes and make up really brought the viewer into the little kids perspective of traveling alone. Saroo as a child in the movie they had him wear dirty ripped clothes and make-up hand him look messy and dirty and tired. Which put all the pieces together and made the film even better. The music also helps shape the movie. The music helped different scenes of the movie. When there was a sad scene there would be darker and sadder music while during a happy scene they played more of a calm and relaxing song. In the end the movie overall showed many different elements that made this movie a well rounded film. Knowing this is a true story impacts everything and helps the film out even more.

"vineet-priya","9","0","0","19 October 2019"," Connects with your heart
","The movie LION connected with my Heart for several reasons....a few:<br/><br/>If you have a child, you know what it feels like losing him for even for a second, let alone a life time. Imagine having him shout out your name helplessly time and again while the sounds of crowds and blazing train horns muffle his sounds...I can't bear it and it was gut wrenching to see the movie capture it so realistically...all I wanted to do was kiss my boy and tell him I love him so much..<br/><br/>The second thing which really touched me was how the beautifully the movie attempted to connect back to the past, the past you really loved but left behind long ago......the desire to reach out and re live those moments, an attempt to go through the journey once again, a past etched in your memories as it was....<br/><br/>Having to let go of places you grew up, friends that were your life as a child but taken away is very difficult, the desire to just go back once to connect is so strong. Only someone who has had to move on often as a child or even as an adult can feel the pain and the need to connect so strongly.<br/><br/>Interestingly the past not may be as you imagined it to be when you revisit it years down the line but what's really special is those memories.. the memories will always be special - friends you wished never grew up, places you wished never changed. It's what we call in common terms nostalgia and beauty of it is that things, people, places move on but memories and Nostalgia never does. Which is why it is so special to have it deep inside you, uncorrupted, untouched from reality. The movie captured the emotions beautifully."

By just an lucky option Australian couple adopts the very small boy who has strong memory and a good heart.

Google Map technology is used extensively to clear a lot of boys memory this adds to his constant suppressed memory eruptions of and on .

With google maps help he comes nearer to find the name of village (Ganeshtalai) locates and a melodrama of re union is so tenderly filmed .... Tears just rolled down
A simple human true story so wonderfully told by all the people concerned . No doubt it won a lot of critical applause.
No villains, no big twists, Lastly though many feared it would be one of documentaries of a true story re told and wont reach the status of a feature film but Dev Patel's act the child stars and Nicole Kidman's out standing performance make this film really memorable."

","A beautifully shot, emotional movie that explores the concept of what it means to belong...
When a young boy becomes lost in the middle of India, the film shows how this displacement is both emotional too, not just physical - & how finding his way home can restore what he lost by bringing closure to an unresolved issue after 25 years - allowing the viewer to spectate at the powerful feat of a man piecing himself back together as an adult after being broken as a child through tragic accidental circumstances.
What's most endearing about Lion is how human the movie is; it wears its heart on its sleeve & embraces the resilience of the human spirit whilst also depicting the worst of it, creating a sense of honesty that the viewer can appreciate & admire.
Everything about it is beautiful - performances, cinematography, direction etc. & the fact that it's also a true story & told so well is worthy of praise too.

The last part of this film portrays his adventure to find his home and that makes me exiting because I expected that finding home far away from where he lives now using his childhood memories are almost impossible but he makes it. In that process, there are lot of dramas which make me moved as well, such as family problem and his relationship with his girlfriend.

","Imagine being separated from your family in a third world country, never to see them again. Then add in the fact that you're a 5 year old kid, who wakes up on a hot, empty train with only scraps of food and water. Despite all your cries for help, nobody does anything, and the few bystanders you pass simply stare as you scream. When the train finally comes to a stop, people push each other as they rush into the train car, and after managing not to get trampled you realize you have no idea where you are, no idea what language everybody else is speaking, and nobody seems to care about you.<br/><br/>Fast forward 25 years. You're a grown man, with a loving family and a stable relationship in Australia. But despite your new life, you can't shake the urge to find your biological mother, who's still in India searching for you, and the brother who called your name everyday for the past 25 years. And so, you embark on your journey to find them despite how impossible it may seem. Following only faint memories, you're willing to destroy your happy new life in Australia just for the chance to see your family one more time.<br/><br/>Armed with vague memories and Google Maps, Saroo finds his home through sheer determination and perseverance, and like the character development throughout the film, India has changed drastically - But it hasn't in the eyes of Saroo, who's once again a young boy running around the streets with his brother.<br/><br/>A gripping tale of strong emotions and painfully true scenes, Lion expresses the cruel conditions of India especially towards children that nobody seems to talk about. From the apathetic bystanders, pedophiles running around the streets, and the orphanage run by child abusers, one can't help but wonder ""How can this be true? Why isn't anybody doing anything about it?"""

"ccbrokaw-47382","9","0","0","16 January 2019"," Lion is an emotional rollercoaster that makes you feel agonizingly worried and heartwarmingly inspired all in the same couple of hours
","Director Garth Davis takes the compellingly true story of Saroo Brierley and turns it into an emotional screenplay to touch the hearts of many. Davis, a somewhat novice director, is better known for directing the television series Top Of The Lake (2013) and hasn't created much else since releasing Lion in 2016. While Davis hasn't has much experience creating major motion pictures, this sure doesn't show in the production of Lion.
Starting out in a small town in India, young, and perfectly casted, Saroo (played by the adorable Sunny Pawar) mistakenly boards a train taking him almost a thousand miles away from his home and family.
The entire first half of Lion is in Hindi, meaning watchers have to read the dialogue in subtitles. Some critics don't like having to read subtitles for a good portion of the movie, but I applaud Davis for this choice. I feel if this part of the movie was in English it would lose it's realistic touch. It really feels as though we have been thrown into rural india right alongside Saroo and his family.
After boarding the wrong train, Saroo wanders the streets of Calcutta, India where he faces starvation, and the alarmingly real danger of being trafficked. In addition to the fact that 5 year old Saroo doesn't know his mother's first name nor the correct name of his hometown, he also only speaks Hindi making it virtually impossible to him to communicate with the people of Calcutta, who speak Bengali.
At this point in the film I was so invested in the story of little Saroo I found myself at the edge of my seat willing someone to swoop in and help him. I finally spot Saroo's savior when Noor (Tannishtha Chatterjee) takes him under her wing, or so I thought.
After his stay at Noor's house almost ends tragically, Saroo escapes her grasp and finds his way to an orphanage. He finally finds peace when he is adopted by an Australian couple (David Wenham and Nicole Kidman). At this bittersweet point in the movie, I was conflicted and didn't know whether to feel happy or sad for Saroo. On one hand he finds a safe and loving home; but on the other hand he has to live with the fact that his family will always be searching for him.
The harrowing first half of the movie is juxtaposed with the second half as we are introduced to successful, Aussie Saroo 20 years later. The tragic story of a little boy lost on the streets now transitions into a sort of self- discovery movie as Saroo struggles with finding his identity. While Saroo finds a great job, loving parents and even a stable girlfriend, he continues to struggle with not knowing the life he left behind in India as a young boy. He immerses himself into searching for his hometown using the newly released software Google Earth and a map of India pinned on his wall. Saroo's girlfriend struggles to get him off the couch and out of the house as he becomes more and more obsessed with the idea of finding his family. Saroo is haunted by the idea that he lives this lavish life while his genetic family is still living in extreme poverty.
This movie did a good job of opening my eyes to the catastrophic issues of poverty, starvation, and inadequate child protection services faced by millions of people in underdeveloped countries. It's one thing to read statistics and articles on this subject but another to become totally emotionally invested in characters living in these conditions. At the end of the movie, viewers get a glimpse of real footage taken the day Saroo was reunited with his birth mother. Titles then appear on the screen informing viewers that ""Over 80,000 children go missing in India each year"", quite a shocking amount. I feel the purpose of this movie was not only to recount the harrowing tale of Saroo Brierley but to encourage viewers to want to help the children in underdeveloped countries (specifically India).
This film did an amazing job recounting a true story and reaching an audience who wouldn't normally watch films about global issues. Lion is a powerful story of searching for your family and finding yourself along the way. I would recommend Lion to anyone who is looking to feel petrified by a harrowing tale, and moved by a heartwarming tearjerker all in the same hour and 98 minutes."

","Nothing could prepare one for the emotional experience of watching this movie. Overwhelmed by tears that would heed to no reason. The little Sunny Powar tugs at your heartstrings and you weep as if he's your own. You walk with him, see the world through his eyes, see him too and you melt in all that this kid personifies. His intuitive sense of things that are beyond what he can understand, to be able to catch the whiff of danger and to flee every time, his strength and bravery, even at that young an age. Telling the tale that memories don't die. They come back at an unexpected moment to haunt you. A visual of something long forgotten. A fleeting fragrance. The weapons with the power to kindle violence in the mind. As Saroo struggles with his yearning for a past long lost, you cry with him. You want him to find them. You want him to get all that he seeks. In that moment when he has all but given up, on that last thread of the rope he's been hanging on, he looks outside his box. He dares to look beyond logic and there it is, the past right before his eyes. Daring to go back to a hurting past and finding love - an incredibly beautiful journey that you are fortunate to be part of. There you learn, although you cried that the child was separated from his brother and mother, how many more lives has he touched because of that fateful incident. Had he stayed there on that station, it might have been a life of forgotten misery without the guiding light of his brother. But now fate propels him to bless the lives of souls far-away and through his movie, touch the hearts of many. A roaring tale of love and perseverance."

","The whole ""based on a true story"" mantra has been done to death in Hollywood, but every once in a while you'll come across a film that actually lives up to the tagline. 2016's 'Lion' is a prime example, as the Garth Davis directed drama tells the amazing story of an Indian man who was separated from his family at a young age, only to end up as an adopted son a continent away in Australia.<br/><br/>From start to finish, 'Lion' is a touching tear-jerker of a film. We see life through the eyes of Saroo (portrayed by Sunny Pawar and Dev Patel), who unfortunately gets onto a train that takes him far far away from home. This journey is one that forces Saroo to grow up very quickly, and when he gets adopted by a loving Australian couple, John and Sue Brierley (David Wenham and Nicole Kidman), he gets a sense of stability and opportunity. But it isn't too long before he gets the itch to locate his ""real"" home and family.<br/><br/>What 'Lion' does very well is tell the story of Saroo through beautiful visuals and sound. The soundtrack adds to the magic of the story, and the majestic landscapes of India and Australia are shown throughout. In terms of acting, Patel and Kidman especially deliver strong performances. Rooney Mara also doesn't disappoint as the girlfriend of Saroo, as she is a pivotal force during a time when he questions many things. And then of course Google does a fine job in its supporting role. There are also many themes that take center stage during 'Lion,' from identity to forgiveness and, of course, family - whether real or adopted.<br/><br/>'Lion' is a powerful film that carries a strong message and serves as a beacon for all those who are separated from their families but still believe they will find their way home."

","Lion, a film created in 2016 was the most impactful film I have watched in some time. Throughout my life, I have viewed films depicting the adoptee experience, leaving me uninspired to watch more. These films did not elicit deep emotions, such as the film: Somewhere Between, created in 2012. The only emotion this film did evoke was anger; that these films left me wondering about the impact of adoptees being raised with such a limited understanding of their roots and culture. As an international adoptee who was raised in my birth country, I own a different understanding of cultural identity than many international adoptees. <br/><br/>Compared to other films about adoptees, Lion showed more in depth visual experiences of an adoptee who learns his past through his own flashbacks. This led the lead character Soroo to become unsure of his identity and inability to trust in sharing his traumatic memories with his close relatives and friends. For much of his life, he had not questioned his parents reason for adopting, yet he felt conflicted about his flashbacks and feeling the need to be grateful for his current family. <br/><br/>I greatly appreciate knowing that the filmmakers presented a more authentic, realistic, and complex look at the impact of losing one's birth family and culture and more so, to have a missing link to one's identity untouched by the adoptee's adoptive family. Soroo both wanted to find his own truth about his missing past, his memories that he didn't understand, while protecting his adoptive parents from pain.I was engaged analyzing Soroo's complex and sometimes conflicting thoughts and actions as well as his internal drive to find his own truth.The most memorable scene was Soroo's return to his birthplace, knowing that his birth mother had waited for him to find her for fifteen years. Powerful. Compelling."

"bobandlulureview","8","0","0","23 May 2018"," ROARING SUCCESS
","Lion is based on the book A Long way Home written by Saroo Brierly and is based on his life. 
The movie is about a 5 year old boy Saroo (Sunny Pawar) from Khandwa, Madhya Pradesh, India, a child of a labourer, who gets separated from his brother, Guddu (Abhishek Bharate) at a railway station and ends up in a train that takes him all the way to Kolkata. Despite his frantic attempts, he is unable to get help from anyone to take him back to his place, 'Ganestalay'. After facing a lot of travails and escaping from the clutches of child snatchers including the syrupy faced Noor (Tannishtha Chatterjee) who feeds him and bathes him only to make him presentable to Rama (Nazwazuddin Siddiqui), Saroo finally finds himself in a children's home which is no better than the outside world. There are shady things happening in this place and Saroj Sood (Deepti Naval) has taken it upon herself to rescue the children from this place. 
Saroo gets adopted by an Australian couple Sue and John Brierly (Nicole Kidman and David Wenham) and flies to Tasmania where he begins to settle in. The Brierlys adopt another boy from India, Mantosh who unlike Saroo has some difficulty adjusting with the family. 
The story moves forward in time and Saroo is now 26 years old (played by Dev Patel). He is an Australian now right down to rooting for the Australian cricket team rather than the Indian. He moves to Melbourne to study hotel management where he meets Lucy (Rooney Mara). A meal with his Indian friends brings back memories from India and with Lucy's encouragement Saroo begins to trace his roots to India using Google Earth. Whilst Saroo is drawn to India, at the same time, he is feeling conflicted wondering if tracing his biological mother would mean betraying his adoptive mother.
Will Saroo continue in his search for his hometown in India? Will he locate ""Ganestalay""? Will he be reunited with his mother and brother?
When I started watching the movie, I was wondering what all the fuss about Sunny Pawar was. I had seen better child actors. But as the movie progresses, you find that there is something so endearing about Sunny. He isn't ""acting"", acting and it would appear that film has captured a real life incident as is and that Sunny is the real Saroo, a lost and confused 5 year old who somehow still manages to have his wits around him. 
Lion received 6 Oscar nominations and won two BAFTAs. It is also the highest grossing Australian film of all time. 
All actors including those with minor roles (Guddu, Mantosh) have done a wonderful job. A special mention to Nawazuddin, whose screen appearance is less than 2 minutes but sends chills down your spine. 
Sunny Pawar, no doubt, is the star of the show. The film shows Sunny walking barefoot, covered in filth, rummaging through all that garbage in search of food and gets you wondering how does one film such a scene so realistically! His face looks unwashed, his eyes crusty and there's dried mucous around his nose!
The film beautifully captures emotions of the actors. The mother's anguish over her lost child, the blind hope of being finally traced by his mother, the joy of laying eyes on their adopted child who has travelled from across the world, the guilt of having led a comfortable life while your family may still be unaware of your survival, the conflict of having to choose biological over adopted...
The film doesn't have many dialogues but manages to tell the story beautifully. The ending is bittersweet but then all's well that ends well. 
Throughout the entire movie, you wonder why the film is called Lion. I even thought it was because Dev Patel's hair hangs loose from his head like a mane (!!!). The title of the movie is explained towards the end and I may have shed a tear or two."

","From a poor rural Indian family, 5-year old Saroo ends up in Calcutta, over 1,000 miles from home. Unable to explain where he comes from, he is ultimately adopted by an Australian family. Still troubled by the memories of his first family, the invention of GoogleEarth enables him to look for the childhood home he lost<br/><br/>This is a great, great story, and I really wanted to like this film rather more than I did.<br/><br/>There is a lot which is good about it. Dev Patel as adult Saroo is excellent, Nicole Kidman and David Wenham are both good as his adoptive Australian parents - I had to put to one side my feeling that they are the ""go to"" Australians for these sort of parts in recognition of box-office clout - and Sunny Pawar as young Saroo is also very good. So the performances work.
The location work, both in India and Australia is also good although, again I had to put a lid on a strong feeling that I had only recently seen Indian youngsters suffering hard times in slums in Slumdog Millionaire.<br/><br/>But two things meant that this film was not the success for me which I had hoped it would be. One was the fact that I think it would have worked much better as a dramatisation than an adaptation - if the narrative had not featured Saroo's fellow adoptee, his troubled ""brother"" Mantosh, or his American girlfriend Lucy, both of whom were major obstructions to the narrative flow without having any dramatic purpose (other than that they actually existed), the film wouldn't have felt quite so bumpy.<br/><br/>And the other thing is that much of it took far too long to make its point or, having made it, lingered far too long before moving on. I understood the purpose of showing us the enormity of 5-year old Saroo vs Calcutta - how huge, how daunting, how terrifying for a small child. But I think the audience - or this member of it, at any rate - got the point a good 10 minutes before it stopped being shown. Ditto the train journey to Calcutta. Ditto Saroo moping around Melbourne.<br/><br/>The film is 2 hours long, and would have been a much more involving experience at half an hour less.<br/><br/>I wouldn't discourage anyone from seeing it - the final sequence is worth seeing on its own - but, for me, it was a worthy effort which didn't quite succeed."

","LION was a fantastic film that must be watched by everyone. All actors were amazing but I was absolutely blown away by Sunny Pawar, who played young Saroo. He pulled the audience's heart strings with the struggles he faced trying to return home. I was also equally amazed at the child actor that played the role of Saroo's adopted brother. His performance in the short amount of time he had on screen was raw and astounding. He managed to make the audience feel various emotions and you can see that he must of faced a lot of conflict and has suffered which made him the way he is now. Both child actors gave an outstanding performance in their roles. When Saroo is a grown man he has relationship problems with his girlfriend which created some drama. I thought this was unnecessary and was not needed in the film. Otherwise, the film was great and all the actors did an outstanding job in their roles."

Dev Patel continues the story as grown up Sheru, providing insight into the struggles felt, whilst in collaboration with Nicole Kidman and David Wen-ham, who both are outstanding within their roles. <br/><br/>The script is unique and captivating, as a fair part of the film is in Hindu with english subtitles to support audiences.

","Lion was a movie un like no others. It contained elements of authenticity and originality, it strayed away from that basic storyline of a rom-com or thriller that almost every movie sticks to. Contributing to this creativity, the fact that it was based of a true story; portraying a small Indian boys journey over the course of 25 years added a touch of vulnerability that incredibly appealed to the viewers empathetic side. <br/><br/>Although the movie illustrating a journey of 25 years it didn't seem to lack excitement or suspense - due to the directors use of an engaging soundtrack and the cinematography complementing the overall essence of the concept of the film. <br/><br/>However I have to agree the first third of the film where it is placed within India and scripted in Hinid gave the reader a real sense of the background story engaging them. Yet later on when we see the conversion of ""20 years later"" it looses that touch of authenticity, which in some cases may detach the viewers. There are also some aspects within the second half of the film that may seem unnecessary and neither add nor take away from it, so I believe they could of left those out and more focusse on Saroos' (main character) culture, highlighting it's importance.<br/><br/>Although maybe losing some viewers in the middle I believe the ending summed up the film perfectly and reached into EVERYONE'S emotional side, portraying Sarros' first time seeing his mum after 25 years.

Dev Patel expressed the distress he was experienced was shown through his body language and tone in his voice, his ability to communicate Saroo's story in such a enthralling way made the film more enticing. <br/><br/>The only part of the film which wasn't as outstanding was the romantic relationship between Saroo and Lucy felt as though it dragged the movie on to make it longer and had no place within the movie, making the second half of the move less captivating as it had no connection to the suffering. <br/><br/>The filmmaking was very riveting, the transitions glided through the movie and through the use of the soundtrack, the audience was allowed to follow the journey of Saroo.

However this was the complete opposite for me, during the film it didn't even feel like it was an effort to read them.<br/><br/>However, during the middle of the movie when he was using google maps to search for his home town, it dragged out to long. In between the main character Saroo searching using the platform google earth many complications occur which drag outs the process. <br/><br/>I think the fact that this is a true story played a massive part in the conclusion having such an impact on me. By including the description, facts and images of the real life footage makes this a powerful film that addresses the issue of young children in India. It makes people question what happens to children that do actually get lost. Who helps lost children? What are the dangers faced by these lost children? Why do certain people choose to adopt?? How do the parents go about trying to find them? Do people and companies actually help look for the parents of these lost children?<br/><br/>Overall this was a great movie to watch, with excellent actors and a great simple storyline!"

","This movie is a major tear jerker and beautiful story! The first part of the movie is absolutely fantastic with Sunny Pawar's amazing performance that draws the audience in so well. It's fair to see he is a star on the rise! <br/><br/>The movie has a beautiful and real story line and although it has been changed to be a Hollywood film the authenticity is still there especially in the opening act when the Hindi language is used and in the end when their are real life shots shown. <br/><br/>Although this movie is fantastic the second half when Dev Patel is main the movie quality shifts from a 9/10 to a 7/10. This is because this part feels a lot slower and feels as though something is missing, it is almost as if as an audience member you feel less empathy and connection with the character. <br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this movie as I think it is very different to what you see these days in movies and I think the quality and story is amazing!"

","Lion is a film about the journey of a young Indian boy who was adopted into an Australian family and searches for his birth mother. The storyline is uplifting, hopeful and astonishing. It is hard to believe that a person can find their home using Google Earth. The use of technology to find his home is amazing as at the time Google Earth was a new feature for the internet. This small part of the film alone will move amaze you. <br/><br/>The cast is incredible from the uprising child star Sunny Pawar who stars in the first third of the film. Through to Dev Patel who leads the rest of the film and carries on Saroo's journey to find his home. Nicole Kidman, David Wenham and Rooney Mara, although having limited screen time assist with convincing the audience of the miraculous story of Saroo. 
 
There is so much diversity this film has to offer. Although it is a true story, it is unlike anything seen in the cinematic world. It is not only about one thing; being lost, romance; a journey. It contains multiple aspects of films from action to romance and the whole plot encompases teh main idea of finding something and going on a journey to do so.<br/><br/>Not only is the ending incredible but the whole plot and everything from the cast, cinematography and soundtrack is amazing."

","I have recently watched this film, and absolutely loved it! The beginning was able to set the scene and make us, the viewers, feel connected and aware of the realistic events in which take place beyond the film. It makes us come to the point of realisation of how appreciative and the numerous opportunities we are given in comparison to other individuals. The film was inspiring and well edited to make it seem real in today's world. Family is a significant factor in the film, which allows a range of emotions to appear to our attention. The characters take family for granted, and respect one another, even through the hardships and losses. Simply losing a young child, impacts not only the parents and the sibling/s, but the entire community. <br/><br/>I truly recommend this film, especially if you are someone experiencing hardship and/or difficulties in life, as it would subsequently help you find a path and sense of guidance of hope, throughout this inspiring film!"

","*SPOILER ALERT* 
It is hard to review and make out coherent sentences when I am still blown away at the emotional rolloercoaster that is LION. There are so many major points that make this film a triumph of cinematography. the film begins in India, where it stays for about two thirds of the rest of the movie, which advances the plot and helps audience create an emotional bond with young Saroo, played by the new and unbelievably talented Sunny Pawar. To explain as simple as I can and to not give away any of the plot, Pawar's scene on the train was so powerful, I doubt people five times his age could have brought me to tears like he did. 
I also want to make note how much I respects that all the dialoge from India was in another language, as this keeps it authentic and realistic, and pushes away that Hollywood idea that this film has to be made so us english speaking folk don't have to make the effort of reading subtitles. With emotional bonds formed with Saroo, Guddu and their mother, we then find ourselves pulled into the present, with only mere flashes of the past, bringing us back to that emotional state and feeling the same sense of lost identity and depression that Saroo would have been feeling at the time. This, mixed with the powerful acting of all of the supporting cast, makes for an experience you will never want to forget."

","LION is based on a true story. Through a touching journey the audience embarks upon an emotional rollercoaster. The film takes us into the life of a young indian boy losing his family and ones he's grown up trying to find them again even though they are miles apart. The film is filled with hope and loss. 
The beginning of the film is filled with sadness and despair as a the young boy loses his older brother and is taken away on a train he cannot escape. He continues to search for him as he neglects the idea he has lost him forever. 
Most of the film is in subtitles and it really brings the true story to life. 
The second part of the film we see the young boy flourish in Australia only to realise something is missing as he does not know who he truly is. He feels lost and realises the only way to find himself is to find his family, thus he begins a miraculous search through google earth. <br/><br/>It is an amazing film and should be seen by all."
"tahliaheininger","7","0","0","2 May 2018"," Lion - The Journey of Saroo
","Lion is a movie that I would recommend all to watch. Compelling, enthralling and heart wrenching, this movie is one you will remember. The first third of the film was by far the best. It provided huge insight into the life of many in India. It demonstrates how poverty and danger surrounds the everyday routine of the people who live there and thus creates an emotional bond between us and the character Saroo. As an audience there is something compelling you to help him. You want him to be safe and find home, despite his failure to do so. The movie wasn't at its best when it came to the scenes 25 years after this. Saroo starts remembering his past and looking deeper into it before he tries to search for it on google maps. I thought this part wasn't as interesting and there were many parts which I thought were not needed. This was a let down considering that the first part of the movie was so amazing. However, near the end of the movie where Saroo starts having flashbacks and eventually finds his old home before travelling there, the atmosphere becomes more intense and anticipating. The end scene effectively highlighted the significance of finally finding his home and greatly stirred the emotions of the hearts of the audience. The end scene showing the real Saroo Brierley also gave this event much more meaning. Overall, Lion did contain some unnecessary scenes and in some parts I was a bit bored, but it also had some incredibly artistic scenes, often ones that tugged at your heart and was well-worth seeing."
"roilovable","7","0","0","22 April 2018"," A movie may not that attractive but enough impressive
","Lion is a high score movie with IMDb rating of 8.1, telling a true story. The story is based on the non-fiction book A Long Way Home by Saroo Brierley. It has received six Oscar nominations, including the Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor and Actress and other heavyweight awards.
The film tells of an Indian boy, Saroo, getting lost from young age. Fortunately, he was adopted by Australian couple The Brierley who led him to Tasmania to start a new life. When Saroo was in university, he decided to find his hometown and heritage which led him going to India and meeting his mother and sister again after 25 years.
In the first half of the filming of India, the depiction of emotions was extremely delicate. Saroo's junior actor portrayed the bewildered and fearful in details, his expressions were full of realism. In addition, director's ability of rhythm controlling of this part is also very good. The narrative of the story is smooth and coherent. The details are appropriate, and the environmental background, the relationship between the characters, and the personality are all clearly defined. The most notable scene is when junior Saroo was chased by traffickers on the underground street. The film used a shaking motion to switch quickly from the front and back sides of Saroo to create an atmosphere of intense oppression. 
In the latter half of the film, it formally entered the Australian scene. It still has the perfect scenes, background music and acting. However, may be influenced by the length of the movie, loopholes begin to appear at the rhythm. Especially when the scenes of reality and memories are shifted, the movie may consciously want to create a sense of ambiguity in memory, but made the audience feel confused. The development of the story began at a fast pace, which caused a certain degree of obstacles to understanding. 
In addition, it is worth mentioning that the figure of Saroo's brother Guddu, although not much played, is the character that connects the beginning to the end of the series. Guddu was the key figure for Saroo's lost and homesick plot. His death was the biggest regret in the movie. In my opinion, the use of a supporting role with fewer supporting characters as the tandem of the entire emotion is the most glorious place of Lion. It is also the most moving point of this movie as an adaptation of the real story. It blurs the boundaries between art and reality, allowing movies to connect viewers with this story not only as a cultural product but as an emotional medium.
Lion is one of the leader film dealing with feelings. Delicate in portraying, clever in expression, the movie's plot is not that attractive but the emotions from it is impressive. It reflects a unique Australian warmth that touched every audience."
"CinematicInceptions","7","0","0","20 April 2018"," Pretty cool story that could easily make you cry.
","Maybe this was an issue that other people experienced and maybe not, but I watched this movie on Netflix and for some reason, the subtitles from the fist half of the movie started playing during the second half. I later confirmed that this wasn't supposed to happen, but while I was watching it, my mom went off on this theory that it was intentional and the subtitles were showing up later because Saroo was remembering all the things from his journey as a five-year-old. While this doesn't really apply to the movie that you'll probably see, it does speak to the quality of the movie. First of all, it shows that, even though the subtitle thing wasn't intentional, there was enough thought put into the movie that it seemed plausible that it might have been intentional. Also, I don't think I actually missed that much by not seeing the subtitles the whole first half. I felt like I understood everything that was happening, which speaks well to the acting and directing and content of the scenes.<br/><br/>I didn't find that I was terribly moved by the movie, but I can see how many people would be and I've had a couple people tell me that they cried at it. I definitely felt for the five-year-old Saroo as he made his way through India. The Revenant may have taken place under more extreme conditions, but I was more invested in and impressed by Saroo's survival. Things slow down a bit after he gets adopted, and the scenes of Saroo trying to find his way back home were less engaging to watch. It is pretty amazing that he was able to find his way back after so many years having only distant memories to guide him, but I think there were just less stakes with it. I can see how it would have been very emotional for Saroo since he had no idea if his family would even be alive if and when he did find them. But the suspense just wasn't real for me as a detached audience member and it made the ending flatter.<br/><br/>There is a decent amount of attention given to Saroo's foster parents, and even his other adopted brother. It made me think more about the idea of adopting kids in a way that makes me now more supportive of it. <br/><br/>The Oscars verdicts for this movie I think were just. It didn't deserve to win, but the nominations it got were earned. It definitely has the potential to be one of your favorite movies of 2016, maybe even your favorite movie overall if you can relate to enough of it. For most people, though, I would say that you will appreciate it and maybe enjoy it. It's not forgettable at all, but neither is it anything that special. It's in the upper half of movies based on fact, but is hardly the best in an objective sense. But if you're the type of person who likes movies that make you cry, you will not want to miss this. Overall Rating 7.5/10."

","Based on a true story: In rural India in the 1980s, Saroo (Sunny Pawar) is a five year-old boy from a poor family. After being separated from his family in a bizarre incident, he is eventually adopted by an Australian couple (Nicole Kidman and David Wenham). During his adult life in Melbourne (portrayed by Dev Patel at this point), a flashback memory gives him the urge to find his birth family despite very difficult odds.<br/><br/>In the movie's first section in India, director Garth Davis collaborates perfectly with young actor Pawar as they take the viewer down the memory lane of childhood. While Saroo's plight is more severe than most of us have ever experienced, these early scenes can easily recall one's own childhood experience of the vulnerability of being separate from loved ones and surrounded by strangers. In the portrayal of Saroo as a young boy, Pawar is easily loveable as he brings the perfect mix of innocence and vulnerability plus wisdom and courage beyond his years. It would be proven later that Saroo's inner-strength was exceptional compared to other children who shared his fate.<br/><br/>Most of the movie's second half has less impact than the earlier scenes. Patel's performance is good enough but it has less depth than that of Pawar in the continuation of the main role. It's like a relay race in which the first runner is way ahead in the race but when he passes the baton to the second runner, the team starts falling behind. It doesn't help that Rooney Mara, who plays Saroo's girlfriend, is equally lacking in depth. The scenes between Patel and Mara are the movie's weakest moments.<br/><br/>But there are some blessings in the second half. Kidman lights up the screen every time she's on it. Sadly though, like the Michelle Williams role in the recent ""Manchester by the Sea"", Kidman's role is too small.<br/><br/>The biggest saving grace for the second half is its final scene which is truly magical. There's also a bonus in how the viewer learns how this movie got its title.<br/><br/>""Lion"" can be placed in the same category of ""Philomena"" among rich films based on adopted children trying to find their biological families."
"Jonathanraven1980","9","0","0","15 March 2018"," A masterpiece of cinematic wonder and minimalist dialogue which will fill your eyes with tears.
","I haven't had tears in my eyes this much for any movie I can recall. This was a truly emotional movie. Even now writing this, I'm fighting back the tears, that's how moving this movie is. I'm a man in his 30's, and lit it be said that men cry too.<br/><br/>This movie, where to begin. Powerful story telling with few words. It combines minimalist dialogue with a cinematic experience that blends environment with splendid acting to create a very REAL experience. Within minutes I found myself completely immersed in the world of Saroo and Guddu.<br/><br/>I won't spoil details, but I will say, this movie is a must watch. It's not a Hollywood action flick, so if you're the type of person who needs constant visuals to be entertained, this may not be for you. The movie progresses steadily but slowly, and the whole while you may have tears welling up in your eyes. I did. Almost every moment of this movie. No movie has had this profound an effect upon me. Despite it's slow burn, it ultimately ends up being a gripping movie. I was on the edge of my seat with wonder and curiosity, with sadness, and happiness, and even at times fear and outrage and shock. There are scenes which hint at a darkness in the world of Saroo's childhood. <br/><br/>This is a moving story of a child who becomes lost and his 25 year story. It is sad, but uplifting in its finale.<br/><br/>One final note, is I would have liked to have found out more about Mantosh. I won't say anything other than that. His character was curious, and sad. But I felt his story could have been elaborated on more, hence 9/10 instead of 10/10.<br/><br/>This is a masterpiece."

","With half of the film taking place in India, the movie ""Lion"" captures the vivid imagery of Saroo Brierley's village of Ginestalay in Khandwa, India. Spending a small snippet of his childhood life in the remote village, Saroo and his older brother, Guddu, are always traveling and playing around in their village. One day, Saroo decides to go along with Guddu to his job at the train station where he later falls asleep. Guddu tries to wake him up, but Saroo is too deep in his sleep to rise. When Saroo does wake up, Guddu is no where to be found. Searching all over the train station, Saroo desperately tries to find his brother, going even as far as accidentally boarding one of the trains, in which he ends up falling asleep again. Little did Saroo know that he boarded a train inbound to Kolkata. After several days of traveling, Saroo faces the bustling crowd of a Kolkata train station. Eventually he is placed into an orphanage where he later is adopted by a couple from Australia. Growing up with his adoptive parents in Australia, Saroo begins to question his true origins. Although finding where one explicitly originated in India through Google Earth may seem like an impossible feat, the film ""Lion"" undermines the impossible, not only vividly transporting the audience to Saroo Brierley's childhood in India and adopted life in Australia, but also showcasing the true, emotive story of how technology enabled him to find his way home and reunite with his biological mother in India. Under the direction of Garth Davis, with actors Dev Patel, Sunny Pawar, Rooney Mara, David Wenham, and Nicole Kidman, this film will truly captivate all who watch it. 
 This movie is worth watching because it doesn't require one to be able to understand how to speak Hindi or Bengali. It provides enough visuals in order to understand what is going on in the film. In other words, even though half of the film is spoken in Hindi and Bengali, the emotions and expressions portrayed by the actors are executed phenomenally, enabling non Hindi speakers to understand what is going on. For example, when Saroo arrives at the Kolkata train station, he yells at the top of his lungs for his brother Guddu, displaying Saroo's lostness in a mass of people at the unfamiliar train station. 
 Also, this film is inspirational. It sends the message that even what people deem to be an impossible task, is actually possible-that is, if you put your mind to it. Being a motivational film, as this film is based off of a true story of Saroo Brierley's experiences, it portrays that one can find where one came from through the help of services like Google. While some may say argue that not everyone needs to or has an inclination to find where they came from (having the same situation as Saroo), the film nevertheless proves to be a motivational movie. Personally, after I had watched the film, I felt as if there was a hope, that what one deems impossible can be achieved through hard work and determination. It was a refreshing feeling to have. 
 In addition, this film is very heartwarming as the end will almost certainly put anyone to tears (or make them somewhat teary). In the end, Saroo finally locates the village he came from and ends up flying over to Ginestalay, reuniting with his biological mother. This moment is a very intimate moment between a mother and a son as they reunite with each other after many years of being separated. If that does not evoke emotion is some people, the part when Saroo asks where Guddu is will surely make anyone's heart wrench. Even at the very end of the film, they show the actual reuniting of the actual Saroo Brierley and his mother. This added clip adds to the ""realness"" of the film. 
 This film is also worth watching because of its precise attention to detail regarding imagery. It shows how Saroo, who now is an adult, navigated Ginestalay through google earth, paying close attention to the process of his finding. As Saroo clicks through the map, he has visions of Ginestalay, retracing his steps as if he were the younger version of himself running back to his home in the village.
 This film also raises awareness of the issue of poverty in India. While some may say that this film portrays India in a negative light, it actually does not as it instead informs those in the Western Hemisphere about India's condition. In other words, it alleviates ignorance as people will gain more knowledge about India's problem of poverty. This is a good thing as the exposure of India's poverty could possibly bring about change from people even all around the world who have watched the film. 
 For those who say that ""Lion"" has the same old ""Slum Dog Millionaire formula,"" not only are they stereotyping Indian-based films, but they are also discarding the fact that ""Lion"" and ""Slum Dog Millionaire"" have two completely different plots. Further, ""Lion"" is based on a true story-a story that is unique to Saroo Brierley. 
 In conclusion, ""Lion"" can be encapsulated as a phenomenal, motivational, informative, and beautiful film that everyone should watch"

","What a story this is! Incredibly remarkable and astonishing. A young Indian boy becomes lost 1600km from his home village. Months later he is adopted by an Australian couple, where years later he yearns to rediscover the location of his real family. After the first ten minutes, I could smell the awards fragrance. A powerful stench it is, but it has every right to attract golden statuettes. A real tearjerker in every sense, I advise you bring tissues. There is so much raw emotion here, both on the surface and embedded within the narrative. An important story that needed to be told to highlight the poverty and missing children of India. Then, to introduce Saroo to the privileged world, meant he adopted an internal conflict. Stay with his Australian family who provided him with a chance at having a good life, or locate his real family who might still be searching for him. Both have consequences which are explored rather well. Fortunately the Australian couple are the nicest and most generous people in existence, which makes Saroo's choice that much easier. A beautiful tender story, with plenty of rich depth. Dev Patel shines amongst the heavyweights in what is his best role. He is able to portray that internal conflict enigmatically to create an emotionally involving performance. It never felt falsified. Nicole Kidman, Rooney Mara and, a personal favourite of mine, David Wenham were are all fantastic and really supported Patel. Sunny Pawar, who plays young Saroo, was a revelation. He captured innocence and fragility. Google Earth has never been so useful, although I do find how Saroo utilised it to be rather coincidental in the film. It's slightly too melodramatic and emotionally manipulative for my taste, but when the last ten minutes arrived...I felt goosebumps. I let myself in and was overwhelmed with happiness. The addition of the real footage at the end was the icing on the cake. A truly wondrous drama that portrays generosity, resilience and happiness."

","Lion is certainly not the greatest film of all time, nevertheless, it is one of the few that engaged and amazed me, hence my ten stars. I have no illusions that the story was not simplified, homogenized and depicted to make its point, yet the kerygma of this stranger-than-fiction biography is indubitably true, and what a heart rending story it is! Along the way, the audience is given a slice of the hard life in low-caste and demimond India, and discover some idea of how many children there are abused and neglected. Out of this horror, just one little miracle, so unlikely, offers up the joy of hope and the promise in mere survival, if one persists in pursuit of truth. If any film earned the right to a happy ending, it is this one. If any single human ever deserved a good outcome, it is the protagonist in this film, not for his (their) good acting, but for the real life tragedy incredibly erased, out of a sudden flash of memory. 
 (How much we take for granted in the First World, complaining that the electorate and politicians don't do enough for citizens and resident aliens who suffer relative want or injustice. What a joke our real-enough problems are by comparison! The agony in the slums of India, or North Korean slave labor camps, or Syria, and many more such countries, makes a homeless person in America much closer to Jeff Bezos than he would be to those wallowing and dying in Third World squalor! While we freak out over the potential that mother earth is being hurt by too much anthropogenic emissions, there are real people, by the hundreds of millions, suffering torture, extermination, starvation and callous neglect in dozens of nations around the world.) This fine film, Lion, shows us how good we have it here, and how much help the truly desperate need. It touches on many other points, too. Some characters clearly are led to extremes for survival, but others are evil for mere easy advantage or gain, and also, the adoptive brother demonstrates the limits of kindness and love for the unfortunate few who suffer brain trauma or psychosis, as a caring Australian couple do their best to help two boys, but only one surmounts his stumbling blocks. To sum up, all I can say is ""wow!""!!
 I close on the music of Sia, ""Never Give Up"", played over the end credits. Talk about icing on the cake, this made me wonder how often we walk away with positive dharma in our heads when the music adds to your already high opinion. It is the ideal lyric and music for the film. I have no problem with marketing when it drives more people to such a film, to promote the hope inherent in life, striving, and following Sia's call to ""Never Give Up."""

""Lion (2016)"" touches the issue of how children are kidnapped, managed and sent to unknown destinations, where prostitutes are painted as false mothers to delinquents who may well sin of pedophiles. The best for these children is to be adopted by decent families although they will never forget where they are coming from and look forward to come back and meet their relatives.

Simple premise - Saroo (Pawar - one cute kid!) helps his brother, Guddu (Bharate), little sister Shekila (Solanki) and mother (Bose) to survive in the Indian poverty, when one day his brother accidentally loses him on a train station. Being only five, after travelling for two days, Saroo can't pronounce his home town correctly, so he ends up in a juvenile prison, along with thousands of other lost kids. The time spent (45min) with young Saroo builds his character and back story nicely, and displays the vibrant and bustling India.<br/><br/>Saroo is adopted by Sue (Kidman) & John (Wenham - needed a bit more to do) and given a great life in Hobart. They also adopt Mantosh (Ladwa) - Saroo (now Patel) grows up well-adjusted, Mantosh not so much. Saroo meets Lucy (Mara) at university in Melbourne and they fall in love. He then finally decides to search for his mother, brother and sister, which is a tough ask across the billion-plus people in India and the fact he doesn't know what region he's from.<br/><br/>The pacing is good - doesn't feel like a two-hour film - and I would rate this on the same level as 'Slumdog Millionaire': they both have some similarities, but quite a few differences, with Patel's charisma shining through and helping him to carry the film. The support cast is good, but he has to display the most emotion and the ending in India is beautiful. Decent score, great Indian and Tasmanian settings and a great story."

","'Lion' is a biographical tale about a 5 year old Indian boy who becomes lost, stranded thousands of kilometres from home. He manages to persevere, surviving a frightening passage of time and dealing with the challenges before he gets adopted by an Australian family. 25 years later, he sets out to find his real family. Its powerful stuff. <br/><br/>Sunny Pawar makes an impressive debut. The young actor is the heart and soul of the first half of the film, connecting your emotions with his plight of being lost, invested in seeing him safe. He wanders hungry and confused, whilst all manner of undesirables prey on his vulnerability. Dev Petel then brings the character even more depth years later as he comes to terms with his feelings regarding his real family, understandably empty knowing his mother and brother never knew of his fate/survival.<br/><br/>Then the whole film is complemented by a beautiful soundtrack that gradually gravitates towards uplifting perfection in Lion's final teary and well-earned moments. A truly mesmerising, true story that's been expertly transformed into a highly watchable drama that encapsulates the powerful nature of the human spirit that resides within us all.<br/><br/>9/10!"

","Finally, a movie to like. Really like. This film is a tearjerker, especially for those of us who had unusual childhoods.<br/><br/>I thought at first I was watching a foreign film, for nearly half the movie is spoken in Hindi. I tried repeatedly to download non- existent subtitles.<br/><br/>Clearly, I thought, the American viewing public, hopelessly self- absorbed in American culture with scant knowledge of cultures in other nations (ask yourself, how many Americans speak a foreign language? Have you seen ""American Sniper""?) would not stand for a movie in a foreign language with no subtitles.<br/><br/>But I was wrong. The Hindi language deepens the viewers' involvement, loses nothing in comprehension, and authenticates the transition from India to Australia, when English begins to be spoken.<br/><br/>Although the plot is well known, as is the ending, the story is so well told and so well acted, especially by the wide-eyed 5-year old boy, that this movie never bores.<br/><br/>Th first half, admittedly, is the more more interesting as it deals with India, through a child's eye, much the same as the ""Slumdog Millionaire"" was fascinating. But in the second half Nicole Kidman does such a fine acting job, without her long reddish-blonde hair and slinky dresses I had difficulty recognizing her at first.<br/><br/>I gave the movie an 8 instead of 10 because there is no expressed explanation why the little boy runs away from the Indian couple who shelter him, nor why from the hundreds of homeless children in the orphanage (and thousands in India) he is one of few ""brown-skinned children"" selected to go the Australia.<br/><br/>This movie is a BIG money maker. It is indeed gratifying, in an age of overly expensive but mediocre and often infantile, formula- repetitive, cartoon-like and CGI-overloaded movies, we can find and watch this gem.<br/><br/>Let's hope that there will be many more made like this."

Exceptional insight on certain subject matter, execution in cinematorgraphy, and outstanding performing cast.The landscape panorama and intimate camera-work contribute to the film's execution of character perspective and never let the film seem dragging. Going 40 minutes with either dialogue in another language or none at all, this film really transcends cultural and language barriers and communicates that actions really speak louder than words. In those 40 minutes, we, as an audience, see the world from the perspective of a lost 5 year old boy 1500 miles from home trying to get back to his family with no idea how to communicate with them. In addition, newcomer Sunny Pawar puts on an outstandingly genuine performance with his innocent demeanor that compels the audience to not take their eyes off him for a second. Transitioning from the first act to the second, Dev Patel also puts on an amazing performance as a man who struggles to reconnect with his own past and deal with his own identity crisis. Overall, the film succeeds in raising the question of the aspect of identity and provoking the audience to reflect and embrace it as something essential to our lives. It is extremely humbling and powerful to witness such a cinematic masterpiece and experience its emotional roller coaster. I recommend for everyone to watch it."

","Every once in a while comes a movie about survival that unknowingly ends up spreading the beautiful message of 'hope'. Lion is one such 'long' story of survival, a story that looses its way in the slums of Khandwa, struggles in the by lanes of Calcutta only to find solace in the arms of a childless couple living in Australia.Sunny Pawar is the little 'cub' here called Saroo who ultimately transforms into the 'lion' played beautifully by Dev Patel. It is great to see how the little hope in Saroo's eyes suddenly turns into 'questionable conduct' after 25 years when he realizes of his true origin and that's where Dev Patel actually scores as an actor. Nicole Kidman and David Wenham play these really humane characters who take this little brown-skinned boy under their wings giving him a life that every normal human child deserves. Rooney Mara is another great actress who emotes really well.Director Garth Davis directs his first feature film Lion and the result is a great story that brings together two lives, one lead by Saroo's Mother who despite her shortcomings never gives up upon her lost 'cub' and the other lead by Saroo's Mum who brings up a lost 'cub' and grooms him into a 'lion' making him competent enough to reach out to his mother even after 25 years. Had it not been for the Brierley's, Saroo may never have survived even to tell his story.Saroo is about that one such child who found his way home, there are million out there who don't even live to see that day."
"Laakbaar","8","0","0","16 July 2017"," An interesting story, well told
","This movie is based on an interesting true story. The strength of this film lies mainly in its ""slumdog"" portrayal of life in Calcutta for Young Saroo. But what made it also fascinating was the process of him getting so utterly lost as a child and then as an adult reversing the process by using modern technology to find out where he was from exactly. It really could easily have remained a lifelong mystery.<br/><br/>I am a little uneasy with the romanticisation of Indian poverty. I wouldn't enjoy that in any context, so I don't understand why it is practically glorified in some movies relating to India. I simply don't need to see this in movies. I don't go to movies to see extreme poverty. There is nothing of merit in showing it.<br/><br/>His reuniting with his mother was not so moving to me as it was apparently to some of the other reviewers. I found it mawkish. Don't get me wrong.

Not knowing the language or the address and the names of his family, he struggled from various threats in the society. After that he got adopted from an Australian family and the rest of the film revolved on his true identity. Haunted by his past, how he rediscovered his originality was emotionally told.<br/><br/>Very impressive film. The families should not miss it. Even though it is a must see by all ages. I am not a big fan of Dev's performances, even in his debut film 'Slumdog Millionaire'. After that success, he had survived in the film industry doing decent roles, for like a decade. But it was 'The Man Who Knew Infinity' that changed his career. For the first time I liked him very much in that, and again he was pretty impressive in this. The second best performance in his career. Though his part comes only after the half way mark. Yet in that one hour, he did great, particularly in the sentiments.<br/><br/>I was wondering why it was called 'Lion'. And I got answered only just before the end credit. So you should be patient to learn why, if you are yet to see it. It was not until the 90s the India began to see a real change. This story takes place in the mid 80s, only the opening half and those parts were raw and cruel, especially in the eyes of an 8 year old boy. That kid was so good. Just like Jacom Tremblay, a year before who impressed us with his performance from the film 'Room'.<br/><br/>It was a feature film debut for the director and he was wonderful in this attempt. The film splits into two, the first half was about lost and the following half is about finding the road back to the home. Less dialogues, but well written in those necessary parts. The music was good. Only negative was the film was out of depth. Yeah, all the events were like fast forward. If they had focused on details, the narration would have reached at least 3 hours. Especially I wanted the Australian mother's perspective on how she went through to raise those kids.<br/><br/>Now I'm waiting for the 2020. I mean 2008 was SDM, 2012 was LoP and 2016 was this one. The 4 years later, surely there will be another India related western film would come. Despite this film nominated for the 6 Oscars, it had won nothing. That's very sad.

"Screen_Blitz","8","0","0","24 June 2017"," Emotionally captivating as it is powerfully acted, Lion is an admirable true-story-based tale
","Some stories are difficult to believe until you witness them through the lens of a Hollywood director who takes from the pages of the autobiography. Focusing on a story of a young boy who face one of the most terrifying situations both a parent and a child would ever faced, this film tackles the hope and determination of a young man who will do anything in this power to return to the life he unwillingly left behind. The central figure of the story here is an Indian man named Saroo Brierly who was separated from his home at a young age and made major headlines upon his loss as well as his eventual return -- which didn't come until decades later. Garth Davis is the man responsible of bringing this strange, but true event to life in this emotionally powerful cinematic stride, and the concluding product is a both a beautiful and sobering biographical tale that makes a fair contender for tugging at your heart strings. Opening up in 1986, this movie follows five-year-old Saroo (played by Sunny Pawar), a young Indian boy living with his older brother Guddu (played by Abhishek Bharate) who he helps out with gathering coal to help their mother take care of the family. One night, when Saroo falls asleep on a train while looking for his brother, he wakes up to find the train moving and soon transported 1,500 miles away from his hometown. Stranded by himself with nowhere to go and no knowledge on how to speak anything outside his Hindi language, Saroo is adopted by an Austrailian couple Sue and John Brierly (played by Nicole Kidman and David Wenham). 25 years pass, Saroo (played by Dev Patel), now an adult, falls in love with college student Lucy (played by Rooney Mara). Along the way, he is introduced to Google Earth which he discovers he must use in order to track down his home and find his way to reunite with his family.<br/><br/>Garth Davis presents this inspiring tale with both melancholy and unexpected charm. Those who are even remotely familiar with the story are likely to predict both the midpoint and the final outcome. Nevertheless, Davis knows how to keep things intriguing for at least most of the run. This does not conclude that the story doesn't hit just a few weak points. The first hour brilliantly showcases the fear and utter puzzlement of young Saroo as he journeys through some unsettling obstacles including a group of homeless children who are abducted with no warning, and landing into an orphanage where children are treated with callousness. This contributes to an effective exploration of the underprivileged environment that Indians are forced to endure. Food is not easy to come by and the economy rests in a third-world state of condition. The entire trajectory of his half is beautifully shot by Greig Fraser and powerfully acted by Sunny Pawar who delivers a striking portrayal as the young lad. It is mesmerizing to watch as it is harrowing to sit through. And the the music score by Dustin O'Halloran and Hauschka is a thing of beauty. The second half exhibiting the story of Saroo as an adult where the film loses a little steam. Although the segment nicely operates with an endearing performance by both Dev Patel and Nicole Kidman as well as offering deep exploration into the relationship between Saroo and his newly adopted family, it doesn't escapes from its emotionally empty state, at least not until the final ten minutes when Saroo finally reaches his moment of triumph. In the midst of the harrowing atmosphere, the film leaves just a little room for some levity. And Garth Davis never slides into the zone of emotional or narrative contrivances. <br/><br/>Lion is both an uplifting and melancholy picture that strikes at the heart with some powerful deliveries in both the narrative and performance departments, and transcends the story into something of beauty. This film will not fail to leave some moviegoers reaching for the tissues, especially at the end. If you are one of the those people, no need to feel embarrassed. This is a true-story-based picture that deserves plenty of attention."

He doesn't think much of the idea then, but memories of his mother calling for him and his brother looking after him haunts him every single day. He starts narrowing down on the possible locations he could be from. This consumes him, he quits his job, breaks up with his girlfriend, and is straining on his relationship with his Australian family. He eventually finds the place that resembles his hometown, visits his mum and his sister, and finds that his brother is no more.<br/><br/>The movie is superbly acted. Dev Patel is authentic, as someone troubled with a difficult past. Nicole Kidman, Roonie Mara are good too. I was able to Dev's character, Saroo. Feel his emotions when his mother calls for him in his dreams, when he couldn't anymore continue as normal but all consumed with his quest, his happiness when he manages to find his mother and sister. I cried. Quite a bit. Perhaps being an Indian provided an extra connection to the small things, but I don't think most people would have a hard time anyway.<br/><br/>In the end, this movie is about confronting your past, seeking out those left behind. Many of us can connect to this and therefore this movie is a great watch."

","Lion Cast: Dev Patel, Nicole Kidman, Priyanka Bose, Sunny Pawar Lion is the true story of Saroo , a 5 year old kid living in Ganesh Thali a small neighborhood somewhere in Central India. It traces his journey from Ganesh Thali with his big brother Guddoo, his sister Shakila and their mother Kamala to a very different life in Australia with his adopted parents. In very unfortunate circumstances , he gets separated from his family in India and gets transported to a very different life in Australia with his adopted parents. He has seemingly forgotten his past but is reunited with his childhood memories when he accidentally sights a Jalebi . It is 2008 and Google has just released a new software called Google Earth and he sets about completing an impossible task of reuniting with his family. Dev Patel is brilliant as the 20 something Saroo who is haunted by his childhood memories. His eyes convery the anguish of a person who cannot let go of his past. He has played a similar role in 'Slumdog Millionaire' but this is a more memorable performance , aided by the script and the good work done by his co-stars. Nicole Kidman and Tanistha Chatterjee are ably cast in the role of his real and adopted mothers. The star of the film is without a doubt the child actor Sunny Pawar, the younger version of Saroo who conveys the joy in his simple life as well as the tragedy that he undergoes with equal elan. The film follows a tight script through out and concludes with some photographs and a vide from Saroo's actual life. Those real life clippings literally brought tears in my eyes. Also revealed in the end is the mystery behind the title of the film. All in all , a must watch and in my view one of the best English films with an Indian connection- miles ahead of the Oscar winner 'Slumdog Millionaire'."

","From the start, I must say that I am an avid movie-goer, and as a result, most movies that I see barely scrape the surface of what I would begin to call a 'good movie'. Lion makes the cut, and more than that, I would venture to say that it is one the best movies that I have seen all year, if not in the last few years. Beautifully shot and acted, and complemented by a script and direction that goes beyond the conventions of your typical movie, Lion invites you to join the amazing and emotionally profound journey of 'Saroo' as he searches to find his way back home, to his family, and to himself, after having been lost for over 25 years.<br/><br/>I am going to keep this review short. I watch a lot of movies - 1 to 2 every night - and I must say that Lion is a treat. It truly is movie making at its best. I am honestly surprised that it didn't win the best picture award at the Oscars. From a person that didn't care too much about the hit 'Slumdog Millionaire' a few years back, I must say that Lion is a step above the rest. A great movie that I must truly recommend. 9/10"

","This is a movie based in a true story, and although it could get really sentimental, the director has done an amazing work in not falling too much into it but presenting a realistic story that once in a while is good to watch and to remember us that there is always hope in this world.<br/><br/>The story and the setting might remind you of ""Slumdog Millionaire"", and also Dev Patel who is present in both, but that is mainly because we are not used to watch many Indian movies. While we watch this movie we follow the quest of the main character trying to find his family, which he was separated from as a child and by accident. Almost half of the movie takes place in Indian and we are shown the exact turn of events that happened to the main character as a child, which is interesting because normally it takes only 5 minutes to get the audience into situation but in here,the story is well developed so we can connect with the boy.<br/><br/>A powerful cast that provides a powerful performance that doesn't fall into cheeriness or sentimentality. They just show you what they feel and all time remind you that these people exist in real life, that is not just a novel but reality itself. Another strong point of the movie is the cinematography really beautiful and powerful that help the audience to connect even more with these amazing characters and feel like they are present there with them too.<br/><br/>A movie to reconnect with the world and to never lose hope no matter what the circumstances are or where you are, no matter who you were but who you really are.

","I have been dying to watch this film ever since it came out and didn't watch it until now on Prime Instant Video. I need to start out by saying that this film is quite emotional, but then again I cried during Dragons 2 and Fantastic Beasts, so you can't exactly trust my judgment. Anyways, I bawled during this film and I would definitely recommend it if you need some good old fashioned happy crying. Hence the title, it is certainly a feel good film. <br/><br/>My next big point about Lion is how artistic it is. Much like Manchester by the Sea, it can say more in silence than it can with words. I'm usually not a big fan of foreign films either, but though this one wasn't foreign, practically the entire first half is in Hindi, and I enjoyed it. Though it was in a language I do not understand I still found the emotions and expressions much more universal. <br/><br/>Finally, I need to comment on Sunny Pawar. Now Lion's cast is made up of some incredibly talented actors, especially Dev Patel, but they are all adults. It is difficult to find a child actor who is as capable as this kid. I mean where was he when the live action Jungle Book came out?! I was thoroughly impressed with his talent, as he is better than half of the adult actors I have seen. <br/><br/>So I am giving this film a 7 because it is not quite complicated or unique enough to really deserve anything above a seven, but it still does what it does with its own style and is beautifully done.

"cruise01","9","0","0","16 May 2017"," Beautiful emotional journey of a lost boy trying to find his way home.
","Lion is a strong emotionally driven film that hits around every corner about a five-year-old boy that gets lost in India. I was surprised about how good this movie was from direction, acting, the music score, and the plot, which is based on a true story about Saroo Brierley. This is one well done biographical film about his story, in 1986 when he was five years old and living with his older brother Guddu and younger sister and mother. They steal coal from moving trains to sell at the market to afford milk. Guddu tries to work at these one stop jobs and was supposed to work overnight. Saroo (Sunny Pawar) and Guddu are close as brothers. When Guddu leaves Saroo on a train station bench cause he couldn't stay awake for this job. Saroo not knowing when his brother will return, he hid inside a train and fell asleep. When he woke, the train is moving, not knowing how far away from home the train took him. Saroo is left roaming in the other side of India, were a different language is spoken. With no idea how to get home or find his family. He is left without shelter, coming across homeless kids, and guys that would kidnap the kids for money. Saroo then gets taken in by an orphanage. Were they found a family for him to live with in Australia. John (David Wenham) and Sue (Nicole Kidman) adopted Saroo into their lifestyle. Decades later, Saroo (Dev Patel) taking programs for hotel management. He meets a lovely Lucy (Rooney Mara), who he falls in love with. The one set back that is always preventing from peace is the thought of his real mother worrying. Saroo sets out, from the help of using google earth and retracing his steps on trying to find his hometown in India. <br/><br/>Lion turned out to be a really well film. The direction and cinematography capturing the India settings and the culture lifestyle. Also, the music score also set the mood and tone of the movie. It is a beautiful score and the sense of wonder that it creates. It is a sad emotional story of a journey that Saroo goes through. Even in the final moments of the movie, the scene was emotionally powerful seeing these people reconnect. What I really like about the film as well is the language spoken. Saroo and his brother spoke Hindi throughout the first half of the movie. Hollywood didn't have to tamper the material by having the characters speak English. <br/><br/>Sunny Pawar is a charming talented kid. It is an emotional roller coaster seeing this kid go on the journey of trying to find his home. When it comes to a scene, were he has a bent spoon and going through the motions, pretending to eat soup when he is starving. And mimicking a young guy in a café shop eating soup was very hard to watch. Dev Patel is a great actor, playing an older Saroo and how his inner self is struggling with the thought that his mother is worried. Rooney Mara is a beautiful actress. David Wenham and Nicole Kidman are both great. <br/><br/>Lion is a really good biographical film, which at times may be difficult to watch seeing homeless kids struggle. The journey Saroo goes through is a powerful one and from the final moments in the movie. Should bring tears of joy seeing how everything is resolved. Definitely worth checking out for its story, the acting, and the movie itself is well done."

","As tragic as is the fate of the young boy Saroo (Sunny Pawar) at the beginning of the story, I was struck by the magnitude of missing children annually in India noted at the end of the film - eighty thousand! One wonders how that could even be possible. The scene that really got me was when Saroo asked Mrs. Sood the question in my summary line above. It was as if he knew that no one really tried, though in a country of over a billion people and being almost a thousand miles from home, the odds approximated the proverbial needle in a haystack.<br/><br/>You'll need to keep the Kleenex handy while watching the story. More than once the viewer is instinctively called on to reflect on what one's own reaction might be under similar circumstances. The story does a remarkable job in showing how two individuals subjected to the same outcome under similar conditions respond to their upbringing. The adult Mantosh (Divian Ladwa) remained embittered and unable to deal with a loss the viewer is not privy to during the course of the story.<br/><br/>Reflecting on the real life Brierley's, one gets a sense of how special they were to forego having their own children in order to save two youngsters from a stressful life. The scene of the Brierley's meeting Saroo's mother Kamla is another one of those moments that tug at the heart, and if it was so touching to see on screen, imagine how it must have been for the real life 'Sheru' to witness his two families meeting for the first time."

","Lion is a drama film starring Dev Patel based on the true story of Saroo Brierley. Touching and heartwarming, this film shows that no matter where we are in this world, we cannot escape who we really are.<br/><br/>In 1986, a young Indian boy named Saroo (Sunny Pawar) is separated from his family while out one day with his older brother. After surviving on the streets of Calcutta for some time, Saroo is eventually taken to an orphanage where he is later adopted by an Australian couple named John (David Wenham) and Sue (Nicole Kidman). At first, Saroo is weary of his new adoptive family, but over time, he warms to them. 25 years later, the older Saroo (Dev Patel), still haunted by visions of his childhood, decides to search for a way to reconnect with his birth family, whom he believes are still waiting for him.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, the film depicts more of Saroo's backstory in India than his actual search for his family, which is fine as this allows the audience to feel what he has been missing out on for so long. Dev Patel's portrayal of a young man searching for his birth family was fantastic and reminiscent of his role in Slumdog Millionaire. Nicole Kidman only really shines in one short scene, although it certainly leaves an impression on the viewer.<br/><br/>I rate it 8/10"
"lindseyloon","9","0","0","22 February 2017"," Authentically touching and beautifully done, nearly 10/10
","Zero spoilers: Soulful without being trite, Lion is a journey film that explores the tie of family, the way we map our memories, and the longing to fully understand identity. Ranging from India to Australia, this chronicles a spirited boy becoming a quiet but determined man, a focused dreamer. Performances and story are a solid 10, with only a few aesthetic choices in camera department and a few issues of narrative focus robbing it for what would be a perfect score and one of the best films of the past few years. <br/><br/>Dev Patel is mesmerizing, as are every one of the Indian actors who grace the screen for the first half of the film. Beginning with phenomenal aerial photography, the camera offers gorgeous visual narration and draws us into the themes of place and displacement from the first flicker of the projector. <br/><br/>The editing is also sensational, with beautiful pacing and way-- creating tension then exploring memory. The film rarely drags or feels that it is rushing. <br/><br/>Really, close to perfect. The aesthetic and narrative adjustments that I would have made come down primarily to preference-- the lighting, framing, and cinematographic choices made during a few scenes drew me out of the narrative, and as a fussy film festival director I could pinpoint them but it wouldn't matter. <br/><br/>A few moments made me loose a bit of faith in the aesthetic cohesiveness because of a feeling that things vacillated from a ""shooting commercials"" look to a more self- conscious indie style shoot (which I found unconvincing given the grandeur of the film, and unflattering to several of the female actors, there seemed to be an unawareness of portraiture in some key scenes that involved women). Additionally, it was a sad oversight that there were no female characters in the entire film that existed other than to forward the male story-- while there were fantastic female characters and wonderful performances by a number of actresses (NK, RM, and the Indian orphanage lady as well as another female key character spring to mind)-- still, when there is license to translate a real story into cinema there is also license to expand some of the characters, Nicole Kidman's mother had such depth it would have been easy to have a scene with her and a female friend that showed more of her depth of life outside the frame of being ""the mom,"" or Roony Mara's ""girlfriend"" who also interacted with no other women. In an era in which awareness of the Bechdel test is so prevalent, and there are increasingly multi- faceted and wonderful roles for women as there are in this film-- it would really have been thoughtful and expanded the scope of story to include women whose purpose did not stop at serving this film-- because this is a gorgeous human story and not just a star vehicle. Likewise some of the camera department aesthetic choices seemed inconsistent and a bit insulting to the sensational aerial cinematography and superb editing. Truly worth a good watch, I enjoyed Lion on many levels. You're in for a treat!"

"harry_tk_yung","Null","0","0","22 February 2017"," Marvellous cinematic re-creation
","As this marvellous true story has received considerable publicity even before the movie was made, I won't elaborate the background details. A simplest recap: A little boy in India. accidentally trapped in an out-of-service train, was carried a thousand miles across the Indian sub-continent. After a miraculous struggle to survive, he was adopted by an Australian couple, growing up like a native-born Australian. Twenty-five years later, gnawed by the images of his mother and brother from early childhood, he employed Google and, after painstaking search, miraculously found his native home. He returned to re-acquaint, even if not stay, with his original family. <br/><br/>It seems nowadays that every other movie you see is based on a true story. It is easy to forget how difficult it is to work within the innate constraints and still produce a good movie: the delicate balance between departing too much from the facts and shying away from sufficient dramatization to make it interesting. ""Lion""'s success is achieved by paying exceptional attention to details and making those detail work in giving full dimensions to the characters. <br/><br/>The first half is carried on the little shoulders of Sunny Pawar, the little boy selected from a couple of thousands. It is not difficult for a cute little boy with an innocent smile to be disarming and have you rooting for him in no time at all. This is further helped by the image of Saroo hopping along the railroad track with older brother Guddu (Abhishek Bharate) who is twice his height (no exaggeration here), his idol of a father figure. More challenging is to portray the alertness and resourcefulness of this little boy who is lost in an entirely strange, unknown world of Calcutta. This conjures up right away images from Dickensian protagonists such as Oliver Twist in London. The parade of characters, both wicked and good, encountered along the way, are depicted with a little more depth than what would usually be expected. But in the end, it is Sunny Pawar that deserves a standing ovation. The last few short scenes in this first half do two things. First, it establishes the bonding of Saroo with John and Sue Brierley (David Wenham, Nicole Kidman), his adapted parents. As well, it introduces the second adopted son, also from India, Mantosh (later played by Divian Ladwa as the grown up), a mentally disturbed child at the opposite end of the likability spectrum. <br/><br/>The second half, 25 years later, provides illustrations aplenty in the aforementioned thoughtful handling of details. For example, a restaurant scene stages a celebration lunch for Saroo's (Dev Patel) going away to study hotel management. It is a serene scene of blissful harmony of the three of them until a small ripple – quite insignificant. An all-to-eager waiter comes around asking if he can clear ways the dishes. While Saroo cheerfully accedes, Sue insists that her plate be left where it is. In these tiny ripples of emotions, we get a glimpse of the completely unwavering adherence of this divinely good-natured woman to her principles. It clicks when we later discover that the couple adopted not because they could not have children, but because of their belief that in the overpopulated earth, adding more does not necessarily make a contribution, while giving a better life to someone suffering is definitely more positive. <br/><br/>When they get home after lunch, Saroo goes to the backyard to find Mantosh in solitude. After niceties of ""sorry you weren't able to join us at lunch"" Saroo sternly leaves his parting words with Mantosh, telling him to stop hurting their mother. No, the only type of physical violence Mantosh is capable of is to himself (hitting his own head, against the wall or with his own fist). But then, Sue loves both her adopted sons equally, and it is Mantosh's failure to achieve his potentials that hurts her. Mantosh's reply says a lot about the good side of this superficially repulsive figure ""Why do you think I stay away from this lunch""? <br/><br/>Staying on tract with the true events, the movie shows how Saroo becomes more and more obsessed with images of his mother and brother remembered from his early childhood. Painstaking search through Goole Earth Engine finally brings about this near-miracle. Amidst the immense joy of reuniting of birth mother and son, there is unassuaged sadness that Guddu had already died in a traffic accident. The ending credit comes with footage of the real people, the three of them - Sue, Saroo and his birth mother – hugging. A deeply moving scene. <br/><br/>Kidman has been hailed by all for her heart-felt portrayal of this wonderful yet very ordinary woman. Wenham touches me not only with his quiet assurance but because I am just re-watching again my ""Lord of the Rings Extended DVD"" and always remember him as Faramir. Valuable, but a little wasted, is Rooney Mara playing Saroo's ever supportive and understanding girlfriend. With only a few brief scenes, Bharate makes his mark as the mentally disturbed brother. Patel has matured well into a character truly worth his salt. But if you will come away from this movie with only one face in your mind, it has to be Sunny Pawar."

","I cannot describe how emotionally connected I felt to the story of ""Lion"" and its characters. I was filled with heartache the entire film and sobbed continuously with pitiful breathless whimpers until the ending credits appeared and the theatre lights turned on. No movie has ever made me feel this way.<br/><br/>I was adopted from China as an infant and have lived in Canada for nearly 20 years. My parents aren't Chinese, nor are my brothers or the majority of my friends. Similar to Saroo, I was raised surrounded by privilege, love, and belonging despite the obvious difference in the colour of my skin. Of course I am grateful for the life I have been given and I love my (adoptive) parents to death, but my thoughts can't help but wander... I think of my family and wonder how they are doing, how they are living, if I have siblings, if my biological parents ever think of me, and if they want me to come find them some day. <br/><br/>I too have felt that immense urge to find ""home."" I am currently learning Mandarin and am considering visiting/moving abroad when my studies and life are more stable. Some day, I will look for my parents in China. I am fully aware that my story may not have as happy of an ending as Saroo's but what if it does? What if the answers I am searching for are just around the corner and I just need to take one big step to find them?<br/><br/>In the scene where grown up Saroo is speaking with his adoptive mother, I felt such a genuine connection to their conversation that I cried (yet again). I promised myself that if I ever decided to have children, I would adopt. It was so heartwarming to know there are people who feel the same way I do: There are enough people in this world so why not save a child who is already born and suffering and give them the chance of a great life? I felt like the writer had taken the words out of my own head and put them in his film.<br/><br/>""Lion"" truly is a wonderful movie, but I must admit that I was unable to properly analyze it as a film because I was such an emotional wreck. I am rating it 10 stars because as an adopted child myself, it was perfect. You may be thinking I'm over glorifying this movie because it pulled at my heartstrings, but when you see such a near reenactment of your own life on the big screen, that story becomes personal to you. Their situation (although not entirely like my own) was so much like my own. The thoughts were the same, the feelings were the same, as were the hopes, the dreams, and the fears. Everything I absorbed was spot on.<br/><br/>This story is remarkable, and true. I am thankful it is being told to such a large audience and in such a beautiful, compelling and real way. Saroo's life felt like my life; I am so happy for him. He found his mother and I hope someday, I will find my family too."

","Lion finally helped me complete my viewing of all the best picture nominees, and I'd have to agree it deserves a place up there with the other great films.<br/><br/>Lion is the story of a boy in India who gets lost and ends up traveling far from home not knowing where he is. He is then adopted into a family in Australia where he grows up and decides he wants to find his old family. The movie has two distinct parts: young Saroo and older Saroo. The younger of the two steals the show and makes you want to see more of his young bravery.<br/><br/>Nicole Kidman plays his adoptive mother and she does a fine job but Saroo is the central character the entire way and I felt gripped the entire time rooting for him not to give up. The film briefly brings up the idea of leaving your past in the past. It asks the question, if you don't like what you find would you continue searching, but neither of those points are focused on for too long. Besides that brief discussion the main focus of this movie is just watching young Saroo survive surrounded by Indian's but not speaking their native Bengali since he is from another part of the country and speaks Hindi. The movie does a great job showing what many young children face being alone in the streets. As the movie ends, the credits explain there are over 80,000 displaced children like Saroo which really lends weight to the story and makes his one to root for.<br/><br/>Dev Patel plays the older Saroo and he does a great job playing a man who has a conflict of roots. He speaks Australian, almost forgetting his Hindi, and assimilates to the culture. In college he meets Rooney Mara and some other students and while at a dinner party of an Indian friend he sees something that jolts his past square into his present making that search for his family the main focus while trying to juggle his current family.<br/><br/>The music was beautiful and really helped push these emotions home without feeling forced as it so easily could have. The locations were also beautiful, giving a true feel to the streets of Calcutta and the wilderness of India along with Australia as well.<br/><br/>Lion is a must see for this Oscar season with more going for it than not. Great performances especially from newcomer Sunny Pawar as young Saroo along with beautiful music and a feel good story that will have you teary eyed."

","A very engaging story about a small child who becomes lost. His family life is extremely hard and the period on the streets is bad, could have been even worse. This is definitely a look at the underbelly of India. Much of the movie is about his memories of India and the confusion of feeling losses he can't express. The search for his home could have been done better and shown much more of how the internet was, and can be, used for such a nebulous memory search. The girlfriend angle is okay, but doesn't add much to the story, and the back history of his adopted brother could have been explored more fully too. All in all, good entertainment and raises some very deep questions about lost children and how easy it is for a child to be lost."

","""Lion"" is a film that essentially preaches for simplicity, he wants to do his homework, pass on his message, thrill the audience and it's over, but at some point he tries and ends up being deeper than he is. Here we have a bibliographical, linear script that does not attempt to deceive the viewer with subjectivity or parallel timelines, as I said, he preaches for simplicity to tell the story of Saroo (Dev Patel), a 5 year old boy who gets lost in his Brother at a train station in Calcutta, and after being adopted by an Australian family tries to find his family 20 years later. The setting of the film in its first act is so honest and simple, it is extremely captivating and beautiful, director Garth Davis spends an air of attachment and complicity, blending the violence and innocence that is a beautiful thing, pity that his second act is the Opposite that, with a beautiful photograph in its first act, dark and highlighting the elements of the screen, the rest of the film opts for something lighter and blending the shades of blue with a simple track and a camera that is often used without a tripod The film technically only pleases. The performance of Sarro is wonderful, but Dev Patel does not impress as Saroo, he does not pass the air of lost or desperate and alone does not raise the dramatic charge, and were it not for the good construction of the script, Patel would not make us dry The eyes at the end of the film. We have here a movie that has a great first act, a second act too elongated with many repetitions of idea and bad construction of characters (Only Sarro is built) and a third that is short, but extremely beautiful and precise, and is always very sensitive Of the director showing pictures or videos of the events has put film, served to spend more wipes, ""Lion"" is a good movie that fulfills its role."

","Heard of it ""Lion"" with ""our"" Nicole Kidman, so was looking forward to see it. I forgot it was the story of this Indian boy who got adopted but many years later had the urge to look for his mother. I had seen some excerpt of that story on TV and realised I was not going to see any safari! But what I saw was great. Dave Patel has become a true blue Aussie, but some memory about his youth come to haunt him and he has to act on it. At time it's very emotional. I always enjoy Nicole Kidman and was please to see the laconic David Wenham. Here he has not much screen or character time but it was good to see him. As for the young actor who plays the part before D Patel takes over, he's a joy to watch. You experience the life in a big city in India comparing to a privilege area in Australia and the contrast his huge, not that Australia does not have areas that you'd rather avoid.

","Real stories of a somebody-got-famous are a dime in a dozen and about a thousand in couple of thousand in Cinema history. But the one in this film, involves no one you've ever heard of, doesn't star a soul you'll recognise for its first 40 minutes, and will rip you into a thousand pieces before it's over. ""Lion"" tells the story of a lost boy: a five-year-old Indian called ""Saroo,"" who grew up in the 1980s in the area around Khandwa. The film begins with him pilfering lumps of coal off a train with his older brother, ""Guddu,"" and selling them to buy food. By the end of the first reel, these two are thousands of miles apart, wholly by mistake. <br/><br/>Left sleeping one night on a railway station bench, Saroo woke up alone and scared, and stumbled onto a decommissioned passenger train. Before he knew it, he was speeding his way to Calcutta, with no one to help, no Bengali to explain, and a place name for his home town that no one at the other end recognised. This is a true story; a pretty inspiring and incredible one at that. It's a story of two halves, the first half full of the colour and drama of young Saroo's Indian childhood, with the second half (covering the adoption by a compassionate Sue and her husband John; Portrayed by Nicole Kidman and David Wenham respectively) focusing on the psychological toll of dislocation and loss of identity. Handled with intelligence and subtlety, this is a powerfully engaging drama.<br/><br/>The excellent script, by the Australian writer Luke Davies, sticks rigidly to Saroo's own point of view as days, months, and eventually whole decades elapse with him effectively orphaned through freak circumstance. It's derived from a 2012 memoir by the grown Saroo Brierley, called A Long Way Home. He can only imagine the agony his mother and brother must have gone through, endlessly searching. So twenty five years later, armed with only a handful of memories, his unwavering determination, and a revolutionary technology known as Google Earth, he sets out to find his lost family and finally return to his first home. While Rooney Mara has a fairly limited function as Saroo's girlfriend, Nicole Kidman enriches the film enormously. It's a sterling, supportive performance by Kidman (who is one of my most favourite actresses). <br/><br/>The script never lunges for cheap drama by forcing Saroo into a binary choice between mothers, and the most complex beats are about tip- toeing around, often counter-productively, to avoid hurt or betrayal.<br/><br/>Patel in a role (and film) which infinitely improve on his breakthrough in Slumdog Millionaire. But Nicole Kidman is a fascinatingly strained figure, often barely keeping her grip. Right now, the Best Supporting Actress Oscar must be hers to lose."

"Lord_Orson","9","0","0","11 February 2017"," Lion Review
","With a mixed critical reception I wasn't entirely sure what to expect here. However, it turned out to be an absolutely outstanding, captivating tale. The first half is an extremely morbid story of a 5 year old Indian boy who gets separated from his brother, ends up lost and homeless, and has to survive in brutal conditions in impoverished India. Not only this, but he also has to become road runner as just about every man seems to want to kidnap and molest him, and it really creates a harrowing portrayal of India. The performance from young Sunny Pawar is stunning and Oscar worthy in itself. It then flashes forward 20 years to Australia, where Dev Patel also puts in a good turn as the lead, still searching for his lost family. <br/><br/>The melodic music throughout links excellently with the stylish cinematography and sombre, sentimental tone. It really is just a thing of beauty. There's obviously similarities between this and Garth Davis' previous directorial efforts on Top of the Lake. The intensity of the movie really starts to build, with Nicole Kidman also putting in an impressive performance. There's a particular critical scene where Dev Patel searches online for his family and as he does so he reminisces of being back home as a child, then breaks down. It's incredibly powerful and immersive stuff, but the movie has a plethora of scenes like this. The conclusion is extremely intense and as emotive a finish as I have ever seen. <br/><br/>There is no doubt in my mind that this should be getting best picture. However, there's no black people or retarded singing, so nobody's interested.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Lion is an incredibly made film, using gorgeous set scenes and a powerful cast. <br/><br/>Sunny Pawar is incredible at expressing emotions with nothing but his eyes and actions. Watching Pawar create young Saroo as vulnerable against the treacherous world, and flying to the whims of destiny creates a roller-coaster of emotions and intrigue. To then be transformed into a Saroo portrayed by Dev Patel is incredible and consistent with the film's aims. Patel does a wonderful job at Saroo's identity crisis, his want to know and find more, and his alienation from the current social scene. <br/><br/>The flow of the film and where it ends really brings to light numerous questions revolved around identity, family, and ancestry. Garth Davis does very well in combining the cast with such a well developed story, and using scenery and music to really evoke the needed emotions to hit real life problems to an audience seeking genuine and raw goodness. Lion is a dime a dozen, and more so impressive to find out it's Australian roots and low budget."

"thechoctopfilmblog","9","0","0","7 February 2017"," A film of stirring emotions
","When the source story is a compelling story, it makes it a little easier for it to be a powerful film. Lion is a film of stirring emotions. It depicts a real life story of Saroo Brierley, who after 25 years of being separated from his family, miraculously finds them with the help of modern day technology Google Earth. It took 6 years of painstaking search.<br/><br/>Saroo (whose birth name name is actually 'Sheru' meaning 'lion') grew up in Ganesh Talai, a village in the city of Khandwa, India. His mother is a labourer carrying bricks for a living and young Saroo (Sunny Pawar) desperately wants to help out by joining his older brother Guddu (Abhishek Bharate) foraging for money at train stations. One night, when he was 5 years old, he took a nap and woke up to find his brother missing. In an attempt to search for him, he boarded a departing train, which ultimately took him on a 1,600km journey to the city of Calcutta.<br/><br/>The young Sunny Pawar gave a magnetic and immersive performance as the young Saroo. He blends in so naturally with the life that is portrayed, and we as the audience are instantly drawn in by his innocence and on-screen charisma. Alone, defenceless and frightened, we follow him as he struggles through perils, before he is finally put in an orphanage and adopted by an Australian couple John (David Wenham - 'Lord of the Rings') and Sue Brierley (Nicole Kidman - 'The Railway Man'). It was delightful to see those two Aussie actors being cast in their respective roles.<br/><br/>Pawar effortlessly carries the first half of the film and sets the perfect tone and foundations for the remaining half. In the present day, the grown up Saroo (Dev Patel), is now at university studying Hotel Management in Australia, where he meets girlfriend Lucy (Rooney Mara). We see him living a very different life than he otherwise would have. At a friends' gathering, he stumbled upon a plate of ""Jalebi"" – a sweet dessert popular in India, and it triggered a childhood memory of him and his brother Guddu back home. This was an extremely profound scene, as it is incredibly relatable. We all have those moments where something little like that can prompt us to reminisce about our childhood memories we keep close to us. For many of us, 'home' evokes sentiments that are familiar, tender and nostalgic. Perhaps when it comes to our childhood memories of home, we, like Saroo, are not afraid to show our vulnerabilities. The memories we have may be faint gossamers of the past, but they do leave indelible marks on us and the bonds we have with those we love are perpetual.<br/><br/>The second half is comparatively weaker. The film loses a little of its momentum but it is quiet understandable as it is somewhat difficult to propel the narrative forward with excitement when the search for home is all via Google Maps on a computer screen. The result is that when he finally found his home on the map, it happened quickly and seemed relatively easy, compared to the many years spent in real life. And let me just say, the idea of using Google Maps to try and match the mental pictures in his mind of his home is just ingenious. Without it, the search would have been almost impossible.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Garth Davis ('Top of the Lake') manages to harness its energy of its brilliant cast and the story never ceases to move us, up until the final reunion. Kidman, in particular, portrays Sue's fragility and strength with sensitivity and density. Patel is equally solid, matching her fear and uncertainty with his own quiet conviction and understanding. He has matured immensely since his 'Slumdog Millionaire' performance, bringing a sense of stability and trust in his character.<br/><br/>A relatively unknown Australian director, Davis does a fine job in finding a comfortable balance between heaviness and warmth, and gives us a film that is touching, but not excessively lachrymose. It is not only a film about searching for our identity and our roots, as it also touches on the theme of cross-country adoption. The cinematography by Greig Fraser ('Rogue One', 'Zero Dark Thirty') is magnificently real, and his most effective shots echo those of a satellite, giving us a bird's eye trace of Saroo's footsteps back home.<br/><br/>Lion made me ponder, why is it so important to all of us that we know where we come from? Perhaps the answer is simple. When we are pulled apart from our origins by the vicissitudes of life, we would innately embody a kind of unrelenting determination to learn and connect with those that had an impact on us and made us who we are. To find peace and to know where we are going, we might first need to know where we come from. Saroo's bond with his family, particularly with Guddu and his birth mother was unbreakable. One can only imagine the years of anguish and torment he went through not knowing what happened to his family. Now, he can finally put those questions to rest."

","'LION': Five Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Another upcoming Academy Awards hopeful is this drama, directed by debut feature filmmaker Garth Davis. It tells the story of a 5- year-old Indian boy, that falls asleep on a train car and is taken 1600 kilometers from where he lives. He is later adopted, by an Australian couple, and 25 years later he decides to track down his birth family, by using Google Earth. The film is based on the 2014 non-fiction book 'A Long Way Home' (by Saroo Brierley), and it was scripted by Luke Davies. It stars Dev Patel, Sunny Pawar, Rooney Mara, Nicole Kidman and David Wenham. The film has performed well at the Box Office, and with critics, and it's also been nominated for multiple respected awards (and it's also won some). I loved it.<br/><br/>Saroo (Pawar) goes with his older brother, Guddu (Abhisek Bharate), to work at a train station one night. When Saroo is then too sleepy to help, he waits at a bench, for Guddu, while his brother goes to work. When Guddu doesn't return though, Saroo goes looking for him. He then falls asleep on a train, while looking for his brother, and the train takes off with him sleeping inside it. It takes Saroo 1600 kilometers away, to Calcutta. Having no idea how to get back home, or how to tell anyone where he's from, the boy is forced to live on the streets. He's later put in an orphanage, and then adopted by an Australian couple (Kidman and Wenham). 25 years later, Saroo (now played by Patel) decides to track down his biological family, and finally return home.

The characters are all lovable, and the performances are all topnotch (especially Patel and Kidman). It's also a very emotionally moving film, and in some ways it's quite inspiring.

"rockman182","8","3","8","5 December 2016"," An emotional, wonderful, experience
","The main reason I wanted to see this badly was because of Rooney Mara. I love her to death but she's honestly nowhere near any of the top reasons why I enjoyed this. I don't think this film will be for everybody because it is meant to be emotional and can seem like award season bait. I thoroughly enjoyed it though. Much more than I thought I would. This is basically a much better version of Slumdog Millionaire. Slumdog is honestly a bit of a mess, and doesn't feel realistic. This (obviously based on a true story) is more or less a rags to riches story as well that is set in India and then shifts to Australia. The lead character lives in poverty with his mother and siblings and gets separated one night when he falls asleep on a train. He travels to areas in Calcutta where he struggles to understand Bengali and does not remember enough details to get home. He eventually ends up being adapted and has a successful life but then longs to find his family. It might be from being fresh out of the theater but I was quite emotionally attached to the protagonists quest to find his family. There are things that could be improved from a storytelling perspective, especially with the lack of focus on the adopted brother and his relationship with Nicole Kidman's character. I'll let it slide though because it was a fulfilling experience watching this film. All the actors in this film put in strong performances I know this might not get a lot of Award season love but I hope it at least gets nominated for Best Picture, and Best Adapted Screenplay."
"akdubois-34734","5","5","18","1 January 2017"," Dickens meets ""Central Station""
","I'll be honest, I cried throughout this movie. The Dickensian themes are unrelenting: little poor boys risking their lives to buy milk, mother has to carry rocks for a living, unkind strangers. For a white man to make a film like this is risky at best. The villainy of almost everyone the main character encounters is so over-the-top, it practically reeks of racism. Dev Patel's easy, aryan good looks surly boost the ratings and popularity with white viewers, but it also recalls a past where actors like Caesar Romero played an Indian servant in ""A Little Princess."" I'm sure many Indians will dislike the fact that their entire country is portrayed as heartless pedophiles. Even ""Central Station,"" the wonderful Brazilian film of a similar theme (mother is killed and little boy has to fend for himself) is peppered with humor, and in the end, homespun humanity. I'm sure Saroo Brierley told his story truthfully, but his bitterness for India shines through. Even Dickens had the heart to explain his villain's behavior (most of the time), but this movie doesn't explain or show the dynamic that would lead to a child falling through the cracks. ""Central station"" builds the story and characters in a way that seems to be outdated now in films. This movie and others come across like extended previews— snippets of information with no real, intensive insight into anything or anybody. All the characters seem hollow, Hollywood prototypes. Yes I cried, it's certainly a film full of sadness and brutality, and yes those issues should be addressed in Indian and everywhere else. But this white man's version left me feeling a little funny, like I was being manipulated."

","This film lacks any cohesive narrative which diminishes and distracts from its dramatic impact. You be the judge. A classmate in his hotel management class catches the eye of the adult Saroo, and in the very next scene they are walking separately on opposite sides of the street at exactly the same moment to someone's house, though we don't know whose house or why; in the next scene they are in bed together, though they haven't even shared a kiss; in the next scene they are living together in Tasmania, though we don't know the nature of their relationship or why they chose Tasmania; in the next scene they break up because ... well, we really don't know why; in the next scene they pass each other on an escalator and they're inexplicably back in bed together (in the same scene we learn that she's just returned from New York, though we were never told when, why, or even that she was there); in the next scene we learn that Saroo has quit his job, though we've never seen him working at one; and finally, we learn that Saroo isn't even his real name, though that's what his friends, his family and even his birth mother have always called him.<br/><br/>And the Oscar goes to ... please, another film.

"Hitchcoc","8","2","5","5 February 2017"," A Gripping Story That Could Have Been Better
","To start with, I really enjoyed the film. It impressed me, even though I already knew the whole story. That takes some doing. The story of the young boy, the first half of the film, gives us a view of the sadness that takes place because of over-population. People live on a subsistence, but somehow many manage. Of course, many do not. Saroo goes with his brother to steal coal off the trains. It is utterly dangerous with possible death around each corner. They manage to trade their coal for a couple small bags of milk which they take home. The older brother can work and Saroo is a pest. He manages to talk his brother into taking him to a new job site by train, but he gets separated and the rest is history. We see the little guy trying to figure a way to get back to his village but he can't name it or his mother's name (he calls her Mum). He manages to get away from some nasty people, probably avoiding being sold into prostitution. Through a series of events, he winds up with an Australian family which adopts him and another boy who is severely, emotionally disturbed. If someone had done a little script work to bridge a twenty-five year gap, it would have helped tremendously. We now have Saroo as a man. He has been accepted into white (and brown) society. He has an attractive girlfriend played by Rooney Mara. But he is conflicted. He hates his brother because he shows disrespect for their adoptive parents. He has also begun to long for his original home. Bits and pieces of his life before the age of five have crept into his mind. Had there been even a few minutes for us to get to know when this longing started. Also, some of the specifics of life with the second brother. A psychological framework for his feelings. There is so much angst in the older Saroo. It could have been sold better. It would have made very good film a great one and could have been done without making it too long. The little boy who played little Saroo has such an expressive face. Beautiful."

","Lion's warm and inspirational true story cannot be faulted or labelled as anything less than powerful or moving, yet the film doesn't always manage to capture this essence in its purest form and somehow loses twenty years of the story along the way, leaving the rest of the narrative a little thin on the ground and thus disengaging. It absolutely has its moments of real greatness, with a really solid start that renders a young Saroo's journey as a profound one - but the second half begins to undo that with too many coincidences and conventionalities that prevents the story's translations on to the big screen from being a wholly successful and effective one. It's a real shame that it cannot maintain the goodwill of its first half, as the general cast do a really tremendous job of making us feel sympathetic towards the characters they bring to life and the hard work put in by the writers and director is unquestionable.

"nathagkar","10","2","5","2 January 2017"," Not just a story about a lost boy and Google - It's a potential Oscar contender
","When I watched this movie, it was rather unplanned. Rather to kill time.But, boy! was I in for a surprise. Almost half of the movie is non English , but the powerful portrayal by a relatively unknown kid actor and than the accomplished actors like Dev Patel and Nicole Kidman completely raises the film to new heights. The film engrosses you from the very beginning – A different world from what we know in the west, but yet the same emotions of love between brothers, how a separation cannot be forgotten and how incredibly a technology which we now use rather ubiquitously can be used to re-connect lost bonds. But then the story is much much more than that. The emotions, the motivation and love for the son which connects the two mothers. The journey itself cannot be expressed but needs to be watched on the big screen. Actually , my decision to select this movie while I was in the theatre was because I chanced on an answer to Quora, as I typed each movie's name and the actor in search on google. Here is the external link : https://www.quora.com/Why-did-the-movie-Lion-starring-Dev-Patel-and- Nicole-Kidman-get-a-wide-release-of-just-15-theatres-in-the-United- States#<br/><br/>Yes, Oscar contender – definitely.

"bobbobwhite","7","2","5","29 December 2016"," Liked it, but overly sentimental
","Liked the India part way best, with little Saroo lost and bewildered trying to get home. In Tasmania, to me, the story faltered and was inconsistent with a lot of logic and story flow flaws. Not getting overwhelmed by emotion, I looked for the bits and pieces that told a complete story of a lost kid's almost divine rescue from probable tragedy. Little Sunny was great as Little Saroo, and Dev Patel was good as older Saroo. Nicole Kidman was also really good as his adoptive mom.<br/><br/>As an internet researcher, I found that older Saroo was not very good at connecting the dots in order to find his home and his Mum in India. If I did it, first I would best figure how far he traveled by time and train speed, find a town name that was closest to what he remembered it to be, find if it had a water tower, then a covered rail station, sited next to woods and a rock quarry, on and on. Wouldn't take long, certainly not as long as it took him, so that was a very weak part to me, but it added to movie drama, of course. And, I must allow that he was delayed in his search by his dreams progressively telling him more details about his childhood home that led him further into his search.<br/><br/>Sorry to get so scientific about such an emotional movie, but I saw too many realism flaws to make it a more rewarding story to me in the second half. And, after I saw the harshness of poor India the closest thing I had to an tearful emotional moment was..........God Bless America."

","I have lately enjoyed a number of Indian movies. They are getting better all the time. Most foreign films are getting way more interesting than the often formulaic US blockbusters. I looked forward to this, after all the hype. Nicole Kidman could only be expected to add to the mix. She has rarely disappointed me. However after the tantalizing start, the director just played out a limo stretch of a glossed over photo shop job with an dishearteningly predictable and pathetic attempt at pulling on heart strings. It may have possibly worked in the black and white silent era on my doting aunties. The director seems to have got bored and just carried on lamely to fulfill his contractual obligations. I had given up on a twist or flourish way before the end. Very disappointing indeed."

I do not know if it is necessary to spend so much time on the train. There comes a time when I wonder if he's going to pick it or not. I think the film is a lot of time left. That if in the end it only needs to see the extras applauding.

","A really very nice take on biopics. It is like two or three films with different flavour are joined very nicely. the first 50 minutes are well directed. One can watch and understand it without dialogue. A visually strong part.
The part where Dev Patel and Rooney Mara starts romance (with Rahman's URVASHI URVASHI in background) is lovely.
Theme is strong and so many can connect with that with their perspective. The montages of switching shots between two different countries, India and Tasmania, are really good and moving. The one scene with google earth montages is also powerful.
Cinema as a medium is brilliantly used in this real life story.

Director Garth Davis has flawlessly brought to the big screen, this incredible true tale of loss & undying hope & love. The screenplay by Luke Davies has impeccably adapted Saroo's novel, A Long Way Home. The cinematography by Greig Fraser is one of the highlights of the movie. Fraser has expertly captured the beauty of India & Australia. The performances are another highlight of the film. Dev Patel is fantastic as Saroo Brierley. Patel portrays his character's vulnerability & desperation, effortlessly. Rooney Mara is great as Lucy. David Wenham is awesome as John Brierley. Nicole Kidman is spectacular as Sue Brierley. Kidman has showcased a mother's love, brilliantly. Sunny Pawar is the star of the show as Young Saroo. Pawar shines in his acting debut, superbly carrying the movie on his shoulders for half its run-time. Tannishtha Chatterjee, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Deepti Naval & Divian Ladwa are impressive as Noor, Rawa, Mrs. Sood & Mantosh Brierley, respectively.

Just imagining what his journey could be like is already touching me to tears. Watching his journey makes my imagined scenario real, and touches me deeply. It must have been very terrifying for a five year old boy to go through such an ordeal. The film conveys the ordeal brilliantly. His time at the orphanage isn't that much better, though it is not because of anyone's malicious intent. The scene when Saroo asks whether the orphanage has tried to search for his mother is touching, and there are lots more touching degrees to come. It is a great emotional journey."

","I was surprised with how much of this film just focuses on the character of Saroo. I mean, he is the main character, so I figured he'd be the center of the movie. But I thought the film's actual focus would be of him searching for his family. Instead, it develops Saroo as a child, played beautifully by Sunny Pawar. We then transition into him as an adult, where the film then focuses on his relationship with Lucy (Rooney Mara). They had unbelievable chemistry, and I really bought into their relationship. It wasn't some stereotypical boy/girl thing, but it was a human and compelling dynamic that I thought stole the film. Saroo traveling to India to find his family is actually a small portion of the film. On paper, that sounds like it would be disappointing and anticlimactic, but is incredibly effective in the context of the movie. Director Garth Davis does a magnificent job helming this film, and really knew how to navigate it in order to make it work. Because of his foresight, we buy into the human character of Saroo, instead of the situation. We understand this character, and that's what really makes this film work..."
"matthewssilverhammer","8","1","2","8 February 2017"," Gentle and Uplifting
","Our society is flooded with think-pieces about the migration of people from one country to another. Still, we rarely get a thorough glimpse of what a person who makes this trek goes through, losing connection to their blood and culture. Lion, a purely human film that quietly draws you into the true-story of a lost Indian boy adopted by an Australian couple (Kidman, Wenham), provides us with a harrowing tale of discovery & rediscovery. A gentle epic about the mistakes we make in family & love, and the second-chances we long for. In the first half, we're introduced to 5-year-old Saroo, a financially-impoverished but family-rich boy lost thousands of miles away from his home. The world is never so overwhelming as through the eyes of a lost child; that perspective is our tour guide here. We are rarely given information outside of his naÃ¯ve ignorance, allowing mystery and fear to bloom up in unexpected places. Even his eventual life-saving adoption by a kind Australian couple is blanketed in confusing culture shock (expensive houses, nice transportation). Pawar is perfectly casted, his sweet voice and heavy eyes perfectly capturing the complexity with which we try and reconcile his new privileges with his stunned sadness. In the second half, Saroo (Patel) is 25-years-older & more accustomed to his Western life, though still longing for a connection to his past. Some of the complexity fades here: the dialogue is more awkward, the side-characters are less-natural, and the narrative is clumsily pushed along. Still, the performances are strong, the score is gorgeous, and the story is enveloping. Lion is a gracious tearjerker that makes you wanna go out, live life and cling tight to the ones you love."

Going into the picture I actually knew very little about it other than its central story so the journey that the lead character goes on is quite remarkable to watch and it's even more amazing to see how well-balanced the film was and how emotional it all plays out.<br/><br/>I think the most impressive thing for me was the first hour as we see the young Saroo getting separated from home, the horrors of being that young and alone and then him trying to survive the streets before being adopted. The film certainly tries to get a point across about homeless children in India and the film can get this across without any preaching. Instead, it really does show you how scary a world would be to a child lost in it.<br/><br/>What makes that first sequence even greater is the fact that Pawar is so wonderful in the film. His performance here has to go down as one of the greatest that you're ever going to see from a child actor and there wasn't a single moment where you feel as if you're watching an actor. The performance is so fresh and so raw that you really feel as if you're watching a documentary. The supporting cast is terrific as well. Patel really packs an emotional punch with his strong performance and Rooney Mara, Kidman and Wenham all doing great work.<br/><br/>LION features a terrific music score, some very good cinematography and there's no question that the screenplay hits all the right marks as the story plays itself out."

Poverty, corruption, and paedophilia meet charity, sacrifice and kindness while Calcutta shows one of its dark sides. Google, Tasmania and Indian Railway play prominent roles.

"SpoilerAlertReviews","9","1","2","3 February 2017"," An Incredible journey of rediscovery and the maternal, family spirit
","TV and commercial director, Garth Davis gives an exceptional main feature debut with a touching true story about a young boy getting separated from his family and lost in Calcutta to then be adopted by a family in Australia at the tender age of five, who then has the sudden, obsessive urge to find his real family. <br/><br/>It's based on the published memoirs ""A Long Way Home"" by Saroo Brierley, the boy, now grown up man, who embarks on a mission to find the family he got lost from all those years ago. It tackles conflict of loyalty, love and determination, a truly heart-rending story, not just of Saroo, but of all involved. <br/><br/>It's superbly balanced, basically in two parts. Firstly the origin of separation, a Saroo at 5 years old going through a hellish ordeal of being completely lost, not understanding the language, hungry, tired and just wanting to get home. The second part being the adult Saroo, now fully integrated into Tasmanian society and surrogate family, leading a privileged life compared to the one he lost. <br/><br/>Young Saroo is played astonishingly by Sunny Pawar who manages to convey emotion and feeling with little dialogue. He's truly amazing, being totally believable and the chemistry he shares with the other actors is beyond incredible. He actually steals the show from the other leading actors, even though all give brilliant performances. <br/><br/>Dev Patel plays the adult Saroo, those emotional torment is different, it's still portrayed greatly, racked with guilt with a sense of possible betrayal for all involved. Not wanting to hurt anyone, but to fulfil his need to find his original family. Patel did a lot of research for his role, travelling to India to visit the orphanage and to ride the same train journey trying to imagine what nightmare it must have been for young Saroo. <br/><br/>Nicole Kidman was chosen by the real life Susan Brierley, the surrogate mother of Saroo and adopted brother Mantosh. Kidman and the film show just how remarkable the real Susan Brierley is, at first being kind and understanding beyond measure, brave and loving only to then become something greater when you discover her motives and reasoning. She's become an inspiration to myself. <br/><br/>Dustin O'Halloran and Volker Bertelmann, better known as Hauschka, compose a fitting score for the film, with strings conveying themes of loneliness, discovery and enlightenment in both child and adult. Sia's busy year of end credit songs doesn't end in 2016, providing another great track ""Never Give Up"" which includes ethnic music.<br/><br/>Davis does an exceptional job, directing names such as Kidman, Patel and Rooney Mara. He has a graceful, elegant style with brilliant use of light and composure. It's a tough story with perfect portrayals that embellishes the meaning of family, love and the maternal spirit. Really looking forward to see what Davis gives us next. <br/><br/>Running Time: 8 The Cast: 9 Performance: 10 Direction: 10 Story: 9 Script: 9 Creativity: 10 Soundtrack: 9 Job Description: 8 The Extra Bonus Points: 10 for Sunny Pawar's performance. <br/><br/>92% 9/10"

","Lion is a film of two halves. It starts with the story of 5 year old Saroo in India who with his older brother Guddu tries to make ends meet for his mother by stealing coal from train trucks.<br/><br/>One day Saroo pesters his brother to take him to work some distance from their home but Saroo gets tired and falls asleep on a train and ends up in Calcutta, hundreds of miles away from his village. Unable to speak Bengali, unsure of where he is from, his mother's name, he survives with other street children and fend of sexual predators. Saroo is then placed in an orphanage before he is adopted by a well to do Australian couple.<br/><br/>In Australia the now grown up Saroo (Dev Patel) haunted by visions of his brother and mother searching for him starts to search for his family, home and identity. The search becomes an obsession, he gives up his job, becomes distant from his adopted parents as he goes through Google Earth looking for clues based on vague childhood memories.<br/><br/>Director Garth Davis made the underwhelming television series Top of the Lake in 2013. Here he has a surer touch, maybe because he has a better and more coherent screenplay.<br/><br/>The second half of the film is not as strong or powerful as the first half, even clunky in places. Saroo's other adopted brother has emotional problems, it his hinted in the film that some of the kids in the orphanage might had been sexually abused but we never find out why Saroo's adopted brother is the way he is.<br/><br/>However the film is well paced and we see the contrast from the tumultuous scenes in India to the more tranquil scenes in Tasmania."
"Red_Identity","Null","1","2","28 January 2017"," Very straightforward, but heartwarming
","It's not a surprise at all that a story like this was made into a novel and then a film. It's the kind of thing audiences eat up. For that reason, the film follows a very predictable path that ends exactly where you expect. On one hand, it's hard to deviate too much because it is based on a true story. However, I still believe that the screenplay and director could have added so much more to make this a truly great film. As it is, it's still a very good one. A flawed one, but one that manages to effectively convey what it wants to. The acting is really good and I am really happy that Dev Patel got so many award nominations for this."

","This is a sensitive and empathetic film that casts all characters in their best light. There is no villain, no 'saviour' just a range of people trying to do their best. The footage in India is warts and all. As a frequent visitor to India, I found the portrayal of India to be honest. It is a wonderful place but also suffers from extreme poverty and horrendous overpopulation with all its inherent blights. Sunny Pawar is a wonderful 'young' Saroo. His plight and journey in India is examined in great detail, and when he is adopted by a Tasmanian couple his journey in Australia is glanced upon until Dev Patel emerges from the Ocean as the now 26-year-old Saroo. The story then moves to Saroo trying desperately to reconnect with his family in India. A difficult task as he has no idea where he hailed from. The performances of all the main characters were sensitively portrayed. Nicole Kidman's role was minimal but honest. The heroes of the movie are Sunny Pawar and Dev Patel. Sunny for his wonderful portrayal of a boy thrown into a nightmare, and surviving. Dev Patel for his portrayal as the young man drawn headlong into a seeming less impossible task. A tear-jerker with genuine emotion."
"vasco_cid","8","1","2","23 January 2017"," Intelligent, sensible and uplifting
","Slow, thoughtful and intelligent, Lion expertly and refreshingly avoids the typical clichés of the based-on-a-true-story-for-awards-season formula. <br/><br/>The narrative, aptly split into two disparate narrative and linguistic halves, follows the real life events of Saroo, a young Indian boy who is lost on a train heading to Calcutta, wandering lost and alone for two months until he was brought to an orphanage and eventually adopted by an Australian family and relocated to Tasmania. Growing up forgetting is own mother tongue but never his family, his search for the exact whereabouts of his hometown and family, increasingly take a toll on his priorities. <br/><br/>Garth Davis and Greg Fraser expertly capture the essence of loss and despair as well as familiarity and passion, in both Indian and Australian contexts, accentuating their intrinsic contrasting characteristics, while maintaining the characters' guiding thread. Films like Lion are hard to come by; the true story at the base is equally as important to the narrative as the way it is told: prudently and gratifyingly, supported by a minor yet powerhouse by Kidman."
"sol-","Null","1","2","20 January 2017"," Vast Landscapes
","Essentially a film in two parts, the first hour of 'Lion' covers the struggles of a young Indian boy who gets separated from his family in the 1980s, while the second half deals with the boy now grown up, living with an adoptive family in Australia and keen to track his birth mother and actual family down. With a significant chunk of time omitted in between these time periods, 'Lion' never quite feels cohesive, however, both time periods are encapsulating and the film therefore manages to tell two compelling tales within the one film. With large, expressive eyes, first time actor Sunny Pawar as excellent as the protagonist as a boy who finds himself weary and unable to trust anyone after the separation from his family, and eerily enough, none of the authority figures he meets have even heard of his hometown. Equally as good is Dev Patel as the boy grown up who, after learning about Google Earth, becomes 'A Beautiful Mind'-like obsessed with tracking down his Indian family, quitting his job, walls covered in maps and pins, etc. This section of the film may have benefited from a greater depiction of the toll his quest has on his health (physical and mental) and livelihood, driven nearly over the brink by his unwillingness to tell his foster parents of his search, lest they be offended - however it is all interesting to watch all the same. Nicole Kidman is also solid in a small but pivotal role as his foster mother and the aerial photography throughout appropriately captures the vastness of not only India but Australia, emphasising just how significant an achievement his search is."

On a visual level, the photography wax great, capturing the beauty, but also the poverty which is characteristic of India. On what I would define as an ""intellectual"" level, meaning story-line and screenplay, I would say that the writers did a good job in transposing a true and extraordinary tale into a strongly moving picture. The story is cleverly balanced between the youth and the adulthood of the protagonist. In addition to this the soundtrack was also very beautiful and well suited. A final note goes to the actors: the protagonist was egregiously portrayed both by Dev Patel and Sunny Pawar.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I would definitely recommend viewing this film, as it is a an excellent piece of work which will definitely move the viewer and that raises awareness of the condition of children in India.<br/><br/>Definitely worth a cinema ticket and will definitely buy it on DVD."

","Lion tells the true story of Saroo, an Indian boy who is separated from his family at a very young age and is adopted by a couple in Australia. 25 years later as a grown man he sets out to find his mother, brother and sister using the newly created google earth (circa 2008).<br/><br/>This is an incredible story and it carries an important message about love, determination and the importance of family. The central performance by newcomer Sunny Pawar who plays a young Saroo is what really holds the first half of the film together, his on screen presence is phenomenal for someone so young. Dev Patel is the best he's ever been as the grown up Saroo, Oscar worthy to be sure. Supporting performances by Nicole Kidman and Rooney Mara as his adoptive mother and girlfriend are also great and very well cast. <br/><br/>In terms of the script the film does falter in parts especially when attempting to provide character for Nicole Kidmans' character; one scene in particular involves Kidman attempting to explain a 'vision' she had as a child and this is what made her adopt Saroo and his 'brother' Mantosh. The scene feels forced and more of an attempt to add weight to her character as opposed to adding to the overall plot. Nevertheless, this is a minor flaw when compared to the brilliance within this film. <br/><br/>One aspect I adored of this film was the musical score by Dustin O' Halloran and Volker Bertelmann. It adds so much to every scene and its the first thing that hits you when the film begins, it has an emotive tone to it and is a wonderful addition.<br/><br/>Overall. Lion is a film I would absolutely recommend watching for its powerful message and incredible acting and score; it deserves all the awards buzz it is receiving. 8/10"

","I enjoyed the first half a lot. It gave a good impression of India, raised questions, and made me really care for the main character. I was just about to rave about how great the movie was when it suddenly turned boring and overly dramatic. Julia Roberts cries in every scene she gets. She only acts for 10 minutes tops, probably more like 5, and by the end of the movie her tears seem to be more the result of too many plastic surgeries than any genuine feelings. A secondary character, a girlfriend comes in, and does absolutely nothing for the film. She has no role other than to fill in time and to bring in a textbook elements necessary for a movie's success. She fades out exactly as she faded in. We are also forced to watch the main character use google, over and over and over and over again. For about five years of his life.

","Lion is a beautifully produced film that truly captivated my heart and became one of my favorite movies. This film captures everything that I look for in a film. It is filled with emotional, heart-touching scenes, a powerful message and wonderful cinematography. It is very unique and special, very different from what you ordinarily see at the cinema. <br/><br/>The story tells about 5-year-old, vulnerable Indian boy Saroo who gets lost on a train and travels thousands of miles across India away from his dear family. Saroo faces many hardships of life all by himself. Eventually he is taken in and adopted by a caring Australian couple. Years later Saroo feels a part of himself missing and is filled with murky memories of his past as a young child in India. Using Google Earth, Saroo is determined and passionate to find his lost family through the use of this tool.<br/><br/>The lovable and kind Saroo is played by the talented Dev Patel who also had the leading role in the Oscar winning film Slumdog Millionaire. Dav Patel portrays Saroo's passionate determination to be reunited with his family and country in the most believable way. Rooney Mara plays adult Saroo's girlfriend who aids him finding his family. Sue Brieerley, Saroo's adopted mother is portrayed by Nicole Kidman in another stunning performance.<br/><br/>The film runs 120 minutes and I have many favorite scenes, but what touched me most is watching the passion that drives Saroo to find his family. Although he faces many hardships and issues, his love and passion for his family drives him to not quit but overcome every obstacle. Seeing his dedication to be reunited with his roots is inspiring. <br/><br/>The message of this film touched my heart, due to similar personal experience I share with Saroo. As someone who also left their motherland at age six to come to a country with better opportunities I, like Saroo, know how it feels to be reunited with your motherland and have only mercury memories from where you come from. So I relate very deeply to the message of not forgetting your origin and staying true to your background and roots. In addition, the film portrays the message of family and unity which are dear to me as well.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film and recommend it for ages 13 to 18. I give this film 5 out of 5 stars and expect to see this film be nominated for an Oscar.<br/><br/>Reviewed by Maria G., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more reviews by youth visit kidsfirst dot org."

","I was in tears about 20 minutes into the movie. Aside from that, really can't agree with the raving reviews and the Oscar nominations. Really wanted to like the film but just couldn't. A moving true story that could've been executed in a much, much better way with a more skilled director. Characters were flat, plot was so predictable to the point that's almost cliche, many pointless characters and I don't agree with the chronological way that the story is presented. The better portion was the first half of the movie but even that was way too long for my taste and can't help but think that they way that it's done only serves to conform to the negative stereotypes of developing countries in western societies."

","*** This movie is free of sexism and political correctness.

There's a sincerity, a truth and some solid acting by Dev Patel and Nicole Kidman that support an excellent story. Dev even manages to pull off the first perfectly forged Australian accent i've ever heard in a film.<br/><br/>If you are thinking that Lion is the usual cheesy Hollywood pulp, I didn't find that at all. I'd even say that most of these types of movies normally irritate me. This story mostly avoided those clichés. Although, I feel the weak point of the movie was Rooney Mara who was (thankfully) the only blight of the movie. Rooney certainly isn't the lovable, friendly girl next door who would fall for the boy in the story.<br/><br/>I found just about every aspect of the story believable and relatable. The story starts with two brothers surviving day by day in an isolated Indian town. Through a series of events, the youngest boy is caught on a train that takes him far away from his home.<br/><br/>If you manage to sit through this movie without a tear in your eye, you did better than I did.

"jkonoe","8","1","3","23 April 2017"," A great movie but I have a nagging question
","A great book or movie is an emotional journey with deep gorges and high mountains. ""Lion"" is such a movie. The movie follows the physical and emotional journey of a young Indian boy who becomes a grown man in Australia. He goes through an agonizing emotional torture just to reunite with his biological family. With the help of modern technology he succeeds in reuniting with his family. This is an exceptional movie with psychological subtleties and depictions of emotional agonies and sorrow.<br/><br/>However, there is one thing which absolutely baffled me. As a young boy I also grew up in Asia (i.e. Japan) more than twenty years ago. As a young boy of four, the first things I was taught by my parents, grandparents, and kindergarten teachers were how to say my own name, my date of birth, names of my family members, my home address, and my home telephone number. This was and still is a standard education of a young Japanese child. I understand that there are great differences (e.g. culture, size of country, population, etc.) between Japan and India but I absolutely felt that there were total deficiencies in Saroo's education. I also felt that strangers and government officials treated him with total callousness, corruption, and incompetency when he was roaming the streets of Calcutta.<br/><br/>There was a real 1960s case (widely reported in Japan as a happy news) where a Japanese boy hopped on a freight train near Tokyo. He traveled more than 1000 km west and was found lost in western Japan. Japanese railway officials and police had no problem locating his parents because he could recite his own full name, names of his family members, and his home address. He was reunited with his family within a day or two. Why didn't Saroo know his own home address? Why couldn't Saroo give his mother's name—except for Mum? I understand that it was a true story but it was laughable to say the least. I had no problem telling my mother's name and my home address when I was four. I feel that it is commonsensical to teach your own children the home address and home phone number. Are poor Indian parents so deficient in common sense that they don't even teach their kids to say their own home address? This question absolutely baffled me."
"gcastles-35417","8","1","3","10 April 2017"," A devastating true story
","I normally wouldn't dream of watching a film with Nicole Kidman in it, but having seen author Saroo Brierley interviewed on Australian television I was interested enough in his story to want to see this film.<br/><br/>As a 5 year old, Saroo became lost in India and wound up in an orphanage because he was simply too young to be able to provide details as to where he came from and who his family was. He was adopted by an Australian couple and raised with all the luxuries he would have missed out on in India. Yet he has a yearning to find his family, to let his mother know that he is OK. The film explores the unique story of how as a young adult he began searching for his family using google earth, looking for familiar landscapes in the satellite images in the region he believes he came from.<br/><br/>Both the young Saroo (played by Sunny Pawar) and the adult (Dev Patel) give beautiful performances in this film. Pawar takes us through the terror such a small child must endure to be lost in a megacity like Mumbai, and Patel is the rudderless young man with everything to be grateful for who is tormented by dreams of his family of origin. Kidman was surprisingly very good as Sue Brierley, and accompanied by master actor David Wenham as husband John they show us how the Brierly's desire as a childless couple to give love and affection to orphaned children from disadvantaged backgrounds is confounded by the traumatic backgrounds the boys they adopt cannot escape from. Both Patel and Kidman were nominated for Oscars for their performances. <br/><br/>Ultimately, Lion is a film that will be remembered by cinema-goers for the empathy it makes us feel; but in addition it is very well crafted, with some beautiful cinematography and great dialogue. This is the first film by Garth Davis, who previously directed the sensational miniseries Top of the Lake (2013). Lion has well and truly launched him into the US market, with his next film (Mary Magdalene) due out late in 2017 starring Rooney Mara, Joaquim Pheonix and Chiwetel Ejiofor. Lion clearly shows why Davis is now working on such a big project."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","1","3","10 March 2017"," Outstanding example of emotion-driven storytelling
","You know that helplessly choked up feeling you get watching a TV news feature or documentary special about parents and children reuniting after years or decades apart? That's the fuel that powers ""Lion,"" a classically emotional story accentuated by astute craftsmanship.<br/><br/>The journey of Saroo — played in the first half of the film by young Sunny Pawar and in the latter half by Dev Patel — awakens our innermost empathy. Director Garth Davis and screenwriter Luke Davies take great patience in nurturing the deeply human core of Saroo Brierly's powerful true story.<br/><br/>At five years old, Saroo was separated from his family in a small Indian village and accidentally boarded a train that shipped him to Calcutta, practically another country away. Forced to develop street smarts to survive, Saroo narrowly escapes potentially worse trauma (kidnapping, child labor) and eventually ends up in an orphanage, where he is later adopted by Austalian couple John (David Wenham) and Sue (Nicole Kidman) Brierly. As an adult taking hotel management courses in Melbourne, Saroo begins to reconnect with memories of his distant past, and becomes overwhelmingly compelled to find his family of origin. <br/><br/>Especially in the first half of the film, the storytelling is almost effortless. Warmth comes instantly watching Saroo interact with his mother (Priyanka Bose), sister and older brother Guddu (Abhishek Bharate), and seeing him mistakenly separated from his well-meaning brother and then navigating the treacherous streets of Calcutta is heart-wrenching. Davies' script leaves us helplessly watching Saroo struggle and survive, taking its time to really tell that story rather than just provide the essential information. The move is a crudely emotional wallop, the kind that wins audiences' hearts.<br/><br/>The simplicity of the childhood narrative also gives Davis a lot of wiggle room as a director. He and cinematographer Greig Fraser create so much atmosphere, making India dark and scary or beautiful and spiritual. When Saroo first arrives in Calcutta, lost in a mass of train station crowds, the scale, vibrancy and scariness put you there physically and emotionally with Saroo. They also capture his childlike wonder along with his skepticism. No knock on young Pawar's remarkable performance either.<br/><br/>The large portion screen time dedicated to Saroo's childhood journey magnifies the film's ultimate catharsis, but it also creates a sort of partition between the first and second halves. Davies spends so much time acquainting us with young Saroo that we have to get to know him again as an adult despite being well into the throes of the narrative. The storytelling gets a little tougher here with this jump in time and the inevitable course of the plot leading Saroo to find his family.<br/><br/>Patel plays a critical role in bridging our emotional experience watching young Saroo to his character's journey of rediscovering long-forgotten memories and becoming somewhat obsessively driven to reconnect and make peace with his cloudy past. He hits all the emotional beats of the story and we end up in complete sync with him at every one of those junctures as he discovers new information or makes a crucial realization. Kidman does the same thing, but in unexpected ways because of how wrapped up we get in Saroo's story. She gives the film a left-field punch that brings it added dimension.<br/><br/>The only emotional challenge that the film struggles with helping us access why Saroo is so private about his search, as well as his inability to let others (namely his adoptive parents) in. A few points of contention between him and girlfriend Lucy (Rooney Mara) don't carry any kind of emotional weight despite their importance to the narrative of pushing Saroo to where he needs to be.<br/><br/>The private nature of Saroo's search demands the best of not only Patel, but also Davis and editor Alexander de Franceschi, who weave together Google Earth searches with childhood flashbacks and Patel's emotional responses. It's an ambitious attempt to facilitate drama from the unexciting experience of a man searching on a computer for his childhood village, but there's a lot of visual symbolism connected to it and, of course, an emotional component.<br/><br/>With emotion as the central cog of everything that makes it tick, ""Lion"" envelops the audience in a predictable yet no less moving way. What elevate the story beyond that human appeal are the production values. They work in concert with one another to enhance the artistic value of a viewing experience that almost exclusively engages the heart. For those who prefer films target their feelings above all else, ""Lion"" is one you can't miss – for everyone else, it's a worthwhile watch. <br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

","Lion is a well-executed, sincerely made, very emotional ""true life"" film which received six Oscar nominations at the 89th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor (Patel), Best Supporting Actress (Kidman) and Best Adapted Screenplay.<br/><br/>It is about a very poor boy (Saroo) in an Indian orphanage who was adopted by a kind Australian couple. When Saroo grows up he recalls his childhood days and becomes restless to find his true roots – which brings him back to India.<br/><br/>Although it does not have too much of drama, but it succeeds in pulling the audience along with the flow of the story.<br/><br/>Presentation is more important than the idea itself. A simple story can be presented thoughtfully and enticingly.<br/><br/>Lion is a proved example of that.<br/><br/>But why is the film called ""Lion"" when there is no real Lion in the film? The truth is revealed after the film ends.<br/><br/>MERITS OF ""LION"" <br/><br/>1 – Interestingly, the film (directed empathetically by a first-timer Garth Davis) does not have too much of dialogues and heavy scenes. He relies more on moving imagery, telling shots and sound to tell the story. The pace of the film is creatively slow as it organically moves from one page to the next.<br/><br/>And this proves to be very effective – which just pulls you in. You will love it when you see it. Only a deadpan person will remain unmoved by the emotional pull of this beautifully made film.<br/><br/>You will surely feel for the character Saroo (played by Sunny Pawar when young and Dev Patel when grown up).<br/><br/>2 – Cinematography is captivating! It scans beautiful landscapes (in India and Australia) to go with the flow of the story.<br/><br/>3 – Background score is very arousing and fully uplifts and throws into high relief every situation in the film.<br/><br/>4 – Sunny Power is adorable as the young Saroo. I loved the cute voice he has. He may not be an acting powerhouse, but whatever acting he has done is enough for us to empathise with him.<br/><br/>5 - Dev Patel has certainly matured as an actor since his Slumdog Millionaire days. But Nicole Kidman has very few scenes as Saroo's mother.<br/><br/>DEMERITS OF ""LION"" <br/><br/>1 – Saroo's longing for his roots and his interest to see his long lost family (before coming back to India) is presented in a very brief manner – WITHOUT any depth! His interactions with other people in his life (parents and girl friend) are pretty shallow.<br/><br/>It is here that audience will feel ""de-empathised"" after showing empathy in the first hour or so.<br/><br/>This empathy and emotional connect could've been sustained if the ""longing for his roots"" phase in Tasmania had been presented with more DEPTH. <br/><br/>This ""depth"" could have taken the form of curiosity on Saroo's part to know more and more about where he came from by talking to his parents and with a build-up of passion in him to know more about himself.<br/><br/>2 – The reunion between the long lost son (from Australia) and the mother (in India) is done in public, with villagers around them. How strange! It should have been done in private, thereby, creating the right sombre atmosphere for such an emotional reunion.<br/><br/>Although what we see in the film is also emotional, but it should have been done in private, unless the public reunion is precisely what happened in real life.<br/><br/>3 – Saroo is never shown kissing his American girlfriend, even when they are in bed a few times. Why? Did Saroo never did that in real life too? Strange! <br/><br/>Finally, Garth Davis is very impressive as the Director. He certainly excelled in his craft ending up attracting the attention of the Oscar management.<br/><br/>LION IS WORTH A 2nd WATCH! <br/><br/>Garth Davis keep it up!<br/><br/>PS:<br/><br/>Have something to say to me? <br/><br/>Shoot a mail to inforaza@gmail.com"

If only the talent and effort that went into making this had gone to a better written screenplay. Instead it hopes and pushes for sympathy by boasting about the reality behind it."
"svorva","7","1","3","1 February 2017"," 2017 Oscars: 100% Cheap Emotional Manipulation Free
","I am happy to announce that no Best Drama for Housewives Honorary Oscar will be presented this year.<br/><br/>This semiannual disgrace is bestowed on syrupy films that garner widespread critical praise or awards. They contain emotionally manipulative plots with absolutely no interest in real world consequences. Room earned this distinction last year.<br/><br/>I make this announcement during my Lion review not just because I could not of a clever introduction. The comparison is just too obvious and proves Lion was a potential disaster averted by more refined creators. Both films are adaptations, Lion from the book A Long Way Home. Adaption is a tricky process for even the great filmmakers. One common problem, narration, murdered Room and even gave legend Scorsese trouble in the first act of his 2016 film Silence. Additionally, both movies uses the Child in Peril. An age old technique to manipulate audiences and grab their attention. This method's effectiveness is rooted in human nature and has depreciated in bygone decades. Maybe India's exoticness acted as a distraction, but Lion never felt cheap. Although the film begins to coast after the first act, Lion is the emotional experience we hope to get out of our best drama. I didn't laugh. I didn't cry. But my elation was real and my eyes might have been a bit moist.<br/><br/>Lion is based on the real life story of Saroo, introduced as a 7-8 year old boy (Sunny Pawar) living in the village of Ganesh Tali, India. He is the middle child in a family existing between survival and poverty. The father is absent and Saroo's mother works as a labor to secure a living. Saroo reveres his elder brother Guddu, not many years older, but already working and stealing to survive. Guddu frequently brings his brother on these excursion, but one evening Saroo falls asleep on a decommissioned train. Saroo is trapped on a 1000+ km journey across the subcontinent. After escaping in Calcutta, Saroo is alone and unable to speak the common language in a city filed with predators. Through both misfortune and luck, Saroo is adopted by an Australian couple the Brierleys (Kidman, Wenam). Years later, Saroo (Dev Patel) is beginning a career when his forgotten past suddenly reenters his life. Traumatized, Saroo must reconcile with his past, his family, and his girlfriend (Mara).<br/><br/>The first act is sublime. I honestly have no idea how to evaluate child actors, but Pawar commands more love and best wishes than just any cute face. His innocence and filial devotion toward his brother makes him unforgettable. This purity exists in sharp contrast with the world around him. Village slums are bearable with family, but watching him alone in the streets of Calcutta is excruciating. Our perception of the child carries the film going forwarded. There is a natural affinity for older Saroo. His filial devotion remains, making him unmistakable from the child Saroo and still likable. We want this character who is still a child in our eyes to be spared suffering. As of writing, Dev Patel is nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. His performance is certainly notable, but the nomination is more a result of underselling the role. Patel is the lead for 2/3 of the movie. That is beyond the scope of a supporting character, but Supporting Actor is much less competitive than Best Actor where Patel would have no chance. Kidman has her own nomination and her role is opposite. She sticks to the background, but then steps up and carries one crucial scene. She has no chance at hardware, but her performance provides some energy to otherwise bland acts. The actual goings on in the second half involve Saroo investigating his roots online, pretty uninteresting. Really the second half is devoted to character emotions, which considering nothing else is happening, are not complex. Obviously Saroo is damaged from his ordeal and simply forgetting his past is not psychologically satisfying. Lion tries working these feelings in the context of family, but by the time Saroo makes breakthroughs this attempt at an emotional tapestry becomes a throw rug. Instantly forgettable. A letdown, considering young Saroo and the cinematography are great film caliber. Lion might not be infallible, but it is the rare honest drama well worth a winter's evening."

","I have watched many movies and read many amazing stories of people who have battled and overcome personal situations in their lives, many of these stories i have been touched by them being told, but this story was so beautifully told, from the moment the movie started it took me through the eyes of this child how he lived and walked through life, the struggles he had to overcome to survive which shows how much we take for granted. I felt, as i watched it there was so much realism in it with out any Hollywood b.s. to boost the story, it felt raw, real and equally beautiful and sad at the same time.

","Lion isn't the most tightly directed film, nor the most emotionally impactful. But it's one of the most unique films I've seen this year. So much like Captain Fantastic, I really like the film as a whole, but I appreciate the film's originality even more.<br/><br/>I always love sitting down for a film that's structured entirely different than your prototypical movie thrown in theaters every weekend. I love blockbusters as much as the next guy, but there's something to be said about smaller and more independently made features. Lion is based on a true story about an adopted boy, Saroo, who uses google earth to try and find his original family from India. <br/><br/>As happens sometimes with true stories adapted into feature length films, it's difficult to structure a 2 hour story from events that took place over the course of several years. Lion begins when Saroo is only five years old, and spans over 20 years. To say this was a difficult story to adapt is an understatement, and I think this is the only area where the film really has some faults. After spending significant screen time with a young Saroo, you are asked to then follow a late 20's Saroo, played by Dev Patel, and it's not the smoothest of transitions. Granted, I got over it after a few scenes, but the very nature of this story makes it difficult to keep the flow even throughout.<br/><br/>Patel, along with his young counterpart, Sunny Pawar, are terrific. As a first time actor, Pawar, had to take on an entire first act by himself, and you'd think he'd been doing this for years already. It's unlikely he'll come close to winning, but he should be considered for best supporting actor. You can't find that much charisma at that age easily.<br/><br/>When Lion hits emotionally, it really hits. I think it's the time in between that takes the overall quality of the film down a notch. Some sporadic pacing and a story that calls for a wandering plot makes for a mediocre experience. But when the film chooses to sink your teeth into an extremely engrossing journey into what it feels like to be lost, it contains some of the most emotionally impactful sequences. The last shot says it all. I just wish it wasn't so few and far between.<br/><br/>+Some heavy, heavy stuff here<br/><br/>+Pawar is a young star<br/><br/>+A Journey worth taking<br/><br/>-Pacing<br/><br/>-Story sometimes strays away from where it should stay<br/><br/>7.8/10"

","We all have a family. You may live with the family of your birth, with a family which adopted you or with a family that you have made through getting married and having children. It doesn't matter which. You have a family. Since we can all relate to having family, it also follows that we can all understand what it means to be separated from family. And you can probably imagine what it would be like to have a family that is lost to you, to desperately desire a reunion, but be unable to make it happen. A person in that situation may become part of another family, even one that is full of love, but still never stop thinking of his original family. That's what the main character is facing in the Australian-produced drama ""Lion"" (PG-13, 1:58).<br/><br/>The film is based on the true story of Indian-born Australian businessman Saroo Brierley, as told in his 2014 book ""A Long Way Home"". As a 5-year-old, Saroo was abandoned by his older brother in a train station near his home in central India. Saroo wandered onto another train where he got locked in one of the unoccupied cars and was unable to get out until the train stopped for good in Calcutta, over 900 miles from his home. Saroo couldn't tell the authorities enough about his hometown or his family for them to help him find his way back home, so he was declared ""lost"" and put up for adoption. He was soon adopted by John and Sue Brierley, an upper middle class couple who lived on the southeastern Australian island of Tasmania. It was there that he grew up as a member of a happy family. When he became an adult, he began thinking more about his family in India and how they must still wonder what happened to him – and if he's even still alive – if they are still alive themselves. He began using satellite images from Google Earth to look at train stations he might have passed through 25 years earlier – and desperately hoping to match something in those images with any of the details he could still remember.<br/><br/>That was the bare bones of Saroo's factual story, and here's how it plays out in the film ""Lion"": Saroo (Sunny Pawar) is a happy 5-year-old from a poor family living in a neighborhood of the city of Khandwa, India. Saroo's mother, Kamla (Priyanka Bose), is a single parent who works moving rocks at construction sites, in order to feed Saroo, his younger sister and their teenage brother, Guddu (Abhishek Bharate). Saroo is very close to Guddu, following him everywhere. Guddu tries to help his mother by stealing and selling coal from passing trains and Saroo helps. When Guddu announces late one night that he's going to take the train to a nearby city to get temporary work moving bales of hay, Saroo convinces Guddu to let him come along. When the boys arrive at their destination and get off the train, Saroo is so tired that Guddu lays him down on a bench to sleep while Guddu goes to see about the job. Before Guddu can get back, Saroo wakes up and, looking for his brother, wanders onto another train, but gets locked inside one of the cars. This train doesn't make all of its usual stops and Saroo is unable to get off or get help.<br/><br/>Saroo ends up in Calcutta (now known as Kolkata), on the other side of India. Saroo is so far from home that the locals speak a different dialect than he does. Even with the help of a translator, Saroo can't tell anyone exactly where he is from and can only identify his mother as ""mum"". After living with other homeless children in or near the Calcutta train station for a few days and escaping some potentially dangerous situations in the city, he ends up in a center for missing children. After exhausting every effort to find where Saroo belongs, the center allows him to be adopted by Sue Brierley (Oscar winner Nicole Kidman) and her husband, John (David Wenham). John and Sue are loving parents who soon also adopt another Indian boy named Mantosh. As an adult, Saroo (now played by Dev Patel) begins a search for his original family. He doesn't want to hurt the Brierleys, but he agonizes over what the past 25 years must have been like for his Indian family, especially for his birth mother and for Guddu. As Saroo prepares for a career in hotel management, he falls in love with a classmate named Lucy (multiple Oscar nominee Rooney Mara), who is sympathetic to Saroo's emotional need to find his family, but is frustrated by Saroo's growing obsession with a search that has little chance of success. Understanding that he is looking for the proverbial needle in a haystack and is distancing himself from those closest to him, he still cannot stop searching for answers to who he is – and to find the family who loved him first.<br/><br/>""Lion"" is a fascinating, emotional and very entertaining film. It showed more of Saroo's life in India than I would've expected and it sometimes seems like a bit much, but it's that background that gives this film its emotional heart. It's also helpful that most of the story is told chronologically, with flashbacks used only sparingly and for surprising reveals. The film's ending won't be a surprise to anyone familiar with the story, but it still makes for the most emotional 5-10 minutes in recent cinematic memory. And the last few shots and information revealed during the closing credits are both surprising and satisfying. With such an emotionally engaging story so well told and so well-acted, ""Lion"" is not to be missed. ""A"""

","The movie Lion directed by Garth Davis is awesome. The movie is about a 5 year old boy Saroo and his teenage brother Guddu who do whatever they can to bring home food for their mom and little sister. And then Saroo gets separated from his brother and is lost. Ends up getting adopted by an Australian couple (Nicole Kidman as Sue Brierly and David Wenham as John Brierly).<br/><br/>The story is sad and happy, beautiful and mean . Even after living away from home for 25 years, Saroo remembers his first 5 years of life clearly, life filled with Guddu's caring and loving presence and mom's loving embrace. Mom, brother and sister made his life lovable and something he longed for again. One of my favorite scenes is when young Saroo prays to Goddess , eats the blessed food and after that manages to run away from a ""nice"" lady who feeds him and cleans him up to sell him to a child peddler. Saroo is blessed because he had excellent upbringing from a mother who loved him and taught her 3 kids how to care and look after each other. Excellent acting, especially Sunny Pawar as young Saroo is terrific and Dev Patel(slumdog millionaire, man who knew infinity )as adult Saroo is excellent, both are Oscar worthy. Script is perfect. Cinematography is nice. Excellent Direction. Oscar worthy ."

","When Awards Season comes around I always set myself a target to watch as many of the nominated and winning films as possible in the three big ceremonies, if not all of them, this film was no exception. Based on the true story, in 1986, five-year-old Indian boy Saroo (Sunny Pawar) lives in poverty in a secluded part of rural Central India with his mother Kamla Munshi (Priyanka Bose) and older brother Guddu (Abhishek Bharate). One day Saroo follows Guddu to work, they stop at a train station, Saroo stays and awaits for his brother's return, he wakes from a sleep to find his brother has not come back, Saroo calls for Guddu, before boarding an empty train, he rests and falls asleep. Saroo wakes on the train while it is moving, alone and locked in the carriage he is forced to wait, after several days the train stops in faraway Calcutta, 1500 miles away from his home, he only speaks Hindi, so does not understand the Bangali language. Saroo is forced to spend the night in the station with other stranded children, he continues to wander around the city, before friendly woman Noor (Tannishtha Chatterjee) brings him to her apartment, she tells him that Rama (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) can help him get home, but not trusting them Saroo runs away. Saroo is found by a man who takes him to the police, he says he is from a place called ""Ganestalay"", unable to trace his family they put him in an orphanage, three months later Mrs. Sood (Saroj Sood) tells him his photograph has been in the newspaper, but no-one has claimed him. An Australian couple want to adopt him, so Saloo is taught some English and taken to Australia to be cared for by Sue Brierley (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Nicole Kidman) and her husband John (The Lord of the Rings' David Wenham), later they also adopt Mantosh (Keshav Jadhav), who has trouble adjusting. Twenty years later, Saroo (BAFTA winning, and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Dev Patel) has moved to Melbourne to study hotel management and started a relationship with Lucy (Rooney Mara). One night, sharing an Indian meal with friends, Saroo starts to recall his childhood, he tells that he is adopted but has little memory of his hometown location, his friends suggest using Google Earth to search. Saroo begins to search, using the past memories he can recall, but he disconnects with Lucy, and is overwhelmed thinking of the emotions his family must have gone through when he went missing. Saroo visits Sue, whose health is deteriorating, she tells that she was never infertile, she and John decided to help others and thought there were too many people already in the world. Saroo continues his search on Google Earth with no success, then one night he extends his search further, from Calcutta he follows the track, eventually finding the station where he boarded the train, then he notices the rock formations where his mother worked, he finally finds where he lived, the town is called Khandwa, but the neighbourhood is Ganesh Talai (""Ganestalay""). Saroo finally tells adoptive mother Sue about his search, she is fully supportive of his efforts, he takes a flight to India to find and return to his former hometown, in the end he has a highly emotional reunion with his biological mother and sister, but is sad to learn that Guddu is dead. The real Saroo Brierley returned home in 2012, his brother Guddu was killed by a train the same night he disappeared, his mother never gave up hope that her missing son would return, his adoptive mother also came to meet his biological mother in India, and it is revealed that Saroo learned he had been mispronouncing his own name, which was actually Sheru, which in Hindi means ""Lion"". It is odd that Patel is nominated Supporting Actor when he is the lead star, perhaps because the child and he is not highly well-known in Hollywood, he does give a good performance, as does Kidman as his caring and nurturing adoptive mother, but it is young newcomer Pawar who shines as the poor child who is unintentionally separated from his family, he should have been nominated! The first half of the film is amazing, the boy from a remote village with no money and identification getting lost and trying to find way back, the second half does plod on a little with the grown up Indian nervous to return home, but it does show the good the internet can do, and the final reunion is tearjerking, all in all it is moving and thought-provoking stuff, I would highly recommend it, a brilliant drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Original Score for Dustin O'Halloran and Volker Bertelmann, it won the BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography and Original Music, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Original Score. Very good!"

","Eighty-thousand children go missing each year in India. Saroo Brierley, author of the autobiography, ""A Long Way Home,"" was one, and he tells about his incredible journey from India to Australia and back again. The result of the adapted indie drama, Lion, is a well-intended attempt which utilizes a ""been there, done that"" approach to prove how the community can pitch in to help families across the globe.<br/><br/>Sure enough, being a depressingly heartwarming weepie, Lion starts on a heartbreaking note. Saroo as an adorable little five-year-old oversleeps and loses his way in a dark train station, separated from his older brother. He hops onto a train and arrives at another station far away, and sees no options available other than to sleep on cardboard with other lost kids. The stay gets cut short though, as several kidnappers force him out. He then comes across new parts of India's culture he never knew existed beyond his mother's work as a rock-hauler. A hospitable Hindu couple helps Saroo out until he runs away out of desperation. Soon, with hopes of locating his parents, an orphanage takes him in, where beatings occur daily.<br/><br/>Eye-swelling in these first moments are guaranteed while watching a vulnerable little tike lose his innocence before reaching his full development of memory cells. When also considering how everyone in India speaks in their native tongue with English subtitles, an extra step authenticates the true story. However I must admit: the boy cast as Saroo, Sunny Pawar, acts precisely how any young actor would in his first role. Nobody cheers him on because of his talent, but because of his cuteness.<br/><br/>A kind Australian couple eventually adopts Saroo, with some English lessons included to help him with the transition. As investing as it all feels, the very next event is, ""20 years later."" So did nothing interesting happen within twenty years? This sort of leap in time happens constantly throughout the picture, limiting the story possibilities and minimizing Saroo's motives of returning to India. So proof exists in why Lion would prefer to tug on your heartstrings over structuring the story to deserve the countless awards it campaigned so hard for.<br/><br/>Speaking of awards, my complements go to the Academy Award nominated performances of Nicole Kidman (The Hours, Moulin Rouge!) and Dev Patel (Slumdog Millionaire). Both portrayals standout satisfactorily well, carrying the second half of the film to maintain the audiences' tears. Although I ought to complain about Kidman's distractingly obvious wig. Yes, I realize they needed to cast a talented actress, and yes, I understand she needs to look like the real-life counterpart, so why not cast someone whose natural hair looks like the real life counterpart? Or maybe dye Kidman's hair? Oh, right. They needed an already nominated actress to guarantee a nomination, and she has to still look pretty in her natural silky blonde hair for those expensive interviews and campaigns.<br/><br/>Yet like any other Oscar-bait picture, the production crew still put in tremendous effort. Saroo's growth into manhood blooms to life through various scenic shots meant to highlight memories of home, such as moths illuminated by the sun, or the infinite route of a railroad track. Then as things turn more personal and distanced from youth, the camera pulls in closer to the human face. The minds and hearts of everyone involved were in the right place, even if Lion turns out no different in quality than the summer released indie crowd-pleaser.<br/><br/>Clearly, Lion will fall out of the public's memory after the 2017 Oscars ceremony. But the #LionHeart campaign it started will last much longer. It exists to raise donations to benefit the 80,000 lost children in India, and worldwide. I encourage you to offer them a small donation; even just a little can travel a long ways to make a difference."

The story is about Saroo Brierley (who is also the writer of the novel) and the there are lots of suspense and emotional attachment about India. I am nit telling the story but as per IMDb, the story is about a five-year- old child who lost on a street of Calcutta city which is a thousand kilometers away from his home. He survives many challenges before being adopted by a couple who lived in Australia. After 25 years, he sets out to find his lost family. Very engaging story and this is based on a novel written by Saroo Brierley.<br/><br/>Well, this is recognized as a drama movie but I think this is nit a drama movie.

There are lots of emotions and struggling of the central character and the survival story of the boy is very much imperious. The one and the only reason is Dev Patel.

In this movie, he is the central character and as ""Saroo Brierley"" he is just outstanding. The director missed some opportunities to create a gem like the novel but Dev Patel saved him from making a dumb movie. The movie is the full show of Dev Patel's acting and he made this movie an enjoyable one. <br/><br/>I am not telling this is a bad movie but if you have already read the novel this is not for you.

The first half of the film is in different dialects of Indian with English sutitles, and that can be kind of hard to get through, but about 45 minutes or so into the movie when the dialouge is mostly in English for the remainder of the film. Dev Patel and costar Rooney Mara have something in common. They've both starred in terrible films, but have redeemed themselves with Oscar nominated films. (Patel was in that garbage ""Last Airbender"" movie, and Mara was in the most recent ""Fantastic Four"" remake and ""Pan"", but has starred in ""The Martian which I liked.) This deserves the Best Supporting Actor and Best Adapted Screenplay awards it won. I agree with some critics that some parts of the film moved at a slow pace, but in my opinion the emotion portrayed in those scenes far outweighs the slow pace. The film is emotional and nearly made me cry. It's an absolutely fantastic and brilliant piece of cinema.

","Minor spoilers included in this review<br/><br/>First of all, it is indeed a powerful real-life event and I was very touched after learning the stories behind the real-life protagonist of this film.<br/><br/>The first half of movie is the life of young-adolescent Saroo (played by Sunny Pawar)
and second half is the life of Young-adult Saroo (played by Dev Patel)<br/><br/>both actors brings a powerful performance and the latter half even features power-house performances from Rooney Mara and Nicole Kidman.<br/><br/>But the first half which is played by then-unknown actors was somehow more convincing and easier to get absorbed to the story. I am not trying to say that well-known actors are getting in the way of the story (or maybe I am saying that, but I am too nice to say it blatantly), but the film only shows young Saroo's life when he was 5-6 years old, and then when it skips to young-adult Saroo all of sudden being in his mid-20s, haunted by the his life events at his adolescent life, becuase of that 15-18 years gap between two stories, it is really hard to delve into the psyche of the young-adult characters.<br/><br/>I understand this is a feature-length movie and you cannot pull your inner Scorsese/Tarantino out by going over 3 hours of running time but be rather economical with it. But because of the sudden time skip between two eras in the story, and because the first half takes place in India and second half in Australia all of sudden, it seems like watching two separate films - almost like a double-bill.<br/><br/>I wish there was a better transition between two parts.<br/><br/>But the story itself is very powerful and has a provocative message on Adoption issues and mental health. The second half is a definite tear-jerker, it is quite impossible fight back the tears even when you know how the movie was better in the first half.<br/><br/>I hope they make a short TV series with the same story, so the story delves into Saroo's life between 5yr old- 20yr old.<br/><br/>This movie also made me realize how the story is greater than its performer. Despite the excellent acting from all the actors in the second half, it just could not exceed the more powerful first half played by Sunny Pawar and Abhishek Bharate"

"robertemerald","7","0","1","4 June 2019"," Deeply sentimental eye-opener
","I loved seeing rural India in this movie. The first half, being a straight story arc without flashbacks, is set entirely in India and, indeed, is truly a masterpiece. The second half sees several complications added to the storyline, with the importance of other characters (with their own stories), along with frequent use of flashbacks as Saroo begins reliving his early childhood in earnest. This half sees many tears. The first half is on par with Salaam Bombay, and in fact resembles that movie in many ways. The soundtrack is orchestral, and I thought a little old-fashioned, although the motif is sweet, with piano dominating at times. As a biography it's a good reflection of an emotional loss and subsequent journey to find one's origins. Personally I thought other India based movies were better, such as Slumdog Millionaire or the one mentioned above, but then again I'm not sure it's fair to compare them. I'm sure most people will find this heartfelt and very sentimental journey a revelation, but for me the frustrations of the latter half, albeit a true story, were not as spellbinding as the magical first half."

The second half of the movie follows an older Saroo who has been adopted by an Australian couple living in Tasmania. The couple adopt Saroo and another boy and are amazing, generous and kind people. We see Saroo do well in life but long to find his originalfamily and watch how he struggles to cope with the guilt of having a now easier and wealthier privaliged life knowing his family are probably still living in poverty. Fantastic performances from everyone especially Dev Patel who really has improved as an actor and is a bit of an unsung British Hollywood hero who often gets forgotten about and overlooked by British media. It really does make you realise there are decent people in the world, courage and dreams can be found in the unlikeliest of lives. Watch it"

","I would rate the story as ordinary as it was done over and over by different films in different languages. Nothing wow factor is there. But I tolerated it to some extend as this was based on a true story hence the director cannot change what actually had happened. The fact it was a true story made the viewers really heartfelt and emotional.<br/><br/>The actors have been chosen with great success.Sunny Pawar has really done a huge part for the success of this film. As a young kid he has given his best realistic emotions to this plot. It made the audience feel what he was going through with high level of intensity. He is definitely inline to be a famous actor in future.<br/><br/>Dev Patel's performance was ordinary. He just acted according to the script and he has not given his heart and soul for his character. Nicole Kidman did not have much range of acting to be done but she has performed well above par in her limited scenes.<br/><br/>I believe Lucy's character should have been more involved with the emotional discussion of Senior Saroo. But director has made her just another fill in character. I believe even some sex scenes were just unnecessary and did not matched the situation at all. So I find it as a failure in LION.<br/><br/>The last episode of the film where Dev Patel is nearing to find his old home has to be more powerful. I believe there was much more anticipation in audience's mind when he started his journey in finding out his old home. The hype created by prior visualizations of Senior Saroo was not lived up at the end. The last moments are just ordinary scenes.<br/><br/>Footage of the real world hero was attached in the end which I believe is the reason why it received 8+ ratings from most of the viewers. Otherwise it will be around 6 and 7. There is an electrifying feeling when you see the real life situation screened in front of you. I mean its real and we get really emotional with the real person who underwent these scenarios. It has caused more people to click the 8+ ratings. It actually boosts the labored end of the film."

I think this story is more powerful if it was on the news than in a movie. It was about this lost son trying to find his mother in India for over 20 years. Though what happened in his life was sad, there isn't much story. It just goes in circles till he finds his mom."
"phoenix-emery","7","0","1","2 May 2018"," Lion
","Though the storyline is compelling and contains many hardships to draw in viewers, it loses my interest during Saroo's adult life, where I believe it is quite drawn out and creates a tension which is merely solved by luck. Though the music does add effect to the movie, it tends to draw out long moment within Saroo's and his girlfriends whilst he continuously contemplates the meaning of where he belongs throughout many years. A repetitive effect used throughout the shots shown of their relationship throughout the middle act and near the end of the movie. <br/><br/>Despite this the beginning act of the movie will have you hooked as it does not fall into what other movies tend to do. Having a 40minute part of subtitles and constant insight into the life within the slums and how this affects the lives of individuals within that community. It creates intense and emotional affects in which can get audiences hooked and crying when empathising with a child being lost on his own.<br/><br/>However, the cast where quite strong in their roles, embodying the pain and sorrow which would of occurred within real life. The young child actor Sunny Pawar was outstanding in his role, it demonstrating how damaged he was becoming and how society is outcasting them. <br/><br/>This movie for majority of the film is quite diverse to others, demonstrating a unique storyline, despite the middle centre which seems bland and typical for an emotional love story. The movie is refreshing for the most part, is distinct in how everyone should see it to decide if they like it or not, as many can feel differently."

","Lion, definitely not a zoo field trip. Every year over 80,000 children go missing in India. The movie, Lion, is an Australian biographical film based on a non-fiction book, A Long Way Home. Written by Saroo Brierley, on his real life journey where he got separated from his family at the age of five. Grab the tissue and ready to be on the edge of your seat. This movie is a tear-jerker as I expected. It brilliantly invites you to the daily hardship of surviving through poverty of a small village in India. Little Saroo, played by the amazing Sunny Pawar. I guarantee you will fall in love instantly. Grown Saroo, played by Dev Patel, whom is well known worldwide after his big break in Slumdog Millionaire in 2008. Adopted by an Australian couple played by the extraordinary Nicole Kidman (Sue), and David Wenham (John Brierley). Saroo never gave up on searching for his birth family. One day, some friends invited him over for dinner, stumbled across a pastry dessert in the kitchen which brought back all his childhood memories and sorrow with his brother. When asked, Saroo stated, ""I'm not from Calcutta, I'm lost."" His friends then suggested him to look for his family using this amazing App. Life is what we make of it! There are countless people all over the world that suffer so much yet they embrace the simplest thing and are so grateful for what it's worth. This is definitely a five-star and a must see-again movie that I recommend."

I won't say how he gets lost but that first act of the film is highly engrossing and emotional and the little boy actor is convincing, charismatic and adorable. The gritty cinematography helps drive the emotions of being lost and searching. This is a clever little boy as later on the film focuses on him as a young adult and how his intelligence has carried him far with an education and girlfriend. The final act focuses on his obsession to find where is from and of course to locate his family. All the acting and emotions are raw and honest with much told through expressions, body language and shot framing. The pacing was good for a film covering large spans of time.

You've probably learned that it's about a boy in India who accidentally got separated from his family and eventually got adopted by an Australian couple, but later decided to try and find his original home. The most intense scenes are in Calcutta, where the young Saroo is forced to wonder the streets and fend for himself, all the while avoiding kidnappers. Knowing that this is a true story adds to the intensity. I can't imagine how terrible it would be to get completely cut off from one's family.<br/><br/>Dev Patel brings strength to the role of the adult Saroo, newly interested in finding out where he came from. I also liked Rooney Mara's performance as his college acquaintance, but I thought that the adoptive parents (Nicole Kidman and David Wenham) weren't as important to the story once he set out in search of his birth mother. Nevertheless, it's a movie that everyone should see. Outstanding one."

","This is a truly moving story and what's more, it's real. It's based on the true story of Saroo, a child from India who gets lost in a train station looking for his brother. He then starts to travel around the country until he arrives at Calcuta and he must try to take care of himself alone. <br/><br/>The movie is divided in two well identified parts. The first one when the young Saroo (the newcomer Sunny Pawar in a an amazing performance that is by far better than the adult ones) gets lost and travel through India until he is taken in adoption by an Australian family. And here starts the second part, with an older Saroo (that being the Slumdog Millionaire actor, Dev Patel, who also gives a great performance) who wants to find his family, helped by Google Earth. This affects a little to the story, because in each part there are moments when I felt it was a bit long. Specially the middle part of the young Saroo and the beginning of the second part until Saroo starts looking for his family. In here I felt that the story wasn't going anywhere. If I have another thing to add that I didn't liked, it's the thing about Mantosh, his old brother when he is adopted. I felt this character was introduced but wasn't used at all. I don't know if in the real story it was like that, but for me he felt a bit off place.<br/><br/>But that's all I have to say of it's bad things. the rest is just amazing. The cinematography of the first part truly captures this sense of poverty and dirt of the streets of India and also makes you feel emphatic with Saroo's character, so young and lost in such a big country. In the second part it has more light and it gives you this sense of hope about him finding his family.<br/><br/>The story is told in such a great way (except this moments i have mentioned) that in many parts it will bring tears to your eyes, specially in the final moments of the movie. It all is accompanied by a beautiful piano score by Dustin O'Halloran & Hauschka that will only help you to get more emotional.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie if you want to know about a warm and real story about a young boy from India and you want to see a movie that will get you emotional in many different moments."

This is a multifaceted story and one that gleams from each of the facets.<br/><br/>The setting is 1986 India in the Hindu region. Saroo (a sensationally fine Sunny Pawar) was a five-year-old child in India of a poor but happy rural family. On a trip with his brother Guddu (Abhishek Bharate), Saroo soon finds himself alone and trapped in a moving decommissioned passenger train that takes him to Calcutta, 1500 miles away from home. Totally lost in a strange urban environment and too young to identify either himself or his home to the authorities, Saroo struggles to survive as a street child until he is sent to an orphanage. Soon, Saroo is selected to be adopted by the Brierley family (Nicole Kidman and David Wenham) in Tasmania, where he grows up in a loving, prosperous home. Yet for all his comfort and good fortune, Saroo finds himself plagued by his memories of his lost family in his adulthood (as played by Dev Patel) and tries to search for them even as his guilt drives him to hide this quest from his adoptive parents and his girlfriend Lucy (Rooney Mara). Only when he has an epiphany and his use of IT revolutionary technology known as Google Earth does he realize not only the answers he needs, but also the steadfast love that he has always had with all his loved ones in both worlds.<br/><br/>The novel 'A Long Way Home' by Saroo Brierley was adapted for the screen by Luke Davies and directed with great sensitivity by Garth Davis.

","""Lion"" was an exceptionally well-performed film that tackled serious issues, yet failed to resolve them. It was nonetheless an earnest approach to a number of delicate topics.<br/><br/>The film was flawed in its failure to properly juggle two thematic strands: (1) the narrative of a separation of little boy from his family in Indian and his quest to search for his roots.<br/><br/>(2) the problems faced by the kind mother and father in Australia, who adopted a pair of foundling children.<br/><br/>It turned out that the first narrative completely overshadowed the second. The viewer feels so much empathy for the Australian mother and father, who clearly have struggled in raising the two adopted boys. Yet, we never actually see the child rearing and the home life except when the boys are adults.<br/><br/>In the bonus section of the DVD, there were several deleted scenes. Yet not even the deleted scenes presented the home life of the two young boys. One can only wildly guess at why Mantosh developed a drug addiction. And it was left completely vague whether or not Saroo longed to return to India while he was raised by his new family. The film presented his search for his family roots only as an afterthought when he was an adult working a hotel.<br/><br/>Without a doubt, the most sensitive performance of the film was that of Nicole Kidman as the Australian mother.

The strength and resilience of this five-year-old boy resounds with you as he faces hunger, loneliness, and danger in an area that speaks an entirely different language.

","Lion is a gripping tale of humanity often found missing in the whirlwind of androids and machines, Hollywood is so much fascinated with, these days. It is a poignant saga of an Indian boy lost at a tender age of 5.The film narrates the odyssey of that kid Saroo, through a grey world full of greed, lust, decaying values and finally redeeming himself in a world of light and hope. <br/><br/>Ever since the film released or it created so much buzz at the Oscars, (It did not get any though, even after getting 6 nominations!) I was craving for watching it. As the film was not shown in any of the screens near the place where I live, I had to wait for the DVDs to release. And whoa! It was worth waiting for such a gem of a movie. Broadly the movie is divided in two parts. Whilst the first part portrays kid Saroo's never ending struggle in the Indian allays, stations, slums and finally ending up being adopted by an Australian couple, the second half narrates the turmoil of the grown up Saroo to relive his lost childhood. The contrasts portrayed in the two halves mellifluously showcase the differences between the two worlds in the same planet - India and Australia, poverty and luxury, dirty lanes and posh suburbs, pain and love, hunger and abundance, loathe and affection. The gruesome experiences of little Saroo in the streets of India leave you petrified in horror. The reality of the pathos and agonies in an Indian's life has been shot with so much honesty that you are left awestruck at the genius of the director. The scene where the kid with a spoon mimics a young guy in the posh restaurant is there to stay in your heart forever. On the contrary, the scenes in Australia have been shot with extensive hues and colors to symbolize the aplomb in grown up Saroo's life. This was the first feature film directed by Garth Davis and what a splendid job he has done in his first outing! He is sensible and sensitive and the subject he picked for his debut movie is indeed a matter of Indian and International concern. The movie is based on the autobiographical book of Saroo Brierley- 'A Long Way Home', a literary gem in its own merit. But the panache with which Davis adopts this into a movie is simply fabulous. With him being the latest entrant, list of my favorite Hollywood directors is ever increasing.<br/><br/>Dev Patel as adult Saroo is brilliant to say the least. His expressions as someone who cannot get over his past even amidst abundance and a secured life are fabulous. The climax scene where he celebrates with his real mother even without understanding her language epitomizes his brilliance in essaying human emotions with élan. With a successful track record already, this young actor has a very bright future ahead. Nicole Kidmanhas done a fantastic job as the kind hearted Sue. She had a quiet spell in the last decade or so. But a riveting performance in 'Lion' catapults her once again in the forefront. Both Nicole and Patel deservedly earned Oscar nominations in supporting casts, albeit without winning. But the show stealer in this magnum opus is definitely Sunny Powar. It would not be an overstatement to say that this little kid has delivered one of the finest performances ever by any actor of his age group in a long, long time. The ease with which he essays the pangs of little Saroo, the poignancy of a child dwelling in an Indian orphanage is mesmerizing. You are bound to love the innocence this kid has in his eyes. If nurtured rightly, he has the potentials of becoming a super talent soon. All other actors do justice to their roles while you long for a little longer screen time of our very own Nawazuddin Siddiqui.<br/><br/>The plight of the children in the orphanages in India is a subject hardly any activists have taken up. It is said every year 80,000 children are lost from India alone. No garbed 'Rakshak' bothers to care for them. Kudos to this foreign director for handling this sensitive subject with utmost sincerity and empathy. When Kidman says' We did not take any child because we thought the world is full of orphans who need care', you feel the honesty of the intention of the director. When the movie ends with actual footage of Saroo, I bet you can hardly keep your eyes dry. This is a wonderful cinematic experience you should not miss as the effects of the theme will stir your heart for long. In every street child in India, there lives a Saroo. This movie just opens up our eyes to see them, perceive their grief and care about them.<br/><br/>P.S:Throughout the movie, I was wondering why this is titled 'Lion'. The reason is shown in the end title."

","I am writing this review as an Australian Indian who moved to Australia in 1989. Unlike Saroo's experience I moved to Australia for education and work and later called Australia my home. To me Australians are great souls which Brierly family rightfully signifies and are excellent living examples.<br/><br/>The film is very hard hitting showing us the true meaning of love and care. I love the scene in the beginning where Saroo is surrounded by butterflies that shows us the innocence is surrounded by and protected at the same time by love of God. There is no secret or spoiler to this film as its based on true story, therefore all I'll say is that the Writers and Director have done an excellent job, and to add to it we see some brilliant acting especially by Nicole Kidman.<br/><br/>Please take a box of tissues with you when watching LION because you're sure to cry from start to end.<br/><br/>You know there is GOD when you see this film.<br/><br/>God bless ALL LOST SOULS."

","Saw this movie few days ago, and I am so glad that I've watched this movie, This movie is an emotional punch. A real story of Saroo brierley told through the eyes and brilliance of Garth Davis and Luke Davis. First half was very captivating, wherein first 20 min's of second half was little gloomy & but final 15 min's brings you right back. Acting was top notch all actors did justify their respective roll's perfectly (A special mention to Sunny pawar and Abhishek Bharate). In my perspective as a complete layman in professional acting I should say little Sunny made it easy for Dev Patel in the second half (Yes, I know movies are not shot in final view-able sequence & Dev patel did a great job too),I should commend the entire cast and crew for their work. Background score & Cinematography were excellent. I should say as an Indian national the reality of life in India was portrayed with 100% perfection. Overall its a must watch movie & be prepared for an emotional roller coaster!"

","This movie is amazing. I could not find a right words to come about for this movie. It's one of the best movies that i have seen after a long long time. Musical score, Cinematography, Screenplay, Direction, Acting and most importantly the story telling, all come together so beautifully and the representations of the characters and the country through cinematography and direction is just impeccable. I have watched it 30 times (approximately) and yet sobbed each times, and still not tired of this movie. This movie exerts so many feelings and embraces that warmth of motherly essence and family values which i think everyone can relate to. Hope is one of the key points that i extracted from this movie. It also talks about that subject which is practiced but not often talked about such as adoption and also explores beautifully the life and struggle of street kids in India which was very touching and brings all the audience of this movie into a firm ground and takes you along with the movie so beautifully. Acting credits to Dev Patel, Nicole Kidman and most importantly Sunny Pawar. Sunny Pawar is brilliant in this movie. As an audience i was so drawn to his performance. I bought whatever he was trying to convey through this movie that it was brilliant. Even the fact that he was only 6 years old when shooting this film is beyond my imagination. <br/><br/>Therefore, i am looking forward to see what Sunny Pawar's next movie called Love Sonia (2017), so finger cross. And also i am looking forward to Garth Davis's and Luke Davis's next venture."

","A little Indian boy (Sunny Pawar) gets separated from his family and ends up far away from home, living on the streets and in orphanage, until he's adopted by a nice couple who take him to Australia. <br/><br/>Also starring: Dev Patel as boy as an adult, Nicole Kidman and David Wenham as his new parents, Rooney Mara, Diwian Ladwa. <br/><br/>Based on a true story which was turned into book, written by the boy himself, and now a movie.<br/><br/>I liked ""Lion"" a lot, for the most part it's gripping and packs a strong emotional punch. But the two-hour story as a whole is uneven, losing steam during its last quarter and – even worse – starting manipulating with the audience in unconvincing way.<br/><br/>This big shift doesn't kill the movie but the whole experience would win if adult Saroo's journey was compressed into shorter period of time. As it is, the last quarter is not quite compatible with the previous hour and a half and ends up killing the mood that has been masterfully built up and maintained almost from the start. <br/><br/>The adult cast offers impressive performances during that last quarter which is totally worth the awards recognition it has garnered. I am especially glad to see Nicole Kidman and Rooney Mara getting strong, well-written female characters and thus turning in more interesting work as usual for them.<br/><br/>But the movie makers could have easily shortened the adult Saroo's detective work part which really bogs the story down and seems to be more of an excuse to show Patel hanging around aimlessly. <br/><br/>He'd still have enough screen time for all those stronger acting scenes with the girlfriend and family, or just showing off his fab new looks. Watch out, girls and manlovers, he's turned into quite a heartbreaker indeed, wild hair and strong body, and all...<br/><br/>""The mood that has been masterfully built up and maintained almost from the start"", as mentioned above, is the main reason why ""Lion"" turns out to be such a moving journey. <br/><br/>The director uses as little dialogue and talking as possible, concentrating on just showing this lost little boy wandering around – sometimes enhancing the events with not too intrusive music. <br/><br/>The environment becomes a character of its own – alien, dirty, sometimes hostile. Watching this little guy just trying to get by, without trying to make him act"", or remind us to feel something, gives the story a lot of poetic power and unexpected dimension of depth. <br/><br/>Sadly they are unable to repeat or resuscitate this feeling later on, although Patel gives an strong performance of his own, as stated above.<br/><br/>Interestingly, 2008's ""Slumdog Millionaire"" – Dev Patel's breakthrough hit which also shows the shadow side of India and its children's' lives – is also a movie of two halves, the first of which excites a lot and the second kind of kills the buzz. <br/><br/>So, it's a great movie for the first three quarters and just okay after that.<br/><br/>""Lion"" is one of the frontrunners during this award season, with 60 nominations and 32 wins already under the belt. It's nominated for 6 Oscars: movie, adapted screenplay, supporting actor (Patel) and actress (Kidman), cinematography and music. Was also nominated for four Golden Globes but did not win any."

","What happens to your life when God pushes you back to the darkest corner of the wall?<br/><br/>What happens when you are lost, helpless, broken and don't have any idea about when the situation will change, or even the faintest assurance that the things will at all change.<br/><br/>What happens when you know that the people you love the most, your family, is going through the same amount of pain as you, and you can do nothing about it, absolutely nothing. For twenty-five years.<br/><br/>Life then becomes an unending pain. A vacuum of existing in the present and living in the past. And ultimately an elongated search, for the real self within.<br/><br/>It is this desperateness, Lion, the movie, will pull you all into.<br/><br/>The story of Saroo Brierley. A tale of immense human courage, of how a little boy faced unimaginable difficulties and survived through,with admirable poise and a mature calmness way beyond his years.<br/><br/>Little Sunny Pawar aka Saroo, rules your heart from Shot one. You smile,when he beams back love at his proud protective elder brother. You laugh at his little mischiefs,when he is able to behave like a child in the few truly happy moments of his life. You are then on the edges of your seat when he's about to fall into traps, and you sigh with relief when he assures us, time and again, that he's smart enough, to manage on his own,without anyone's help.Thank you very much.<br/><br/>Your heart goes out to him when he keeps searching for his brother and mother in a strange crowd. He matter-of-factly states to all that he needs to see his mother. But when he understands,that it is no more possible, he accepts, with an admirable composure and moves on.Perhaps it was for this attitude, that even God stopped testing the little boy and gave him what he deserved at last. Love.<br/><br/>It is difficult to hold the attention of the audience when the story is known to all. But the adept direction of Garth Davis hooks you from the word Go.<br/><br/>What is more amazing here that since we know that the characters are all true and somehow it is that realization which makes us go through a plethora of emotions. We gasp with shock at the unexpectedness of how real people turn out to be, in this cruel, blood-sucking world. So much so that you start suspecting even that second glance from a stranger, be it a friendly man or a motherly woman. Because you know, that everybody out here is at a war of their own, struggling and fighting, to exist, and if lucky, rise above. Be it at the mine site breaking stones, or stealing coals and risking your life for a packet full of milk for your little brother. Be it a child trafficker selling her body and soul to a pimp or a policeman who supplies helpless children to powerful men. Everyone is fighting their invisible wars and hoping to win.<br/><br/>But the ultimate war here is the war within.Brilliant actors Dev Patel and Nicole Kidman portraying the tussles inside with such grandeur that I hear quite a many sniffs in the audience throughout the screening. Our favorite Deepti Naval, in a little cameo, shines in a silent moment of just expressions, when Saroo for the last time, asks for his mother.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie rests on the little shoulders of Sunny Pawar, who comes across as a real discovery.I sincerely wish to see more of him, not just as a child actor, but as a strong 'character'. Because he certainly has, the ability.<br/><br/>The Cinematography by Greig Fraser is sheer painting. Right from the first dissolves, of the scenic Australia to the powdery plains of Khandwa, the deeply emotional story of Lion has a very passionate camera following it throughout. Thank God for that. A tumultuous train journey captured with brilliant use of camera and picture perfect frames using just natural lights need special mentions.<br/><br/>Outstanding editing work by Alexandre de Franceschi, bring alive the childhood of Saroo when he finally meets his mother after twenty five years of separation. And as happens always in our real 'worldly' life, nothing did remain the same ,other than a mother's love and a few cherished memories.<br/><br/>Go and watch Lion, if you haven't already. You will learn a thing or two about the rules of life. The turmoils and tests we all must go through, to survive with our heads held high. The 'hearty' use of our intelligent minds, which is needed for all, to make quick decisions and escape pitfalls.And the grace we all must show, at all times, before accepting,that whatever happens, always does happen, for only the best."

"yuvarajvima","9","0","2","12 March 2017"," Gut wrenching story of separation & re-union
","Lion was famously & deservedly nominated for Best Picture at the Academy and numerous other story, screenplay, direction and performance awards. But all these, and especially Oscar nominations raise a big question – Is this going to be another one of those dreary art films where you walk out depressed wishing you never watched it, yet feel the need to appreciate it for being an Oscar nominated movie? No. Lion is not only beautifully shot, it has authenticity, drama, mystery and romance which make it a wholesome entertainer.<br/><br/>Lion tells the heart wrenching tale of a lost child from India and the extremely real horrors faced by orphan and homeless children like starvation and trafficking which scar them for life. Today, searching for something or someone is almost so easy that we have too many options or privacy concerns. The film also makes you think how today we take several privileges like food, shelter, safety & technology for granted while there are billions of starving children and families living on less than $1/day. It is unbelievable that there are extraordinary families like Sue & John Brierley; true heroes who decided to adopt two children from India and give them a fighting chance in the world. A true story of separation, imperfection, family, love and closure - that needed to be told.<br/><br/>Sunny Pawar perfectly portrays innocence and despair of 'Saroo', and manages to look cute despite the homeless kid makeup. Nicole Kidman & Rooney Mara deliver poignant supporting roles, while Nawazuddin Siddiqui makes a surprising, eerie guest appearance onto international cinema. Dev Patel shows tremendous growth as an actor and expertly portrays the guilt and the yearning of a mature 'Saroo' who longs to find his roots and re-unite with his family. From a script standpoint, I would have liked a less dramatic; more realistic transition from Saroo's normal life overseas to his search to find closure. Technically, the film shows almost flawless direction and editing. Definitely watch the movie and find out why it's called 'LION'."
"genesisoriana","8","0","1","11 March 2017"," Roots, family, identity.
","The beginning of the film is outstanding. The film's emotions make it a really powerful piece. In order to make a proper review to this movie, I have to divide it in two. The first part: It leaves you completely captivated. It's brilliant the way dialogues weren't completely necessary, and when they appeared, they did it in the precise time. Very different from the second part, that appeared of a sudden, in this section the dialogues seemed even forced sometimes. This section is colder. Sadly, the movie loses a lot of strength in the middle, but in the last scenes, the strength and the emotive are back.<br/><br/>The film as a whole contains a lot of remarkable aspects, such as the touching performances, especially the ones by Dev Patel and Nicole Kidman, -which basically saved the second part of the movie from being too soulless and weak compared to the first one- also the beautiful photography and the remarkable soundtrack. It's impossible not to cry with this movie. If you're lucky, it'll touch you deeply the way it did with me. Definitely, it deserved more recognition in the Oscars than La La Land."

","I had only heard about Lion being nominated for Oscars and it made me curious to see the plot of the movie.<br/><br/>I believe one should really not read anything from the movie beforehand and enjoy it till the last scene making the story and climax exciting.<br/><br/>Well, the epitome of the story is that it is a real one. The movie is divided in two parts: Part I - Saroo, A 5 year old kid living with his mom, a laborer who earns livelihood by picking and sorting stones on construction sites and his elder brother. Saroo is lost in a small village in India and then he finds himself a ton miles away in Calcutta and remembers just the name of his place where he dwelled. He spends few days on the road before going to the police station when a gentleman notices that he is lost and takes him there.<br/><br/>Part II - A Tasmanian couple adopts Saroo and another Indian kid and they live together. After 25 years, Saroo is set out on a mission to find his real family in his hometown in India.He flies to India and finds him mom alive and living in the same vicinity. His elder brother is found out to be killed by the train at the same night when Saroo was lost.<br/><br/>This movie has powerful emotions to connect with the audience. The performances by Sunny Pawar, Dev Patel and Nicole Kidman is exceptional. <br/><br/>""Like Saroo, there are thousands of kids who are lost in India every single day. Some are forced into prostitution, while some are forced to beg. It is a real pity that kids in the age of playing and studying, have to undergo this pain and cruelty. Lion made me remember Slumdog Millionaire where kids are tortured and forced into begging business and other stuff. All this is real in India and is heart wrenching."

","I absolutely loved this film.<br/><br/>If the story was not true and amazing per se, this film would still be good. But the fact that this is a real person's story really blows my mind. The story made me reflect on the longing we all have for knowing who we are and where our roots are, and also about how we have to integrate the harsh parts of our past into our lives to have healthy adult lives. This story is so moving and so wonderful, that I don't think is possible to hate it.<br/><br/>I loved all the actors in the film, some of whom I don't usually like it. I loved Patel's heart-felt performance and he really deserves all the accolades and the Bafta he won; and let me tell you, he is finally playing a man, and really he looks so hot in this film :). Nicole Kidman provides us with a honest mature believable performance; I wouldn't say deserving of an Oscar nomination, but very good nevertheless. Pawar, the child who plays young Suru, is truly amazing; such an small kiddo, and so mature in his acting. Rooney Marah and the other actors were correct in their respective performances as well.<br/><br/>This being a real story, I was really pleased to have real footage of the real people behind the story, and some details of what happened to them.<br/><br/>The main downside to me is that we get no background story about what happens to Saru's family after he disappears. We are not presented with their despair, heart-break and the actions they took to try to find Saru; of course, we can imagine that, but a bit of details on that front would have rounded up the story and the film.<br/><br/>Lion really did it for me."

","Lion stars Dev Patel and Sunny Pawar and tells the emotional and miraculous true story of 'Saroo' an Indian child who finds his way back home after 25 years of being separated from his family and adopted by an Australian family. The performance from the child actor Sunny Pawar was really great, his emotions and deliveries were all on point, His performance was heartfelt and heartbreaking, his fear and sense of isolation were done very well in the scenes where he first separates from his family, how he was depicted walking through the crowds, the sheer size comparison alone pacts such a strong effect. <br/><br/>I really liked this movie because of how it was able to deliver an emotional and powerful story, the emotions from the child's point of view and also in the later act with Dev Patel depicting a victim of trauma and the feeling of lost and the idea of searching for self purpose and his own roots were great. The excruciating process of trying to grasp that thread of memory digging through a dark pool of nothingness. Also the guilt that he feels for not having contacted his family all well explored and acted out. <br/><br/>The film also does a great job exploring India's poverty, the scene depicting a child snatching group was not only informing but relevant and impactful. Delivering an overall message of the amount of children that are lost in India each year at the end of the film, presumably falling into the hands of such criminal groups. This isn't necessarily a very commercially viable movie, but it is as mentioned very important and explores the darker corners of the world and human nature."

","Lion was one of my favorite movies of the year. It made me want to travel, cry, write, and live. Dev Patel carries an incredibly vibrant performance of the true story of Saroo Brierley, who was lost as a child and then attempts to find his family in his 20's. Pair that with grand sweeping landscapes and the incredibly endearing Sunny Pawar, who shines despite the grit of 1980's slums of India, and it had everything I could have wanted in a hauntingly true film. This movie stuck with me days after leaving the theater and only deepened the lifelong crush I have been harboring on Dev Patel (which started in Slumdog and escalated in The Newsroom). I am in general pretty lukewarm on Nicole Kidman, but this is her at her best, and her maternal interactions seemed authentic without being romanticized. All in all, this was near perfect to me, and somehow managed to avoid landmine clichés that could have cheapened this standout of 2016. 9.7/10"

","Lion is quite possibly the most tear-jerking film I've ever seen in my life; thank you Garth Davis. And I've seen Schindler's List, Pan's Labyrinth and One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest. Lion is the story of lost Indian-boy Saroo Brierley: and his long-gestating journey to find his family, from whom he was accidentally separated from in 1986. The story and journey from then to the present actually has some surprising twists and turns; and one of them was subversively shocking and disturbing (involving a character's paedophilic subtext). This is a family film that explores a deeper emotional spectrum than most family pics.<br/><br/>Lion is one of 2016's finest offerings in cinema. I know that some critics and audience- based reviews cited issues with the pacing, but I believe that it was completely intentional on behalf of director Garth Davis. It's an emotional journey that needs some lenient pacing for the sake of the audience's emotional responses. Davis directs his actors with real flare and there's hardly a pointless moment ever caught on camera. Every moment is important to Saroo's struggle and the film's overall philanthropic message: help children less fortunate than us to reunite with their lost families. It's a powerful story, theme and message we can all identify with; and are more than willing to help.<br/><br/>Lion is truly moving, and could be the first of many like-minded philanthropic films countering and solving childhood problems. Please see this film and spread the word."

He's locked in for a few days, in a totally empty train wagon. How does he survive? One day he arrives at Calcutta, a city with 15 million people. They speak another language, Bengali and he speaks Hindi. He is five years old, all alone in a big city, not being able to communicate with a majority of the residents, far away from home. How will he manage there? How will he find food, who can he trust? Can he get help to get back home? The audience is taken on a little boy's journey and we get to see how he handles life, all alone. He is a smart little resourceful boy and he manages in this dangerous place. Many dangers lure around the corners and we are kept on the edge, since we do not know if good or bad will come from every experience. There are bad people in this film, as well as good people. The name of a person that handles adoptions and investigations is very much like a real person that I know. First I thought it could be her, but I didn't know. I later on got confirmation the character portrayd was her. My world shrunk. The story is based on a true story, a real boy's adoption history and his search for his biological family. Every year children in India go missing. Some are abducted, other's perhaps have been in accidents, others have wondered away, just like this boy. There are many stories out there, this is just one of them. The movie really shows us the life in Calcutta and India. It has a real feel to it and the people are believable. The main character, played by Dev Patel, does it with good acting. I think he surely makes the audience feel the agony and the despair of this persons faith. The movie seems to have caught the feeling of agony, despair, as well as hope and love. So will he find his birth place, or is he forever lost? For that you have to go on a journey with tears, joy, exploration and new experiences. To know, you have to go on a journey with this boy and see yet another interesting journey and faith of a person. The movie really keeps you in the characters feelings, you feel all up and downs and so on. Perhaps you might even learn a thing or two. This movie is a good entertaining drama."

"taryllsbaker","10","0","2","2 March 2017"," Emotional, gritty and real. Lion is a must-see.
","Lion is directed by Garth Davis, starring; Dev Patel, Rooney Mara, Nicole Kidman, David Wenham and introducing Sunny Pawar.<br/><br/>A five-year old Indian boy gets lost on the streets of Calcutta, thousands of kilometres from home. He survives many challenges before being adopted by a couple in Australia; 25 years later, he sets out to find his lost family.<br/><br/>It's rare in film to encounter a first act so thoroughly emotional, gritty and real. In Lion, director Garth Davis introduces us to Sunny Pawar, who at only eight-years old gives one of the most genuine, touching performances I've seen from any young actor. The first 50 minutes are mostly silent, similar to the opening act of Pixar's WALLE, in which very little dialogue is used. During this time, Pawar is acting through raw expression as he stumbles around the unforgiving streets of Calcutta, laying down a vital background before cutting to a grown Saroo, 25 years on.<br/><br/>The cinematography in this film is simply stunning, capturing India and Australia with a smart eye for composition, complete with a grade that only slightly brushes the screen with a finishing gloss. Each and every shot is dark in tone, especially in the first act, and documents the poverty situation without holding back, making the picture feel that bit more realistic.<br/><br/>This is a work based on an incredible true story, and it's definitely one of the most heartfelt tales to ever hit the big screen. During the final act, though inevitable, the execution is thorough enough to make us shed a few tears. The real success here is the telling of Saroo's unexpected journey, miles from home. Once Dev Patel's grown Saroo appears, the impact gets lost somewhere in the background, though in the final act it's rekindled with spirit and we are pulled through many emotions until the picture fades to black. <br/><br/>Original music by Dustin O'Halloran & Volker Bertelmann is warm in colour, with a ravishing piano lead that drives the emotional bind between score and imagery. Lush string arrangements are present, but only serve as an underlying texture for the prominent use of piano. The music also stands on its own as a delightful listening experience.<br/><br/>This is a must-see. Whether it's at the cinema or during its home release, make it your priority to see this lovely film.<br/><br/>Verdict; Garth Davis' Lion is a work of art, featuring a powerful first act that captures fear, wonder and sadness all encased inside one wonderfully raw performance from Sunny Pawar.<br/><br/>Lion, 10/10."

","The young Saroo character played by Sunny Pawar is a natural and the highlight by far. The first half of this film is the best half, featuring this young boy lost and surviving on the streets.<br/><br/>The second half when he is grown up is merely anticipating the inevitable, waiting patiently for what we know or expect will happen - for the questions to be answered and the search to end.<br/><br/>The poster for this movie is poorly designed. For some reason it focuses on the relationship with the girlfriend, which is not important to the story at all. Whoever designed and approved the poster attempted to invent significance where there wasn't any. It gives the impression of a love story, which it isn't.<br/><br/>Photography is solid. Music is a bit tedious and repetitive with endless piano scales up and down. The second half tends to suffer from lack of punch. It merely delays the inevitable. The scene where Nicole Kidman unloads her emotions about everything is tedious. We don't need to know all that, it's not that interesting or relevant.<br/><br/>Good story, shot well and good performances. Incredible that it happened.

","I saw the ""60 Minutes"" segment about the true story behind this movie and was thinking I would skip it for that reason, but given the good ratings it has gotten, I decided to give it a shot. I found the dramatization got me much more emotionally involved than the documentary.<br/><br/>This story of Saroo Brierly is presented in two parts, separated by 25 years. As the young Saroo, age five, the movie is immeasurably helped by the outstanding performance by the endearing Sunny Pawar. The risk of having a first time young actor carry half of a major movie paid off. It seems that the quality of child actors and young actors has improved impressively in recent years. I am thinking of the three kids in ""The Tree of Life,"" for example.<br/><br/>The older Saroo is played by Dev Patel, who was nominated for an Oscar for actor in a supporting role. Nicole Kidman was nominated for best actress in a supporting role for her portrayal of Saroo's foster mother in Australia. The movie itself got a total of six Oscar nominations, so it comes with credentials.<br/><br/>This is somewhat of a travelogue with scenes being filmed in various places in India, West Bengal, and Australia (particularly Tasmania). The artful cinematography of Greig Fraser (also an Oscar nominee) adds much to the impact of the movie.<br/><br/>I think anyone who had a happy childhood and moved away from where he or she grew up always has nostalgia for the place of their beginning. With maturity also comes the desire to know one's ancestors, to know where you came from. Those two themes infuse this story to the extent that most audiences should be able to establish a strong emotional identification with Saroo.<br/><br/>Be sure to stay to the end where footage of the real life people is shown."

","It's important to remember there are orphans in mainstream cinema who aren't whiny superheroes. Indeed, as Lion's sobering closing title card reminds us, over 80,000(!) children go missing in India alone every year - a staggering figure that makes the story of one who found his way home to his family all the more incredible. Saroo Brierly's story is too irresistibly moving to ever dismiss; however, it's unfortunate that its cinematic telling stumbles in properly doing it justice. Despite many promising attributes, Lion falls prey to a glut of unwarranted Oscar bait clichés, making the 'so-incredible-it-feels-like-a-movie' tale feel disappointingly artificial when told in feature film form.<br/><br/>Lion will invariably suffer from a spate of Slumdog Millionaire comparisons, which aren't as reductionist as you'd expect. Nonetheless, debut director Garth Davis could have taken notes in how to convey heavy content with the pizazz and massive heart of his film's begrudging predecessor, as his film plays as too overlong, stagey, and glum to properly stand out by comparison. Still, Luke Davies' otherwise clumsy screenplay makes one bold choice that pays off: unfolding Saroo's 'there and back again' linearly, rather than disrupted by traditional, hackneyed Hollywood flashbacks. This two-act structure forces us to empathize with the sheer enormity - emotional and geographic - of his journey, building up to a climactic emotional payoff that feels exhaustively earned. <br/><br/>The first half, a near-silent parable of a young Saroo, disoriented, wandering across India, and besieged by countless unscrupulous, predatory individuals, grimly sketches the film's social consciousness and horrific climate of missing/abducted children. Poignantly severe as it is, the segment's length, aimless editing, and wordless lugubriousness still toe the line of being an episodic downer parade. Thankfully, Davis cleverly takes the Life is Beautiful route, filtering the looming evils through the cheerful shambling of its child protagonist. It works, as luminous newcomer Sunny Pawar, bursting with a quirky, Charlie Chaplin charisma, carries the first act masterfully, captivating with his wary but unquenchably chipper perseverance every step of the way. <br/><br/>The film's second half, housing the bulk of the narrative, is more of a slog. Initially, Davis ably conveys the brittle social dynamics of Saroo's adoption process, including the unforeseen pain of an adopted brother struggling to integrate and prone to fits of self-harm. Similarly, Saroo's subsequent disinterested 'third culture kid' identity (""you still like cricket?"" ""Yeah, but I cheer for the Aussies, mate"") feels commendably real. Disappointingly, the script's set up for Saroo's central conflict is far from as finely honed. The tricky thing about PTSD is that, distressingly real as it is, it's hard to depict cinematically without it reading as wholly disingenuous, and Davis flounders somewhat to dredge up the urgency and emotional resonance in Saroo's triggered fixation with his past. Instead, we get pockets of cumbersome, frustratingly Oscar-baiting dialogue that brandish the film's themes with the subtlety of a cricket bat upside the head, including multiple superfluous exposition-fights with Saroo's girlfriend (Rooney Mara; capable but somewhat glassy-eyed in an underwritten support/indignation sounding board archetype). Increasingly, this second act involves watching an increasingly sulky and hairy Dev Patel loom over a laptop (and the fawning introduction of Google Earth - ""have you heard about this fantastic new program?"" is about as instantly dated as Chef's love letter to Twitter in 2014) - or worse: one of those splashy CSI-style map-pin-boards that seem to only exist in Hollywood detective fantasies. <br/><br/>Davis does his best to counteract the stagnation with Google Earth footage turning into sweeping, gorgeous panoramic shots of beautifully lush Tasmania, and the arid, frustratingly elusive Indian countryside. Where Lion really excels beyond its central performances is in its ability to astutely capture a location's sensory details, with snippets of birdsong, local music, background banter, and cameras prowling as relentlessly as the titular predator lapping up the sights, sounds, and even smells of its two locales. This attention to detail is appropriate - after all, it's a sugary dessert that triggers Saroo's first childhood PTSD flashback - but it lends a welcome degree of authenticity and immediacy to a film otherwise scrambling to conjure such qualities. <br/><br/>None of this is not to disparage Patel's excellent performance, as his furious, manic compulsion to reconcile the two halves of his life is commanding and fiercely believable, and the perfect counterbalance to the jauntier Pawar as his younger self. It's more a shame that the film's script and direction can't meet him at his level of intensity, as he's hauntingly human enough that we want to ache for Saroo's hardship, only to snapped out of Patel's magnetism by the frequent contrivance of the words that tumble out of his mouth. This is a fate that Nicole Kidman and David Wenham, as Saroo's adoptive parents, also struggle valiantly to combat through their honest and warm performances. Davies is mostly careful to position them gracefully and carefully, eschewing white saviour overtones by concentrating on their tentative but teeming love for their new family, and leaving Kidman only a single teary Oscar-flirting monologue. Their scenes are still a touch rosy-tinted, but the cabal of talent between them help make their thoroughly scripted exchanges play as raw and natural. <br/><br/>Slow, disordered, and frustratingly cliché-peppered as it may be, Lion still serves as an emotional venus flytrap, pouncing with a (somewhat rushed) finale sure to leave even the most scornful skeptics misty-eyed - even its title drop is an rousing slam dunk. Nonetheless, the film's most moving moment is its closing credits' documentary footage of its real life personages interacting - tearful, gauche, but devastatingly authentic. Often, fictional filmmaking is championed for evoking a true story's inherent emotions more vividly than talking head anecdotal recreations. Lion, despite its promising attributes and visceral leading performances, is a strong testament to the contrary: sometimes such remarkable stories are better avoided by major studios, and told by those involved.<br/><br/>-7/10"

Three months later, Saroo is introduced to Mrs. Sood, who tells him she has placed an advertisement about him in several local newspapers, but no one has responded. She then tells him that an Australian couple is interested in adopting him. She begins to teach Saroo English and he moves to Hobart, Tasmania in 1987, under the care of Sue and John Brierley, where he slowly starts to settle in.

The plot covers his difficult time in the city and the many challenges he survives before being adopted by a couple in Australia and, after growing up, sets out to find his lost family.<br/><br/>Directed by Garth Davis in his feature film debut, Lion allots its first hour to a newcomer, covering the little kid's struggle in the unknown city with honesty & patience, and paves a solid platform for the remaining hour.

This is it now i cannot explain more i will start to cry again so deep story-line. <br/><br/>10/10 From me<br/><br/>CAUTION U CANNOT STOP THINKING ABOUT THIS MOVIE AFTER WATCHING"

","After hearing everything from, ""don't watch this movie it's too depressing, it'll ruin your day"" to ""I cried all the way through it, what a great movie!"" I was thoroughly confused about what to expect with this one. I hadn't seen a trailer and other than the few comments from friends I had nothing else to go on. Let's just say I'm glad I went to see it! <br/><br/>The film is a touching story of a lost boy, his adoption and his journey through the first half of his life. Played by child actor Sunny Pawar and Dev Patel this portrayal of a true story was impeccable. The direction, cinematography, locations, costumes and music were spot on. At times I felt like I was actually there, with little Saroo lost on the train tracks searching for home on a journey through India, in locations very similar to what I would call home too.<br/><br/>Like I said, I loved how real the story felt. Growing up in the 80's - the styles, furniture, hair, clothing and the ""there's this new thing called Google Earth!"" moment felt incredibly nostalgic and relatable. I could easily relate to little Saroo as I would have been roughly the same age and we spent a lot of time on local Indian transport in those days! As a child of immigrants, I could feel Saroo's confusion and the internal battle of growing up different in an alien world.<br/><br/>My only gripe with the movie was the poorly fleshed out love story section, but this is understandable given 1hr 58mins had to squeeze in a story spanning 25 or so years. The initiation of the Rooney Mara's character felt cheesy and more typical of an embarrassing low budget 80's Bollywood movie. Saroo actually gives Lucy ""the look"" - reminded me of Chunky LaFunga from Goodness Gracious Me!! I believe there were literally two scenes where one minute they were in bed and the next they were breaking up in the street with the cliché ""you deserve better than me"" line and then somehow they were semi-clothed and semi-friends and in bed again - huh? The timeline at this point felt confusing and immersion breaking and left me feeling jaded. It could easily have been left out as Lucy didn't have any real impact on Saroo's life, past the point of planting the seed to hunt for his parents. I think they should have portrayed her as just a concerned friend without the need to elevate her to girlfriend status and abandoned her character at the ""friends chilling"" scene.<br/><br/>The remaining cast were as spectacular as their peers. Nicole Kidman's portrayal of the adoptive mother was as powerful, realistic and as touching as Priyanka Bose's portrayal of Kamla and Divian Ladwa played the disturbed adoptive brother wonderfully! <br/><br/>This movie wasn't just the typical ""boy on a journey to find his past"" Hollywood-style B-movie that I'm so bored to death of watching and it had none of the pompous and over-exaggerations we're also so fed up of from Hollywood-style movies. This movie was an exploration of the challenges of adoption not only from the child's perspective but the adoptive parents' too.<br/><br/>Not only did they manage to explore Saroo's story but also touch beautifully on the difficulties some children experience with adoption. Here the story became gritty, the raw emotion and isolation was tangible as we know this is an experience shared by many adopted children. Other themes explored included estrangement from ones lands (which is apt considering it's an Australian movie) and the internal identity crisis of immigrants, whilst highlighting issues of Indian corruption, failure of government systems, the railway children, language barriers and interracial relationships.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a layered and deep movie, definitely one to watch multiple times. Finally, watch the movie if only to answer the question, ""how did they get the title for this movie?"""
"lucashattersley","10","0","1","16 February 2017"," A masterpiece that will bring a tear to your eye
","When I chose to watch Lion at the cinema I didn't really know what to expect. I certainly didn't expect to be walking out of the cinema fighting back tears and checking my phone to see when the next available showing would be. Sunny Pawar who plays Saroo was given a humongous task of carrying the first half of this film, but he did it so well and deserves way more recognition for his role than he is getting. He is such a talented young actor with a bright future. Dev Patel carries the second half of the film as an older Saroo, alongside the wonderful Nicole Kidman, Rooney Mara and David Wenham. The true story is gripping from start to finish and has a few plot twists along the way. I loved that the film was split into two halves and we were able to see this story unfold in such detail. I'll definitely be going back to watch for a third time! 10/10"
"rdpublic","9","0","1","16 February 2017"," A gripping visual and visceral ride with its heart in the right place!
","What could I say? I was utterly blown away by how good this movie was.<br/><br/>From the opening scene, the score and cinematography was just outstanding, bringing us into Khandwa with the characters. The young actor Sunny Pawar did a phenomenal job by doing a realistic portrayal of the character. The editing in the movie is a little too fast for my taste but I soon got used to it, although I did think several shots in the movie could've been cut. But this director definitely had a firm hand on the screenplay. I was never bored for a second as the movie was so gripping. The sound design throughout the film, editing, mixing, whatever it is so immersive and fully utilizes the soundscape, including moments of silence and moments of much music.<br/><br/>Where the movie does dwindle is in the second half of the film, which is still really good and better than most movies, but it was a notch down as it couldn't really find a focus for some time. There isn't much conflict happening that we could care about as deeply as what happened in the 1st half. We just want this man get home to his place. But once that starts, it gets gripping again. But the way he finds it on his laptop when he has finally given up felt quite cliché. The Mentosh character wasn't developed enough for us to know what exactly is going on, which might be enough but introducing such an integral character to the main character's life and leaving him just like that feels unfinished. The movie was slows down, getting a little underwhelming.<br/><br/>But the last scenes become a saving grace, making us both cry and feel happy at the same time. The acting of Dev Patel and Nicole Kidman are fantastic. Nicole Kidman is so subtle in her portrayal and I just her as the character. That's true acting. Dev Patel really portrays the shitty feeling that people feel when there's a longing and never- ending grief in them. This is a long way from Slumdog Millionaire, where he was more of a kid. But in this film, he's intense. His eyes say a lot. When he's angry in the dinner table scene, you truly feel that intensity, because it's done so realistically.<br/><br/>Rooney Mara might not have much of a role but for what she was given, she did absolutely brilliantly, which isn't surprising as to how great of an actress she is as seen in Social Network, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo 2011. The dream sequences that appear towards the second half don't feel forced as it's the visual incarnation of Saroo's longing for his real family.<br/><br/>Some may argue the movie portrays India in a negative light but this movie shows a poor village boy from Khandwa getting lost in a city, in the 1980s, and not even knowing the language. I don't know how else this would turn out. Plus it's based on a true story so whether you like it or not, it happened.<br/><br/>Moreover, this movie doesn't go to cheap tricks to make us feel sad. It develops the characters before we have to feel something for them. It does things visually more than through dialogue, especially in the first half. You could turn off the sound and subtitles and still understand the film. That's visual storytelling, which is what films are meant to be. Or else we could just be watching plays, or radio dramas, or even read a novel, with the same or better effect. Now here is someone who understands the medium of film and makes the best use of it, although maybe there's too many cuts and shots, reliance on score, which could all just get better with age. So I have high hopes for this director.<br/><br/>This won't win Best Picture but damn is it a good film. I didn't think a movie could be as close to the visual poetry and masterpiece of a film like Moonlight in 2016 but I was wrong. This might be just as good as that.<br/><br/>Personally, I was on the verge of tears for most of the movie, after he gets on the train. And whenever that theme song, which is similar to Moonlight Sonata but still super effective, just makes me want to cry. The cinema hall was rather empty for such a good film. I think more people should go out to see this. If you don't like dramas that much, you probably won't like this but if you like a really emotional ride and don't mind crying while watching a movie, this is for you."
"chrstphrtully","10","0","2","12 February 2017"," Remarkable Tale of Love, Obsession, Guilt and Family
","It starts with a day in the life of five-year old Saroo (Sunny Pawar): playfully following his beloved older brother Guddu along an unused stretch of rail trackage; helping him as he hustles for work; sharing a meal with his mother and family, before she has to set off to work as a laborer. Guddu plans to go off to work a long way from home, and Saroo insists on coming along. They pull into a train station late at night -- the brother heads off into the train yard to look for work, and Saroo falls asleep on the platform; when Guddu doesn't return, Saroo finds shelter in the sleeper car of a decommissioned train. Then, the train starts its deadhead move to Kolkata, some 1,000 miles away, and a remarkable story is underway.<br/><br/>""Lion"" is one of those films that, if it were not based on a true story, might be dismissed as melodramatic fantasy. Instead, in his feature debut, director Garth Davis has created a remarkable, compelling, and deeply moving film of loss, guilt, and the ties of duty to and love of family that can lead to obsession. The first half of the film follows Saroo through the aforementioned scenes, and into the swirling mass of humanity that is Kolkata. These scenes are accomplished with a minimum of dialogue and yet are incredibly effective, thanks largely to a remarkable performance by Pawar. He immediately establishes a bond to the audience with his sweetness, intelligence, and total lack of affect, and we relate to his joys, his fears, and his remarkable defense mechanisms as he navigates dangers that he cannot possibly fully comprehend. Then, he is adopted by an Australian couple (Nicole Kidman and David Wenham), and the next phase of his life begins, growing up in a new culture and with an adoptive brother who, if anything, has borne even more horrific experiences than Saroo.<br/><br/>In some ways, much of ""Lion"" plays a modern-day parallel to Sanjayit Ray's masterful Apu trilogy, and Luke Davies' script anchors Saroo's quests -- both to survive and, a quarter-century later, to find his home -- in believable relationships and motivations, avoiding the temptation to ramp up the histrionics. The grounded story carries its own dramatic weight without artificial enhancement. The performances are uniformly excellent, with Pawar, Kidman and (as the grown-up Saroo) Dev Patel taking top honors. Patel's scenes with Kidman are absolutely riveting, and the final payoff is not only enormously gratifying, but dramatically well-earned.<br/><br/>The cinematography (Greig Fraser), editing (Alexandre de Franceschi), and score (Dustin O'Halloran and Hauschka) are also top-notch, and Davis does a remarkable job blending them to contrast the openness and freedom of Saroo's world in his hometown and on the beach in Tasmania, with the oppressive world of Kolkata and the increasingly confining mental state of his obsessive quest. Such work plainly belies the fact that this is Davis' inaugural directorial effort.<br/><br/>In sum, a deeply moving and effective film that readily warrants its multiple Oscar nominations (and probably should have been nominated for best director as well). ""Lion"" plainly stands -- along with ""Manchester-by-the-Sea"" and ""Moonlight"" as one of the three best films of 2016."
"orlakelley10","10","0","2","12 February 2017"," A film that blew away the whole family.
","Right from the start, this film had us captivated. For the first hour and a half this film shows Saroo'a journey after getting separated from his brother whilst on a job. It is an utterly heartbreaking experience which shows how cruel a child can be treat, but also how they can be saved. My whole family just couldn't stop crying, it's a beautiful picture which continues to stay as brilliant when it skips to 20 years later. The ending is magical and tragic at the same time. For someone who doesn't normally cry at films, this one made me sob throughout. Words just cannot explain how much you feel for Saroo, you just want to save him from the nightmare that he is experiencing and are so glad when he is finally adopted even though you know he has a loving family out there."

","Lion is the story of Saroo, a 5 year old Indian boy who one day finds himself on the wrong train and becomes lost. The film tells Saroo's story of being lost and the multitude of challenges he faces in his quest to find home. With a good cast, script and direction, Lion is an enjoyable biopic which does justice to it's intriguing story.<br/><br/>The cast is great. Dev Patel and Nicole Kidman act wonderfully as adopted mother and son in this film. However the real star of the film is little Sunny Pawar as young Saroo. The boy performs brilliantly as you really feel for him and believe that he really is a lost individual. Also due his adorable appearance, Pawar is someone the audience can easily come to love. Credit should also go to Gareth Davis' direction as it must have played a really big part in directing the 5 year old Pawar. So credit where credit is due.<br/><br/>Lion is a film that simply tells its story. This story of a young boy getting lost and spending many years trying to find his way home. An extraordinary true story with a film adaptation that is both written and directed in such a way that the story and can tell itself, with help from a great cast of course. In this way the film is enjoyable to anyone who is interested in an intriguing and hopeful true story about one boy's adventure that takes him across the globe, from India to Australia.<br/><br/>Overall, Lion is a well acted, written and directed film that tells it's fascinating story in a satisfactory way. With a standout child performance from Sunny Pawar the film is an enjoyable one for many, and is a film I would recommend. His name is Sheru, hear him Roar!"

","This is truly an amazing film, it did not only grip and hold on to my emotions but it has the whole time kept me in the narrative. I simply enjoyed It. I wiped tears occasionally from my eyes as i watched. The film is full of intense substance that is relevant to me. Struggle - poverty, family bonds, coming of age, perseverance, purpose,fulfillment and many more vital and relevant issues are raised by this film that questions who i am and what i want out of life. Young Saroo - Sunny Pawar's performance on this film is outstanding; a down to earth and so good to be true performance!<br/><br/>I also would like to get a bit technical about this wonderful piece, I loved one of the opening shots: The establishing shot where we see Saroo really small in a frame running. This shot for me really speaks a lot about the journey of Saroo from the onset. It speaks of the freedom he had, his whole world that is soon about to change forever but remain with him.<br/><br/>I must as well comment the director Garth Davis for simplicity and remarkable, amazing outcome. As an aspiring director this film has challenged me a lot, to work more with first time actors and not fear. What he has achieved in directing this little guy is terrific. I also love the yellow color grading of the film with its high contrast images. It really draws our attention to important details such as eyes."
"Marwan-Bob","9","0","1","9 February 2017"," The only 2016's film that got me close to shedding some damn tears.
","It's a story that normally would find its place as a Hallmark Movie of the Week or a crass commercial television production but in the capable hands of director Garth Davis and a great cast, Lion manages to bypass the easy sentimentality of many of its kind to provide a cinematic experience that is intensely moving and emotionally true. The first half is an incredible example of pure cinema when, in scenes almost devoid of dialogue, the young Saroo (played by the wonderful Sunny Pawar) is separated from his family. The second half doesn't quite reach the same cinematic heights as the first but the acting of Nicole Kidman, Rooney Mara, David Wenham and a top-form Dev Patel anchor the narrative in a way that never renders a false note. All in all, a beautifully executed tug at the heartstrings."

The story is an epic tale of how one tiny decision can change the course of your entire life. The acting is impeccable. It reminds me a lot of Slumdog Millionaire, however, the story could not be more different. Lion is the true story of a boy who begs his brother to go to work a night shift with him and he falls asleep at the train station. When he wakes, he finds that the station is deserted. He goes onto the train in the station and falls asleep. When he wakes up the train is moving and does not stop for 1600 Kms. By the time he gets to the destination, he does not know where he is, where he is from or what his mothers name is. He is eventually taken to a center for street kids and is one of the very lucky ones who is adopted by a well-to-do Australian family. When he grows up he decides to look for his real Mom and tracks down the place with Google earth.<br/><br/>This movies should win Best Picture at the Academy awards.

","Essentially film-making is about story-telling and sometimes - as in this case - the story is so remarkable that only the fact that it is true makes it credible. In the north of India, five year old Saroo finds himself separated at night from his older brother, finds a place to sleep on an empty train, and finishes up 1,600 km (1,000 miles) away in Kolkata (Calcutta). His inability to speak the local language - he is from a Hindi-speaking part of the country while Kolkata uses Bengali - plus his young age and poor recollection of place names all render him utterly unable to find a way back to his family. Only a couple of decades later, by which time he has had an adopted childhood in Tasmania can Saroo - with the add of Google Maps - find a way of reconnecting with his past after an interval of 25 years.<br/><br/>Little Sunny Pawar is wonderful as the young Saroo, while Dev Patel enhances his growing reputation with a solid performance as Saroo as a young man. Nicole Kidman, as always, is excellent as Saroo's adoptive mother. First-time feature director Garth Davis delivers a fine piece of work, enhanced by location shooting in India and Australia. Only in the final seconds of the tale do we learn the reason for the title of the film. My only reservation about this worthy work is that, for all its emotional punch, it lacks a certain edge since we know how the story is going to unfold and there are no surprises along the way.<br/><br/>I saw the movie in my local multiplex in Harrow in north-west London and there was a certain piquancy to this, since Dev Patel was brought up in Harrow and around two-thirds of the audience were local Asians. We all took home the end of film message that in India over 80,000 children go missing each year and there are over 11 million children living on the streets."

","I will say while personally I don't find the move Oscar worthy in terms of best picture because lion feels like many similar movies of trying to find family again. I also feel that the pacing of the movie is rather slow and drags in the first half. However one of the benefits that the film has is great performances from dev Patel who plays Sharoo whose name in Hindu means lion and Nicole Kidman who plays his adopted mother sue. I will say what I found engaging abou t the film was how Sharoo was determined to find his biological mother after many years of being separated so she would know her son was doing well which was very touching."

","From the grinding poverty of Calcutta to the serenity of Tasmania, Australia, Lion takes the audience on a tour of the world culture as well as I have ever seen. Dev Patel(Slumdog Millionaire) is the star here, as a thirty year old man haunted by his past as a five year old street orphan searching for his mother. It begins with the little boy riding a train to Calcutta and winding up at a prison like shelter surrounded by other orphans. Saroo (Patel), as the child, has the good luck of being adopted by a loving Australian couple. Nicole Kidman is excellent as his mother and Rooney Mara is also good as his American girlfriend. The story is heart wrenching with a cast that includes a few very young kids who are nothing short of amazing. Lion may well be the best film of 2016."
"jtindahouse","9","0","1","1 February 2017"," A powerful and emotional experience
","Foreign films can sometimes be a trying experience. They can be hard to relate to and appreciate, often through no fault of their own. So when you come across a foreign film that features none of these problems, you know it is something special and must be excellently made. 'Lion' is certainly one of those films. It has deservedly been nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards, and while I don't expect it to compete for the actual win, its still good to see a film like this get the recognition it has earned.<br/><br/>Dev Patel and Nicole Kidman have also both been nominated for Academy Awards in supporting roles. Both were very strong in their roles, without perhaps ever blowing me away. It sounds like Patel fully immersed himself in the role, and the only thing holding him back was probably a couple of very strong scenes that he could show his true acting talents off in. He was strong in every scene he was in, but nothing that was overly memorable. Kidman probably falls into the same category. Consistently strong, but never gets a chance to completely show off the vast talents we all know she has.<br/><br/>The film is very different from what I was expecting going in, however I would have to say that that turned out to be a good thing. The way it went about telling the story actually worked very well. There is a lot of emotion behind the story and the characters, and the fact that this is based on a true story is nothing short of heart-breaking. There's also some terrific pacing throughout and it all results in a fantastic final product. A film not to be missed."
"abobaggings","9","0","1","1 February 2017"," Tastefully unromanticised and beautiful memoir
","Unalike memoirs such as Mask, Lion never seeks to romanticise its characters beyond their real life counterparts in order for us to see them as worth while. Sheru is not remarkable for his intelligence (or if he is, we never see it). Instead he is remarkable in that after everything he goes through, he smiles.<br/><br/>The emotions he is going going through and the strength required not to rise above them but simply survive them are shown in a style mid way between Tarkovskys ""The Mirror"" and Lynchs ""The Elephant Man"". The lynchian ambivalent details such as a room of children singing in the night remind me of my own memoirs of childhood by their particular and incredibly human emotion. Not grandiose, but human and all the better for it.<br/><br/>It is very restrained in some details though, at one point a young Sheru is chased through a tunnel; we don't know who by or why, because neither did he. It reminds me of when a WWII survivor told me of Kristallnacht, ignorance grounds these moments in reality, it is this reality that makes each moment endlessly enthralling.<br/><br/>One moment that sticks out is the simple shot of an approaching bridge from a train and many many voices calling out. The actors speaking the native language, the genuine child actor and the aforementioned reality makes this simple shot one of the most ominous I've seen for a very long time. All in one movie we see absolute horrors of the worlds in which some live and the genuine love and beauty in life, all in the unforgettable, bittersweet and yet unromanticised reality of a memoir.<br/><br/>We see fear in the eyes of people, in handfuls of city dust. We see love in the eyes of others and in handfuls of beach sand. All on a journey, a long way away from home."

","LION is the story of a boy, Saroo, who goes missing for 25 years from his Indian home.<br/><br/>This film plays on the emotions of loneliness, sadness, regret, and acceptance to convey the journey that Saroo is experiencing. It may teeter on the edge of over-doing it with it's grand and sweeping score and crying followed by hugs, yet it ends up being quite justified, considering this is an extraordinary true story.<br/><br/>The acting in the film is very well executed. Nicole Kidman shines as the loving and confused mother of Saroo and his brother, Mantosh. Kidman smiles through the pain of the absence of Mantosh, and sometimes Saroo, as well. Sunny Pawar holds his own very strongly for the first hour of LION. He's fun-loving and charismatic, and also distraught, closed off, and alone. Pawar is virtually the only character for a good part of this film, up until Kidman comes into play, and he is phenomenal. Dev Patel is able to to portray the still-lingering feelings of loss and abandonment while trying to stay true to his adoptive family. Patel wrestles these emotions and emotes frustration off of the scree. Finally, Rooney Mara's character. I am a firm and unmoving Rooney Mara supporter; I believe she is a fantastic and understated actress who knows how to pick a film to star in (exlcuding PAN). There's no doubt that she is great in LION and that she does all the she can with what she has here; the problem is that there's not a lot there. Mara's character barely progresses the story along and is only there to add frustration and support to Dev Patel's character. I understand she was an important figure in Saroo's life so the film can't just completely exclude her, yet it almost brushes her aside, just like the adoptive father character. It's a shame to see Rooney's full talent go unused.<br/><br/>Overall, this is crowd-pleasing, emotional, and investing film that uses all of it's emotion button-pushing with just the right amount. Paired with beautiful cinematography, a riveting score, powerful performances, and an ending that will stay with you; LION proves to be one of the better films of 2016."

","Of course it's predictable, there wouldn't have been a movie based on the book if it wasn't. Hollywood (Australian style) isn't in the business of not making money. I loved Nicole Kidman's role & especially her ""big"" scene where she discloses her reason for adopting the children. She was brilliant while delivering those lines. Rooney Mara was super in her role also, as the girlfriend who encourages Saroo to find his family, but I would like to know if she really stuck around in the end like she said she would. I'm not a big fan of subtitles and that's one of the reasons I didn't give it a 10. Another reason was there was some disjointedness with the dream/reality sequences that had me wondering several times what was going on, then the film would come back around and move on. Still, the little kid was marvelous and sucked me in completely. His angst was real. Knowing what happened to his brother Gudru (?) at the end was sad but, helped bring the film full circle. Dev Patel is a wonder and I hope he continues to get more roles in big films as he well deserves them. He has grown into a fine young man/actor. Be sure to bring tissues."

","There has been a vast amount of roar about the touching drama ""Lion"", and now I know why it roared with critics. ""Lion"" features the true story of Saroo Brierly, a five-year old Indian boy who gets lost in the streets of an Indian city very far from home. Via events that followed, Saroo gets adopted by an Australian couple John and Sue Brierly. Twenty years later, Saroo decides to come down to Google Earth to help locate his original mother and brother in India. Director Garth Davis provides an authentic emotional landscape that viably transports you into Saroo's incredible story. Luke Davies' screenplay also feeds the ""Lion"" with a genuine verbal touch. Dev Patel was no thespian slumdog with his credible performance as the adult Saroo; Sunny Pawar also provided a little sunshine with his loving performance as the child Saroo. Nicole Kidman's work as Sue Brierly was solid, but not of Oscar caliber; but who am I to believe, I'm just a corny pun kidman. Rooney Mara did not add anything relevant to the picture as Saroo's girlfriend Lucy; so yea, I did not Love the Lucy character here.

","I'd be lion if I said I sometimes didn't obsess for years to find something or someone from my past. Though, mine seems a ton more trivial now.<br/><br/>Talk about cultural differences. It might happen in America, but I doubt the outcome would be the same. <br/><br/>This sometimes heartbreaking story tells the true tale of a five-year- old boy getting separated by his older brother in India. He is virtually trapped on a train car for days and the people who do see him and his cries for help lands on deaf ears. Once finally released from the cab, he's lost, taken and eventually sold (I guess) to an Australian couple. So off he's whisked to Australia, grows up and finally hit with the overwhelming need to find his first homeand mum. <br/><br/>His two year obsession nearly destroys his adult life, relationships and adopted mother. This is a story of a lost boy grown up and attempting to retrace his steps from shaky memories now 25 years later and from when he was only five.<br/><br/>Heck, I remember some of when I was five years old, and though I didn't have such a tragedy occur, I am uncertain if I could recall enough details to put the pieces back together. I don't even know if I even knew my parent's real names back then. Worse, for this person, he has only his memory to rely on verses any records, people or places to recall.<br/><br/>Again, I doubt this would happen (as badly) in the United States, but according to this film, this happens, ah-hem, 80,000 times a year. Egad! They have issues.<br/><br/>I did truly like this film and had a string of emotions throughout. Started with anger on how poorly strangers and agencies dealt with an obviously lost young child. And, mercifully, he did end up with a loving family, it still was terrible he was all-but snatched away and sold as property. But the emotional journey of him attempting to reconnect with his biological family was when the movie peaked and provided a pleasant hope. Definitely worth seeing.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Final thoughts: Unfortunately, I have little, in-person contact with foreigners and I would like to. Coincidentally to me seeing this, I get to spend some time with a friend coming from Peru for the very first time to the States. I get to take him to Vegas, Disneyland, Hollywood and a few other places within driving distance of Phoenix, AZ. Can't wait for him to visit and for me to learn more from someone outside the country in about a week. <br/><br/>Let's just hope he doesn't board a train without me and I have to spend the next 25 years looking for him!"

Sure, there are moments when the viewer's emotions are manipulated - as in every film - but who wouldn't be moved by these events?

A heart-warming,sad, joyful and thought-provoking film, with a capable cast, especially the boy who plays the young Saroo. The settings, 1980s through to 2000s India and Tasmania, are evocative in their contrasting beauty. No gratuitous violence, explosions, or in- your-face profanity - if that's your idea of good cinema, ""Lion"" will move very slowly for you. But if you like a movie that invites you to think - issues as diverse as trans- national adoption, child labour, cultural identity and finding one's roots - then you'll find ""Lion"" richly rewarding.

"Troy_Campbell","8","0","1","25 January 2017"," A riveting drama that steers clear of biopic clichés.
","This Australia-India co-production has been a heavyweight in the awards season, having picked up multiple Golden Globe and Oscar nominations, and it's not hard to see why. Based on an incredible true story, Lion opens with the harrowing journey of 5-year-old Indian boy Saroo Brierley, who is separated from his family after being trapped on a cargo train that terminates in Calcutta, some 1600km away from his hometown in Khandwa. Anchored by an outstanding turn from newcomer Sunny Pawar, the first half is a devastating look at how easily children can become lost in the over-populated India, and how the terror is amplified when so few people—even those charged to protect citizens—seem to care. It's a relief to Saroo then, albeit tentatively and sceptically at first, that he's saved from his prison-esque orphanage by a sweet Tasmanian couple who, through genuine love and care, wish to provide him a fruitful childhood he otherwise would have missed. When we meet adult Saroo (Dev Patel) two decades later he is about to head off to university in Melbourne, blessed with a wonderful upbringing, a loving family and bright future ahead. Yet there's something nagging him, an underlying issue of identity and loss that is bubbling away underneath the surface. Saroo's search for home could have bogged down the second half in cliché and melodrama, but Patel's performance is so full of complexity and charisma that it grounds the unbelievable sequence of events in heartfelt realism. Despite sharing a cute chemistry together, Saroo's complicated romance with American exchange student Lucy (Rooney Mara) feels like an unnecessary subplot, but his unique relationship with adoptive mother Sue (a terrific Nicole Kidman) is captivating. Refining his trade on the haunting mini-series Top of the Lake, Aussie director Garth Davis' leap into feature films is a successful one; Lion is a riveting drama worthy of all the awards attention it has received."
"davidgee","8","0","2","25 January 2017"," Schmaltz overkill
","As so often these days, the trailer for LION gives too much of the story away, including the ending, which robs it of any chance to surprise us. What did surprise me was how involving the story was. Sunny Pawar who plays the 5-year-old Paroo, marooned in Calcutta 1500 miles from his home village, is the most appealing and compelling child star since Joel Haley Osment. Both in India and in the early scenes in Australia after he is adopted by Nicole Kidman and her husband, he is gut-wrenchingly convincing as a lost little boy. Not just likable, this kid is utterly lovable.<br/><br/>Dev Patel is someone we already like thanks to the MARIGOLD HOTEL movies, and here as the 30-year-old Saroo he comes pretty close to being lovable as well. Ms Kidman delivers one of her best-ever performances as the Aussie mum with a heart of gold. The script slightly loses its edge and some pace as Saroo wrestles with his memories and with Google Earth before embarking on the trip to be reunited with his lost family. His brother in Tasmania, another adopted Indian but with behavioural issues, gets forgotten in the final scenes – a careless oversight in a movie about abandoned siblings. <br/><br/>The postscript, offering us glimpses of the real Paroo and his two mothers, comes close to schmaltz overkill but this is a picture that sets out to warm the cockles of our cold cynical hearts – and warm them it does (if your cockles aren't warmed you might want to think about a transplant)."

","I am slightly annoyed here. Don't get me wrong, I loved this movie to the core. I am very happy that Garth Davis, Creig Fraser and Luke Davies recognized the importance of this story being told. It got me running back home to start donating to Magic Bus & Childline India, which by the way, the LIONMOVIE.COM promotion site does NOT facilitate the actual links to the aforementioned organizations (why? are you really helping then?!). <br/><br/>I cried throughout the movie, from the moment little Saroo and his beloved brother Guddhu were introduced. You could feel the chemistry between these two actors, solidifying the wonderful bond of the brothers. <br/><br/>What made this movie great, is the first half of the movie. It's the moment Sunny Pawar stepped into the train and you know his life will never be the same. It's when he hopefully starts to look for Guddhu, to find out that his brother is nowhere to be found. What follows is a horrifying journey, where we can see through the eyes of this (luckily) street smart kid, who managed to outsmart the dangers and horrors of his life as orphaned child. The emotional punch is delivered here and echoed throughout the movie. <br/><br/>I respect Dev Patel, but his delivery was flat, bored and blasé. Did he really wanted to be in the movie? I miss the emotional burden the real Saroo Brierley carried in the six years he was trying to find back his family home. All Dev delivered was a flat, one- dimensional, tired spoiled brat with messy hair and a beard. Is that how you convey an emotional burden that has haunted you your whole life? <br/><br/>I do think Nicole Kidman and David Wenham (the Tasmanian parents) delivered a wonderful performance - so gentle, so loving. After this horrendous turmoil in Calcutta all I needed (excuse, Saroo) was a warm blanket to spoil me and to never let me go. <br/><br/>Rooney Mara. Why? Beautiful actress, the supporting girlfriend, all good, but was it necessary to have her in the movie? <br/><br/>So, in my opinion, things got mixed up here. While I cheer that Dev Patel endorses this movie, I really feel that Sunny Pawar and Abhishek Bharate are the true heroes of the story. It's their bond captures you, leading you to follow Dev's grown up finding-back- home-journey. <br/><br/>It's only fair that they are credited equally on the movie posters.

(Tasmania is the picturesque mountainous south eastern island state of Australia, which commonly gets left off maps of our country).<br/><br/>Dev Patel as the older Saroo shines again and Sunny Pawar as the five year old Saroo is just wonderful. <br/><br/>Yet another piece of evidence that fact can be stranger than fiction, I found this film intensely engaging once the initial set up was completed. The initial third of the film did seem slow, but the later structure of the story justifies this. <br/><br/>The landscape and city photography and locations chosen in India, Hobart, country Tasmania and Melbourne are wonderfully evocative of these places – well they are of the Australian ones, and the Indian ones seem just as good. <br/><br/>Nicole Kidman as the adoptive mother is a standout, and David Wenham makes the most of minor opportunities. Rooney Mara feels at home as the older Saroo's girlfriend. Australian audiences might recognise Todd Sampson in a brief but convincing role as a vocational training school principal.<br/><br/>The strength of the movie is in the characters, and the parts of their lives the story tells. The concluding photos of the people on whose story the film was based provides evidence of the veracity of the factual base of the story, and the effort the producers have made to present an accurate portrayal.<br/><br/>If you like films that are based on characters, their lives, how they unfold and locations, this may well be a standout."

","Lion is a movie that flew under my radar for most of 2016. It was not until it started getting some awards season buzz that I really ever started seeing it brought up around the internet and I was honestly a little skeptical. Being that I did not know much about it anyway, I decided to keep myself in the dark a bit other than looking at the short IMDb summary and looking up the director, who happens to be making his feature film debut, I did not know much going in. I was happy to find that Lion is definitely a movie that belongs on year end lists and may just pull off some upsets when the awards are handed out.<br/><br/>Lion tells the story of Saroo Brierley who when the movie starts is a young boy in an incredibly impoverished small town in India. His mother works moving rocks, so they are basically the poorest people in the world. One night Saroo wakes up as his older brother Guddu is leaving to go to work. Saroo begs to be brought with Guddu, but ends up getting lost at a train station, and then accidentally falls asleep on a train that takes him far away from his hometown. The movie takes you through the frightening trip Saroo takes and into his adult years after being adopted by Australian parents. Saroo then tries desperately to track down his family and find his way back to his home.<br/><br/>Director Garth Davis is a rookie to feature films, but he does not show any signs of being a rookie in Lion. Lion is a beautifully filmed movie, and Davis gets some incredible performances from not only child actors, but complete unknowns who do not even speak English. I cannot put into words how proud of these child actors I am. They captured something about childhood that is so far beyond normal acting ability, and this is also a real testament to Davis as well. The movie moves really well and comes up just short of 2 hours which is always appreciated. Lion is not an easy first movie to tackle, but Garth Davis has put up one of the most impressive efforts of the year.<br/><br/>The rest of the performances are really good as well. Dev Patel has already proved himself to be a great actor and he brings his A game in Lion. Adopting a convincing Australian accent and the fact that he is really only in about half of the movie would make a lot of lesser actors turn the role down. He owned this role and while he probably will get passed up for awards this is a great addition to the filmography. Most of the rest of the characters are in decidedly supporting roles, but Nicole Kidman and Rooney Mara both come pretty strong while not trying to take the movie over.<br/><br/>Lion is also one of the better written movies of the year, while there are some times in the middle to latter points of the movie that lag, it is still a compelling journey and stands as the only movie of 2016 that got be to cry pretty openly, and more than once. Most of the movie is a bummer to be honest, but the good moments make up for that and those depressing moments make the happy ones that much better. I highly recommend Lion to any true movie fan. It is a fantastically made movie with heart and drama in it, but also some really great moments of boyhood that are genuine in any language. I don't see Lion stealing many awards away from Manchester by the Sea or Moonlight, but it certainly deserves to be in the race, and if it did snag some awards I would not make much of an argument."

The film is gripping from start to end with a handful of intense emotional moments that will dampen even the driest of eyes. The first act of the movie follows Saroo as a young boy and is almost 100% without a hint of English and it absolutely works. The viewer is fully immersed into Saroo's world and you feel deeply his turmoil and strife. The film also has an incredible aesthetic appeal that starts with the opening shots and does not let up. The cinematography is gorgeous and the reoccurring piano theme fits the tone and feel of the movie perfectly. <br/><br/>The acting was spot-on. Dev Patel was extremely convincing as was Rooney Mara with Nicole Kidman being the real standout. The Indian actors were lovely as well and held up fantastically against the more mainstream actors. But the movies main focus was Saroo and his physical and spiritual journey. His arc in the film was incredibly moving, especially in the 2nd and 3rd acts. <br/><br/>I only have some minor issues with the film. I felt that Sunny Pawar, the actor who plays Saroo as a child, lacked a little bit and could have been more convincing, and I wish the film developed Saroo and his family's relationship with Mantosh a little more. It felt a little forced and the payoff would have been much greater with just a little more development. But, the most frustrating thing for me were the title cards throughout the film. They were overused and cliché and took me out of the movie. There are ways to explain the passage of time and location without spelling it out for the audience. <br/><br/>Other than those minor grievances, I thought the film was absolutely lovely and wholeheartedly recommend seeing LION in theaters. This has Oscar's written all over it. <br/><br/>Fav. Scene: The dinner scene towards the end of the film<br/><br/>My Rating: 9/10"

","This film has been on my to-do list since I first noticed it a couple of months ago. FirstlyI must praise Sunny Pawar as the five-year-old in the film. His facial expressions and the sheer reality of his circumstances could not have been brought to the screen any better.His instinct in realizing when things were not quite right when dealing with the adults around him was astonishingly portrayed. Dev Patel was also excellent in his role as the adult Saroo and a special mention to his uncanny ability to pull off the often difficult Australian accent was flawless. The support actors notably Kidman, Wenham and Mara were all excellent but perhaps all surpassed by the performances of the Indian actors in the film with special mention to Priyanka Bose who was extraordinary. Interesting to hear that the two actors who played the brothers in the film, Sunny Pawar and Abhishek Bharate have already made another film together where they also play brothers titled Love Sonia. The film is all about human emotions, the complexities that adoption can bring to a young person's life, and the need to discover your roots, whilst having obviously developed a close and enduring relationship with those who were able to bring some safety and stability to life and the recognition of the birth mother and how to deal with all these emotions while remaining true to yourself. A remarkable film."

","This film makes you think of the blessings that are taken-for-granted for most of us; family, welfare, food, and shelter. It sheds a light on the street children issue. The boy who played young Saroo was brilliant, as he was capable of portraying a critical crisis. He is amazing, I loved how his face expression changed to match the events. So, he was capable of expressing love when he is with his mom, expressing pride when working with his brother, and expressing fear when he is lost amazing! The fear, danger, and desperateness that Saroo has been through are an illustration of what 100 thousands of street children are facing every day. In fact, this story represents one of the best case scenarios of how a street child might end up."
